{"Headline": "Taking On Adam Smith (and Karl Marx)", "Date": "2014-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Thomas Piketty turned 18 in 1989, when the Berlin Wall fell, so he was spared the tortured, decades-long French intellectual debate about the virtues and vices of communism. Even more telling, he remembers, was a trip he took with a close friend to Romania in early 1990, after the collapse of the Soviet empire. \u201cThis sort of vaccinated me for life against lazy, anticapitalist rhetoric, because when you see these empty shops, you see these people queuing for nothing in the street,\u201d he said, \u201cit became clear to me that we need private property and market institutions, not just for economic efficiency but for personal freedom.\u201dBut his disenchantment with communism doesn\u2019t mean that Mr. Piketty has turned his back on the intellectual heritage of Karl Marx, who sought to explain the \u201ciron laws\u201d of capitalism. Like Marx, he is fiercely critical of the economic and social inequalities that untrammeled capitalism produces \u2014 and, he concludes, will continue to worsen. \u201cI belong to a generation that never had any temptation with the Communist Party; I was too young for that,\u201d Mr. Piketty said, in a long interview in his small, airless office here at the Paris School of Economics. \u201cSo it\u2019s easier in a way to reopen these big issues about capitalism and inequality with a fresh eye, because I was too young for that fight. I don\u2019t have to justify myself as being pro-communist or pro-capitalist.\u201dIn his new book \u201cCapital in the Twenty-First Century\u201d (Harvard University Press), Mr. Piketty, 42, has written a blockbuster, at least in the world of economics. His book punctures earlier assumptions about the benevolence of advanced capitalism and forecasts sharply increasing inequality of wealth in industrialized countries, with deep and deleterious impact on democratic values of justice and fairness.Branko Milanovic, a former economist at the World Bank, called it \u201cone of the watershed books in economic thinking.\u201d Paul Krugman, winner of the Nobel in economic science and a columnist for The New York Times, wrote that it \u201cwill be the most important economics book of the year \u2014 and maybe of the decade.\u201d Remarkably for a book on such a weighty topic, it has already entered The New York Times\u2019s best-seller list.\u201cCapital in the Twenty-First Century,\u201d with its title echoing Marx\u2019s \u201cDas Kapital,\u201d is meant to be a return to the kind of economic history, of political economy, written by predecessors like Marx and Adam Smith. It is nothing less than a broad effort to understand Western societies and the economic rules that underpin them. And in the process, by debunking the idea that \u201cwealth raises all boats,\u201d Mr. Piketty has thrown down a challenge to democratic governments to deal with an increasing gap between the rich and the poor \u2014 the very theme of inequality that recently moved both Pope Francis and President Obama to warn of its consequences.Mr. Piketty \u2014 pronounced pee-ket-ee \u2014 grew up in a political home, with left-wing parents who were part of the 1968 demonstrations that turned traditional France upside down. Later, they went off to the Aude, deep in southern France, to raise goats. His parents are not a topic he wants to discuss. More relevant and important, he said, are his generation\u2019s \u201cfounding experiences\u201d: the collapse of Communism, the economic degradation of Eastern Europe and the first Gulf War, in 1991.Those events motivated him to try to understand a world where economic ideas had such bad consequences. As for the Gulf War, it showed him that \u201cgovernments can do a lot in terms of redistribution of wealth when they want.\u201d The rapid intervention to force Saddam Hussein to unhand Kuwait and its oil was a remarkable show of concerted political will, Mr. Piketty said. \u201cIf we are able to send one million troops to Kuwait in a few months to return the oil, presumably we can do something about tax havens.\u201dWould he want to send troops to Guernsey, the lightly populated tax haven in the English Channel? Mr. Piketty, soft-spoken, barely laughed. \u201cWe don\u2019t even have to do that \u2014 just simple basic trade policy, trade sanctions, would do the trick right away,\u201d he said.A top student, Mr. Piketty took a conventional path toward the French elite, being admitted to the rarefied \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure at 18. His doctoral dissertation on the theory of redistribution of wealth, completed at 22, won prizes. He then decamped to teach economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before returning two years later to France, disappointed with the study of economics in America.\u201cMy Ph.D. is mostly about pure economic theory because that was the easiest thing to do, and I was hired at M.I.T. as a young assistant professor doing economic theory,\u201d he said. \u201cI was young and successful at doing this, so it was an easy way. But very quickly I realized that there was little serious effort at collecting historical data on income and wealth, so that\u2019s what I started doing.\u201dAcademic economics is so focused on getting the econometrics and the statistical interpolation technique correct, he said, \u201cyou don\u2019t really think, you don\u2019t dare to ask the big questions.\u201d American economists too often narrow the questions they examine to those they can answer, \u201cbut sometimes the questions are not that interesting,\u201d he said. \u201cTrying to write a real book that could speak to everyone meant I could not choose my questions. I had to take the important issues in a frontal manner \u2014 I could not escape.\u201dHe hated the insularity of the economics department. So he decided to write large, a book he considers as much history as economics, and one that is constructed to lead the general reader by the hand.He is also not afraid of literature, finding inspiration in the descriptions of society in the realist novels of Jane Austen and Balzac. Wealth was best achieved in these stories through a clever marriage; everyone knew that inherited land and capital was the only way to live well, since labor alone would not produce sufficient income. He wondered how that assumption had changed.As he extended his work on France to the United States in collaboration with Emmanuel Saez, a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley, he saw that the patterns of the early 20th century \u2014 \u201cthe top 10 percent of the distribution was full of rental income, dividend income, interest income\u201d \u2014 seemed less prevalent from the 1970s through the early 1990s.\u201cIt took me a long time to realize that in effect we were returning slowly in the direction of the previous equilibrium, and that we were part of a long transitory process,\u201d he said. When he started working on the issue in the late 1990s, \u201cthere was no way this could be understood so clearly \u2014 having 20 additional years of data makes a big difference to understanding the postwar period.\u201dHis findings, aided by the power of modern computers, are based on centuries of statistics on wealth accumulation and economic growth in advanced industrial countries. They are also rather simply stated: The rate of growth of income from capital is several times larger than the rate of economic growth, meaning a comparatively shrinking share going to income earned from wages, which rarely increase faster than overall economic activity. Inequality surges when population and the economy grow slowly.The reason that postwar economies looked different \u2014 that inequality fell \u2014 was historical catastrophe. World War I, the Depression and World War II destroyed huge accumulations of private capital, especially in Europe. What the French call \u201cles trentes glorieuses\u201d \u2014 the roughly 30 postwar years of rapid economic growth and shrinking inequality \u2014 were a rebound. The American curve, of course, is less sharp, given that the fighting was elsewhere.A higher than normal rate of population and economic growth helped reduce inequality, along with higher taxes on the wealthy. But the professional and political assumption of the 1950s and 1960s, that inequality would stabilize and diminish on its own, proved to be an illusion. We are now back to a traditional pattern of returns on capital of 4 percent to 5 percent a year and rates of economic growth of around 1.5 percent a year.So inequality has been quickly gathering pace, aided to some degree by the Reagan and Thatcher doctrines of tax cuts for the wealthy. \u201cTrickle-down economics could have been true,\u201d Mr. Piketty said simply. \u201cIt just happened to be wrong.\u201dHis work is a challenge both to Marxism and laissez-faire economics, which \u201cboth count on pure economic forces for harmony or justice to prevail,\u201d he said. While Marx presumed that the rate of return on capital, because of the system\u2019s contradictions, would fall close to zero, bringing collapse and revolution, Mr. Piketty is saying the opposite. \u201cThe rate of return to capital can be bigger than the growth rate forever \u2014 this is actually what we\u2019ve had for most of human history, and there are good reasons to believe we will have it in the future.\u201dIn 2012 the top 1 percent of American households collected 22.5 percent of the nation\u2019s income, the highest total since 1928. The richest 10 percent of Americans now take a larger slice of the pie than in 1913, at the close of the Gilded Age, owning more than 70 percent of the nation\u2019s wealth. And half of that is owned by the top 1 percent.Mr. Piketty, father of three daughters \u2014 11, 13 and 16 \u2014 is no revolutionary. He is a member of no political party, and says he never served as an economic adviser to any politician. He calls himself a pragmatist, who simply follows the data.But he accepts that his work is essentially political, and he is highly critical of the huge management salaries now in vogue, saying that \u201cthe idea that you need people making 10 million in compensation to work is pure ideology.\u201dInequality by itself is acceptable, he says, to the extent it spurs individual initiative and wealth-generation that, with the aid of progressive taxation and other measures, helps makes everyone in society better off. \u201cI have no problem with inequality as long as it is in the common interest,\u201d he said.But like the Columbia University economist Joseph E. Stiglitz, he argues that extreme inequality \u201cthreatens our democratic institutions.\u201d Democracy is not just one citizen, one vote, but a promise of equal opportunity. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to make a democratic system work when you have such extreme inequality\u201d in income, he said, \u201cand such extreme inequality in terms of political influence and the production of knowledge and information. One of the big lessons of the 20th century is that we don\u2019t need 19th-century inequality to grow.\u201d But that\u2019s just where the capitalist world is heading again, he concludes.Mr. Saez, his collaborator, said that \u201cThomas combines great perfectionism with great impatience \u2014 he both wants to do things well and do things fast.\u201d He added that Mr. Piketty has \u201cincredible intuition for economics.\"The last part of the book presents Mr. Piketty\u2019s policy ideas. He favors a progressive global tax on real wealth (minus debt), with the proceeds not handed to inefficient governments but redistributed to those with less capital. \u201cWe just want a way to share the tax burden that is fair and practical,\u201d he said. Net wealth is a better indicator of ability to pay than income alone, he said. \u201cAll I\u2019m proposing is to reduce the property tax on half or three-quarters of the population who have very little wealth,\u201d he said. Published a year ago in French, the book is not without critics, especially of Mr. Piketty\u2019s policy prescriptions, which have been called politically na\u00efve. Others point out that some of the increase in capital is because of aging populations and postwar pension plans, which are not necessarily inherited.More criticism is sure to come, and Mr. Piketty says he welcomes it. \u201cI\u2019m certainly looking forward to the debate.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Only One Top Banker Went to Jail for the Financial Crisis", "Date": "2014-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Money IssueOn the evening of Jan. 27, Kareem Serageldin walked out of his Times Square apartment with his brother and an old Yale roommate and took off on the four-hour drive to Philipsburg, a small town smack in the middle of Pennsylvania. Despite once earning nearly $7 million a year as an executive at Credit Suisse, Serageldin, who is 41, had always lived fairly modestly. A previous apartment, overlooking Victoria Station in London, struck his friends as a grown-up dorm room; Serageldin lived with bachelor-pad furniture and little of it \u2014 his central piece was a night stand overflowing with economics books, prospectuses and earnings reports. In the years since, his apartments served as places where he would log five or six hours of sleep before going back to work, creating and trading complex financial instruments. One friend called him an \u201cinvestment-banking monk.\u201dSerageldin\u2019s life was about to become more ascetic. Two months earlier, he sat in a Lower Manhattan courtroom adjusting and readjusting his tie as he waited for a judge to deliver his prison sentence. During the worst of the financial crisis, according to prosecutors, Serageldin had approved the concealment of hundreds of millions in losses in Credit Suisse\u2019s mortgage-backed securities portfolio. But on that November morning, the judge seemed almost torn. Serageldin lied about the value of his bank\u2019s securities \u2014 that was a crime, of course \u2014 but other bankers behaved far worse. Serageldin\u2019s former employer, for one, had revised its past financial statements to account for $2.7 billion that should have been reported. Lehman Brothers, AIG, Citigroup, Countrywide and many others had also admitted that they were in much worse shape than they initially allowed. Merrill Lynch, in particular, announced a loss of nearly $8 billion three weeks after claiming it was $4.5 billion. Serageldin\u2019s conduct was, in the judge\u2019s words, \u201ca small piece of an overall evil climate within the bank and with many other banks.\u201d Nevertheless, after a brief pause, he eased down his gavel and sentenced Serageldin, an Egyptian-born trader who grew up in the barren pinelands of Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula, to 30 months in jail. Serageldin would begin serving his time at Moshannon Valley Correctional Center, in Philipsburg, where he would earn the distinction of being the only Wall Street executive sent to jail for his part in the financial crisis.American financial history has generally unfolded as a series of booms followed by busts followed by crackdowns. After the crash of 1929, the Pecora Hearings seized upon public outrage, and the head of the New York Stock Exchange landed in prison. After the savings-and-loan scandals of the 1980s, 1,100 people were prosecuted, including top executives at many of the largest failed banks. In the \u201990s and early aughts, when the bursting of the Nasdaq bubble revealed widespread corporate accounting scandals, top executives from WorldCom, Enron, Qwest and Tyco, among others, went to prison.The credit crisis of 2008 dwarfed those busts, and it was only to be expected that a similar round of crackdowns would ensue. In 2009, the Obama administration appointed Lanny Breuer to lead the Justice Department\u2019s criminal division. Breuer quickly focused on professionalizing the operation, introducing the rigor of a prestigious firm like Covington & Burling, where he had spent much of his career. He recruited elite lawyers from corporate firms and the Breu Crew, as they would later be known, were repeatedly urged by Breuer to \u201ctake it to the next level.\u201dBut the crackdown never happened. Over the past year, I\u2019ve interviewed Wall Street traders, bank executives, defense lawyers and dozens of current and former prosecutors to understand why the largest man-made economic catastrophe since the Depression resulted in the jailing of a single investment banker \u2014 one who happened to be several rungs from the corporate suite at a second-tier financial institution. Many assume that the federal authorities simply lacked the guts to go after powerful Wall Street bankers, but that obscures a far more complicated dynamic. During the past decade, the Justice Department suffered a series of corporate prosecutorial fiascos, which led to critical changes in how it approached white-collar crime. The department began to focus on reaching settlements rather than seeking prison sentences, which over time unintentionally deprived its ranks of the experience needed to win trials against the most formidable law firms. By the time Serageldin committed his crime, Justice Department leadership, as well as prosecutors in integral United States attorney\u2019s offices, were de-emphasizing complicated financial cases \u2014 even neglecting clues that suggested that Lehman executives knew more than they were letting on about their bank\u2019s liquidity problem. In the mid-\u201990s, white-collar prosecutions represented an average of 17.6 percent of all federal cases. In the three years ending in 2012, the share was 9.4 percent.After the evening drive to Philipsburg, Serageldin checked into a motel. He didn\u2019t need to report to Moshannon Valley until 2 p.m. the next day, but he was advised to show up early to get a head start on his processing. Moshannon is a low-security facility, with controlled prisoner movements, a bit tougher than the one portrayed on \u201cOrange Is the New Black.\u201d Friends of Serageldin\u2019s worried about the violence; he was counseled to keep his head down and never change the channel on the TV no matter who seemed to be watching. Serageldin, who is tall and thin with a regal bearing, was largely preoccupied with how, after a decade of 18-hour trading days, he would pass the time. He was planning on doing math-problem sets and studying economics. He had delayed marrying his longtime girlfriend, a private-equity executive in London, but the plan was for her to visit him frequently.Other bankers have spoken out about feeling unfairly maligned by the financial crisis, pegged as \u201cbanksters\u201d by politicians and commentators. But Serageldin was contrite. \u201cI don\u2019t feel angry,\u201d he told me in early winter. \u201cI made a mistake. I take responsibility. I\u2019m ready to pay my debt to society.\u201d Still, the fact that the only top banker to go to jail for his role in the crisis was neither a mortgage executive (who created toxic products) nor the C.E.O. of a bank (who peddled them) is something of a paradox, but it\u2019s one that reflects the many paradoxes that got us here in the first place.Chertoff, who worked at the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office under Rudolph W. Giuliani, the godfather of the Wall Street perp walk, seemed like just the guy to jump-start the initiative \u2014 and he arrived at an opportune moment. Prosecutors were beginning their investigation of Enron and probe into Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm that had blessed the energy-trading giant\u2019s phony balance sheets and shredded documents shortly after it detonated. Early in his tenure, Chertoff found himself sitting in a conference room at Justice Department headquarters on Pennsylvania Avenue, listening with growing irritation as lawyers for Arthur Andersen tried to dispose of the Enron case with yet another settlement. The company previously oversaw the fraudulent books of Waste Management and Sunbeam, and it dealt with those previous scrapes by reaching settlements and a consent decree with regulators, vowing never to commit such a crime again. For its Waste Management infractions, the firm paid $7 million. Then, it was the largest civil penalty ever paid.Andersen was expecting the same kind of wrist-slap. As Chertoff recalls, one high-ranking executive noted brazenly that such settlements were merely \u201ca cost of doing business\u201d \u2014 the routine surcharges applied to the nation\u2019s largest corporations. That comment enraged Chertoff, and soon after, his prosecutors indicted the firm. \u201cDestroy documents?\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to view that as a stumble outside of its core business.\u201d In June 2002, Arthur Andersen was convicted by a jury, and within months, the firm closed down, costing tens of thousands of people their jobs.The Andersen case was supposed to embolden the Justice Department, but it quickly backfired. Chertoff\u2019s chutzpah shocked much of the corporate world and even many prosecutors, who thought the department had abused its powers at the cost of thousands of innocent workers. Almost immediately, the Andersen verdict resulted not in more boldness but in more caution on the part of federal prosecutors, including Chertoff himself. In 2003, his investigators were digging into questionable off-balance-sheet deals between the Pittsburgh-based PNC Bank and AIG Financial Products. They contemplated indicting the bank, which spurred Herbert Biern, at the time a top banking-supervision official at the Fed, to demand a meeting with Chertoff to warn him against it. Chertoff told Biern, according to attendees, that if the Justice Department \u201ccan\u2019t bring these cases because it may bring harm, then maybe these banks are too big.\u201d In the end, though, Chertoff and the Justice Department blinked. They didn\u2019t indict, and PNC entered into a deferred prosecution agreement. No bank executives were prosecuted. Two years later, the Supreme Court overturned the Arthur Andersen conviction.From 2004 to 2012, the Justice Department reached 242 deferred and nonprosecution agreements with corporations, compared with 26 in the previous 12 years, according to a study by David M. Uhlmann, a former prosecutor and law professor at the University of Michigan. And while companies paid large sums in the settlements \u2014 the days of $7 million cost-of-doing-business fees were over \u2014 several veteran Justice Department officials told me that these settlements emboldened defense lawyers. More crucial, they allowed the Justice Department\u2019s lawyers to \u201csucceed\u201d without learning how to develop important prosecutorial skills. Investigations of individuals are more time-consuming and require a different approach than those of a corporation. Indeed, the department now effectively outsources many of its investigations of corporate executives to outside firms, which invariably produce reports that exculpate those at the top. Jed Rakoff, the U.S. District Court judge and former federal prosecutor who has become the most prominent legal critic of the Justice Department, explained the process to me this way: \u201cThe report says: \u2018Mistakes were made. We are here to take our lumps\u2019 \u201d \u2014 in other words, settlements and, if the transgressions are particularly bad, further oversight. \u201cLost in that whole thing,\u201d Rakoff said, \u201cwas anyone trying to investigate whether the individuals did something wrong.\u201dIf Chertoff had signaled a green light for going after entire companies, Thompson drafted a memo in 2003 that offered a post-Andersen playbook that went right at the heart of how large corporations protected themselves. For years, big businesses, like tobacco companies, shielded questionable conduct by invoking attorney-client privilege, which could render details of troubling executive dealings inadmissible in court. If a company came under federal scrutiny, it typically paid its executives\u2019 legal bills, hiring some of the nation\u2019s best firms, those who could slow or derail any inquiries. And when multiple executives fell under suspicion, their lawyers would often sign joint defense agreements allowing them to share with one another what they learned about the feds\u2019 case.Thompson\u2019s memo declared that prosecutors could, in essence, offer a deal, but it wasn\u2019t a very generous one. Companies could win Brownie points for being cooperative only if they eschewed privileges like joint defense agreements. Almost immediately, members of the white-collar bar asserted that this overreach eroded a fundamental right, but they didn\u2019t have to argue incessantly; once again, the Justice Department\u2019s ambition backfired. In the summer of 2006, the government\u2019s once-promising prosecution of executives from KPMG, an accounting and consulting firm suspected of selling illegal tax shelters to wealthy clients, started going bad. (The U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan felt so confident that it indicted 17 KPMG executives.) The case fell apart when the judge ruled that those prosecutors had violated constitutional rights by pressuring the firm to waive attorney-client privilege and stop paying employees\u2019 legal fees; the government\u2019s zeal, he noted, had gotten \u201cin the way of its judgment.\u201d With the \u201cgreatest reluctance,\u201d he threw out the cases against 13 of the executives. (Two others were convicted.)Soon after, the counteroffensive to the Justice Department\u2019s overreach peaked, led by the white-collar bar and corporate lobbies and aided by The Wall Street Journal\u2019s editorial page, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and even the American Civil Liberties Union. Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, contended that the department was abusing corporations; his colleague Arlen Specter, then a Republican from Pennsylvania, readied a bill to prevent the Justice Department from receiving attorney-client privilege waivers. To cut that off, Paul McNulty, the deputy attorney general, released a revised set of rules stating, among other things, that no federal prosecutor could ask a company to waive attorney-client privilege without permission from higher-ups.Over the years, the KPMG debacle and the corporate revolt would lead the Justice Department to roll back the Thompson memo to nearly the point of reversal. Today prosecutors are prohibited from even asking companies to waive their attorney-client privilege. They are also prohibited from pushing a company to cut off the legal fees for indicted executives or pressuring it to forgo joint defense agreements. \u201cIt was very much a game-changer in the business of investigating and defending in those cases,\u201d says Michael Bromwich, a top white-collar lawyer and former inspector general of the Department of Justice.In the decade since, the courts dulled other prosecutorial tools. A Supreme Court ruling allowed sentences to be set below previously determined mandatory minimums (which made executives less likely to \u201cflip\u201d). Another narrowed an often-used legal theory that said employees were guilty of fraud if they deprived their companies of \u201chonest services\u201d (which helped nab Enron\u2019s former C.E.O., Jeffrey Skilling, among others). No change was momentous on its own \u2014 and some may have legitimately restored the rights of defendants \u2014 but taken together they marked a significant, if almost unnoted, shift toward the defense. After Lanny Breuer entered the Department of Justice, he testified in front of Congress to restore the honest-services charge for corrupt government officials. But he didn\u2019t even try to broach the topic of a private-sector fix.Serageldin\u2019s group made so much money that some colleagues believed his bosses gave him a pass on risk controls. But by disposition, and by practice, he was anything but a swashbuckler. When the value of mortgage securities began to crater, on what became known as the Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre of February 2007, most traders kept trading, pumping out securities, boosting their personal earnings while endangering \u2014 and in some cases destroying \u2014 their institutions. Serageldin, however, began ordering his traders to get out of their riskiest positions. The bank\u2019s head of fixed income at the time, James Healy, would later note that Serageldin\u2019s decisions \u201ctook courage and personal conviction, in the face of immense pressure\u201d from the sales force.Yet Serageldin\u2019s caution failed him in one crucial moment. Later that summer, traders in one of his portfolios began to avoid taking the necessary losses on their mortgage-backed securities. Traders are required to hold securities at their current value, known as marking to market, determining how much the portfolio made or lost that day. At one desperate point, one of Serageldin\u2019s traders approached a friend at a small regional bank to give him a so-called independent price that happened to be nearly identical to the prices in the portfolio, enabling them to conceal the size of the losses. In early December, that spreadsheet tallying the losses made its way to Serageldin, who would later admit to recognizing that the prices should have been lower. He had assumed the positions were hedged, a friend of his told me, but instead of saying anything, he tried to protect his reputation. By early 2008, he was out at Credit Suisse. The bank reported him to the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in the Southern District of New York.In a matter of months, the markets plummeted in a financial crisis that made Enron look like small-time pilfering. And as tens of millions of Americans lost their jobs or homes, an inchoate but palpable demand for justice \u2014 for a crackdown \u2014 emerged. Breuer may have come with the right pedigree, but he now faced troubles that hurt as much as the debacles of Arthur Andersen and KPMG, or the retreat from the Thompson memo: austerity. The department faced periodic hiring freezes. The F.B.I., which assigned dozens of agents to Enron, had shifted resources to terrorism. The Postal Service wound down an elite unit that had specialized in complex financial investigations. President Obama\u2019s Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act, which was designed to give hundreds of millions to prosecute financial criminals, was able to deliver only $65 million in 2010 and 2011. Prosecutors reporting to Breuer proposed setting up a mortgage-fraud initiative, a \u201cProsecutorial Strike Force,\u201d as one July 2009 memo put it, but the Justice Department dithered. Finally it set up the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force, an enormous coordinating committee with essentially no investigative operation. One former Justice Department official derided it as \u201cthe turtle.\u201dResources aside, the erosion of the department\u2019s actual trial skills would soon become apparent. In November 2009, the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Brooklyn lost the first criminal case of the crisis against two Bear Stearns executives accused of misleading investors. The prosecutors rushed into trial, failing to prepare for the exculpatory emails uncovered by the defense team. After two days, the jury acquitted the two money managers. \u201cFor sure,\u201d one former federal prosecutor told me, \u201cit put a chill\u201d on investigations. \u201cPoliticos care about winning and losing.\u201dAccording to numerous sources from the Justice Department, the Breu Crew instilled a careerist culture that was fearful of sullying its reputation by losing cases. Kathy Ruemmler, who worked on the Enron task force and later became Obama\u2019s counsel, would needle Breuer: \u201cHow many cases are you dismissing this week?\u201d Later Ruemmler was upset when the Justice Department decided against retrying a case against Merrill Lynch executives who helped Enron boost its earnings with an infamous transaction involving a Nigerian barge. (Breuer was recused from the barge case.) A former prosecutor at the Justice Department in Washington concurred that Breuer\u2019s staff didn\u2019t \u201cwant to pursue cases where they feel the person is 100 percent guilty but they are only 70 percent sure they can win at trial.\u201d Prosecutors contrasted that with previous eras, some fondly recalling a line favored by James Comey, who served as one of George W. Bush\u2019s deputy attorneys general and emphasized the need for \u201creal-time\u201d white-collar prosecutions. \u201cWe have a name for prosecutors who have never lost \u2014 the \u2018Chicken(expletive) Club.\u2019 \u201d (In a statement, Breuer said he had a strong record of white-collar enforcement: \u201cWhere there were cases to bring, we brought them, and where there were not, we took a pass.\u201d)But given that Washington rejected a unified national task force, these career motivations would prove particularly relevant. When Preet Bharara, former chief counsel for Senator Charles E. Schumer, arrived in the Southern District of New York in 2009, he had a decision to make. There were cases arising from the financial crisis, which could take years to investigate and, after all that, never make it to a jury. Or there were insider-trading cases, which were far more straightforward. Someone improperly learns nonpublic details about a company and makes a killing on the stock market. \u201cYou do have a tough choice,\u201d one former Southern District prosecutor says. \u201cAm I going to chase after crimes I don\u2019t know were committed and don\u2019t know who by, or do we go after crimes we do know were committed and by whom?\u201dBharara focused on insider trading, and his office has amassed a stunning 80-0 record of prosecutions, locking up the hedge-fund titan Raj Rajaratnam and Rajat Gupta, the former managing director of McKinsey & Company and a director at Goldman Sachs. They took down eight former employees of Steven A. Cohen\u2019s notorious SAC Capital hedge fund. (Notably, however, they haven\u2019t been able to bring charges against the man himself.) Time magazine put Bharara on its cover, with the bold headline: \u201cThis Man Is Busting Wall Street.\u201d Yet Bharara didn\u2019t touch Wall Street\u2019s real players \u2014 top bankers. The former prosecutor was almost sheepish about the insider-trading cases when I spoke to him: \u201cThey made our careers, but they don\u2019t change the world.\u201d In fact, several former prosecutors in the office told me that going after bankers was never a real priority. \u201cThe government failed,\u201d another former prosecutor said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do what we needed to do.\u201dAs a result, Bharara and his team neglected seemingly winnable cases in their own backyard, including one particularly big one. After Lehman imploded, the Justice Department\u2019s Washington headquarters split responsibility investigating what the bank\u2019s executives knew among three U.S. attorney\u2019s offices: the Southern and Eastern districts of New York and the New Jersey operation. But for all of that manpower, to those closest to the Lehman probe, the government\u2019s case was seemingly conducted by one lawyer, Bonnie Jonas, an assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District. She would make pilgrimages to the offices of Jenner & Block, a prestigious law firm that had been assigned to investigate the Lehman bankruptcy. Jonas would pore over the 40 million-odd pages of Lehman documents the firm assembled. (The Southern District says it devoted multiple people and ample resources to the investigation.)Nonetheless, the Justice Department never aggressively pursued what may have been the most promising angle. On Sept. 10, 2008, the chief financial officer of Lehman Brothers, Ian Lowitt, told shareholders and the public that the bank had $42 billion of available cash, or liquidity. The bank\u2019s position, Lowitt reassured, \u201cremains very strong.\u201d Lehman would file for bankruptcy five days later. \u201cWhat they were saying was not just wrong but materially wrong,\u201d Robert Byman, a Jenner & Block partner, told me.Over 14 months, Jenner & Block would put about 130 lawyers on the case to prepare a report on the collapse. At one point, recalls Stephen Ascher, a partner, one of them discovered \u201cthis wonderful chart\u201d breaking down the liquidity figure into three categories: high, moderate and low. Of those billions, $15 billion was in the \u201clow\u201d category, generally because it had been pledged as collateral to other banks. One former Lehman executive told me that several other company managers understood that they could not tap much, if any, of that encumbered money. And at least two executives objected to how the bank was representing its liquidity, including its international treasurer, Carlo Pellerani, according to the Jenner & Block report. The law firm found that regulators, credit-rating agencies and Lehman\u2019s outside lawyer had no idea that the liquidity pool wasn\u2019t, in fact, all that liquid. When Lowitt came to talk to Jenner & Block, he explained that he had not fully understood the issues when he assured investors of its liquid assets. That may be a reasonable defense, but it does not appear that prosecutors and federal investigators made a serious attempt to test how much Lehman\u2019s chief financial officer knew about his own books. Three Lehman executives and one regulator at the Federal Reserve, all of whom were involved in the bank\u2019s desperate attempts to keep itself liquid, told me they were never even interviewed by any federal-government officials.In his first months in prison, Serageldin has tried to remain upbeat. The investment-banking monk is now spending his nights in a basketball-court-size room with about 70 others. If the problem sets don\u2019t occupy him, he is allowed five books at a time. After explaining that he had lived abroad, Serageldin became known as London. The extent of his crime, meanwhile, has been revised. Initially prosecutors implied that the trader had been part of a conspiracy to hide $540 million worth of losses. By the time he was sentenced, the government was down to accusing him of conspiring to hide about $100 million. An internal Credit Suisse analysis put the misstatement at $37 million. \u201cThere\u2019s not a moment\u2019s doubt on my part\u201d that such mismarking happened elsewhere during the crisis, Fiachra O\u2019Driscoll, a friend and former colleague of Serageldin\u2019s, who has been an expert witness in private litigation, told me. \u201cI have seen evidence along the way that similar things happened dozens of times.\u201dFederal prosecutors have their own explanation for how only one Wall Street executive landed in jail in the wake of the financial crisis. The cases were complex to investigate and would have been infernally difficult to explain to juries, some told me. Much of the crisis and banker transgressions stemmed from recklessness, not criminality. They also suggest that deferred prosecutions \u2014 with their billions in settlements and additional oversights \u2014 can be stricter punishments than indictments. Still, while the Department of Justice has not been without its successes \u2014 it won a guilty plea from BP in the Deepwater Horizon spill, and it\u2019s currently going after traders in the wake of the JPMorgan Chase London Whale trading loss \u2014 these remain exceptions even beyond the financial sector. Federal prosecutors almost never bring criminal charges against top executives of large corporations, from banking to pharmaceuticals to technology. In March, the Justice Department entered into a deferred prosecution against Toyota but did not indict the company or any top executives. As the economy limps back from the Great Recession, compensation has recovered, corporate profits are at record levels and executives see that few, if any, of their peers ever go to prison anymore. Perhaps one reason Americans have come to begrudge the wealthy is a resentment of their culture of impunity.Larry Thompson became known for his memo, but back in the Clinton administration, the deputy attorney general Eric Holder laid out his own memo for strengthening corporate prosecutions. But he undermined his own words by also explaining that prosecutors needed to take into account the collateral economic consequences. In testimony in front of the Senate in March, Holder, who is now the U.S. attorney general, seemed to lament the position government enforcers had found themselves in. \u201cI am concerned that the size of some of these institutions becomes so large that it does become difficult for us to prosecute them when we are hit with indications that if we do prosecute \u2014 if we do bring a criminal charge \u2014 it will have a negative impact on the national economy, perhaps even the world economy.\u201d Holder quickly walked back the remarks. Soon after, Lanny Breuer returned to Covington & Burling as a vice chairman.Jesse Eisinger is a senior reporter at ProPublica.This article is a collaboration between The Times and ProPublica, the independent nonprofit investigative organization.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Powerful, Disruptive Shareholders", "Date": "2014-04-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsTHE season is starting for annual meetings, when shareholders have the chance to attend gatherings of companies in which they own stock to tell chief executives what\u2019s on their mind. While years ago there were few investors publicly voicing their criticisms, a new kind of shareholder has emerged \u2014 the activist investor. Often these investors take to the media and go online to excoriate companies. Their disruptive actions are rattling corporate boardrooms and businesses, disproportionate to their size and number. These activists typically hold small percentage ownership positions in companies and publicly propose significant changes: They can suggest that the chief executive be replaced (Yahoo), that a subsidiary be divested (PayPal from eBay) or that an entire strategy is flawed (Herbalife). The idea is that they buy the stock cheap, propose changes and sell when the value is higher. In a number of cases, shareholder activism has had a very positive effect on the market and on the management of individual companies that are underperforming. For example, Daniel S. Loeb bought a position in Yahoo in 2011, forced a C.E.O. change, and the stock has since risen by 149 percent. Carl C. Icahn forced a split-up of Motorola in 2011, and shareholders fared exceedingly well. But many don\u2019t end this successfully. William Ackman meddled into the affairs of J. C. Penney in 2013 and almost destroyed the company. He then sold his position and left the company to pick up the pieces. Mr. Icahn, in another investment, asked Apple to return more cash to shareholders. What can Mr. Icahn possibly know about the list of confidential projects on which Apple can spend cash? Certainly less than Apple management.The truth is that the fringe minority dominates the debate. These vocal factions often wage activist campaigns that strike fear into the hearts and minds of executives across the country, while purporting to act in the interest of creating long-term value. Furthermore, activists typically not only tolerate a fight \u2014 they relish it. While that may provide amusement to them, it can leave a company distracted, vulnerable to a takeover and subject to losing its people to more stable employers. These activists take a position, roll the dice, and if it doesn\u2019t pan out, they move on to the next target. Chief executives often have no choice but to react to short-termism, even at the expense of long-term value creation \u2014 which is their job.The dialogue between shareholders and companies needs to change. It\u2019s not something that can be accomplished by regulation or legislation. We would never suggest that shareholders lose their right to complain; they are owners and have every right to voice disapproval of their company. But the big shareholders, the institutional shareholders who invest for pension funds and the like, need to stop being silent and speak out. Sometimes they are working behind the scenes, encouraging the activists to shake up management. They need to be open about what they think, so ideas that are floated can be debated by the full range of shareholders, not just dominated by the vocal minority. If the large institutions are quietly feeding ideas to the activists, why hide their intentions? We are starting to see some changes; BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, recently sent a letter to the biggest companies in the United States criticizing investors who think about short-term instead of long-term goals. That\u2019s a start, and we urge others to follow.The activist-investor debate should not be a one-sided mudslinging assault waged by a few vocal dissenters who drown out companies and the majority of other investors. We need a constructive public forum. Perhaps equity research analysts could provide that forum. They host meetings for management and investors all the time, so why not use this forum to host the debate? The media would certainly cover the discussion. While companies cannot be forced to participate in such a debate, there would be enormous pressure for them to take up valuable ideas for changing companies and to reject the destructive ones. Shareholders own companies, management teams serve shareholders, and boards of directors serve as fiduciaries for those shareholders. We get that. What we don\u2019t get is why a small group of bullies should be able to command such undivided attention and instill such fear in corporate boardrooms. The fear is currently so intense that some executives at a recent conference admitted that they are afraid to speak out about the problem because they don\u2019t want to be targeted themselves.It\u2019s reminiscent of Joe McCarthy in the 1950s \u2014 in the same way he hid behind patriotism to inflame the communist scare, activists purport to seek long-term value when all they really want is to make a quick buck. It\u2019s time for a more civil, open debate conducted with decency. It will help all shareholders.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "New York\u2019s Case Against Airbnb Is Argued in Albany", "Date": "2014-04-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere was no room for agreement, and no agreement about rooms, in court on Tuesday in Albany.Eric T. Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, has issued a subpoena for Airbnb\u2019s list of hosts in New York City because he thinks some of them are breaking the law. It is illegal in New York to rent out an apartment for less than 30 days.Airbnb sees this as a fundamental attack on its very existence because much of what it offers in New York is short-term rentals in apartment buildings.In the media and again in court on Tuesday, Airbnb tried to make this a case of unwarranted government snooping. Roberta A. Kaplan of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, which is representing the company, criticized the government\u2019s subpoena for its \u201cextreme and incredible scope.\u201d The government wants users\u2019 names, emails, the address of the rental, the dates and the amount charged, she told the judge, Gerald W. Connolly of the Albany County Supreme Court.\u201cThis is private information,\u201d Ms. Kaplan said. \u201cConfidential information.\u201d She said an investigation of Airbnb hosts could drag their guests into the light unwillingly.\u201cImagine a person traveling to New York City for a private reason,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe they\u2019re applying for a job and don\u2019t want their employer to know. Or they have a form of cancer, and they don\u2019t want people to know.\u201dIn an affidavit filed in New York State Supreme Court, the director of research for the state attorney general noted that of the more than 19,500 listings on Airbnb in New York at the end of January, the majority were for an entire apartment.The subpoena was filed last fall, and until recently it seemed there would be a deal. Then, over the last few days, the issue exploded into acrimony, mostly on Airbnb\u2019s side. But the company also scrubbed its site Monday of numerous New York hosts, including those that Mr. Schneiderman seemed most interested in \u2014 the ones offering dozens of apartments. Karla G. Sanchez, the executive deputy attorney general for economic justice, argued the case for the state. She said the reason the state wanted a list of all the hosts in New York was because \u201cWe believe that there are people who are using more than one ID.\u201d Asked by the judge if the subpoena was too broad, Ms. Sanchez said, \u201cWe\u2019re happy to limit the subpoena in a way that is not burdensome.\u201dJudge Connolly seemed genuinely interested in the two sides making a deal. Before the hearing began, he met with the lawyers in his chambers. After the hearing, he invited them back into chambers again.They did not accept the invitation.\u201cWe\u2019re all tired,\u201d Ms. Kaplan said. \u201cWe\u2019re going home.\u201d Afterward, spokesmen for each side issued statements condemning the other.\u201cDespite all of Airbnb\u2019s rhetoric, the company has never denied that substantial illegal activity is taking place on its site,\u201d said Matt Mittenthal, press secretary to Mr. Schneiderman. \u201cTo the contrary, Airbnb decided before our hearing to remove 2,000 listings posted by \u2018bad actors\u2019 \u2014 hardly isolated cases.\u201d David Hantman, head of global public policy for Airbnb, appealed to deep fears of some New Yorkers, saying the metropolis could be left behind by places that don\u2019t even have a Bloomingdale\u2019s or Zabar\u2019s.\u201cCities like Paris, Amsterdam and Hamburg are embracing the sharing economy and New York shouldn\u2019t be stuck playing catch-up,\u201d he said.\u00a0The judge gave no indication of when he would issue a ruling.Dennis Gaffney contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.U. Lawmakers Approve Tough \u2018Net Neutrality\u2019 Rules", "Date": "2014-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe proposals, which had been subject to intense lobbying by industry groups and consumer advocates, mirror similar efforts in the United States to allow access by all companies and individuals to the Internet\u2019s pipelines for services like streaming music, on-demand television and cloud computing.The new legislation, which aims to create a single market for electronic communications across the bloc, faces more hurdles before it can become law.The next European Parliament, to be elected in May, would still need to give a final endorsement of the rules, and individual countries would need to reach agreement with the Parliament and the European Commission on a reconciled version of the proposed law.Any future horse trading, particularly over how telecom giants charge Internet companies for access to their data networks, may lead to changes in the final rules after domestic politicians and regulators provide feedback for the Pan-European proposals.Despite the uncertainty, Internet companies and consumer advocacy groups voiced support on Thursday for the new rules, while telecom companies said the changes would potentially curtail investment in the Continent\u2019s mobile and fixed-line Internet infrastructure.European politicians inserted last-minute amendments intended to provide a strict definition of so-called net neutrality, which means that telecom companies and other Internet service providers cannot discriminate between different services that run on their data networks.The lawmakers also made it mandatory for mobile phone companies to comply with rules to phase out roaming costs when consumers use cellphones in other European Union countries by the end of next year.\u201cThis vote is the E.U. delivering for citizens,\u201d Neelie Kroes, the European commissioner responsible for telecommunications, said in a statement on Thursday. \u201cThis is what the E.U. is all about \u2014 getting rid of barriers to make life easier and less expensive.\u201dIndustry lobbyists said that the cuts in cellphone roaming charges, which received widespread political backing, would likely stand when a new Parliament convenes. The net neutrality provisions, which passed with slim majorities, could be reopened depending on the outcome of the parliamentary elections.In a sign that the debate over the legislation is far from over, Giles Chichester, a member of the European Parliament from Britain, criticized colleagues over the vote, saying they had rushed into the approval.The current legislation, said Mr. Chichester, a member of Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s Conservative Party, poses \u201csignificant risks to innovation, investment and ultimately consumers from top-down and overly prescriptive rules that attempt to predict the largely uncertain future evolution of the Internet economy.\u201dThe rules are part of a continuing debate in Europe over how to pay for the multibillion-euro investments needed to upgrade the Continent\u2019s mobile and landline Internet infrastructure. In the absence of clear rules, Europe has slipped increasingly behind the more advanced data networks of North America and Asia.Operators like Vodafone of Britain and Deutsche Telekom of Germany want to charge Internet companies like Google, Netflix and smaller start-ups for use of their networks because services like online-television streaming occupy a large percentage of the Internet pipelines.In contrast, Internet companies and consumer advocacy groups warn that the telecom companies could reduce consumer choice if they require companies to pay extra for access to data networks. Companies say only those with deep pockets, which are mostly American Internet giants like Microsoft, which owns the video messaging service Skype, would be able to pay for greater access to Europe\u2019s Internet infrastructure.European lawmakers said that the majority of politicians had approved the new legislation because of evidence that telecom companies had already promoted some services at the expense of others, including Skype.In response, the vote on Thursday provided extra protection for equal access to Europe\u2019s mobile and fixed-line data networks. Internet service providers like cable companies would still be able to sell access to higher-quality networks, as long as that access did not affect the existing infrastructure.Consumer advocacy groups welcomed the changes.\u201cThe E.U. seized the opportunity to secure users\u2019 rights and protect innovation and freedom of expression online,\u201d Raegan MacDonald, the European policy manager at the consumer group Access, said in a statement.Telecom carriers, which have plans to put billions of euros into the Continent\u2019s mobile and landline Internet infrastructure over the next 10 years, are concerned that they will not be able to recoup their investment from consumers\u2019 growing appetite for online services like streaming of music and TV.For many telecom companies, roaming also is a significant source of revenue in an increasingly competitive market where more than four major carriers in each European country typically vie for consumers\u2019 attention.\u201cToday\u2019s vote risks derailing the original objectives of the Connected Continent regulation,\u201d Luigi Gambardella, chairman of the European Telecommunications Network Operators\u2019 Association, said in a statement. \u201cThe access of European citizens and businesses to innovative and high-quality services will be negatively affected.\u201dMark Scott reported from London, and James Kanter from Brussels.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Cold War Echo, Obama Strategy Writes Off Putin", "Date": "2014-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Even as the crisis in Ukraine continues to defy easy resolution, President Obama and his national security team are looking beyond the immediate conflict to forge a new long-term approach to Russia that applies an updated version of the Cold War strategy of containment.Just as the United States resolved in the aftermath of World War II to counter the Soviet Union and its global ambitions, Mr. Obama is focused on isolating President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s Russia by cutting off its economic and political ties to the outside world, limiting its expansionist ambitions in its own neighborhood and effectively making it a pariah state.Mr. Obama has concluded that even if there is a resolution to the current standoff over Crimea and eastern Ukraine, he will never have a constructive relationship with Mr. Putin, aides said. As a result, Mr. Obama will spend his final two and a half years in office trying to minimize the disruption Mr. Putin can cause, preserve whatever marginal cooperation can be saved and otherwise ignore the master of the Kremlin in favor of other foreign policy areas where progress remains possible.\u201cThat is the strategy we ought to be pursuing,\u201d said Ivo H. Daalder, formerly Mr. Obama\u2019s ambassador to NATO and now president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. \u201cIf you just stand there, be confident and raise the cost gradually and increasingly to Russia, that doesn\u2019t solve your Crimea problem and it probably doesn\u2019t solve your eastern Ukraine problem. But it may solve your Russia problem.\u201dThe manifestation of this thinking can be seen in Mr. Obama\u2019s pending choice for the next ambassador to Moscow. While not officially final, the White House is preparing to nominate John F. Tefft, a career diplomat who previously served as ambassador to Ukraine, Georgia and Lithuania.When the search began months ago, administration officials were leery of sending Mr. Tefft because of concern that his experience in former Soviet republics that have flouted Moscow\u2019s influence would irritate Russia. Now, officials said, there is no reluctance to offend the Kremlin.While Mr. Obama\u2019s long-term approach takes shape, though, a quiet debate has roiled his administration over how far to go in the short term. So far, economic advisers and White House aides urging a measured approach have won out, prevailing upon a cautious president to take one incremental step at a time out of fear of getting too far ahead of skittish Europeans and risking damage to still-fragile economies on both sides of the Atlantic.The more hawkish faction in the State and Defense Departments has grown increasingly frustrated, privately worrying that Mr. Obama has come across as weak and unintentionally sent the message that he has written off Crimea after Russia\u2019s annexation. They have pressed for faster and more expansive sanctions, only to wait while memos sit in the White House without action. Mr. Obama has not even imposed sanctions on a list of Russian human rights violators waiting for approval since last winter.\u201cThey\u2019re playing us,\u201d Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the ranking Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, said of the Russians, expressing a sentiment that is also shared by some inside the Obama administration. \u201cWe continue to watch what they\u2019re doing and try to respond to that,\u201d he said on CNN on Friday. \u201cBut it seems that in doing so, we create a policy that\u2019s always a day late and a dollar short.\u201dThe prevailing view in the West Wing, though, is that while Mr. Putin seems for now to be enjoying the glow of success, he will eventually discover how much economic harm he has brought on his country. Mr. Obama\u2019s aides noted the fall of the Russian stock market and the ruble, capital flight from the country and the increasing reluctance of foreign investors to expand dealings in Russia. They argued that while American and European sanctions have not yet targeted wide parts of the Russian economy, they have sent a message to international businesses, and that just the threat of broader measures has produced a chilling effect. If the Russian economy suffers over the long term, senior American officials said, then Mr. Putin\u2019s implicit compact with the Russian public promising growth for political control could be sundered.That may not happen quickly, however, and in the meantime, Mr. Obama seems intent on not letting Russia dominate his presidency. While Mr. Obama spends a lot of time on the Ukraine crisis, it does not seem to absorb him. Speaking privately with visitors, he is more likely to bring up topics like health care and the Republicans in Congress than Mr. Putin. Ukraine, he tells people, is not a major concern for most Americans, who are focused on the economy and other issues closer to home.Since returning from a trip to Europe last month, Mr. Obama has concentrated his public schedule around issues like job training and the minimum wage. Even after his diplomatic team reached the Geneva agreement to de-escalate the crisis last week, Mr. Obama headed to the White House briefing room not to talk about that but to hail new enrollment numbers he said validated his health care program.Reporters asked about Ukraine anyway, as he knew they would, and he expressed skepticism about the prospects of the Geneva accord that his secretary of state, John Kerry, had just brokered. But when a reporter turned the subject back to health care, Mr. Obama happily exclaimed, \u201cYeah, let\u2019s talk about that.\u201dThat represents a remarkable turnaround from the start of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency, when he nursed dreams of forging a new partnership with Russia. Now the question is how much of the relationship can be saved. Mr. Obama helped Russia gain admission to the World Trade Organization; now he is working to limit its access to external financial markets.But the two sides have not completely cut off ties. American troops and equipment are still traveling through Russian territory en route to and from Afghanistan. Astronauts from the two countries are currently in orbit together at the International Space Station, supplied by Russian rockets. A joint program decommissioning old Russian weapons systems has not been curtailed.\u201cYou can\u2019t isolate everything from a general worsening of the relationship and the rhetoric,\u201d said Graham Allison, director of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University and an adviser to multiple administrations on Russia and defense policy. \u201cBut there\u2019s still very high priority business that we have to try to do with Russia.\u201dStill, the relationship cannot return to normal either, even if the Ukraine situation is settled soon, specialists said. \u201cThere\u2019s really been a sea change not only here but in much of Europe about Russia,\u201d said Robert Nurick, a Russia expert at the Atlantic Council. \u201cA lot of the old assumptions about what we were doing and where we were going and what was possible are gone, and will stay that way as long as Putin\u2019s there.\u201dMr. Nurick said discussion had already begun inside the administration about where and under what conditions the United States might engage with Russia in the future. \u201cBut I can\u2019t imagine this administration expending a lot of political capital on this relationship except to manage it so that the other things they care about a lot more than Russia are not injured too badly,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Quick, Satisfying Drive in the 2015 Honda Fit", "Date": "2014-04-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrue to its name, the 2015 Honda Fit just fits. It\u2019s a small car, and accordingly, weaves through tight urban spaces with ease. But for something so tiny, it has a lot of space inside \u2013 not just the kind that looks good in brochures, but the sort that makes drivers feel at ease, like they have finally escaped the womblike experience so many automakers offer, even on much larger cars.Honda gave journalists an opportunity to drive the new Fit, which was unveiled at the Detroit auto show in January, in New York on Tuesday. Although the journey consisted of only a quick drive up Manhattan\u2019s West Side Highway, some city driving on the Upper West Side and another cruise south to Midtown, the car was comfortable and fun to drive.The manual transmission and C.V.T. models were capable, providing power from the 130-horsepower 1.5-liter dual-overhead-cam 4-cylinder engine quickly and without complaint. The C.V.T. posts better fuel economy numbers \u2013 33 miles per gallon in the city and 41 on the highway, compared with the 6-speed manual transmission-equipped model\u2019s 29 m.p.g. city, 37 highway \u2013 but C.V.T.s are, by their nature, unexciting. This one was certainly not as lackluster as most and took all of the stress out of driving in stop-and-go city traffic.The manual transmission Honda has installed in its new, Mexico-built Fit requires little thought or patience to operate, and gives the driver more control. Revs tend to stay high for a second as the clutch is depressed and the accelerator released for a shift, but the shifts are smooth. Not all drivers will agree, but the zippy little econobox seemed a lot more fun with the 6-speed.With either transmission, the car accelerated quickly and handled well, even on New York City\u2019s potholed pavement. Honda says it made improvements to the suspension and steering systems, and whatever the automaker did seems to have worked. It held a line well through fast curves on patched sections of the West Side Highway. The steering was light and responsive.What really sets the new Fit apart, though, is its interior space. The car is 160 inches long, 67 inches wide, 60 inches tall and has a 99.6-inch wheelbase. That makes it a couple of inches shorter and a bit wider than the model on its way out, and Honda has reconfigured the interior to increase passenger volume, front shoulder room and rear leg room.But the difference is in how it feels. For example, the dashboard is, as it is in so many cars whose windshields have been steeply raked for better aerodynamics, fairly deep. But it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s protruding into the passenger\u2019s space. A low console between the driver and passenger seats does away with the fencelike dividers that seem to pen drivers and passengers into their respective corners in so many other cars. The dashboard is simple and well laid out, with mostly analog gauges arranged symmetrically in front of the driver.The seats can be folded in a variety of different ways to maximize space and provide options for different configurations of passengers and stuff. The rear seats fold flat \u2013 more or less \u2013 and a 5-foot-8-inch person can just lie down diagonally across the extended cargo compartment. Honda says the front and rear seats can be laid flat to increase front-to-back storage space, and its brochure shows surfboards and other fun-looking outdoor activity gear stretched out next to the driver\u2019s seat.Not everyone has been a fan of the Fit\u2019s snub-nose styling, but the new model features clean, simple lines and a tastefully conservative look that will most likely age well. It has a lot less of the goofiness that seems to plague subcompacts because of a taller hood, sharper corners and slightly more aggressive face, and it\u2019s available with 16-inch alloy wheels that give it a more snappy appearance.A camera mounted in the passenger-side mirror activates when the right turn signal is flipped on, providing a wide-angle view of the car\u2019s blind spot on the dash-mounted display screen. Whether this is helpful or distracting is up for debate, as looking down at the screen takes your eyes off the road, too. It\u2019s an interesting idea, though.The 2015 Fit gave a good first impression in this brief encounter. We\u2019ll see how it eventually does in a longer test.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chinese Exports and Imports Unexpectedly Fell in March", "Date": "2014-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 China\u2019s exports unexpectedly fell in March, and its imports dropped even more sharply, but the significance of the data for the Chinese economy was clouded by uncertainty over the extent to which exporters and importers were timing shipments to profit from currency market shifts.China\u2019s exports fell 6.6 percent in dollar terms last month, compared with a year ago, while imports tumbled 11.3 percent, China\u2019s General Administration of Customs said on Thursday. Economists had expected both to show small increases.But the change in exports was particularly hard to predict because many exporters had overstated the value of their shipments a year ago to circumvent China\u2019s currency controls. The over-invoicing allowed exporters to bring more dollars into the country, placing a bet on further appreciation of the renminbi, the Chinese currency.By contrast, the People\u2019s Bank of China, the country\u2019s central bank, pushed the value of the renminbi down 2.5 percent with heavy purchases of dollars and by telling state-controlled banks to buy dollars. The central bank\u2019s initiative, designed to discourage speculation on further appreciation of the renminbi, removed the incentive for overinvoicing.The drop in imports was the bigger surprise, as imports can sometimes be a bellwether for the broader economy. \u201cDo not worry about the export data, but what about imports?\u201d said Louis Kuijs, the chief China economist at Royal Bank of Scotland.But some traders may have delayed taking delivery of imports until their renminbi were worth more.The Hong Kong and Shanghai stock markets were both down 0.3 percent a half-hour after the release of the trade data, with China-related stocks declining faster on the Hong Kong market than companies with more of their operations in Hong Kong itself. Both markets gained more than 1 percent for the day.Premier Li Keqiang of China said in the keynote speech on Thursday at the Boao Forum for Asia on China\u2019s Hainan island that the Chinese economy would be able to achieve sustained growth through ongoing urbanization, growing technological strength and ample foreign exchange reserves.He also sounded a fairly conciliatory note on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an American-endorsed plan for more free trade in Asia and around the Pacific basin. American officials have been skeptical at times that China, with its many oligopolistic, state-owned enterprises, would be willing to embrace sufficiently extensive market-opening measures to join the partnership, while some Chinese economists and other experts have been wary that the partnership\u2019s ambitious goals might exclude them.Without saying how far China might go to dismantle its trade barriers, which remain among the highest of any major trading nation, Mr. Li said that, \u201cAs long as the T.P.P. is conducive to the development of global trade and the fostering of an equitable and open trading environment, China is happy to see its conclusion.\u201dChina\u2019s customs agency said in a news release that for the entire first quarter, the tonnage of commodity imports had increased even as the price had dropped sharply, in line with global price declines for commodities that have benefited China as the largest importer. China\u2019s iron ore imports climbed 19.4 percent by tonnage in the first quarter, for example, even as the price fell 8 percent.The customs agency also noted that its survey of nearly 2,000 exporting companies showed greater optimism in the first quarter than in the fourth quarter of last year, prompting the agency to predict that exports would be stronger from April through June than in the first three months of this year.As details of the March trade figures emerged on Thursday, there were further signs that plays on currency markets underlay the poor export performance. Exports to Hong Kong, a favorite destination for exporters seeking a quick shipment for currency reasons because it is only several hours\u2019 truck ride from thousands of factories in southeastern China, plummeted 43.6 percent in March from a year ago.But exports to the European Union, which are much harder to manipulate because it takes a month for goods to make the trip by sea, climbed 8.8 percent in March from a year earlier. Exports to the United States were up 1.2 percent.S\u00e9bastien Breteau, the founder and chief executive of Asia Inspection, a Hong Kong-based company that checks factories for safety, environmental and labor violations on behalf of retailers, said that the export factories still seemed busy and suggested that the March figures might have been distorted. \u201cThe exports from China are still very strong,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe this is related to the fact they let the renminbi slip down.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Link Between Fidgety Boys and a Sputtering Economy", "Date": "2014-04-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe UpshotAll of which makes the comparisons between boys and girls in the same categories fairly striking: The gap in behavioral skills between young girls and boys is even bigger than the gap between rich and poor.These depressing trends have many causes, but the social struggles of men and boys are an important one. If the United States is going to build a better-functioning economy than the one we\u2019ve had over the last 15 years, we\u2019re going to have to solve our boy problems.But the trends seem too broad for family structure to be the only cause. That\u2019s where schools come in.Girls enter school with a lead on boys, and schools then fail to close the gaps. Instead, they increase. The behavioral advantage that girls have over boys in kindergarten, based on teachers\u2019 assessments of their students, are even larger in fifth grade.These behavior measures are subjective, of course, based on the views of teachers across the country in very different classrooms. Yet it\u2019s clear that the measures reflect something real, because the behavior differences later translate into academic differences. By high school, even advanced math and science classes now have more girls than boys. At college graduation ceremonies around the country this spring, women in caps and gowns will easily outnumber men.The experts who study the subject disagree on the solutions. Some, like Ms. Buchmann and Mr. DiPrete, point out that boys still do quite well in the best-performing schools. When good grades bring high status, boys respond. To the researchers in this camp, the answer involves improving schools, which will have a disproportionate effect on boys, rather than changing schools to be more attuned to boys\u2019 needs.My own sense is that both sides have a point \u2014 and that their ideas aren\u2019t mutually exclusive. Experimenting with all kinds of solutions will offer better answers than we now have.The problems that stem from gender have become double-edged. The old forms of sexism, while greatly diminished, still constrain women. The job market exacts harsh financial and career penalties on anyone who decides to work part time or take time off, and the workers who do so are overwhelmingly female. That\u2019s a big part of the reason that the top ranks of corporate America, Silicon Valley and the government remain dominated by men.But men have their own challenges. As the economy continues to shift away from brawn and toward brains, many men have struggled with the transition.\u201cBoys are getting the wrong message about what you need to do to be successful,\u201d Ms. Buchmann says. \u201cTraditional gender roles are misguiding boys. In today\u2019s economy, being tough and being strong are not what leads to success.\u201dThe problem doesn\u2019t simply involve men trying to overcome the demise of a local factory or teenage boys getting into trouble. It involves children so young that most haven\u2019t even learned the word \u201cgender.\u201d Yet their gender is already starting to cast a long shadow over their lives.David Leonhardt is the editor of The Upshot, a New York Times venture that presents news, analysis and graphics about politics and policy. \nnytimes.com/upshot Advertisement"}

Wobbly politicians from Europe and America should come here to get spinal transplants.\u201cWe hope that you will not freeze,\u201d one senior Russian official publicly warned Moldovans.\u201cThere is no alternative for us but to pursue European integration,\u201d Prime Minister Iurie Leanca, a former diplomat, told me in perfect English in his office here in the capital, Chisinau. \u201cWe are European! No one should contest this.\u201dTransnistria is a Russian-speaking enclave within Moldova, armed by Moscow and protected by Russian troops. Transnistria claims to have seceded and established an independent country, and, in a troubling omen, its government (which Moscow controls) appealed this month for Russia to annex it.So Russia could soon swallow both Transnistria and a chunk of southern Ukraine, including Odessa, to access it.Transnistria remains a police state, so I slipped across the border as a tourist, and the area feels just as the old Soviet Union did. Indeed, Transnistria should market itself as an open-air museum of Soviet rule, complete with Lenin statues, Russian troops on the roads and an intelligence agency still called the K.G.B. The propaganda department is in overdrive, with countless billboards celebrating patriotism and past Russian triumphs.\u201cYou must be proud of your country!\u201d one billboard declared.Transnistria\u2019s military memorials complete with a tank or armored personnel carrier praise the heroism of local people and denounce those killed \u201cby fascists\u201d in fighting with Moldova\u2019s military in the early 1990s. One giant collection of posters celebrated Russian and local heroes and praised \u201cthose great men who contributed to our culture.\u201d\u201cFor people here, Putin is a hero,\u201d one young woman told me.It\u2019s true that the Moldovan government in the past was sometimes heavy-handed or threatening to Russian speakers, and, just as Moldovans had the right to leave the Soviet Union, people in Transnistria should have the right to secede from Moldova. But that should happen when Russian troops are gone and people have the right to speak freely.Moldova, which is Romanian-speaking, is rural, relaxed and green, but the economy crashed after the collapse of the Soviet Union and perhaps one million people fled the country to find work. In some Moldovan villages, it is difficult to find young women because so many left for jobs abroad. According to human rights monitors and United Nations officials, these women were tricked, raped and trafficked by organized crime into brothels across western Europe.In recent years, the government has tried to build a pro-Western market economy, and the country is rebounding but still fragile. Many fear that Putin will now direct his \u201cmasked warfare\u201d of infiltrators and provocateurs to turn Moldova into the next Ukraine.It may be too late to deter Putin in Moldova, but, whatever happens, we should back Moldova\u2019s plucky government. The United States can help by supporting infrastructure for Moldova to import natural gas and electricity from Romania, making it harder for Putin to freeze Moldovans into submission. We can nudge the European Union to embrace Moldova\u2019s desire to join.And if President Obama could visit this gutsy country for a few hours, people would cheer him as he\u2019s never been cheered \u2014 and he would see an example of gold medal grit that we can all learn from.Advertisement"}

The warm and friendly attitude toward America and Americans that I encountered when I first came to Brazil in 2001, and which so attracted me to this wonderful country, has disappeared. This administration has done all it can do to upset a cordial relationship of more than 100 years and has sadly succeeded. What happened?First, America has ignored Brazil, despite the fact that Brazil has the second-largest economy in the Western Hemisphere. Respect is what you have to give in order to get it, and Washington has been woefully inadequate in giving.Second, Washington has treated Brazil with contempt. There has been an attitude on the part of this administration that \u201cyou have to do business with us.\u201d No, Brazil does not. Brazil is the industrial, agricultural and natural resource capital of South America. It picks who its trading partners are, not the United States. If the United States wants better trade relations with its southern neighbor, it will have to earn it. Third, the administration has lied to Brazilians. When President Obama said that spying on President Dilma Rousseff was to \u201cinterdict terrorist networks,\u201d did he really think Brazilians would believe it? Where is the apology that should have been the first reaction to violating a longstanding friendship? The damage can still be repaired, but it will take a much greater effort by the Obama administration. Re \u201cAmerica\u2019s last task in Kabul\u201d (Review, April 19) by Vali R. Nasr: America\u2019s final task as it leaves Afghanistan should be to keep both Pakistan and Iran at bay, as both have used geography and ethnicity to their advantage throughout the war to further their own causes. Both the Taliban and Al Qaeda have grown exponentially in the interim, especially with the help of Pakistan. Afghanistan\u2019s leaders have repeatedly pointed this out to the United States. America should listen.Re \u201cIt\u2019s all about May 25\u201d (Opinion, April 24) by Thomas L. Friedman: Needless to say, sanctions must be made meaningful and be imposed without delay for Russia to back off. At the same time, it is even more important to assist the Kiev government in preparing for the May 25 election. An important part of that effort is to make news from the independent press and Kiev available in the east. It would certainly help the inhabitants of the Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv regions to know how the inhabitants of annexed Crimea are faring, what the Kiev government is doing, who the candidates are and what the choices are for the Ukrainian people. To counter all the Kremlin-fed propaganda, it is imperative that these regions be informed of the real stakes in this election. President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s domestic politics \u2014 a mix of gross capitalism and Soviet-style authoritarianism \u2014 may well be unsavory. But one has to recognize that the end of the Cold War was conceived and managed, mainly by the United States, not as an opportunity for reconciliation and geopolitical renewal but as a victory to be exploited to the utmost, notably by recruiting former Soviet satellites into NATO and encircling or threatening to encircle Russia with military bases and nuclear or anti-nuclear-missile installations. In the interim, the European Union campaigned actively to attract former Soviet states into its orbit, with scant regard for Russian sensitivities, albeit peacefully.Short of some solution to the Ukraine issue satisfactory to the Russians, one way or the other the Europeans, meaning above all the European Union, will have to underwrite Ukraine for its energy expenses and debts, since the credibility of the union is at stake. Meanwhile, Ukraine\u2019s accession to the European Union has become a very long-term prospect, if it ever happens at all. Ukraine had best prepare for partnership agreements with both Russia and the European Union \u2014 probably its only reasonable course of action.Re \u201cWhat Germany can teach Japan\u201d (Opinion, April 17) by Jochen Bittner: In Miyazaki, Japan, there is a hill with an impressive tower at its peak. The tower was built in 1940 at the height of Japanese imperialism, with stones taken from temples and shrines all over Asia. It is said that the tower symbolized the divine right of the Japanese Empire to \u201cunify the eight corners of the world.\u201dAfter the war, the area around the tower was named Heiwadai Koen park, with its central feature being designated as the Peace Tower. If Japan had felt any remorse for its war crimes, it would have torn down the monument and returned the stones. Japan could still do that; 70 years late is better than never. But unlike Germany, Japan has never completely come to terms with its evil past. Until it does, Japan will continue to be viewed with distrust in this part of the world.Re \u201cRaising a moral child\u201d (Review, April 12) by Adam Grant: Compassion and kindness may well be virtues under certain conditions, but they are easily imitated virtues \u2014 and often never involve hard choices. They are postures toward the world. By contrast, morality, as Aristotle understood it, is never rule-bound. There are seldom firm rules for generating the distributive and corrective applications of justice embodied in any genuine morality. This makes moral behavior hard work, and therefore always an achievement, like other acquisitions and applications of knowledge.

{"Headline": "When Cars Ruled the World\u2019s Fair", "Date": "2014-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by14 PhotosFrom its humble origins as a Queens garbage dump \u2014 inspiration for the valley of ashes in \u201cThe Great Gatsby\u201d \u2014 Flushing Meadows Corona Park emerged as the site of two world\u2019s fairs, in 1939-40 and 1964-65.The first fair laid out a glorious vision for the automobile: General Motors\u2019 Futurama exhibition, designed by Norman Bel Geddes, depicted the multilane highways of the future. The second fair arrived with that vision mostly realized \u2014 and the automobile near the pinnacle of its power and prestige.Fifty years ago, Lee A. Iacocca unveiled the Mustang even before the fair\u2019s opening day, with a press conference on April 13, 1964. But there were many other auto-centered displays throughout the fair\u2019s run. Chrysler showed cars with turbine engines; General Motors offered concept cars shaped like jet planes.But in retrospect, the second fair can be seen as the last un-self-conscious public celebration of automotive culture before concerns about safety and fuel economy changed it forever. Ralph Nader\u2019s \u201cUnsafe at Any Speed\u201d would be published the month after the fair closed; waiting in the wings were the OPEC fuel crises and the mass invasion of economical, reliable cars and trucks from Japan.As in 1939, the transportation area where the auto pavilions were situated was across the Grand Central Parkway, south of the main part of the fair and reached by pedestrian overpasses.While American Motors was not represented, Detroit\u2019s Big Three competed in their presentations. Ford claimed its pavilion was the largest at the fair: \u201cA journey of imagination across time and space\u201d that extended \u201cnearly three football fields!\u201d But the facade of G.M.\u2019s pavilion towered high above it.\u00a0G.M. showed a colony on the moon. It included vehicles, of course, called lunar crawlers. But Chrysler had real moon rockets.At the Ford pavilion, some of the new Mustang convertibles, along with models like Falcons and Galaxies \u2014 were pressed into service on the moving belt of the Magic Skyway ride, designed by Walt Disney. Visitors sat in the cars as they rolled past displays of mechanically animated dinosaurs, mammoths and a Neanderthal man.General Motors decided to repeat its successful strategy from 1939 with the Futurama II display. It included dioramas suggesting how the world would continue to be developed. In the year that the Beatles arrived and Bob Dylan went mainstream, G.M. showcased a particularly myopic vision of the future.Its pavilion showed gigantic machines for conquering the oceans, the deserts and the Arctic. What was then jungle \u2014 rain forest, in today\u2019s parlance \u2014 would be conquered by an atomic-powered 300-foot-long machine that would cut trees with lasers, spread herbicide and extrude behind it a four-lane freeway at a rate of a mile an hour.G.M. did show more practical technology, such as a fuel cell and a turbine engine. And in addition to its dream cars, G.M. displayed future products of its other divisions, including five dream kitchens.Chrysler, however, may have offered the most popular display of the domestic automakers. Among the attractions on five islands, linked by bridges in a six-acre artificial lake, were a puppet show and an airborne ride over a simulated assembly line on Production Island. There was a building-size automobile model that children could scramble through.Chrysler even offered a space-age jet car: one of the 50 operational Turbine Cars that the company produced.\u00a0The body, however, was less futuristic: It resembled a 1964 Ford Thunderbird.The designs, directed by the corporate advertising manager, Richard E. Forbes, and the modernist designer George Nelson \u2014 known for his marshmallow sofa and clocks \u2014 were not only fun, but they impressed the critics.Vincent Scully, the Yale professor and architecture critic, singled out the Chrysler exhibition as the best-spirited of the bunch. He especially liked the star display, a 100-foot-long model of an engine with animated parts; the crankshaft was personified as a 50-foot dragon.The creators of the fair displays had reached the spirit of Pop Art, which was just arriving in Manhattan galleries, by a different artistic route.Another example of Pop Art sensibility was U.S. Royal\u2019s tire-shaped Ferris wheel, an 80-foot-tall pop concept worthy of Claes Oldenburg. The giant tire was eventually moved to Michigan and rebranded for Uniroyal; it still greets motorists alongside Interstate 94 near the Detroit airport, as if it had rolled there from the World\u2019s Fair site, down the Grand Central Parkway, over the George Washington Bridge and out to the Midwest.Avis, the rental car company, offered a carnival-style ride of antique car replicas. Sinclair, the oil company whose symbol was a dinosaur, presented life-size versions.For those with more basic automotive sensibilities, the transportation zone also included a figure-eight-shaped track for the Hell Drivers stunt team and its Auto-trol show. Several times daily, the drivers leaped off ramps, ran on two wheels at 50 m.p.h., and played bumper tag in rugged Dodges.The fair\u2019s theme was \u201cPeace Through Understanding,\u201d but attendance was suppressed by rising crime rates and by racial violence in parts of the city during the summer of 1964, according to Joseph Tirella\u2019s new book on the fair, \u201cTomorrow-Land: The 1964-65 World\u2019s Fair and the Transformation of America\u201d (Lyons Press, 2014).\u201cThe fair marked the last time progress was seen as an unmitigated benefit,\u201d Mr. Tirella said in an interview. \u201cIt was the last cry of a widespread belief in technology \u2014 in a car, a computer or a toaster oven could save us.\u201dJust as the technological optimism of the 1939-40 fair was undercut by the arrival of World War II, the cheerful corporate enthusiasm of the 1964-65 version was countered by events outside the park. Civil unrest broke out in Harlem and Bedford Stuyvesant after police shot a young black man.But in August 1964, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King visited the fair with his family. He rode Ford\u2019s Magic Skyway with his children Yolanda and Martin III. Earlier, in the spring, he had declined a suggestion from other civil rights leaders for a protest at the fair, a planned \u201cstall in\u201d to disrupt area traffic.Racial tensions remained high. Mr. Tirella\u2019s book reports that one of the songs in Chrysler\u2019s pavilion became the focus of a brief controversy when someone noticed that the tune \u201cDem Bolts\u201d was a rendition of the black-face minstrel song, \u201cDem Bones.\u201dThe fair seemed to aim for political neutrality. Jacqueline Kennedy and her daughter, Caroline, attended \u2014 one of the family\u2019s first ventures into public after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, whose younger brother, Robert F. Kennedy, came through on his campaign for the Senate. Richard M. Nixon, a former vice president at the time, received a warm welcome from the crowds.Among the elements that physically survive is the Unisphere, the globelike sculpture that served as the thematic symbol of the fair \u2014 and occupied the spot held in 1939 by the earlier fair\u2019s Trylon and Perisphere theme structures.Part of the Chrysler display was incorporated into the New York Hall of Science; the rocket boosters have also been refurbished and kept on display.\u00a0A group of admirers hope to save the New York State Pavilion, designed by Philip Johnson. The site, now closed, will be open as a special event for the fair anniversary from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. on\u00a0April 22.\u00a0(In the 1997 film \u201cMen in Black,\u201d the battered towers of the New York State pavilion provided a UFO sight gag.)An article last Sunday about automotive exhibitions at the 1964 New York World\u2019s Fair misstated Richard Nixon\u2019s middle initial. It was M., not F.An article on April 13 about automakers\u2019 exhibits at the 1964 World\u2019s Fair misstated the location of rocket boosters on display.

{"Headline": "Health Care Nightmares", "Date": "2014-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen it comes to health reform, Republicans suffer from delusions of disaster. They know, just know, that the Affordable Care Act is doomed to utter failure, so failure is what they see, never mind the facts on the ground. But while Obamacare is looking like anything but a nightmare, there are indeed some nightmarish things happening on the health care front. For it turns out that there\u2019s a startling ugliness of spirit abroad in modern America \u2014 and health reform has brought that ugliness out into the open.But wait: What about all the people who lost their policies thanks to Obamacare? The answer is that this looks more than ever like a relatively small issue hyped by right-wing propaganda. RAND finds that fewer than a million people who previously had individual insurance became uninsured \u2014 and many of those transitions, one guesses, had nothing to do with Obamacare. It\u2019s worth noting that, so far, not one of the supposed horror stories touted in Koch-backed anti-reform advertisements has stood up to scrutiny, suggesting that real horror stories are rare.Republicans clearly have no idea how to respond to these developments. They can\u2019t offer any real alternative to Obamacare, because you can\u2019t achieve the good stuff in the Affordable Care Act, like coverage for people with pre-existing medical conditions, without also including the stuff they hate, the requirement that everyone buy insurance and the subsidies that make that requirement possible. Their political strategy has been to talk vaguely about replacing reform while waiting for its inevitable collapse. And what if reform doesn\u2019t collapse? They have no idea what to do.At the state level, however, Republican governors and legislators are still in a position to block the act\u2019s expansion of Medicaid, denying health care to millions of vulnerable Americans. And they have seized that opportunity with gusto: Most Republican-controlled states, totaling half the nation, have rejected Medicaid expansion. And it shows. The number of uninsured Americans is dropping much faster in states accepting Medicaid expansion than in states rejecting it.But nobody expects to see a lot of prominent Republicans declaring that rejecting Medicaid expansion is wrong, that caring for Americans in need is more important than scoring political points against the Obama administration. As I said, there\u2019s an extraordinary ugliness of spirit abroad in today\u2019s America, which health reform has brought out into the open.And that revelation, not reform itself \u2014 which is going pretty well \u2014 is the real Obamacare nightmare.

{"Headline": "The Vanishing", "Date": "2014-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFew American mysteries have proved more durable than the disappearance of Michael Rockefeller. In March of 1961, less than a year after his graduation from Harvard, this 22-year-old heir to the Rockefeller fortune flew to Dutch New Guinea to work on a documentary film and to collect artifacts for the Museum of Primitive Art, a Manhattan institution endowed by his father, New York\u2019s governor, Nelson Rockefeller. That November, the young man\u2019s catamaran capsized off the southwest coast of the Asmat tribal area. After a monthlong search, he was declared lost at sea, probably drowned. But a more lurid explanation has persisted: Rockefeller managed to swim to shore, only to be murdered \u2014 and eaten \u2014 by headhunters.In \u201cSavage Harvest: A Tale of Cannibals, Colonialism, and Michael Rockefeller\u2019s Tragic Quest for Primitive Art,\u201d Carl Hoffman sets out to solve the mystery. Hoffman has long been captivated by this tale of an American aristocrat who sought to immerse himself in one of the world\u2019s most hostile environments. \u201cI was a half-Jewish middle-class mutt with a public education, not a blue-blooded scion,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut Rockefeller\u2019s journey resonated with me. I knew what he was doing and why he was there, at least in part. It wasn\u2019t just to collect \u2018primitive art,\u2019 but to taste, smell, see, touch that world for himself.\u201d Hoffman retraced Rockefeller\u2019s journey into the jungles of New Guinea, tracked down people who remembered him and pored through the state archives looking for documents relating to his disappearance.\u201cSavage Harvest\u201d turns into a taut thriller, but it gets off to a shaky start. Cast adrift in the Arafura Sea, Rockefeller leaves a colleague clinging to their boat and swims toward shore with two empty gasoline canisters tied to his belt. \u201cHe even smiled a little,\u201d Hoffman writes, in an awkward leap of supposition. \u201cHe thought about the exhibition he wanted to mount in New York. . . . He was happy with how well he already knew these people; Asmat, this remotest corner of the world, had become his.\u201d As Hoffman tells it, minutes after washing up at the mouth of the Ewta River, Rockefeller is attacked by a band of Asmat warriors. The assailants spear the intruder through his rib cage and, \u201cwith one blow of an ax in the back of his neck,\u201d murder him. Then they butcher the body, cutting off his arms and legs and pulling out his entrails \u201cwith a vigorous jerk.\u201d The pieces of meat are set in a hot fire to roast.This grisly scene turns out to be entirely hypothetical, drawn from a 1959 article about Asmat rituals in American Anthropologist magazine. Why include it? \u201cIf they\u2019d killed Michael,\u201d Hoffman argues, \u201cthat was how it had been done.\u201dIt was during this period of upheaval that Michael Rockefeller arrived in New Guinea, using his connections to land a job as a sound engineer on a Harvard-sponsored documentary about the Dani tribes in the remote Grand Baliem Valley. The experience was liberating. \u201cWhat was important was right here \u2014 a world of sweating, naked bodies, of feasts and smoke-filled huts, of pigs and pig grease,\u201d Hoffman writes. \u201cHere, at last, he was free from social conventions. Free from being a Rockefeller.\u201dWithin days of Rockefeller\u2019s disappearance, rumors began circulating that he had met a ghastly death. Hoffman uncovers the correspondence of Cornelius van Kessel, a missionary who had won the trust of the Asmat. Van Kessel asserted that warriors from a village called Otsjanep had killed and devoured Rockefeller to avenge a mission, several years earlier, in which a Dutch official, backed by local forces, shot to death a number of high-ranking Asmat villagers. Van Kessel\u2019s superiors dismissed his account and spirited him back to the Netherlands. One colonial official tracked down a skull and bones that were said to be Rockefeller\u2019s remains, but they disappeared without being tested.Why would there have been a cover-up? In Hoffman\u2019s persuasive telling, the Dutch were about to relinquish control over New Guinea, and they were anxious to show the world they were leaving behind a civilized society. \u201cEmphasize modern development of Dutch New Guinea as opposed to picturesque primitivity of south coast and interior,\u201d the Dutch minister of the interior wrote to his local representatives in a cable Hoffman uncovered. The prospect of meting out \u00admodern-style justice to Stone Age killers may also have proved daunting. And the sensitivities of the Rockefeller family were certainly taken into account. The New York governor and Michael\u2019s twin sister, Mary, held a poignant vigil, surrounded by members of the international media, in a New Guinea backwater far from the search area. After Michael was declared lost, they refrained from public comment on his disappearance. \u201cThe family refuses to believe any version of the story beyond his drowning,\u201d Peter Matthiessen, a close friend of Mary\u2019s, told Hoffman.In this book, Hoffman goes further than anyone in describing the charged political backdrop and the dynamics of Asmat society that surrounded Rockefeller\u2019s disappearance. He also builds a strong case for cannibalism \u2014 though the truth will probably never be known with absolute certainty. Locals promise to hand over Rockefeller\u2019s spectacles in exchange for $1,000, then give him a pair of \u201c1990s-style plastic wraparound sunglasses\u201d instead. Toward the end of the book, he ventures up the Ewta River, hoping to live within the community for a month and somehow elicit a confession. But Hoffman gets the cold shoulder and senses that the villagers are guarding a terrible secret. As he makes clear in this gripping book, keeping the real story buried may have been the safest choice for everyone involved.SAVAGE HARVESTA Tale of Cannibals, Colonialism, and Michael Rockefeller\u2019s Tragic Quest for Primitive ArtBy Carl HoffmanIllustrated. 322 pp. William Morrow/HarperCollins Publishers. $26.99.Joshua Hammer, a freelance foreign correspondent based in Berlin, is the author of three nonfiction books.

{"Headline": "Ukraine Sends Force to Stem Unrest in East", "Date": "2014-04-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySLOVYANSK, Ukraine \u2014 The Ukrainian military landed airborne troops at an airport about 25 miles south of here on Tuesday, raising tensions with Russia in the opening phase of what the government in Kiev called a wider military operation to confront pro-Russian militants in the eastern part of the country.Later in the day, a column of armored personnel carriers flying Ukrainian flags approached Slovyansk from the north, parking for a time beside a highway and setting up a checkpoint. Of all the cities in the east, Slovyansk seemed to have fallen most completely under the control of pro-Russian separatists, who have erected massive defensive barricades outside the buildings they occupy.The Ukrainian authorities said the movements were the first in a campaign to drive separatists from government buildings in as many as 10 cities in eastern Ukraine. The initial steps suggested that the government in Kiev, which had been hesitant to do anything to play into Moscow\u2019s narrative that Russian-language speakers are in need of protection, was now willing to use the military to try to restore order in some places.In a conflict that has revealed deep, East-West fault lines, the White House praised the move as a measured step toward restoring law and order, while President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia told the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, in a phone call that he expected \u201cclear condemnation\u201d of the \u201canti-constitutional\u201d operation by the international community. The Russian stock market fell by 3 percent on war jitters.At the small military air base in the town of Kramatorsk, Ukrainian soldiers quickly took control, holding at bay separatists who had surrounded the field\u2019s perimeter, which is guarded by a barbed wire fence. At some point the commander of the operation, Gen. Vasily Krutov, left the base to speak to a crowd of protesters numbering about 500 to urge them to disperse. But the crowd remained hostile, and when he turned to head back to the base he was roughed up, people in the crowd said, shoved hard enough that his hat fell off.The crowd outside the air base then insulted and taunted the soldiers inside. \u201cGuys, fly home, we didn\u2019t invite you here,\u201d one man yelled.The situation, described by local reporters as a \u201cmob scene,\u201d persisted into the early evening, with the crowd occasionally surging forward through a gap in the fence and soldiers firing into the ground in front of those who approached too close. Members of the crowd said that at least two people were wounded by the shots.Russian television \u2014 which has consistently sought to play up grievances by pro-Russian activists who the West says are a tool of Russian intelligence \u2014 introduced its evening broadcast by announcing, \u201cThe illegal, criminal government in Kiev launches a war against its own people.\u201dIt repeatedly broadcast images of helicopters and a single warplane in the vicinity of the airport, where separatists had set up a roadblock outside the main entrance on Sunday. The Russian news media, citing members of the armed opposition to the government in Kiev, reported that several members of a pro-Russian militia had been wounded at the airfield in firefights with the Ukrainian military. Later, it also reported four fatalities in the vicinity of the airport.The Russian Foreign Ministry released a statement on Tuesday saying it was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d by the reports of casualties, which could not be independently confirmed and were denied even by pro-Russian activists at the airport.The checkpoint the Ukrainian military established on a highway north of Slovyansk provided a further sign that the operation this time represented more than just words. Speaking to reporters following the armored column, General Krutov delivered a sharp warning to any gunmen on the road ahead, saying, \u201cThey must be warned that if they do not lay down their arms, they will be destroyed.\u201dWhile there were no credible reports of casualties or even any sustained firefights, General Krutov later told The Associated Press that his forces had repelled a force of 30 men in green uniforms without insignia, shorthand for the unmarked Russian regulars who infiltrated and overran Crimea.The protesters at the airport said in interviews that they felt no allegiance or kinship to the government in Kiev and wanted to go their own way.\u201cAfter Maidan, the east of Ukraine felt outside the political process,\u201d said Vyachislav Filken, 47, a construction worker in the crowd, referring to the Kiev square where the uprising that led to a new government unfolded. \u201cThey wanted to put in their president and didn\u2019t ask us.\u201d Mr. Filken said that he wanted Ukraine to grant eastern regions autonomy, but that local people now felt emboldened and might demand simply to join Russia, as he said residents of Crimea had.Another said, \u201cWe want to live apart and be the bosses in our own land.\u201dAfter the operation began, masked gunmen at checkpoints in the city prohibited civilian vehicles from leaving Slovyansk through a main checkpoint, citing Ukrainian military movements on the highway outside the city. Cars were allowed out by side roads.The Ukrainian speaker of Parliament and acting president, Oleksandr V. Turchynov, told Parliament in Kiev that the operation \u201cwill be carried out in stages, and responsibly and in a balanced manner.\u201d He added, \u201cThe goal is the defense of citizens of Ukraine.\u201dMr. Turchynov, who has asserted in recent days that Russian soldiers have joined the Ukrainian militants who have seized police stations and the entire town of Slovyansk, said the country was confronting a \u201ccolossal danger,\u201d but offered the assurance that \u201cthere will be no civil war.\u201dIn a nod to the wide backing for pro-Russian groups here and in other parts of the east, Mr. Turchynov said that \u201calong with the Russian special forces and the terrorists there are hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian citizens in the Donbass who were tricked by Russian propaganda.\u201d The Donbass is a coal-mining region that includes the city of Donetsk.In the town, scores of armed men kept their hold on the City Hall and the police and domestic security service building. They have barricaded roads and, residents say, placed snipers on roofs.In a sign of the heightened tension, Ukraine seemed to teeter toward a run on bank deposits on Monday. The central bank was compelled to raise one of its key interest rates to 9.5 percent from 6.5 percent to slow the rapid slide of the national currency, the hryvnia, as people withdrew deposits and converted savings into hard currency. The sliding currency also accelerated inflation by increasing the costs of imported goods, exacerbating the difficulties faced by residents in the east, who complain that the new government is mismanaging the economy.Andrew Higgins contributed reporting from Kiev, Ukraine, and Andrew Roth and David M.

{"Headline": "Turkish Court Overturns Part of Law on Judiciary, Loosening Government\u2019s Grip ", "Date": "2014-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byISTANBUL \u2014 Turkey\u2019s highest court on Friday overturned the provision of a new law that gave the government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan greater control over the judiciary, a law that critics said harmed the country\u2019s separation of powers and was part of a broader effort on the part of Mr. Erdogan to push back against a corruption investigation.\u201cThe Constitutional Court proves that there is still a way out of autocracy,\u201d said Metin Feyzioglu, the chairman of the Turkish bar associations. As Mr. Erdogan has moved to take more control over the media, the police and courts, the result has been that many Turks have lost confidence in these institutions to carry out their duties independent of government pressure.\u201cI think the society, being inside such a pressure cooker, that the pressure gets so high from time to time that you need a security valve,\u201d Mr. Feyzioglu said. \u201cAnd the Constitutional Court acts like one.\u201dThe judicial law was regarded as Mr. Erdogan\u2019s most brazen power grab, legal experts say, because it gave control of the council that appoints prosecutors and judges in Turkey to the government. This was the most important \u2014 and controversial \u2014 element of the bill, which the court overturned. It left in place another provision that gives the government control over the justice academy, a state institution that trains judges and prosecutors.But there have been other power grabs, too, in the wake of the graft inquiry: a new law to censor the Internet; a proposed bill to expand the powers and immunities of Turkey\u2019s spy agency; and clampdowns on the news media and on social media sites, where numerous leaked recordings, apparently from the files of the corruption investigation, have been posted.But it was the judicial bill that empowered Mr. Erdogan in his fight against the corruption case, as he has sought to purge hundreds of prosecutors and judges who he believes are against him. Mr. Erdogan has cast the inquiry as the work of followers of the Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, who lives in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania, and whose adherents are said to be in top positions within the police and judiciary. The two men were once allies, but are now engaged in a bitter power struggle.Like they did recently when the court overturned the ban on Twitter, government officials criticized Friday\u2019s ruling, but said they would adhere to it.\u201cThe regulation we have prepared is a regulation that conforms with the Constitution,\u201d Bekir Bozdag, the justice minister, told reporters in Ankara, the Turkish capital. \u201cThe Constitutional Court\u2019s cancellation decision has not changed my opinion. But of course we will abide by the court\u2019s decision.\u201dAmid the continuing crisis the Turkish economy, booming in recent years, has suffered as foreign investors worried about instability have pulled money from the country. One opposition politician, in hailing the ruling as a win for democracy, also placed it in the context of the economy.\u201cEither you will be a state governed by the rule of law and capital will come with confidence,\u201d said Faik Oztrak, a member of the opposition Republican People\u2019s Party. \u201cOr, you will completely ignore the rule of law and you will have to find capital from abroad with very high interest rates. All this has a cost.\u201dCeylan Yeginsu and Sebnem Arsu contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stanford Star Makes Campus Her Stage", "Date": "2014-04-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySTANFORD, Calif. \u2014 Chiney Ogwumike was not yet a year old, standing contentedly in a baby walker next to her father, who was eating pizza while they watched television. Except that Ogwumike was not watching television. She was watching the slice of pizza in her dad\u2019s hand. She watched. And watched. Then she lurched forward and snatched the pizza.\u201cChiney is a planner \u2014 her mind never rests,\u201d said her mother, Ify. \u201cShe goes after things when she knows she\u2019s going to get it. It\u2019s always been like that.\u201dIt was what Ogwumike wanted, the capstone to her career after losing in the Round of 16 a year ago. But it was not simply a matter of snatching it. Rather, she got there, this season and on this night, by letting go \u2014 by letting her teammates share in the lifting. \u201cLast year, it was definitely Chiney and the Chinettes,\u201d Stanford Coach Tara VanDerveer said. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t tonight. Tonight, she had four teammates out there, whoever they were, that stepped up for her. They love her, they absolutely love her.\u201dTo suggest that Ogwumike is the heartbeat of the Cardinal, who are 34-3 entering Sunday\u2019s national semifinal against unbeaten Connecticut, is to underestimate the radiance of her personality. It carries far beyond the locker room.The campus, not just the court, is her stage.\u201cShe brings life to the court, she brings life to a classroom,\u201d said Jasmine Camp, a teammate and video collaborator. \u201cWherever she is, she brings this great energy and great light. She cracks jokes, she loves to dance. She\u2019s like that all the time. She\u2019s not two different personalities: on and off the court.\u201dIf Ogwumike\u2019s eloquence and charm have always been evident in her four years here, the departure of her sister, an all-American and the top pick in the W.N.B.A. draft two years ago, allowed her more space. There are two Chineys, her mother suggested, one who is more deferential in the presence of Nneka. The other has been more fully revealed.\u201cI feel as if I planted a small little plant that I bought and now it\u2019s a huge tree,\u201d said Nneka, who then laughed and added, \u201cWith branches going all over the place.\u201dSuch growth, of course, is what the college experience is supposed to be about. For Ogwumike, it has come away from the court, with encouragement from Rice, who nudged her to study abroad for her degree in international relations. She spent two months after last season interning in the petroleum ministry in Nigeria, where she also volunteered at a basketball camp. Ogwumike\u2019s parents emigrated from Nigeria, and they often return with their daughters to visit, but this was different.\u201cI went with a lot of preconceptions,\u201d Ogwumike said. \u201cYou think you know how the people are, how the government works, but I got to see it with my own eyes. You hear, here, that there is corruption in the government, and there is, but you see there are also people working hard to make it better. You look at how you can improve the system. Now I\u2019m looking at it like a world citizen instead of a girl who is in a fantasy land.\u201dA similar re-examination is what prompted the Ogwumikes to produce the \u201cNerd City Kids\u201d video. The \u201cRevenge of the Nerds\u201d theme, which began with the renaissance of the football team, has now turned into a universitywide branding effort, including the black glasses frames with white tape over the bridge that are sold at the campus bookstore. (Ogwumike said she made her own.)The question of what Stanford represents became a broader topic of debate in late January, when Sherman, a Stanford graduate, touched off a nationwide controversy with his unapologetic criticism of San Francisco 49ers receiver Michael Crabtree in a postgame interview after his team had won a Super Bowl berth.\u201cSherm being Sherm,\u201d Ogwumike said of the moment. \u201cIf you know him, if he beats you in a game of 21, he\u2019d react the same way. But a lot of people were baffled that he was a great student at Stanford. It was funny that the day after, we had Stanford forums on Richard Sherman where people were intellectually discussing what happened, which is so Stanford. It was a moment where you were redefining nerd.\u201dOgwumike, if she is a bit less impolitic than her football-playing friend, also considers herself to be an emotional player. And so it was comforting last week when Nneka sat in the first row, across the court from the team\u2019s benches, during the win over Tuesday against North Carolina and during the victory two days earlier against Penn State.Chiney said she liked to know exactly where her sister was sitting so she might be able to catch an encouraging glance. When Stanford left the court trailing at halftime against North Carolina \u2014 they were once behind by 13 points \u2014 Nneka met Chiney in the hallway near the locker room and offered an encouraging word.The Tar Heels had double- and triple-teamed Ogwumike, limiting her to four shots in the first half. They bumped her and built a fence around her, essentially cutting off passes to the post, where she is most effective. Nneka told her to work harder.\u201cShe was on me: \u2018Chiney you can post up on these kids,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ogwumike said. \u201cI feed off her energy, even though she\u2019s just sitting there.\u201dOgwumike had 16 of her 20 points, 6 of her 10 rebounds and both of her blocked shots in the second half as the Cardinal rallied. But she was not alone in the resurgence. Amber Orrange had kept the Cardinal afloat early, Bonnie Samuelson came off the bench to hit three 3-pointers, the freshman guard Lili Thompson hit the go-ahead jumper with 3 minutes 11 seconds left and Mikaela Ruef was the West Regional\u2019s most valuable player with 17 points and 9 rebounds.Afterward, Ogwumike wholly endorsed the award\u2019s going to Ruef. She said the Cardinal were at their best when the ball was zipping around in the triangle offense and she was simply an afterthought. That is surely how it will need to be if they are to have a chance against Connecticut, which thumped them, 76-57, in mid-November.Few give them a chance, but Ogwumike has been watching and planning, a national championship the one prize she has not gotten her hands on.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Confronts Consequences of Underestimating North Korean Leader", "Date": "2014-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Almost everything American intelligence agencies and North Korea-watchers thought they understood two years ago about Kim Jong-un, the North\u2019s young leader, turns out to have been wrong.The briefings given to President Obama after Mr. Kim inherited leadership said it was almost certain he would be kept in check by his more experienced uncle, Jang Song-thaek. Instead, Mr. Kim had his uncle and dozens of others executed.The early betting was also that Mr. Kim, who was briefly educated in Switzerland, would emphasize economic overhaul over expanding the nuclear and missile arsenals that were his father\u2019s and grandfather\u2019s legacy. Instead, the nuclear program has surged forward, and recent missile tests are demonstrating that after years of spectacular failures, the North\u2019s engineers are finally improving their aim. Their next big challenge is proving that an intercontinental missile they have shown only in mock-ups can reach America\u2019s shores.As a result, when Mr. Obama lands here on Friday on the second stop of his Asia tour, he will be confronting the question of whether his strategy of \u201cstrategic patience\u201d with the North has been overtaken by reality: an unpredictable, though calculating, ruler in Mr. Kim, who has proved to be more ruthless, aggressive and tactically skilled than anyone expected.\u201cWe have failed,\u201d said Evans J. R. Revere, who spent his State Department career trying various diplomatic strategies to stop the North. \u201cFor two decades our policy has been to keep the North Koreans from developing nuclear weapons. It\u2019s now clear there is no way they will give them up, no matter what sanctions we impose, no matter what we offer. So now what?\u201dIt is an assessment some of Mr. Obama\u2019s aides say they privately share, though for now the administration refuses to negotiate with the North until it first fulfills its oft-violated agreements to freeze its nuclear and missile programs. A recent effort inside the National Security Council to devise a new approach resulted in a flurry of papers and classified strategy sessions \u2014 and the conclusion that all the alternatives to the current course were worse.\u201cWe\u2019re stuck,\u201d one participant in the review said.The only place any real change is visible is in the military planning by South Korea and the United States, which maintains a shrunken force of 28,000 troops in the South. For the first time since the armistice in 1953, officials say, the contingency plan for a conflict with the North treats the nation as a nuclear-capable adversary, despite the administration\u2019s official refusal to acknowledge it as a de facto nuclear state. (What appear to be North Korea\u2019s preparations for a fourth nuclear test, perhaps in the coming days, seem intended to remove all doubt.) The latest revision of OpPlan 5029, the war plan for the Korean Peninsula, assumes that if a conflict broke out, the North would be able to deliver a crude nuclear weapon, though perhaps by truck or ship. American intelligence officials do not believe the North is yet able to shrink a bomb to a size that could fit on one of its Nodong missiles, the key breakthrough it needs. \u201cHe\u2019s put new effort into his nuclear program, missiles, special operations forces and long-range artillery,\u201d said Gen. Curtis M. Scaparrotti, who took over last fall as commander of United States Forces Korea and the United Nations Command here. \u201cThey are using more underground facilities. He\u2019s gone to school on how we operate.\u201dDefense officials say they now have less warning time on missile launchings than they had two or three years ago because Mr. Kim has put his resources into mobile launchers that are regularly moved from tunnel to tunnel, making them harder for American satellites to track.Although details of the revised plan are classified, officials have talked about elements of it. Since the North shelled a South Korean island and was blamed for sinking a South Korean warship four years ago, there are now extensive plans for immediately responding to and then de-escalating small attacks along the border regions. The North Korean forces remain numerically impressive at a million soldiers, but highly unimpressive when they train. The country is so poor that South Korean military officials say its pilots rarely have the gas to perform practice runs.But in recent interviews here and in Washington, a picture has emerged of Mr. Kim\u2019s new focus on inexpensive weaponry, from missile launchers to crude cyberweapons, that are hard to detect and harder to halt. Mr. Kim, who is believed to be 30 years old, has also nurtured his reputation for unpredictability, keeping adversaries on edge.Administration officials acknowledge they have largely left North Korea on the back burner while focusing on sanctions, cyberattacks and pressure on Iran, forcing it into negotiations. \u201cThe administration decided, consciously or implicitly, that Iran was more important and there was a greater prospect of getting something done,\u201d said Robert Einhorn, who ran the sanctions enforcement program against both countries until he left the State Department last year. \u201cWhile you can squeeze Iran and its oil money, it\u2019s much harder to squeeze North Korea\u201d while China continues its financial support. White House officials argue that focusing first on Iran made sense. Its program can still be halted before it gains a weapons ability, if that is Tehran\u2019s goal, and the administration believes that North Korea is less likely to set off a regional arms race. \u201cYou could argue that the best North Korea strategy now is to get a deal with Iran, and use it as a model for the North about what the world can look like,\u201d one senior administration official said.But others inside the administration fear that policy is too passive \u2014 and perhaps a prescription for a much larger North Korean arsenal by the time Mr. Obama leaves office. At the heart of the problem are dashed hopes that Mr. Kim would conclude that his grandfather\u2019s and father\u2019s pursuit of a nuclear ability was a Cold War relic, and that he would gradually steer the country to integration with the world economy. There was modest reason for optimism just months after Mr. Kim came to power in 2011 and struck yet another deal to freeze all his nuclear and missile activity, in return for a resumption of the episodic six-party talks with the United States and other nations. That brief effort ended when the North launched a satellite in honor of Mr. Kim\u2019s grandfather. Diplomacy froze for the next two years, with the administration unwilling to make concessions as previous administrations did only to find that the North was reneging on its promises.In recent months the Chinese have led an effort to restart diplomatic talks, and the United States has quietly met with the North. But the goal is unclear. To the United States, the purpose of the talks would be denuclearization; Mr. Kim\u2019s government has already declared that the one thing he will not do is give up his small nuclear arsenal, especially after seeing the United States help unseat Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya, who surrendered his own nuclear program in 2003. He was referring to the North\u2019s effort to expand the production of highly enriched uranium, which would give Mr. Kim a steadier, more plentiful supply of nuclear fuel than its past reliance on extracting plutonium from a small nuclear reactor. \u201cI\u2019m now convinced North Korea would prefer to collapse with nuclear weapons than try to survive without nuclear weapons,\u201d Chun Yung-woo, who recently served as the South\u2019s national security adviser, said this week. Yet the strategy Washington is pursuing is based on the opposite assumption.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Syrian War Takes Heavy Toll at a Crossroad of Cultures", "Date": "2014-04-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPalmyra JournalPALMYRA, Syria \u2014 The imposing stone colonnades still stand, below stark hills dotted with tombs. They still glow peach-pink in the afternoon sun, impassive, as if unimpressed by what is, after all, not their first war.Yet the war has left deeper, less obvious wounds. Illegal digging, long a problem at the many sprawling archaeological sites in Syria, has accelerated during three years of conflict. Grave robbers, some crude, others professional, have stolen numerous objects from Palmyra\u2019s tombs, museum officials say, sometimes sawing funeral friezes in two to make them easier to carry.Another casualty is the town of Tadmur, a jumble of concrete skirting the skeleton of the grander ancient city. Its tourist economy has shut down. And for local people, who consider themselves custodians of one of the world\u2019s most magnificent ancient sites, there is a greater, if less tangible, pain.They yearn for the days when Palmyra showed visitors from around the globe a vision of Syria that transcended the region\u2019s modern-day strife, as a crossroad of Greek, Roman, Persian and Islamic cultures. Archaeologists who worked among the ruins, now closed under military guard, still draw salaries. But they live bereft of an experience that had filled their days with beauty and meaning: excavating at dawn as the sunrise slowly lit the stones with gold.\u201cI feel as if I\u2019m dead,\u201d said Khalil al-Hariri, an archaeologist and the director of the Palmyra Museum, near the ruins. He spends his time waiting for government permission to resume his early-morning explorations, and worrying about the plundering, which he says is \u201cdestroying culture, destroying civilization.\u201dFighting came relatively late to this quiet desert town \u2014 after protesters were fired on and a prominent army officer fell out with the government, residents say \u2014 and flared sporadically for about a year. Many insurgents were locals who hid in the orchards of an oasis adjoining the ruins, residents and security officials said. Shelling and gunfire disrupted harvests and damaged trees.Insurgents occupied the Temple of Bel, museum officials said, and looted a modern guesthouse there. The Hotel Zenobia, built in 1900 among the ruins, where visitors like Agatha Christie woke up to the sunrise striking the columns, stands burned and wrecked.Now it is the Syrian Army using the ruins for military purposes. A 16th-century hilltop castle is off limits because, security officials said, \u201cthe army is there,\u201d raising concerns among residents that heavy equipment could damage it. Unesco says that artillery pieces and tanks have been positioned at the site.Nada al-Hassan, chief of Unesco\u2019s Arab states unit, said the biggest danger to Palmyra and other more remote sites was illegal digging by armed \u201cinternational mafias\u201d and, officials suspect, by insurgent and government fighters. She said that Unesco was working with Interpol, ordinary Syrians and the \u201ccommitted, technocratic\u201d staff of the Directorate General of Antiquities and Museums of Syria to track damage and recover stolen artifacts.\u201cNow is not the time to sell Syrian objects,\u201d Ms. Hassan said. \u201cAnything Syrian that is being sold now is suspicious.\u201dSyria\u2019s 32 archaeological museums have packed away their collections, but objects have been looted from at least three. In Raqqa, controlled by foreign-led Islamist groups, some objects appear to have been destroyed out of religious objections to their pagan provenance or depiction of living creatures, said Ahmad Deeb, the director of museums at the Ministry of Culture.\u201cThere are all sorts of deals,\u201d she said.Temples have stood in Palmyra for thousands of years, and human habitation dates back much further. Successive civilizations included the brief third-century rule of Queen Zenobia, who revolted against the Romans. Many residents, including Muslims, see that history as continuous with their own.\u201cInside us there is something very ancient and old,\u201d said Sheikh Ahmed Dagher Abu Ali, a member of Parliament, leading visitors through the otherwise empty museum to admire statues of Palmyra\u2019s female deity Allat and her Greek equivalent Athena. Protecting that heritage from extremist insurgents less than 20 miles to the east is \u201con our shoulders,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are responsible on behalf of all the world\u2019s civilizations.\u201dNow the Bedouins and camels are gone, the ruins empty but for soldiers perched on the stones, smoking cigarettes. In the museum, a security official in an unmarked army-green uniform sat silently at the desk of the director, Mr. Hariri, who sat to the side.Mr. Hariri showed off four first-century sculptures recently confiscated from thieves. Next, he pointed to friezes of bejeweled women hanging on the wall, his favorites, he said. Asked why, he answered, \u201cBecause they are beautiful.\u201dAn article last Thursday about the Syrian conflict\u2019s threat to the ancient city of Palmyra\u2019s archaeological treasures misidentified the auctioneer that is proposing to sell a cache of medieval Islamic coins. It is VCoin, an online company, not Sotheby\u2019s.

{"Headline": "Britain Can\u2019t Import Obama\u2019s Magic", "Date": "2014-04-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorLONDON \u2014 The last British general election was a disappointment all round. There was a change of government after 13 years of Labour Party rule but it was more a mercy killing of Gordon Brown\u2019s haggard administration than an endorsement of David Cameron\u2019s Conservatives, who failed to secure a majority in Parliament. Nobody won.And still nobody is winning. A British parliamentary election is quite unlike an American presidential contest. For one thing, voters can withhold outright victory, as they did in 2010 and likely will again in 2015. Opinion polls give Labour a slender lead over the Tories but on measures of who\u2019s trusted to run the economy and who\u2019s a more plausible leader, Mr. Cameron trumps Ed Miliband, Labour\u2019s new helmsman. So far, neither leader has shown the capacity to evangelize beyond his base.In search of a competitive edge, British politicians have gone shopping for talent in the New World. Mr. Cameron\u2019s chief strategist is an Australian. The Liberal Democrats \u2014 who prop up the Tories in coalition \u2014 are advised by a South African. But special excitement is reserved for the Americans. Labour ignited a media frenzy earlier this month by announcing it had hired the White House veteran, David Axelrod, as a \u201csenior strategic adviser\u201d \u2014 a riposte to the Conservatives\u2019 recruitment in August last year of Jim Messina, Barack Obama\u2019s former campaign chief.British commentators cooed at the news as if fireworks had crackled over Westminster. It was all an opportunity for London\u2019s political class to wallow in fanboy obsession with the game as it is played in Washington.The attraction is obvious. American campaigns are bigger, glossier and conducted in a language that monoglot Brits understand. Although European campaigns are often a better model, there is also a deep sense of ideological synchronicity that goes beyond the diplomatic \u201cspecial relationship.\u201d The alignment was neatest when Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan brought parallel conservative revolutions on either side of the Atlantic. Tony Blair\u2019s \u201cNew Labour\u201d was substantially modeled on Bill Clinton\u2019s New Democrats and that influence endures. Mr. Miliband uses the consultancy services of Stan Greenberg, Mr. Clinton\u2019s pollster.What makes the current iteration unusual is that both Labour and Tory leaders now crave association with a Democrat. In opposition, Mr. Cameron saw his principle task as moderating his party, which had acquired a reputation for flint-heartedness. This project overlapped with Republican idiom insofar as the Tory leader styled himself a \u201ccompassionate Conservative.\u201d Mr. Cameron\u2019s team also developed relations with John McCain in the run-up to 2008. That put them on the wrong side of British public opinion, which tended to view Mr. Obama as the heroic emblem of hope sweeping aside forces of bitter reaction.The Tory leader didn\u2019t repeat the mistake in 2012. His inner circle made little secret of their preference for Mr. Obama, much to the dismay of the Tory right.Some of Mr. Cameron\u2019s enthusiasm for Mr. Obama is cosmetic. The American president is cooler than any British politician and is still widely admired in Britain even as he loses luster at home. His \u201cno drama\u201d demeanor and flickers of deadpan humor translate smoothly. His aloofness, equivocations and policy bungles pass largely unnoticed. (For most British voters, the American debate over healthcare might as well be conducted in a foreign language.)What Mr. Obama represents to the British public bears little relation to the figure he has become in Washington. He is a political pin-up. Downing Street cherishes every opportunity to have Mr. Cameron pictured alongside the president: Dave and Barry flipping burgers at a barbecue at No. 10; Barry and Dave shooting the breeze at a college basketball game in Ohio.But Mr. Cameron had other reasons for rooting for Mr. Obama in 2012; a Democratic victory would prove that an incumbent could hold on to power even when the electorate was feeling a financial squeeze. The Tory high command was looking for a case study in blaming present woes on a past administration and they need Labour to stay as unforgiven for presiding over the British crash as Republicans were for ushering in the American one. Mr. Cameron\u2019s 2015 campaign will warn voters against handing the keys to the economy back to the guys who drove the nation into a ditch.Labour strategists find completely different sources of Obama inspiration. From the 2012 race they take the vilification of Mitt Romney as the candidate of corporate greed. Mr. Cameron\u2019s posh pedigree, his clique of moneyed chums and his record of cutting taxes for the wealthy give Mr. Miliband hope of Romneyfying the prime minister.Second, Mr. Miliband sees parallels between Mr. Obama\u2019s recent promises to \u201cbuild new ladders of opportunity into the middle class\u201d and his own pledges to address the plight of Britain\u2019s \u201csqueezed middle.\u201d The Labour leader is confident that Britain\u2019s return to growth won\u2019t provoke a surge of gratitude toward the government, because the bounty will be so unevenly shared.\u201cThe cold, hard fact is that even in the midst of recovery, too many Americans are working more than ever just to get by \u2014 let alone get ahead,\u201d Mr. Obama said in his 2014 State of the Union address. That speech was elevated to the status of a \u201csacred text\u201d in Mr. Miliband\u2019s office \u2014 according to a senior Labour official.But on Downing Street, the idea that Mr. Miliband can raid Mr. Obama\u2019s political closet is met with derision. He may like the same material but the difference in style and stature is extreme. The Labour leader is the bookish scion of a Marxist intellectual whose awkward manner is amplified by TV cameras. Mr. Cameron is no matinee idol, but his stage presence is much more assured.In reality, neither man has much in common with the American commander-in-chief. But any perception of proximity is valuable currency in British politics. Westminster is less interested in Mr. Obama as president than in Mr. Obama as campaign gold; the obsession is more about how he made Britain feel in 2008 than how he has governed since.Hiring Mr. Messina and Mr. Axelrod may be a rational investment, but there\u2019s also a hint of superstition, as if they have talismanic properties and proxy contact with the hem of Mr. Obama\u2019s robes can break the impasse by bestowing charisma on ailing candidates.But Mr. Miliband and Mr. Cameron suffer from a political malady that\u2019s all too indigenous to Britain. And it won\u2019t be cured by lip-synching the greatest hits of Obama \u2014 an off key rendition of \u201cyes we can.\u201d No. They can\u2019t.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Flash Boys\u2019 Fuels More Calls for a Tax on Trading", "Date": "2014-04-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s not every day that you find a fan club for new taxes, especially among economists and legal experts.But a burst of outrage in recent days generated by Michael Lewis\u2019s new book about the adverse consequences of high-frequency trading on Wall Street has revived support in some quarters for a tax on financial transactions, with backers arguing that a tiny surcharge on trades would have many benefits.\u201cIt kills three birds with one stone,\u201d said Lynn A. Stout, a professor at Cornell Law School, who has long followed issues of corporate governance and securities regulation. \u201cFrom a public policy perspective, it\u2019s a no-brainer.\u201dNot only would the tax reduce risk and volatility in the market, Professor Stout said, but it would also raise much-needed revenue for public coffers while making it modestly more expensive to engage in a practice that brings little overall economic benefit.Despite these arguments, and support from many economists on the left for what European advocates have called a \u201cRobin Hood tax,\u201d even backers acknowledge the idea faces a struggle to become law, especially in the United States but also more broadly in Europe.\u201cThe power of Wall Street can\u2019t be overestimated,\u201d said Dean Baker, co-director of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, and a longtime supporter of a financial transaction tax.The concept of a financial transaction tax is hardly new. The economist John Maynard Keynes floated the idea in the 1930s and it has antecedents dating at least as far back as the introduction of Britain\u2019s stamp duty in the late 17th century. Britain still imposes a modest tax, of 0.5 percent, on many share transactions, as do other countries at varying levels. Powered by high-speed computing and ultrafast fiber-optic connections, high-frequency trades take place in milliseconds, essentially anticipating big buy and sell orders to capture tiny variations in prices. Advocates say the practice improves liquidity by bringing more buyers and sellers into the market, in turn reducing the spread between bid and offer prices for individual stocks and lowering trading costs for everybody. Opponents of high-speed trading don\u2019t buy any of that, to say the least. Mr. Lewis says high-frequency trading is essentially \u201ccomputerized scalping\u201d that allows trading firms with the fastest algorithms and speediest machines to front-run other investors. The spreads are tiny, but multiplied billions of times those fractions of a cent add up rapidly, whether as a windfall for traders or slightly higher prices for ordinary investors. The stakes are not small, nor is the issue academic. High-frequency trading accounts for roughly half of all stock market volume in the United States, and the rise of the machines has been blamed for May 2010\u2019s \u201cflash crash,\u201d when the Dow Jones industrial average fell by 600 points in the blink of an eye, for no apparent reason, then recovered.The imposition of a financial transaction tax of three basis points, or three hundredths of a percent per trade, advocates say, would be small enough not to penalize investors but big enough to discourage high-frequency trading. On a trade valued at $30,000, it would yield $9 in taxes.\u201cIt eliminates the incentive to engage in this form of extremely short-term trading,\u201d Mr. Baker said. \u201cThey may be very sophisticated in terms of their computer skills, but trading half a second ahead isn\u2019t helping the economy.\u201d It could also be a big revenue raiser, helping to narrow the budget deficit with a minimal effect on the economy. Estimates vary depending on exactly what trades would be taxed and by how much, but it\u2019s a safe assumption that it could raise hundreds of billions of dollars over the course of a decade. Skeptics say a tax on financial transactions might seem appealing at first glance, but would not work so well in practice. Alan D. Viard, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, argues it would essentially be a tax on savings, hitting people who invest in the stock market via mutual funds and 401(k)s. It would also create plenty of incentives for avoidance, he argues, something Wall Street has always been adept at. But that\u2019s a long way off, especially in an election year in which rich donors and big corporations are expected to have more influence than ever. \u201cThis is a long-term project and we have the exercise of naked political power by Wall Street,\u201d Ms. Stout said. Whatever its advantages, she said, before any such tax becomes law, \u201cwe may need to have campaign finance reform first.\u201d videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Acceleration Is Forecast for Spending on Health", "Date": "2014-04-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneWASHINGTON \u2014 Standing before a roomful of economists, policy makers and health care experts earlier this month, Amitabh Chandra, director of Health Policy Research at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School of Government, closed a presentation about the slowdown in health care spending over the last decade by citing an article in The New York Times.\u201cChanges in the way doctors and hospitals are paid \u2014 how much and by whom \u2014 have begun to curb the steady rise of health care costs in the New York region,\u201d the article declared. \u201cCosts are still going up faster than overall inflation, but the annual rate of increase is the lowest in 21 years.\u201dIt is a sobering reminder that the recent improvements could wither away just as they did two decades ago.\u201cIt\u2019s very scary,\u201d Professor Chandra told me.At the very least, it suggests that health care reform is by no means over. The Affordable Care Act may well be on track to meeting its primary goal of providing coverage for most uninsured Americans and protecting everyone against the risk of losing their insurance. But for all its innovative proposals to flush waste out of the system, reining in health care spending still appears well beyond the grasp of Obamacare.\u201cWe have been consistently bending the cost curve over the last 20 years, but the kinds of things that we do don\u2019t tend to be permanent,\u201d said Charles Roehrig, who runs the Center for Sustainable Health Spending at the Altarum Institute, a nonprofit based in Washington. \u201cIt will take a lot of work just to stay on the same curve we have been on for a while.\u201dThe evolution of the American medical-industrial complex has been driven by two critical dynamics. The first is the development of new technologies. The second is our willingness to pay for them.Still, until recently, doctors prescribed them and we got them. Often, an insurer or the government picked up the bill, whether the treatment helped our health or not.With no incentive to say no, the medical industry has little cause to be cautious. And though stents seem to be on their way out for most people, the Next Big Thing is coming into focus. At the conference, which was sponsored by the Brookings Institution, there was much talk of proton beam accelerators for cancer treatment, which cost hundreds of millions of dollars to install yet offer no established advantages to patients. In 2010, nine facilities were operating, planned or under construction across the country. This year there are 20.Can this be stopped, or at least slowed? Forces encouraging restraint have not been very successful. Medicare has pushed cheaper generics to replace brand-name drugs. Nurse practitioners have taken over tasks formerly performed by more expensive doctors. But the savings have proved fleeting.The question is whether the innovations in the Affordable Care Act can consistently bend the cost curve.Most health care economists agree that the Affordable Care Act, along with other forces, will help reduce waste, pushing the industry to drop the \u201cfee for service\u201d model that encourages doctors and hospitals to spend more whether it is useful or not.David Cutler of Harvard points to studies that suggest that straightforward changes, such as improving the dismal management of American hospitals, could cut health care costs by 25 to 50 percent. \u201cGetting better is not rocket science,\u201d he said.But that optimism might be premature. Mr. Roehrig argues that the decade-long slowdown in spending growth reflects a response to the two recessions that provided the economic bookends to the first decade of the new century; not a fundamental shift in the way the system operates.During that period, employers pushed workers to take insurance with higher out-of-pocket payments, which discouraged use. Medicaid in financially troubled states has cut provider fees and limited access to high-cost services. And, of course, many unemployed workers who lost their company health insurance cut back on visits to the doctor.These effects, Mr. Roehrig noted, have by now mostly petered out. As the economy recovers, spending growth will resume its climb, reinforced even more by the understandable demands from the eight million newly insured Americans under the health law for services they couldn\u2019t afford previously. He forecasts that health spending will grow substantially faster than G.D.P. in the near future, but expects the gap to shrink gradually to below one percentage point over time. In the long run, he projects that health care spending could consume 30 percent of G.D.P.\u201cIt would be a mistake to assume that slow growth in health care spending will continue,\u201d they wrote, \u201cor that spending reflects high-value care and therefore, health care delivery reform is no longer an urgent priority.\u201dProfessor Chandra calls himself \u201cextremely optimistic\u201d about the government\u2019s efforts to move the health care industry away from the wasteful fee-for-service model. His forecast that health care spending will exceed G.D.P. growth by 1.2 percentage points may indeed be scary, but it amounts, in fact, to an amazing improvement over the status quo.Over the last 40 years or so, health care spending has been growing 2.4 percentage points faster than the economy, on average.But that slowdown still isn\u2019t good enough. By 2032, health care will consume almost a quarter of the nation\u2019s economic production, taking an even bigger bite from workers\u2019 wages and either forcing taxes up to pay the government\u2019s share, adding more to the national debt, or squeezing other important public services.So, if Americans really want to win the health care spending war, it may take more than reform. It may still take a revolution.Email: eporter@nytimes.com;\nTwitter: @portereduardo Advertisement"}

Economists are forecasting that employers added 200,000 jobs to nonfarm payrolls in March, according to a Reuters poll.The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 0.45 point to close at 16,572.55, while the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index lost 2.13 points, or 0.1 percent, to finish at 1,888.77. Both indexes are near their nominal record highs.Although the number of Americans filing new claims for state unemployment benefits increased last week, the underlying trend in the data continued to point to some strength in the labor market. Initial unemployment claims increased 16,000 to a seasonally adjusted 326,000, the Labor Department said. The four-week moving average for new claims, which irons out week-to-week volatility, remained near six-month lows. Claims were generally stable in March, supporting expectations of an acceleration in job growth during the month.The Nasdaq dropped 38.72 points, or 0.9 percent, to 4,237.74, as market outperformers in the Internet and biotechnology sectors lost ground, resuming a sell-off from March after some recent gains. The Nasdaq biotechnology index slid 2.7 percent.But some investors were optimistic that biotech stocks would rebound. \u201cThat\u2019s a buying opportunity, in our view,\u201d said Randy Warren, chief investment officer of Warren Financial Service, adding that those stocks would come roaring back. \u201cIt\u2019s not just going to have one good year and be done.\u201dTesla Motors, the electric-car maker, fell $4.89, or 2.1 percent, to $225.40, and Netflix, the media rental company, dropped $8.19, or 2.3 percent, to $354.69. Facebook shares tumbled $3.23, or 5.2 percent, to $59.49.On the economic front, the United States trade deficit unexpectedly widened in February as exports hit a five-month low, suggesting that first-quarter growth could be much weaker than anticipated.\u201cAt this point, it appears that growth will struggle to top 1 percent\u201d in the first quarter, said Peter D\u2019Antonio, an economist at Citigroup. The Commerce Department said the deficit on the trade balance increased 7.7 percent, to $42.3 billion, the largest since September 2013. Economists, who expected the trade deficit to narrow to $38.5 billion, said the wider gap could slice off as much as half a percentage point from first-quarter gross domestic product. It added about a percentage point to fourth-quarter G.D.P.A bright spot came from the services sector, where growth accelerated in March after being hampered by unusually cold weather, according to the Institute for Supply Management. Its services sector index rose to 53.1 in March from a reading of 51.6 in February, which was the lowest since February 2010.Among the stocks on the move, Anadarko Petroleum jumped $12.55, or 14.5 percent, to $99.02 after the company agreed to pay the United States government more than $5.1 billion to restore thousands of sites polluted by toxins and compensate thousands of personal-injury claimants.Barnes & Noble plunged $2.99, or 13.5 percent, to $19.12 after Liberty Media said it had sold almost all of its stake in the company, ending a nearly three-year bet that the struggling retailer would emerge as a dominant seller of e-books.The S.&P. 500 now consists of 501 stocks, with the index including both Google\u2019s Class A and Class C shares after the company\u2019s special dividend. Google\u2019s Class A shares rose $3.40, or 0.6 percent, to $571.50 while its Class C shares gained $2.74, or 0.5 percent, to $569.74.In the bond market, interest rates were stable. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note remained unchanged at 2.80 percent, while its price increased 1/32 to 99 19/32.Advertisement"}

But we also believe that right now there are some questions in the marketplace that are causing a little bit of pause. We\u2019ve got a new mayor and there\u2019s still a great deal of uncertainty about what he wants to and can accomplish, and the impact on jobs and the overall economy in the city. He has raised some challenging issues that the development community has to meet.

There still is a block of vacancy that exists that still needs to be absorbed to a point where they can start pushing rents up more strongly. Depending on the locale, concessions packages can be $40 to $70 a square foot in tenant allowance. And depending on the length and term of lease and the rent you\u2019re paying, it could be six to 12 months of free rent. I think the vast majority of Americans today spend too much time with their face plastered in front of a screen, and so when people plop down into a chair it\u2019s very easy to just sit and look at their screen \u2014 and not connect with people.

{"Headline": "Seeking Silver Linings in Emerging Markets", "Date": "2014-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFundamentallyIN a quarter in which most stock funds eked out small gains, emerging-market equity portfolios couldn\u2019t even manage that much. Funds that invest broadly in the developing world fell 0.6 percent in the quarter, while Asia-Pacific portfolios sank more than 2 percent and Chinese-region funds dropped 5 percent. The results weren\u2019t unexpected. It wasn\u2019t just that China\u2019s economy appeared to be slowing even more than was previously thought. Starting in late February \u2014 when pro-Russian forces began taking control of the Crimean peninsula, leading to Moscow\u2019s annexation of that part of Ukraine \u2014 Russian stocks lost as much as a fifth of their value and the group ended the quarter down roughly 14 percent. Now there are growing concerns that Western sanctions and rising borrowing costs could push Russia, the world\u2019s eighth-biggest economy, into a recession.Yet Mr. McClone and other global money managers advise investors not to panic. Russian stocks represent only about 5 percent of the total holdings of a typical emerging-market fund. And many money managers doubt that Russia\u2019s move against Ukraine will ultimately be viewed as an emerging-market crisis. Some investors, in fact, wonder if the negative headlines coming out of Russia \u2014 as well as the unrelated problems in China \u2014 could be the cathartic events needed to lead contrarian investors back to emerging markets. It\u2019s too soon to tell. But bargain-minded investors are slowly making their way back in guarded ways. Mr. Maxwell\u2019s fund is allowed to hold as much as 15 percent of its assets directly in emerging-market shares. Last year, when the Federal Reserve in the United States began discussing plans to taper its stimulus efforts, the fund\u2019s developing-world stake fell to a five-year low of about 6 percent.But after the Fed discussion set off a decline in emerging-markets shares, Mr. Maxwell built his developing-market stake back up to around 13 percent. Part of the allure is valuations, he said. At the end of the first quarter, the MSCI Emerging Markets Index traded at a price-to-earnings ratio of around 10, lower than the historical average of around 14. And compared with global stocks in general, emerging-market shares are cheaper today than they were during the financial crisis, when investors fled many speculative assets.\u201cWe know that things aren\u2019t going great in these regions,\u201d he said, \u201cbut right now you\u2019re being paid to take risks in the emerging markets.\u201d Still, Mr. Maxwell says he is playing it safe. \u201cI want to be able to get out without driving the stocks down,\u201d he said. As a result, he focuses his bets on what he calls \u201cdeveloping\u201d emerging markets \u2014 economies that are among the most mature and closest to being considered a developed-market play. This group consists of China, South Korea, Brazil and Mexico, he said.These markets are not only home to a growing middle class of consumers but they also \u201coffer investors liquidity,\u201d Mr. Maxwell said.\u201cThis is a cyclical correction,\u201d he said, adding that until the process worked its way through and emerging-markets fundamentals improved, \u201cit\u2019s going to be bumpy.\u201dHe suggests focusing on countries with current-account surpluses, as these nations tend to have more stable currencies and aren\u2019t reliant on foreign capital. These are markets like South Korea, the Philippines and Taiwan. One of his fund\u2019s top holdings is Genting, a Malaysian resort and casino company with a strong balance sheet and cash flow. The company, with operations throughout Asia but also in Britain, has returned roughly 16 percent, annualized, for the last five years. Yet the stock still traded at a modest P/E ratio of less than 12 at the end of the first quarter.\u201cWe want a good business that\u2019s still finding ways to improve and management that\u2019s with shareholders,\u201d Mr. Winters said. \u201cBut we still need the stocks to represent good values.\u201dIndonesia is another example. Like many emerging-market countries, it faced a rapidly weakening currency after the Fed\u2019s tapering announcement last year. That drove interest rates higher and threatened growth. Yet lately, Indonesia has begun running big trade surpluses that have bolstered growth and strengthened its currency, the rupiah. Not surprisingly, Indonesian stocks have benefited, surging 21 percent since the start of the year. \u201cYou can\u2019t think of the emerging markets as a block so much,\u201d Mr. Ruff said. One of his fund\u2019s biggest holdings is Jasmine International, a broadband provider based in Thailand. That antigovernment protesters are pushing to impeach the prime minister there raises concerns, he said, but demand for Wi-Fi in Thai homes has still doubled in recent years. \u201cThis is an individual stock story that we think can overcome some challenges and the difficult political climate in Thailand,\u201d he said. To be sure, some investors may not want to invest in nations backed by military regimes.But investors can pick their spots, said Mr. McClone at William Blair, noting: \u201cYou just can\u2019t think of the asset class as homogeneous anymore.\u201dPAUL J.

{"Headline": "Errors in Inquiry on Rape Allegations Against FSU\u2019s Jameis Winston", "Date": "2014-04-16", "News": "Advertisement\nApril 16, 2014Tallahassee, Fla. \u2014 Early on the morning of Dec. 7, 2012, a freshman at Florida State University reported that she had been raped by a stranger somewhere off campus after a night of drinking at a popular Tallahassee bar called Potbelly\u2019s.As she gave her account to the police, several bruises began to appear, indicating recent trauma. Tests would later find semen on her underwear.For nearly a year, the events of that evening remained a well-kept secret until the woman\u2019s allegations burst into the open, roiling the university and threatening a prized asset: Jameis Winston, one of the marquee names of college football.Three weeks after Mr. Winston was publicly identified as the suspect, the storm had passed. The local prosecutor announced that he lacked the evidence to charge Mr. Winston with rape. The quarterback would go on to win the Heisman Trophy and lead Florida State to the national championship.In his announcement, the prosecutor, William N. Meggs, acknowledged a number of shortcomings in the police investigation. In fact, an examination by The New York Times has found that there was virtually no investigation at all, either by the police or the university.The police did not follow the obvious leads that would have quickly identified the suspect as well as witnesses, one of whom videotaped part of the sexual encounter. After the accuser identified Mr. Winston as her assailant, the police did not even attempt to interview him for nearly two weeks and never obtained his DNA.The detective handling the case waited two months to write his first report and then prematurely suspended his inquiry without informing the accuser. By the time the prosecutor got the case, important evidence had disappeared, including the video of the sexual act.\u201cThey just missed all the basic fundamental stuff that you are supposed to do,\u201d Mr. Meggs said in a recent interview. Even so, he cautioned, a better investigation might have yielded the same result.The case has unfolded as colleges and universities across the country are facing rising criticism over how they deal with sexual assault, as well as questions about whether athletes sometimes receive preferential treatment. The Times\u2019s examination \u2014 based on police and university records, as well as interviews with people close to the case, including lawyers and sexual assault experts \u2014 found that, in the Winston case, Florida State did little to determine what had happened.University administrators, in apparent violation of federal law, did not promptly investigate either the rape accusation or the witness\u2019s admission that he had videotaped part of the encounter.Records show that Florida State\u2019s athletic department knew about the rape accusation early on, in January 2013, when the assistant athletic director called the police to inquire about the case. Even so, the university did nothing about it, allowing Mr. Winston to play the full season without having to answer any questions. After the championship game, in January 2014, university officials asked Mr. Winston to discuss the case, but he declined on advice of his lawyer.When The Times asked Mr. Winston for an interview, an Atlanta lawyer advising his family, David Cornwell, responded, \u201cWe don\u2019t need an investigation, thorough or otherwise, to know that Jameis did not sexually assault this young lady.\u201d Mr. Cornwell, who has represented major sports figures and the N.F.L., added, \u201cJameis has never sexually assaulted anybody.\u201dMr. Winston has previously acknowledged having sex with his accuser but said it was consensual. His account has been supported by two friends from the football team who were with him that night, Chris Casher, who took the video, and Ronald Darby.A month before the rape accusation became public, the university\u2019s victim advocate learned that a second woman had sought counseling after a sexual encounter with Mr. Winston, according to the prosecutor\u2019s office. The woman did not call it rape \u2014 she did not say \u201cno.\u201d But the encounter, not previously reported, \u201cwas of such a nature that she felt violated or felt that she needed to seek some type of counseling for her emotions about the experience,\u201d according to Georgia Cappleman, the chief assistant state attorney, who said she had spoken with the advocate but not with the woman.The victim advocate was concerned enough about the episode to have alerted Mr. Winston\u2019s first accuser. Ms. Cappleman said that based on what she was told, a crime had not been committed. Nonetheless, Ms. Cappleman said she found the encounter troubling, because it \u201csheds some light on the way Mr. Winston operates\u201d and on what may be \u201ca recurring problem rather than some type of misunderstanding that occurred in an isolated situation.\u201dMr. Cornwell called her comments \u201cout of bounds,\u201d adding, \u201cI\u2019m not interested in a prosecutor expressing an opinion based on a personal moral compass.\u201dInvestigators showed little interest in finding out what happened. They delayed talking to witnesses, interviewing Mr. Winston and collecting his DNA.Nine months passDec. 7Jan. 10Jan. 23Feb. 11Nov. 14Dec. 5The university, after initially speaking with The Times, recently stopped doing so. A university spokeswoman, Browning Brooks, said she could not discuss specific cases because of privacy laws but issued a statement, saying that the university\u2019s \u201ccode of conduct process has worked well for the vast majority of sexual assault cases\u201d and has \u201cprovided victims with the emotional and procedural help they need.\u201dOn Feb. 13, before the university stopped granting interviews, Rachel Bukanc, an assistant dean who oversees student conduct issues, said she knew of no student who had secretly videotaped sex. After The Times questioned that response, the university began an inquiry and recently charged Mr. Casher with a student-code violation for taking the video. Mr. Darby has also been cited in connection with the episode.It would be difficult to overstate the importance of football to Florida State and its hometown. In Tallahassee, rooting for the Seminoles is a matter of identity and economy. The 2013 championship season generated millions of dollars for the athletic department and city businesses, and favorable publicity beyond measure.Patricia A. Carroll, a lawyer for Mr. Winston\u2019s accuser, said the police investigator who handled the case, Scott Angulo, told her that because Tallahassee was a big football town, her client would be \u201craked over the coals\u201d if she pursued the case.Officer Angulo has done private security work for the Seminole Boosters, a nonprofit organization, with nearly $150 million in assets, that is the primary financier of Florida State athletics, according to records and a lawyer for the boosters. It also paid roughly a quarter of the $602,000 salary of the university president, Eric Barron, who was recently named president of Penn State.The Tallahassee police declined to make Officer Angulo available for an interview, but his report states that he suspended the investigation because the accuser was uncooperative, which she denies.The case came at a time of turmoil for the Tallahassee police. In March 2013, a grand jury investigating police misconduct in an unrelated matter called police supervision \u201ccareless, uncaring, cavalier and incompetent.\u201d The grand jury said supervisory deficiencies were so deeply ingrained that the city police, which has more than 350 sworn officers, should merge with the sheriff\u2019s department, with the sheriff assuming overall control.Late last year, Mr. Winston\u2019s accuser and another Florida State student filed internal-affairs complaints, charging that Tallahassee police officers had investigated them, rather than the accused, and then prematurely dropped their cases.\u201cMy attorney\u2019s repeated calls to Tallahassee Police Department prove that I had not dropped the case,\u201d Mr. Winston\u2019s accuser wrote in her Dec. 19 complaint.Two days earlier, the other student had written, \u201cWhy did the detective insist my case was closed and refused to answer calls and emails?\u201d She added, \u201cI am SO ANGRY!\u201dBoth complaints were quickly dismissed.Potbelly\u2019s is a classic campus bar: big and boisterous, a place to drink, dance and mingle inside or at a tiki bar outside. A Thursday tradition, Purgatory at Potbelly\u2019s, allows students to drink all the alcohol they want for $10 from 9 p.m. to midnight.On Purgatory Thursday, Dec. 6, 2012, Mr. Winston\u2019s accuser, who at 19 could not legally buy alcohol, shared at least five mixed drinks with friends, according to police records. At one point, a man she did not know grabbed her arm, pulled her close and introduced himself as Chris, a football player. He said he was looking for his roommate, and when he requested her phone number, she gave it to him. She did not recall seeing him again that night.The woman did not appear drunk, her friends said. But after a stranger gave her a drink, she recounted, her memory became hazy and fragmented. Soon, she found herself in a taxi with three unfamiliar men, all of whom turned out to be Florida State football players.Jameis Winston was one of them. A redshirt freshman quarterback, 6 feet 4 inches and 235 pounds, Mr. Winston had been a prize recruit, well-known in football circles but not yet a widely recognizable name.Because of the young, combustible clientele, Potbelly\u2019s protects itself by operating more than 30 security cameras. If something untoward happens, the cameras are there to record it. They were in position to fill in the blanks from that evening, recording how the woman came to leave without her friends, her general behavior and the face of the man who gave her the final drink.Taxi records also contained a footprint for investigators to follow: The woman recalled that someone in the car swiped a Florida State student identification card to get a discounted fare.After partially blacking out, the woman said, she found herself in an apartment with a man on top of her, sexually assaulting her. She said she tried unsuccessfully to push him away, but he pinned down her arms. Meanwhile, according to her account, another man walked in and told her assailant to stop. He did not. Instead, she said, he carried her into the bathroom, locked the door and continued his assault.Afterward, the woman told investigators, the man put her on a bed, dressed her and drove her on a scooter to an intersection near her dormitory and dropped her off.Upon returning to her room, she posted a plea online for someone to call her. Two friends did. One was Jenna Weisberg, another Florida State student. \u201cI was awake and I called her and she was hysterically crying,\u201d Ms. Weisberg said. \u201c\u2018I think I just got raped,\u2019\u201d she recalled her saying. Ms. Weisberg drove immediately to the friend\u2019s dorm. Ms. Weisberg said her friend was reluctant to call the police because she did not \u201cwant anybody to be mad at her.\u201d Eventually she relented, and at 3:22 a.m., Ms. Weisberg called 911.A campus police officer responded, listened to the accuser\u2019s account and then drove her to the hospital for a sexual assault examination. Because the woman believed the encounter occurred off campus, a city police officer, Clayton Fallis, interviewed her next.Soon, Officer Angulo, an investigator with the special victims unit who joined the force in 2002, arrived at the hospital and took over the case. Again the woman began to recount what had happened, until the investigator, seeing she was tired, told her to go home and come to Police Headquarters later in the day.She returned, accompanied by a friend, Monique Kessler, who was with her at Potbelly\u2019s, and they recounted what they had seen and heard, including the encounter with Chris, the football player.Officer Angulo had three solid leads to identify the suspect: the name Chris, the bar\u2019s security cameras and the cab where a student identification card had been used.What the investigator did next \u2014 or did not do \u2014 would later confound prosecutors and muddied the outcome of the case.Officer Angulo\u2019s investigation was halting at best. His first report, filed more than two months after the encounter, includes no mention of trying to find Chris or looking at Potbelly\u2019s videotapes.Officer Angulo did contact the cab company, without success. \u201cThe GPS units on the vehicles are not precise enough to eliminate enough cabs to focus the search,\u201d he wrote. He then asked the cab company to email all drivers who had worked that night, with \u201cthe demographics of the passengers and the pickup location.\u201d No one responded, and there is no indication that he attempted to interview drivers.Again, Officer Angulo hesitated. Nearly two weeks passed before his backup investigator contacted Mr. Winston \u2014 by telephone, records show. \u201cWinston stated he had baseball practice but would call back later to set a time,\u201d Officer Angulo wrote. The police did get a response \u2014 from Mr. Winston\u2019s lawyer, Timothy Jansen, who said his client would not be speaking to anyone.With Mr. Winston identified, the next logical step would have been to quickly obtain his DNA. Officer Angulo decided against it. Ms. Carroll, the accuser\u2019s lawyer, said the officer told her that testing Mr. Winston\u2019s DNA might generate publicity. \u201cI specifically asked and he refused,\u201d Ms. Carroll said.Two parts of that statement struck Ms. Carroll as strange. The officer, she said, never informed her client that he had suspended his investigation, and her client never said she would not cooperate. She said that while her client was indeed concerned about the prospect of pressing her case against a star-in-waiting, \u201cat no time did we call him and tell him we don\u2019t want you to do an investigation.\u201d Her client, she added, simply wanted more information before deciding what to do.Such reluctance should not keep the police from investigating, according to Ms. Cappleman of the prosecutor\u2019s office.\u201cIt makes the most sense to me, if somebody comes in to report a violent crime, investigate it, and we\u2019ll talk about what to do with it after we\u2019ve collected the evidence and have the most thorough picture,\u201d she said. If an accuser later decides she does not want a trial, Ms. Cappleman added, her office might offer a suspect a better plea deal.Officer Angulo\u2019s investigation apparently stirred no concern within his department. His superior officer signed off on his work, records show.In the weeks that followed, not knowing the investigation had been suspended, Ms. Carroll called the police periodically to see if lab tests had come back. Sometimes, her calls were returned, she said, but not always.Early last October, a 19-year-old Florida State student was studying on a Saturday night while her roommates went drinking. She said they returned drunk, and a roommate\u2019s former boyfriend, also a student, raped her in her room.The student reported the encounter to the Tallahassee police. The episode had nothing to do with Mr. Winston, but it, too, raised questions about how the city police deal with rape accusations. The police response was so inappropriate, according to the father, that later on, in a complaint filed with the police, he compared it to the Winston inquiry, which had recently drawn criticism in the news media.The father, a part-time deputy sheriff in another county, said he was away on business when he called his daughter and found her crying and confused. With prodding, she disclosed that she had just spoken to the police about \u201ca situation,\u201d but would say no more. An officer had told her that \u201cit might be better not to inform me,\u201d her father said.Alarmed, he asked his wife to call. She did, and their daughter said she had been raped. The mother and a family friend, also a law enforcement officer, immediately drove more than two hours to Tallahassee. They found the daughter with what appeared to be choke marks on her neck.In a report, Officer Pate said he had offered the woman \u201cmany different avenues of help (victim advocate, female officer etc.). She refused them all.\u201dRape crisis counselors, while not speaking specifically about this case, say traumatized victims often experience memory problems. \u201cVictims themselves feel like they are losing their minds when they can\u2019t remember, when they remember fragments that don\u2019t seem to connect up,\u201d said Meg Baldwin, executive director of the Tallahassee-based Refuge House, a haven for victims of domestic violence and rape. \u201cThe interpretation so often is, well, she\u2019s lying, she\u2019s in any event an unreliable witness who won\u2019t be believed.\u201dOfficer Pate\u2019s blunt interviewing style did not help, the student said. \u201cThe first thing he asked me,\u201d she recounted, \u201cwas if I was sure this was rape or if I just didn\u2019t want a baby or wanted the morning after pill.\u201d He also made comments, she said, \u201clike, \u2018Are you sure you want to file a report? It will be very awkward, especially for a female.\u2019\u201dIn his complaint to the police, the father wrote that Officer Pate had suggested that an investigation \u201cwould be futile, as \u2018this kind of stuff happens all the time here.\u2019\u201d The family also said the police had focused more on the accuser than on the accused.Unlike in the Winston case, the police did ask prosecutors to review the evidence, but they declined to bring charges because statements from the roommates conflicted with the accuser\u2019s account. After receiving the family\u2019s request for an internal affairs investigation, the police found no basis for punishment.\u201cWhile no policy violation was identified, Officer Pate was counseled on the public perception of officer actions and speech during investigations,\u201d according to police documents. The department declined to make the officer available for an interview.The woman, an A student, dropped out of school, left the city and underwent therapy for extreme depression, according to the family. \u201cGoing to F.S.U. had been a longtime dream for her,\u201d her mother said.It was Wednesday of homecoming week last year and Florida State, ranked No. 2 in the nation with a 9-0 record, was preparing to play Syracuse. Mr. Winston, described by teammates as both playful and intense, had already thrown 26 touchdown passes, amassing 2,661 passing yards with a completion percentage just south of 70 percent. After his first game, an ESPN draft expert had identified him as a legitimate No. 1 choice in the 2015 N.F.L. draft. If Florida State was going to ascend to the national championship game on Jan. 6, it would do so on the arm and poise of Jameis Winston. The Heisman voting was but a month away, and his crowning as America\u2019s best college football player appeared all but certain.Then, suddenly, that glorious vision began to go out of focus.On Nov. 13, the Tallahassee police, responding to a public-records request from The Tampa Bay Times, released documents on the sexual assault case, setting off a frenzied scramble in the news media and prosecutor\u2019s office to learn what had happened.At one point, Mr. Casher said, he entered the room, but the woman told him to leave, got up to turn off the light and then tried to close the door. At no time, both men said, did she appear to be an unwilling participant. (The men did not respond to phone messages, conveyed through university officials, seeking comment.)Mr. Meggs immediately directed his staff to reinvestigate the case.In the recent interview, Mr. Meggs said he was surprised that the police had not quickly found Mr. Casher. \u201cHow long does it take to identify a freshman football player \u2014 about 10, 15, 16 seconds?\u201d he asked, adding, \u201cAnybody that looked at this case would say you get a report at 2 in the morning, by noon you could have had the defendant identified and talked to.\u201dWhy Officer Angulo had not asked to see the Potbelly\u2019s security video is unknown. A Times review of sexual assault complaints handled by the campus police last year found that in one case, officers asked for the Potbelly\u2019s video when they were trying to identify a suspected assailant who had been seen at the bar.As for not finding the taxi driver, \u201cI am convinced that we would have identified the cabdriver that night and had an interview with him,\u201d Mr. Meggs said. \u201cDon\u2019t know what we would have learned, but we would have learned the truth. I am also convinced that had it been done properly, we would have had the video from Potbelly\u2019s.\u201dBy the time the prosecutor asked for that video, the tape had long since been recycled.Unlike the police, prosecutors said they interviewed every cabdriver they could find who had worked that night, but they turned up no new information. Mr. Meggs said that while his investigators probably spoke to the driver they were seeking, \u201cat 11 months later, maybe he didn\u2019t remember, maybe he didn\u2019t want to remember.\u201dMr. Meggs said he was shocked that the police investigator\u2019s first attempt to contact Mr. Winston was by telephone. \u201cHe says, \u2018I have baseball practice, I\u2019ll get with you later,\u2019\u201d Mr. Meggs said. That call allowed Mr. Winston to hire a lawyer who told him not to talk.\u201cIt\u2019s insane to call a suspect on the phone,\u201d Mr. Meggs said. \u201cFirst off, you don\u2019t know who you are talking to.\u201d He said he would have gone straight to the baseball field. \u201cIf you walked up to Jameis Winston in the middle of baseball practice and said, \u2018Come here, son, I need to talk to you,\u2019 he would have said, \u2018Yes, sir.\u2019\u201dMr. Meggs added: \u201cHe\u2019s not in custody, you don\u2019t have to read him his rights. He might have said, \u2018I didn\u2019t have sex that night.\u2019\u201dOnly after the prosecutor took over the case did the authorities obtain Mr. Winston\u2019s DNA. It was a match to DNA found on the accuser\u2019s clothing.Belatedly, Officer Angulo and his backup were asked to conduct a crucial interview \u2014 to question Mr. Casher about the events of Dec. 7, 2012.Mr. Casher made a startling admission: he had secretly videotaped part of the sexual encounter through the partly opened bedroom door, and deleted the video from his phone a couple of days later. Had the police found him quickly, they might have obtained that video.Mr. Casher had never mentioned the video in the affidavit he submitted with the help of Mr. Winston\u2019s lawyer. Even so, officers did not ask why he had omitted that important fact, why he had deleted the video or whether he had shared it with anyone. And though Mr. Casher said he had a new phone, the officers did not ask what he did with the old one.Neither the police nor the prosecutor\u2019s office subpoenaed the phone records of Mr. Casher, Mr. Darby or Mr. Winston \u2014 even though they investigated all electronic communications to and from the accuser around the time of the sexual encounter.The failure to seek similar electronic communications from the three football players surprised one former assistant state attorney, who prosecuted a Florida State football player on a rape charge a decade ago. \u201cWhy that was done, I don\u2019t really know the answer to that,\u201d said the former prosecutor, Adam Ruiz. \u201cTo me, that\u2019s a no-brainer.\u201dMr. Ruiz said his children, aged 7 to 21, all had iPhones, and even for something as mundane as rain: \u201cYou\u2019re texting 30 people about it. I can\u2019t imagine there would not have been something coming off that cellphone after the incident.\u201dThree weeks after it began, with evidence lost and memories faded, the state attorney\u2019s investigation was over. \u201cI have personal concerns about what happened in that room that night,\u201d Ms. Cappleman said, \u201cbut that\u2019s completely separate from whether I\u2019m able to prove a crime occurred.\u201dThe news that Mr. Winston had been accused of rape moved through campus like an electric charge. On social media, the discussion quickly lost any semblance of civility, prompting one female student to send an email expressing her anger to Mary Coburn, vice president for student affairs.\u201cAll day every day I am bombarded with messages of hatred for the alleged victim,\u201d the woman wrote. \u201cI am sad and ashamed to be part of a student body that is quick to support a man who is accused of sexual assault, simply because he is a good football player, and even quicker to condemn the alleged victim of the crime as a liar.\u201dMs. Coburn replied: \u201cI agree with you and have been thinking about how we address the ugliness that has been circulating.\u201d She promised to gather a group of students in January to discuss the problem.This knowledge should have set off an inquiry by the university. According to federal rules, any athletic department official who learns of possible sexual misconduct is required to pass it on to school administrators. Florida State declined to respond when asked if top officials, including the university president, had been informed of the encounter.\u201cWhy did the school not even attempt to investigate the matter until after the football season?\u201d said John Clune, another lawyer for the accuser.His client filed a complaint with the civil rights office of the federal Department of Education, and the agency recently agreed to examine whether Florida State properly responds to sexual violence complaints. The inquiry was first reported by USA Today.It was not just the Winston case that was causing concern on campus. In January, the mother of a student who said she had been sexually battered at a fraternity the previous April contacted the campus police asking why the university \u201cdoesn\u2019t do more to protect women from rape,\u201d records show. The police response was to inform the mother of a self-defense class for students.That did not satisfy the mother, who told an officer, \u201cThe university should take a harder stand on the men who are identified as having committed rapes.\u201d According to the campus police, the student had said she did not want officers to investigate the case.Determining the extent of the problem is difficult, because so many students are reluctant to report sexual assaults. President Obama, in announcing the creation of a task force earlier this year to protect students from sexual assault, cited surveys showing that one in five women is a victim of \u201cattempted or completed sexual violence\u201d while in college.\u201cI\u2019d like to see a higher reporting rate so that we can address the problem,\u201d said Ms. Cappleman of the state attorney\u2019s office. \u201cA lot of these cases go unreported, so having a higher reporting rate will lead to a higher success rate of prosecution and hopefully a deterring effect.\u201dIf cases are reported, the university is obligated to investigate, regardless of what the police do. According to the federal Education Department\u2019s civil rights office, \u201ca school that knows, or reasonably should know\u201d about sexual harassment, including rape, \u201cmust promptly investigate to determine what occurred and then take appropriate steps to resolve the situation.\u201dUniversities must also inform the federal government of reported sexual assaults on their property or in the immediate vicinity.Florida State has not yet reported its 2013 sexual assault numbers, but in the three previous years it reported four, five and five. Those numbers place Florida State in the lower half nationwide of similar-size public universities, according to federal data analyzed by The Times. The number of reported rapes can be affected by the percentage of students who live off campus.8380Reported forciblesexual assaults2010 to 2012Reporting Sexual Assaults60Florida State University reported few forcible sexual assaults compared to similarly sized public universities.4020142California StateUniversity-FullertonFlorida StateUniversityUniversity ofCalifornia-BerkeleyNote: Includes four-year public universities with total 2012 enrollments between 30,000 and 60,000 students.

Mr. Ruiz, the former prosecutor who handled the case for the state attorney\u2019s office, recalled that the coach at the time, the revered Bobby Bowden, attempted to convince him that a crime had not occurred. A jury eventually acquitted the player.\u201cI learned quickly what football meant in the South,\u201d said Mr. Ruiz, who grew up in New York State. \u201cClearly, it meant a lot. And with respect to this case I learned that keeping players on the field was a priority.\u201d\u00a9 2014 The New York Times CompanyAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Greece Sees Fragile Signs of Recovery", "Date": "2014-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical EconomyMost Greeks know the term vicious cycle \u2014 or favlos kyklos. But when you ask them the Greek phrase for virtuous cycle, they often struggle to find the term or even deny it exists.After six years of recession, which have shrunk the Greek economy by a quarter and left the country with an unemployment rate of 27 percent, it is not surprising that vicious cycles loom large in the Greek psyche. But there is also a Greek expression for virtuous cycle \u2014 enaretos kyklos \u2014 and the country may be beginning to enjoy one.Athens returned to the bond market last week with the issue of 3 billion euros, or about $4.2 billion, worth of five-year paper. The country\u2019s banks are also now able to sell shares.The challenge is to take this positive momentum in financial markets and use it to build on the tentative signs of an economic recovery. Confidence can be infectious. It is not just investors who are giving Athens the thumbs up. So are Greece\u2019s euro zone partners, led by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who was in Athens on Friday. The main channel through which a virtuous cycle could operate is investment, which will create badly needed jobs.As banks find it easier to fund themselves, they will start supplying more credit to local companies, which have been starved of cash. Foreigners are also starting to invest, now that Greece has lower wages and cheaper property. Prime Minister Antonis Samaras plans to present the country\u2019s \u201cgrowth model\u201d this month to build on this potential. The idea is that the Greek economy of the future will be less focused on consumption and more on investment and exports. It will seek to position itself as a supplier of higher-end tourism, logistics, transport and food.But the emergence of such a virtuous cycle is not guaranteed. As ever, the main risk is political: either that Mr. Samaras\u2019s fragile center-right coalition government will fall, or that it will lack the will to push through the further structural overhauls that are needed to change the country for good.Unfortunately, the possibility that the government will fall cannot be discounted, given Mr. Samaras\u2019s habit of damaging himself. The latest self-inflicted wound was sustained this month, when his chief of staff was caught on video telling the spokesman of Golden Dawn, a far-right political party, that the government had intervened with the judiciary to put the leadership of Golden Dawn behind bars. At the very least, this incident shows Mr. Samaras lacked judgment in keeping such a man so close to him for so long.That said, the government will probably survive this particular wound. There is even a chance that it will continue in power until June 2016, the latest a general election can be held. The main hurdle is the election of a new president in March 2015. Under the Greek Constitution, 60 percent of members of Parliament have to approve the choice; otherwise there must be a new general election. The problem is that Mr. Samaras can count on little more than 50 percent. Fortunately, he seems prepared to propose a center-left candidate in the hope of gathering the extra 10 percent required.Another piece of good news is that an opposition victory in the next general election would not be as scary as it would have been a couple of years ago. The radical left Syriza party still has populist plans \u2014 like rehiring laid-off public sector workers. But some of its lawmakers are moderating their views. What is more, Syriza is unlikely to be able to govern on its own. A possible partner is an entirely new party, To Potami, which is now third in the opinion polls (after Syriza and Mr. Samaras\u2019s New Democracy) though it did not even exist two months ago. To Potami is a center/center-left party that is pro-European and pro-market. Stavros Theodorakis, a former journalist who is To Potami\u2019s leader, says he wants to go after the big and small parasites that have held the country back for decades. To Potami\u2019s leaders have no political record; indeed, candidates are not allowed to be professional politicians. What is more, its plans are fuzzy. However, the party could be a moderating influence as a coalition partner for either Syriza or Mr. Samaras after the next elections.In the meantime, the big question is whether Mr. Samaras will implement fully the 300 actions he has agreed to with his euro zone partners and the International Monetary Fund. These are mainly to do with modernizing the country and liberalizing the economy.Mr. Samaras himself is not a natural reformer. But Yannis Stournaras, his finance minister, is. One concern is that Mr. Stournaras may be moved in a reshuffle. This is not necessarily a bad idea if Mr. Stournaras takes over as head of the central bank and is replaced by Stavros Papastavrou, Mr. Samaras\u2019s pro-market European adviser \u2014 as one of the rumors swirling around Greece has it.But it would be a crying shame if, having come so far, Greece did not finish the job. Or as the Greek expression goes: We\u2019ve eaten the donkey; let\u2019s not leave its tail.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Airbnb Host Welcomes Travelers From All Over", "Date": "2014-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe vacationing couple from Hattingen, Germany, showed up at Michael Naess\u2019s shipshape Queens apartment at the end of February. They had never met before. Nonetheless, here they were, digging into scrambled eggs, sipping coffee and chatting companionably with him on a Saturday morning. A German radio station, plucked from the Internet, rendered a flavor of home.The couple consisted of Dark Bontkowski, 52, a test driver for a German shock absorber maker, and his girlfriend, Martina Held, 48, a graphic designer for a financial newspaper. Mr. Bontkowski mentioned that, implausibly, he is a test driver who owns no car of his own. It was a needed expense reduction after he got divorced. He pedals to work on a bicycle, 22 miles each way.The couple was occupying Mr. Naess\u2019s spare bedroom for 10 days.Awkward, but not really awkward. They were paying guests.This is life as a hyperactive New York City \u201chost\u201d in that swelling substratum of the hospitality industry that unfolds in people\u2019s homes, all part of the modern world\u2019s sharing economy, spinning by with serial comings and goings.Some things to know about Mr. Naess. He is 37, Texas-born, tall and lean, a sunny, genial man with an endlessly repeating smile. He is one of close to 350,000 hosts worldwide on Airbnb, the short-term home rental company that matches those with rooms to let and those who want to rent them in 35,000 cities. In New York, Mr. Naess is among 15,000 hosts listed on Airbnb, and easily among the busiest individual ones.Some things to know about hosts. By and large, they do not accept strangers in their homes because they relish phenomenal amounts of company or washing soiled bedsheets. They do it for the money.When he bought his two-bedroom, two-bathroom condominium in Astoria at the end of 2009, Mr. Naess found himself financially pinched. He is a senior marketing manager at Carnegie Hall, where he focuses on seat retention (\u201cOnce we get someone in a seat, we want to get them back,\u201d he explained). His income is not nearly hedge fund large, and he shoulders more than half the mortgage payment on his mother\u2019s home (his sister picks up the rest) in Virginia.He had a rotation of roommates, before learning of Airbnb from a co-worker and gravitating to ephemeral visitors, beginning last June. He finds he can make more money and still possess days when his apartment is empty of unfamiliar humans.At first, as a novice host, he listed his room at $45 a night. Just about everyone wanted to stay at his place. He raised the rate to $65, and then to the current $85. He has a two-night minimum. During sluggish winter periods, he shaves his price, and also applies a discount for a stay of a week or more, and a larger one for a month. His apartment is new and clean and there are two bathrooms, so guests have their own. It\u2019s a quick subway trip into Manhattan.The desire to save money is what puts renters in Mr. Naess\u2019s apartment. Hotel prices in New York average about $300 a night. When Mr. Bontkowski and Ms. Held visited the city a year ago, they spent nearly double Mr. Naess\u2019s rate on a hotel, and they didn\u2019t even like the room. \u201cI asked my boss where do college students stay when they go to New York, and he told me about Airbnb,\u201d Ms. Held said.Mr. Naess has rare cranky moments when he is fatigued and wants to \u201csprawl on the couch and watch brainless TV\u201d while strangers he wishes would evaporate are tottering about. He reminds himself that international travelers are paying half of a Virginia mortgage.Airbnb charges guests a sliding fee of from 6 percent to 12 percent, depending on the price of the booking, and exacts 3 percent from the host. Mr. Naess gets a 1099 tax form from the company reporting his income. His running tally: $17,958.Guests may post reviews of hosts on the Airbnb site, and hosts may grade guests (these appraisals are only for fellow hosts). Mr. Naess has received flattering comments and has spoken agreeably of his lodgers. To the best of his knowledge, he has yet to welcome any thieves, smugglers, drunks, Ponzi schemers, arsonists, arms dealers or murderers.His renters frequently give Mr. Naess a gift: flowers, wine, cake \u2014 all appreciated. Mr. Bontkowski and Ms. Held brought him some Bavarian mustard and one evening prepared a goulash dinner. In Mr. Naess\u2019s guest book, Ms. Held drew a fetching picture of the Astoria skyline.One couple moving to New York stayed with him while looking for an apartment. When they found one on Roosevelt Island, they had Mr. Naess over for dinner.Two days after the German couple left, Giorgia Mazzi, 27, and her friend Federica Biancardi, 29, checked in from Rome. They were staying for nine days and then going on to Canc\u00fan for a week. Both are bartenders and the very definition of exuberant. It was nearly 2 a.m. on Saturday, March 8, when they reached Astoria. Mr. Naess waited with welcoming beers.In the interlude between guests, he had washed the sheets and towels. When visitors stay beyond a few days, a husband-and-wife cleaning team whips in to spruce up the entire apartment.Not long after their arrival, the women from Italy wanted to go to Brooklyn. They had a hankering for fried chicken, so Mr. Naess took them to a barbecue place. They started joking about cooking. Mr. Naess told them he made killer pasta, and they told him, listen, we\u2019re from Rome, get real. Nobody cooks better pasta than we do. They decided that in a few days they would have a cook-off.When you rent from Michael Naess, it feels as if you are staying with your favorite uncle, the one who dotes on you.His only rules are that you smoke only on the balcony (and deposit butts in the coffee can) and refrain from drugs and late-night parties. He tells renters to go ahead and indulge in his groceries. Make coffee. Use his milk. Eat his English muffins. (Most guests replace what they consume, though he doesn\u2019t mandate it.) He leaves a snack basket in the spare room with granola bars, peanuts and almonds. Often, he offers his visitors complimentary concert tickets he gets at work.He avoids showering at the same time as guests, so as not to reduce their water pressure. One frigid night, the heater went on the blink in the spare room when a pair of English travelers were there. Mr. Naess traded rooms with them.As part of the d\u00e9cor, he taped a subway map to the wall near his apartment\u2019s entrance, as a reference for guests. Once he had a Korean woman and her boyfriend who barely spoke English, and it was hard to give them directions, so he resorted to Google\u2019s online translation service. The boyfriend was obsessed with the National Basketball Association and bought jerseys of all the teams.Months ago, two Brazilian women who stayed with him acquired so much clothing that when it came time for them to leave, their suitcases were bursting. They fretted about the weight of their bags, not wanting to exceed the airline\u2019s 50-pound limit and incur an extra cost. Ever since, Mr. Naess has left a scale in the spare room.Except when Carnegie Hall shuts down in the summer, he works lengthy hours. He runs two marathons a year, a habit begun in 2003 as a tribute to his father, a marathoner who died that year. This means Mr. Naess is often out running. Each morning, he runs four miles to work.In some instances, his guests spend more time in his apartment than he does. A review by one visitor characterized him as a \u201cghost.\u201dThe tang of pasta sauce scented the air. Mr. Naess had the burners on and was bent over a frying pan. He was going with his surefire rigatoni carbonara. The Italian women were countering with saltimbocca alla Romana. Mr. Naess did not consider it a disadvantage that his recipe had been learned from his mother, who is German.In the cook-off, his meal would go first. The women were taking a tolerant, careful tone, but nonetheless an assured one. \u201cYou\u2019re going down,\u201d Ms. Mazzi told him.\u201cGoing down?\u201d Mr. Naess said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see about that.\u201d\u201cEven if it\u2019s better, I\u2019m going to lie,\u201d Ms. Mazzi said.\u201cDo any shopping?\u201d Mr. Naess asked to change the subject.\u201cMamma mia, you have to see,\u201d she said. She brought out a hoodie, shorts and boots, all with American flag motifs. \u201cI love America,\u201d she said.There was a pleasing frisson among them as they collected at the dining table and sampled the rigatoni.\u201cThis is good,\u201d Ms. Mazzi said. \u201cI hate to admit it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a surprise,\u201d Ms. Biancardi said.Mr. Naess said, \u201cI went easy on the garlic, because I know you want to go out and talk to men.\u201dSomeday, Mr. Naess said, he expected to get married (adding a second income) and have children, and there would go the spare room, but until that day, this was fun. He was between girlfriends. His last relationship, with a woman from Long Island, had dissolved on Valentine\u2019s Day.Making conversation, Ms. Mazzi asked Mr. Naess what he cooked when he had a date over for dinner. He told them that he emailed the woman a menu with five choices.\u201cReally?\u201d she said.\u201cThat\u2019s like on the fourth date,\u201d he said. \u201cNot right away.\u201dMs. Mazzi told him that she had introduced Ms. Biancardi to a bagel that morning. Ms. Biancardi said it was phenomenal. She ate it slathered with peanut butter.Tucking back some stubborn wisps of hair, Ms. Biancardi deftly got going on her dish. Ms. Mazzi said she would clean. Mr. Naess watched stupefied and said, \u201cI would never attempt this.\u201dThey sampled it. The taste suggested heaven.Who won? They diplomatically declared the dishes so different yet both so tasty that the cook-off would go in the books as a tie.\u201cIt\u2019s one to one,\u201d Ms. Mazzi said.Dishes dispensed with, the women insisted that Mr. Naess go out drinking, and so he steered them to a nearby karaoke bar. Beer for him, vodka for the women. Mr. Naess sang \u201cWhite Wedding\u201d and \u201cAmerican Pie,\u201d while the women gravitated to Italian songs he had never heard of. The three collaborated on a faintly memorable \u201cSummer Nights.\u201d Wrung out from singing, they played a game of pool. Mr. Naess won. At 1 a.m., he packed it in. They kept going.Days after their departure, he received text messages from the beach in Canc\u00fan.Next, Mr. Naess had five stranger-free nights for convalescing. (\u201cI actually thought of sleeping in the guest room to see what it was like, but didn\u2019t,\u201d he said.)Down in Washington, Anthony Pietromartire, 25, a robotics researcher at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, had no plans for the coming weekend. A friend of his from France, his native country, was competing in a big fixed-gear bicycle race on Saturday, March 29, in Red Hook, Brooklyn. Why not show up and surprise him? He bounced the idea off a friend and colleague, Thomas Lafarge, 23. He was all in. In short order, they located the beautiful room for rent in Astoria and booked it for two nights. After work, they boarded a bus, hauling along their bicycles for New York transportation.Mr. Naess greeted them after their late-night arrival and chatted for a bit. The next morning, he had work. The two friends fueled up at a rackety Astoria diner, relating how they had ridden from Pennsylvania Station to Astoria and gotten lost. They asked for directions from a conveniently placed police officer. He had no idea. Done eating, they rode their bikes in drizzle to the Brooklyn race. There would be scores of competitors. They had no doubt that they would find the friend. The frame of his bicycle was made of bamboo. He won the race.Sunday morning they were gone. Clean, clean, clean. Wash sheets and towels. Add nuts to the basket.In the evening, Mr. Naess\u2019s next arrivals in his inexhaustible sequence of guests showed up: Valentina Fabrizi, 27, and her boyfriend, Jorgos Kloutsiniotis, 28, from Rome. They would be installed in the apartment until the end of April.She had recently completed her degree in civil engineering and, wanting to improve her English to enhance her job options, and eager to visit New York, had enrolled in an English class in Manhattan. Her boyfriend, a chiropractor, took vacation time to tag along.To get them oriented, Mr. Naess had lunch with them one day after her class. Ms. Fabrizi said they would walk around and \u201csee how the city works.\u201d Mr. Naess gave them concert tickets. Mr. Kloutsiniotis wanted to see an N.B.A. game. He said he played \u201cbaskets.\u201d Mr. Naess said he could show him a park where he could slide into pickup games. And Astoria, how was Astoria?Mr. Kloutsiniotis said: \u201cIt is very nice. I looked it up on Internet and I knew Astoria was good.\u201dMs. Fabrizi said, \u201cIt is quite cozy. Not so crowded, but still America. I like Astoria.\u201dAn article last Sunday about Michael Naess, a man who rents out part of his apartment on Airbnb, gave an outdated name in some editions for one country from which some of Mr. Naess\u2019s guests visited. It is the Czech Republic \u2014 and no longer Czechoslovakia, which was split into Slovakia and the Czech Republic more than two decades ago. And a picture caption misspelled, in some editions, the given name of a visitor from Italy. As the article noted correctly, she is Giorgia Mazzi, not Georgia.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Silence the Israeli Right", "Date": "2014-04-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTEL AVIV \u2014 Last month, the American billionaire Sheldon Adelson bought a small, right-wing religious newspaper in Israel, Makor Rishon, for 17 million shekels, about $5 million. Having done that, Mr. Adelson is now not merely an important player in Israel\u2019s right-wing newspaper scene: He is the only major player. This might be good for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Mr. Adelson\u2019s favorite politician. But it is bad news for Israel\u2019s public sphere. Mr. Adelson\u2019s dominance of this segment of Israel\u2019s media market began soon after Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s return to power in 2009. In 2011, Mr. Adelson\u2019s Israel Hayom became the country\u2019s largest-circulation newspaper, with approximately 1.5 million copies, surpassing Yediot Ahronot, which for years had dominated Israel\u2019s market.It was bound to happen. Yediot Ahronot charges a fee for the paper; Israel Hayom is free. For many readers, who only want a newspaper to skim through, without giving too much thought to its content or ideology, Israel Hayom is a good option. Except for a tiny quirk: On every issue, at every juncture, it always seems to take the prime minister\u2019s side.Many Israelis, especially on the left, rolled their eyes at Israel Hayom. After all, it\u2019s the most-read paper, controlled by an American casino magnate and reflexively supportive of Mr. Netanyahu. It represents a nightmare for opposition parties, and for other newspaper owners who don\u2019t have Mr. Adelson\u2019s deep pockets. Emotions and rhetoric fly high on this issue. One of Yediot Ahronot\u2019s leading columnists wrote about \u201can ultimate ugly display of wealth of a super-tycoon.\u201d Israel Hayom refers to Yediot Ahronot as \u201cthe evil empire.\u201dBut Mr. Adelson\u2019s rivals have reacted foolishly to his newfound dominance; they try to legally compel him to charge a fee for Israel Hayom. Seven Knesset members signed a proposed bill in March calling for a ban on free newspapers. Their stated cause is defense of \u201cfree media,\u201d but that\u2019s a dubious claim. They want to weaken a paper that makes life harder, politically and commercially, for Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s critics.But this isn\u2019t just a battle between the left-tilting opposition and a right-wing Netanyahu backer. It\u2019s a battle that trumps political allegiances, which makes it more complicated but also much more consequential. Last week, an exchange of insults erupted between Israel Hayom and the right-wing economy minister, Naftali Bennett, of the Jewish Home party. (Mr. Bennett is a coalition partner of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s but also a sworn political foe.) Mr. Bennett called Mr. Adelson\u2019s paper \u201cPravda,\u201d and he vocally supports the anti-Adelson legislation. He has also reportedly become cozier with Yediot Ahronot\u2019s publisher, Arnon Mozes, even though Yediot\u2019s editorial line is to the left of Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Bennett is to his right. But both Mr. Mozes and Mr. Bennett dislike the prime minister and the paper that uncritically backs him.Mr. Bennett is especially angry over the purchase of Makor Rishon. This paper was, until last week, Mr. Bennett\u2019s turf. It never backed him as obsequiously as Israel Hayom backs Mr. Netanyahu. Still, it is the voice of the hard-core right wing: the Zionist-Orthodox, pro-settler community to which Mr. Bennett belongs. The paper\u2019s readers are his voters. Yet Mr. Adelson, still hungry after having captured most of Israel\u2019s right-wing readers, went after the small paper that reaches Mr. Bennett\u2019s core constituency. The attempt by critics of Mr. Netanyahu to legally restrain a newspaper because of its views and its success contradicts sacred principles of freedom of speech. Thus, the proposed legislation against Mr. Adelson and Israel Hayom is shameful and dangerous. But Mr. Adelson\u2019s takeover of Israel\u2019s conservative journalistic sphere \u2014 its bloodstream of ideas \u2014 is also deeply problematic. He has taken an ideological camp and turned it into a personal one. Recent events are a case in point: a proposed diplomatic deal was on the table that included the painful release of Palestinian prisoners from jail, allegedly in exchange for the United States\u2019 agreement to release the imprisoned Israeli spy, Jonathan Pollard. Only a vibrant and independent right-wing paper, one that doesn\u2019t feel compelled to support Mr. Netanyahu at every turn, could make the much-needed case against such a deal. Yet with Mr. Adelson controlling both the mass-market Israel Hayom and the smaller Makor Rishon, it\u2019s no longer clear that opposition from the right will ever have a megaphone with which to argue against Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s policies. Mr. Adelson\u2019s representatives have promised the worried writers at Makor Rishon that their independence will not be compromised. But the writers understand, as everybody does, that Mr. Adelson did not buy the paper for a possible miniscule profit he can make out of it. He wants something else.In an ideal world, the legislators would withdraw their unhealthy proposal that would force Israel Hayom to charge readers and Mr. Adelson would withdraw his dissent-threatening purchase of Makor Rishon. But in the real world, the only way to restrain Mr. Adelson\u2019s conquest of Israel\u2019s right-wing media scene and ensure a healthy clash of ideas on the right is to compete with him by establishing other newspapers and finding other rich people to finance them. Surely, Mr. Adelson and Mr. Netanyahu, both vehement champions of a free market, couldn\u2019t oppose such a proposition.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Corporate Profits Grow and Wages Slide", "Date": "2014-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ChartsCORPORATE profits are at their highest level in at least 85 years. Employee compensation is at the lowest level in 65 years.The Commerce Department last week estimated that corporations earned $2.1 trillion during 2013, and paid $419 billion in corporate taxes. The after-tax profit of $1.7 trillion amounted to 10 percent of gross domestic product during the year, the first full year it has been that high. In 2012, it was 9.7 percent, itself a record.Until 2010, the highest level of after-tax profits ever recorded was 9.1 percent, in 1929, the first year that the government began calculating the number.Before taxes, corporate profits accounted for 12.5 percent of the total economy, tying the previous record that was set in 1942, when World War II pushed up profits for many companies. But in 1942, most of those profits were taxed away. The effective corporate tax rate was nearly 55 percent, in sharp contrast to last year\u2019s figure of under 20 percent.The trend of higher profits and lower effective taxes has been gaining strength for years, but really picked up after the Great Recession temporarily depressed profits in 2009. The effective rate has been below 20 percent in three of the last five years. Before 2009, the rate had not been that low since 1931. The statutory top corporate tax rate in the United States is 35 percent, and corporations have been vigorously lobbying to reduce that, saying it puts them at a competitive disadvantage against companies based in other countries, where rates are lower. But there are myriad tax credits, deductions and preferences available, particularly to multinational companies, and the result is that effective tax rates have fallen for many companies.The Commerce Department also said total wages and salaries last year amounted to $7.1 trillion, or 42.5 percent of the entire economy. That was down from 42.6 percent in 2012 and was lower than in any year previously measured.Including the cost of employer-paid benefits, like health insurance and pensions, as well as the employer\u2019s share of Social Security and Medicare contributions, the total cost of compensation was $8.9 trillion, or 52.7 percent of G.D.P., down from 53 percent in 2012 and the lowest level since 1948.Benefits were a steadily rising cost for employers for many decades, but that trend seems to have ended. In 2013, the figure was 10.2 percent, the lowest since 2000.One way to look at the current situation is to compare 2013 with 2006, the last full year before the recession began. Adjusted for inflation, corporate profits were 28 percent higher, before taxes, last year. But taxes were down by 21 percent,so after-tax profits were up by 36 percent. At the same time, total employee compensation was up by 5 percent, or less than the 7 percent increase in the working-age population over the same period.The accompanying charts compare President Obama\u2019s administration with each of his predecessors, going back to Herbert Hoover. After-tax corporate profits in President Obama\u2019s five years in office have averaged 9.3 percent of G.D.P. That is a full two percentage points higher than the 7.2 percent averages under Lyndon B. Johnson and George W. Bush, previously the presidents with the highest ratios of corporate profits.The stock market has reflected that strong performance. Through the end of March, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index was up 133 percent since Mr. Obama\u2019s inauguration in 2009. Of the 13 presidents since 1929, only Bill Clinton and Franklin D. Roosevelt saw a larger total increase. On an annualized basis, the Obama administration gains come to 17.7 percent a year, higher than any of the previous presidents. The figures reflect price changes, and are not adjusted for dividends or inflation.Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix. Advertisement"}

They get it right down to their toes.\u201dAlthough the book recounts Ms. Warren\u2019s childhood and formative years as a law professor, mother and dog lover, it also examines in considerable detail the government\u2019s deeply inequitable response to the financial crisis of 2008. The Congressional Oversight Panel, she writes, \u201ccouldn\u2019t change a system that seemed hellbent on protecting the big guys and leaving everyone else by the side of the road.\u201d About President Obama, she writes, \u201cThe president chose his team, and when there was only so much time and so much money to go around, the president\u2019s team chose Wall Street.\u201dA telling anecdote involves a dinner that Ms. Warren had with Lawrence H. Summers, then the director of the National Economic Council and a top economic adviser to President Obama. The dinner took place in the spring of 2009, after the oversight panel had produced its third report, concluding that American taxpayers were at far greater risk to losses in TARP than the Treasury had let on. \u201cI had been warned,\u201d Ms. Warren concluded.A spokeswoman for Mr. Summers did not respond to a request for comment.A second revealing story recounts an autumn 2009 meeting that the oversight panel members had with Timothy F. Geithner, then the Treasury secretary. Ms. Warren recalls asking why the government\u2019s response to the foreclosure crisis had been so lackluster \u2014 the equivalent of trying to put out a forest fire with an eyedropper. In her telling, Mr. Geithner responded this way: \u201cThe banks could manage only so many foreclosures at a time, and Treasury wanted to slow down the pace so the banks wouldn\u2019t be overwhelmed. And this was where the new foreclosure program came in: It was just big enough to \u2018foam the runway\u2019 for them.\u201d To Ms. Warren, Mr. Geithner\u2019s message was clear, if startling. \u201cMillions of people were getting tossed out on the street, but the government\u2019s most important job was to provide a soft landing for the tender fannies of the banks,\u201d she writes. A spokeswoman for Mr. Geithner said that Ms. Warren\u2019s account did not reflect his views and that the foreclosure program was not designed to protect the banks. \u201cThe housing programs were designed to help as many Americans as possible stay in their homes, refinance their mortgages and avoid further declines in the value of their homes,\u201d the spokeswoman said in a statement. \u201cThe financial rescue was effective in preventing a second Great Depression but could not prevent all damage from the crisis, and we are still living with those scars.\u201dToday, of course, Ms. Warren is no outsider in Washington. But she told me that she still brings that mind-set to her work. \u201cI came to the United States Senate late in life,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t shape my life around how I could run for office and how I could have the maximum number of donors or allies. I came as a continuation of the consumer work I had done for 25 years. That work was the outsider\u2019s work.\u201dNow a member of the Senate banking committee, Ms. Warren is keen on resolving the problem of too-big-to-fail banks; she also prods regulators to be more aggressive. \u201cI keep reminding them that they don\u2019t work for the companies they regulate, they work for the American people,\u201d she said in the interview. \u201cEvery agency is set up so that the regulators hear over and over from the industry and their lawyers and lobbyists. That means the message is the same over and over \u2014 regulate less, do less, create an exception. In building the consumer agency, it was so powerfully important to me to try to set it up structurally so that the people in the agency would hear from real families, from customers of banks. That the wind would blow sometimes from the other direction.\u201dWhile Ms. Warren contends that the deck in Washington is stacked against Main Street, she says she remains hopeful about working to level the playing field. \u201cPeople will put up with a lot, but there comes a time when taking away the opportunities for their children \u2014 it stirs something deep in people,\u201d she said. \u201cWashington, instead of being a place that builds opportunity for young people, has turned into a place that helped concentrate money and power with those who\u2019ve already made it,\u201d Ms. Warren said. She is right about that. But leveling the field is going to be one monumental job. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Nudge on Digital Privacy Law From E.U. Official", "Date": "2014-04-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 The top data protection official for the European Union called Tuesday for member governments to restore public trust in the Internet by pressing ahead with an overhaul of the bloc\u2019s electronic privacy laws by the end of this year.A separate bill, aimed at providing more equitable access for companies and consumers to the Internet \u2014 \u201cnet neutrality\u201d \u2014 and making mobile phone roaming less costly to consumers is now before the European Parliament, which is to vote on that legislation Thursday.But Ms. Reding\u2019s digital privacy regulation is running on a separate track.Last month the European Parliament gave preliminary approval to a strengthened version of Ms. Reding\u2019s rules that would set higher fines and provide stronger bulwarks against demands by countries like the United States for access to data belonging to Europeans. But that version still needs to be reconciled with the views of the European Union\u2019s 28 member governments.As it stands, the proposed digital privacy law would establish fines that could run to billions of euros for giant American technology companies like Amazon and eBay if they failed to adhere to rules like limiting the sharing of personal data. Companies like Google and Facebook would also need to seek clearance from European officials before complying with United States court warrants seeking private data.\u201cThe problem is that the council is not ready yet,\u201d Mr. Hustinx said.Mr. Hustinx called on the bloc\u2019s 28 member states to reach a deal with one another and with the Parliament by the end of the year, because \u201cthe 21st century requires stronger rights, stronger responsibilities, more consistency across Europe.\u201dMr. Hustinx said European Union governments were ready to approve most of the current version of the privacy legislation, including a \u201cright to erasure\u201d that would enable users to demand that data be scrubbed from websites.But he suggested that governments could continue to hold up approval because of other elements, including difficulties reaching agreement on how to enforce uniform rules across the bloc and whether to apply the rules to the way civil servants in member countries handle data.Germany has been particularly forceful in seeking a broad carve-out for the public sector, because of a deep reluctance to modify its own existing privacy rules, which it regards as preferable. Britain, too, has reservations about how the law could create more red tape for businesses in an area of the economy with potential for growth.Mr. Hustinx also challenged the United States government to do more in updating its own rules. \u201cThere are some interesting movements in Washington, but we\u2019d like to see much more,\u201d he said. \u201cIf trust should be rebuilt, then it certainly takes a number of actions at the other side as well.\u201dMr. Hustinx suggested that European governments could be given added reassurance they would be in sync with the American approach to data privacy, if a group led by John Podesta, a special adviser to Mr. Obama, issues its report on data privacy this spring as expected.That study by Mr. Podesta, announced in January, is expected to review how businesses collect private data. But it might also suggest specific legislative proposals to give consumers more control of that information.\u201cTo avoid a limping horse in the trans-Atlantic space, we need to have sufficient consistency,\u201d Mr. Hustinx said.Advertisement"}

He appealed for only the most essential needs, food, water, seeds and farming tools, to allow the South Sudanese to plant crops before the end of May, when rains bring the planting season to an end.\u201cIf we miss the planting season, there will be a catastrophic decline in food security,\u201d Mr. Lanzer said. \u201cWhat will strike that country, and it will hit about seven million people, will be more grave than anything that continent has seen since the mid-1980s.\u201dSouth Sudan gained independence from Sudan less than three years ago, and it has not faced starvation before. But the conflict has inflicted heavy damage on its already fragile, agriculture-based economy, destroying towns, disrupting trade and cutting production of oil, a key asset, by about half, Mr. Lanzer said. The hostilities need to cease to give people the confidence to tend their land, he noted.In a statement released during a visit to western Ethiopia, where close to 90,000 South Sudanese have fled, Ertharin Cousin, head of the World Food Program, said, \u201cThis is a political crisis that is now evolving into a humanitarian catastrophe.\u201dAnt\u00f3nio Guterres, head of the United Nations refugee agency, who was also visiting the area, said: \u201cThe physical and psychological condition of these people is shocking.

The country\u2019s G.D.P. almost doubled, rising to $510 billion, after better assessment of the growth of telecommunications, retail and other service industries.The revision offers a chance for the country to reflect on why more of its 170 million people are not benefiting from the booming economy.Nigeria has been one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing economies of late, with growth driven primarily by oil and gas production. This has generated billions of dollars and created many jobs. But corruption and mismanagement have kept the benefits from trickling down. The government estimates that 61 percent of people lived in \u201cabsolute poverty\u201d in 2010, up from 55 percent in 2004.Sadly, the administration of President Goodluck Jonathan has not done enough to improve his people\u2019s lives. In fact, Mr. Jonathan undermined public confidence by firing the respected head of the central bank, Lamido Sanusi, in February. Sanusi was trying to find out what happened to $20 billion from oil sales that should have been deposited in the treasury. This reinforced suspicions that politicians and oligarchs are helping themselves to the oil wealth. The missing money could have been used to improve public services and diversify the economy.

Those back-to-back gains followed two big declines in December and January, which had raised concerns about possible weakness in manufacturing.Demand for core capital goods, considered a good guide for business investment plans, rose 2.2 percent in March after a 1.1 percent drop in February. It was the best showing since a 3 percent rise in November.Analysts were encouraged by the widespread strength shown in the March orders increase, saying it was an indication that manufacturing was recovering after a cold winter disrupted business activity.\u201cThe gains were spread across most sectors, from primary metals to computers,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.He and other analysts said the March report was an encouraging sign that increased factory production would lift overall economic growth in coming months.The Labor Department reported that 24,000 more people sought jobless benefits last week, bringing the total to a seasonally adjusted 329,000. The increase most likely reflected temporary layoffs in the week before Easter.The four-week average of applications, a less volatile number, rose 4,750 to 316,750. The four-week average fell two weeks ago to its lowest level since October 2007, two months before the recession began.Applications can be volatile around Easter, because many school systems temporarily lay off bus drivers, cafeteria workers and other employees during spring break. Some of those workers file for unemployment benefits. Because the timing of Easter shifts each year, it can be difficult for the government to seasonally adjust for the holiday. Last year, Easter fell on March 31; this year on April 20.\u201cThe underlying trend in claims is falling, albeit slowly,\u201d Mr. Shepherdson said. \u201cWhen the economy picks up, companies hold back on firings before they start increasing hiring, so a sustained drop in claims would be a clearly positive sign\u201d for hiring.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tax Revenue Rockets Up, Helping Lessen the Deficit, Treasury Department Says ", "Date": "2014-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe economy may be plodding along. But business is booming for Uncle Sam.The Treasury Department said on Thursday that the federal budget deficit for the first half of the 2014 fiscal year totaled $413 billion, down $187 billion from where it stood at this point last year, as tax revenue surged and spending sank.In March, the Treasury collected $216 billion in taxes, up 16 percent from a year ago, helping reduce the deficit for the month to $37 billion, from $107 billion last year. Spending also sank by 14 percent, or $40 billion.The budget gap last month was the smallest deficit recorded for the month of March since 2000, when economic growth was running at a much faster pace than it is today.The red ink had been expected to ease this year. But Thursday\u2019s announcement underscored just how quickly tax receipts have been increasing as economic growth speeds up and the stock market surges.While some of the increase was a result of tax increases that took effect at the beginning of 2013, budget experts said it also reflected who was benefiting the most in the current recovery.\u201cIt\u2019s higher-income people and it is mainly from the stock market; it\u2019s not mainly wages,\u201d said Alice M. Rivlin, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and director of the Office of Management and Budget in the Clinton administration. \u201cThe economy is doing a little better, but not a lot better, while the stock market has been a remarkable phenomenon. Higher capital gains taxes feed in pretty quickly.\u201dReceipts from other sources also rose smartly. Corporate tax collections jumped by $17 billion in the first half of the fiscal year, to $117.5 billion, and Social Security receipts also surged. In addition to the boom in tax revenue, the federal government\u2019s books are being helped by lower military spending, a drop in outlays for benefits like unemployment insurance, and payments to the Treasury from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage giants that were taken over by Washington in 2008.Military spending in particular has dropped sharply, especially as operations in Afghanistan gradually wind down. In the first half of the 2014 fiscal year, which began last October, the Defense Department\u2019s military spending fell by $20 billion. Over all, the deficit is expected to equal 4.1 percent of gross domestic product in 2014, down from nearly 10 percent in 2009, during the depths of the recession.The deficits in the next few years are expected to stay at 2 to 3 percent of the gross domestic product, before widening sharply again toward the end of the decade. That deterioration in finances will be driven by the higher cost of retirement benefits and health coverage for baby boomers, although government spending on Medicare and Medicaid recently has shown signs of stabilizing.While a narrower budget gap is good news in many ways, many economists are concerned that policy makers focused too much on spending cuts and austerity in the short term even as the economy remained weak after the recession.In particular, they worry that the reductions in discretionary spending by Washington in recent years, as well as the expiration of unemployment benefits for the long-term jobless at the end of 2013, will ultimately be counterproductive in terms of growth.\u201cI\u2019m still ambivalent about the drop in deficits over all,\u201d said Ernie Tedeschi, head of fiscal analysis at ISI, a private research firm.\u201cIt is the fastest four-year reduction in deficits since the demobilization after World War II,\u201d he added, \u201cbut it has come in the middle of an economy that is not yet healed from the worst recession since the Great Depression.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The union gets a third of its oil and gas from Russia, and 40 percent of that gas is pumped across Ukraine. Europe may now look to tap its own shale gas reserves and expand nuclear power, despite environmental concerns.\u201cI see the danger of more nuclear \u2014 which is CO2-free, which is also part of the discussion, but it is the wrong path,\u201d said Gerhard Roiss, chief executive of OMV, a big Austrian importer of Russian gas into Central Europe.Despite his disengagement from wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and strategic \u201cpivot\u201d toward Asia, Mr. Obama has been pushed by events back into the old-fashioned role of \u201cleader of the free world\u201d in an East-West crisis in Europe.The crisis has swept aside European anger over American spying on global communications and put a new premium on cooperation. In Brussels last week, Europeans appealed to Mr. Obama to sell them shale gas, and both sides agreed to speed talks on a trans-Atlantic trade and investment pact.Yet strategists in the United States say its economic interests and the security challenges of managing China mean Asia will remain the priority and Europe will have to do more for itself.Her disenchantment with him has shaped an increasingly firm crisis response after initial hesitancy. German willingness to reduce energy dependence on Russia will be the yardstick of how far the rest of the European Union goes. Rebecca Harms, a German member of the European Parliament from the Greens, joked that it was too early to nominate Mr. Putin for the annual Charlemagne Prize for services to European unity, \u201cbut in the face of a new threat of war in Europe, E.U. states have indeed agreed on a joint strategy towards Russia.\u201dSome European diplomats say Poland may speed up slow-motion moves to join the euro, seeking sanctuary in Europe\u2019s inner core, as the Baltic States have done.

The deadline for filing was midnight on Wednesday.The company said it was considering several sites in the Catskill and Hudson Valley regions, but would not be more specific. At least 16 companies are expected to compete for the licenses to establish casinos, which Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo considers critical to lifting the struggling upstate economy.The casinos will be allowed in three regions: the Catskills and the Hudson Valley, which includes Orange, Sullivan and Ulster Counties; the Saratoga-Albany region; and a narrow strip in western New York, running from Binghamton north to the Canadian border.The Catskill-Hudson Valley region is the most lucrative because of its proximity to New York City, an appeal underscored by the fact that two major gambling operations \u2014 Caesars and Genting \u2014 want to open there. Many big players have also been wary about the prospect of opening a major casino upstate because of the many gambling options that already exist.With new casinos or slot machine parlors opening in Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island, and more to come in Massachusetts, some analysts think the market is already oversaturated.In New York, there are now five Indian casinos upstate and electronic slot machine parlors at nine racetracks.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misspelled, in one instance, the name of a Las Vegas company bidding for a New York State casino license.

{"Headline": "What Does Today Owe Tomorrow?", "Date": "2014-04-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBy DegreesIf you had driven north on Highway 101 toward San Francisco a few summers ago, you might have noticed a banner hanging from a freeway bridge. \u201cWhat have future generations done for us?\u201d it asked.The question not only answers itself, but implies a follow-up question, as was presumably the intention of the anonymous provocateur who posted it. If future generations have given us nothing, should we spend our hard-earned money trying to make the world better for them?All the more difficult, then, is the task of figuring out what the projected climatic changes might do to human society, which is in large part an economic question. How severe will the damages be; what present-day policies might reduce them; what will those policies cost; and are they a worthwhile investment compared to the many alternatives for spending our money?Tackling these issues is not for the timid, but some economists do it for a living. They have to take the best projections they can get from physical scientists, then incorporate these into elaborate numerical models of how the economy will evolve over the coming centuries.As you might imagine, the results depend on many assumptions, and particularly on the question of how much value to attach in the present to the hypothesized suffering of future people. You can find arguments in economic journals for spending nothing on climate change, and arguments that we should be spending trillions of dollars to head off the apocalypse.Most economists who do this work come down in the middle. Their analyses tend to suggest that, because we have dawdled so long, the economic damage from climate change is going to be substantial, no matter what we do from here. They also generally find that this damage is likely to be dwarfed by bigger economic trends unrelated to climate, like the evolution of technology and shifts in population.Despite those findings, the typical economic analysis suggests that it is still worth trying to limit climate change \u2014 in other words, not only can the damage be reduced somewhat, but the future benefits of doing so outweigh the current costs.Most economists in the field think the rational thing to do is to put a price on emissions of greenhouse gases, which would in turn raise the price of gasoline and of electricity generated from coal. That would discourage emissions in the short run \u2014 people might, say, buy more efficient cars or better insulate their houses to avoid higher bills \u2014 and it would tilt the market in favor of cleaner energy sources in the long run. It would also have some valuable side benefits, like cleaning up the localized pollution from coal-burning power plants that is chopping years off people\u2019s lives in Chinese cities.But what should the price of greenhouse emissions be? This is where things get sticky.If you wanted only to reduce the damages that are virtually certain to occur, you might come up with a pretty low number \u2014 say, a few extra cents tacked on at the gas pump. But that course would rest on the assumption that climate change will proceed fairly smoothly. In other words, what we will see might look a lot like the changes we have already seen, except gradually becoming more intense. Human society might adjust to that pretty well through normal market behavior.But as the United Nations panel pointed out, the physical scientists see a distinct risk that things will not work that way. We might cross some temperature threshold beyond which a rapid, highly disruptive change in the climate would occur.Suppose we were to spew enough heat-trapping gas into the air to produce a rapid collapse of the polar ice sheets and thus a rapid rise of sea level. Human society could be thrown into panic. Tens of millions of people might have to be moved. Trillions of dollars of productive capital, including many of the world\u2019s major coastal cities, might have to be abandoned.Because the likelihood of this sort of thing is unknown, economists cannot really figure out how to work such risks into their economic models. But they certainly understand them in principle. That is why many of them recommend that we push harder on climate policies than we otherwise might \u2014 in other words, set a higher emissions price \u2014 to buy ourselves some insurance against the worst-case possibilities.Whether you agree with that is not, in the end, an economic question.It is a question of how much you believe you owe those living in the future \u2014 not just your own children or grandchildren, but the generations of people who will come long after we are gone.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Push by Obama, Minimum-Wage Action Is Moving to the States", "Date": "2014-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byANN ARBOR, Mich. \u2014 The more President Obama talks about the need to raise the federal minimum wage, the less likely it appears that Republicans in Congress are inclined to do it.The result is an outside-the-Beltway variation on Mr. Obama\u2019s pledge to use his executive powers to bypass an obstructionist Republican Party in Congress. In this case, White House aides said they believed that Mr. Obama\u2019s feverish rhetorical push for a higher minimum federal wage, to $10.10 per hour from $7.25, has helped generate political pressure on states to act.On Wednesday, the president continued the push at the University of Michigan, the latest in an almost weekly focus on the subject in speeches, blog posts, radio addresses and events. In March, Mr. Obama delivered remarks on the topic at universities in Florida and Connecticut. In February, he issued an executive order raising the minimum wage for federal contractors. In January, he demanded a raise for America\u2019s workers at a Costco in Maryland.\u201cNobody who works full time should be raising a family in poverty,\u201d Mr. Obama said Wednesday as he campaigned for the minimum-wage increase in Michigan, where a coalition of labor and other groups is trying to collect signatures to force action by the Legislature or put the issue to voters in the fall.Mr. Obama praised the efforts of the states to raise their own wages, but he chided Republicans in Washington. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to do right by our fellow Americans, we need Congress to get on board,\u201d he said, adding that lawmakers should put it to a vote on Capitol Hill.\u201cYou can give America the shaft, or you can give it a raise,\u201d Mr. Obama said to thunderous applause.The state minimum-wage actions, which have created a patchwork of minimum wages across the country, are not the uniform step that Mr. Obama and his allies would prefer. Some states have minimum wages on the books that are below the current federal level of $7.25 an hour, meaning that the federal level automatically applies to them. Other states already require wages to start at $8, $8.25 or higher. The District of Columbia, which already has an $8.25 per hour minimum wage, could have the highest in the nation on July 1, 2016, when it rises to $11.25.But Mr. Obama\u2019s advisers have embraced the legislative flurry across the country as a second-best alternative that can work politically and substantively. Local increases in the minimum wage will help workers and pump money into those economies, they say.President Obama\u2019s proposal to increase the federal minimum wage to $10.10 from $7.25 is unlikely to pass through Congress, but several states have been tackling the issue on their own.\u201cPresidential mobilization created the environment in which there is support for making change on the state level,\u201d said Jennifer Palmieri, the White House communications director. \u201cWe\u2019re always looking for ways to break through.\u201dThe White House is also running a weekly strategy session with Capitol Hill lawmakers, top White House political advisers and outside groups like labor unions who are eager to see a higher minimum wage.\u201cThere\u2019s so much collateral damage you can do to job creation by setting a minimum wage,\u201d Mr. French said. \u201cThe higher you set that minimum wage, the more collateral damage you do. Politics is being played here.\u201dRepublican governors in Maine, New Jersey and New Mexico have vetoed legislative efforts to raise the minimum wage, echoing concerns among their Congressional counterparts about the potential for job losses. (New Jersey voters subsequently approved a constitutional amendment last year to increase the minimum wage anyway.)A spokesman for House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio said the president\u2019s plan for a rise in the minimum wage would \u201cincrease costs for consumers and eliminate jobs for those who need them the most.\u201dBut despite the opposition, and even without Mr. Obama\u2019s efforts, the momentum behind a minimum-wage increase is building, according to experts who have tracked the issue for years.Jeanne Mejeur, a senior researcher at the National Conference of State Legislatures, said the wave of action in the states on the minimum wage was most likely a reaction to the lack of movement on the issue at the national level.\u201cWhen Congress doesn\u2019t act on the minimum wage, that\u2019s when the states start looking at it,\u201d said Ms. Mejeur, who has studied the minimum wage for 15 years. She said there had been previous waves of interest at the state level, but the president\u2019s efforts appeared to have encouraged states to seek a higher minimum wage.\u201cThis is the first time where there have been quite a few states that have gone over the threshold of $10 per hour,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the first time that I\u2019ve seen the states proposing these kinds of numbers.\u201dAdvertisement"}

On Wednesday, the legislature met in Pyongyang in a session widely seen as a formality in which Mr. Kim would fill major posts left vacant by the purges with younger cadres who would owe their loyalty to him.Vice Marshal Choe Ryong-hae, the top political officer in the North Korean People\u2019s Army who has emerged as a rising star under Mr. Kim, was elected as one of the three vice chairmen of the National Defense Commission on Wednesday, filling a post vacated by Mr. Jang\u2019s execution.Vice Marshal Choe, 64, \u201cis now the true No. 2 man in the Kim Jong-un regime,\u201d said Cheong Seong-chang, an analyst at the Sejong Institute in Seongnam, South Korea.

{"Headline": "Better Insurance Against Inequality", "Date": "2014-04-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewPaying taxes is rarely pleasant, but as April 15 approaches it\u2019s worth remembering that our tax system is a progressive one and serves a little-noticed but crucial purpose: It mitigates some of the worst consequences of income inequality. If any of us, as individuals, are unfortunate enough to have income drop significantly, the tax on that income will plummet as well \u2014 and a direct payment, or negative tax, might even be received from the government, thanks to the earned-income tax credit. In this way, the tax system can be viewed as a colossal insurance system, guarding against extreme income inequality. There are similar provisions in other countries. But it\u2019s also clear that while income inequality would be much worse without our current tax system, what we have isn\u2019t nearly enough. It\u2019s time \u2014 past time, actually \u2014 to tweak the system so that it can respond effectively if income inequality becomes more extreme.Professor Piketty talks about instituting a \u201cglobal tax on capital\u201d but acknowledges that it is a utopian idea and says that \u201cit is hard to imagine the nations of the world agreeing on any such thing anytime soon.\u201d He talks about raising the rate of the top tax brackets and raising inheritance taxes but sees \u201clittle reason for optimism\u201d that this will happen. There have been big increases in taxes on the rich in the past, but he points out that these tax increases were put in place only in response to wars \u2014 specifically, World War I and World War II. There is a practical reason for starting now. If we wait until income inequality is much more severe, we will have a whole class of new superrich who will probably feel entitled to their wealth and will have the means to defend their interest. That\u2019s already gone far enough. We shouldn\u2019t let it become more extreme.Though our proposal worked in theory, we found that putting it into effect would encounter difficulties. For the system to be effective, the top tax bracket would have had to rise to well over 75 percent \u2014 a political nonstarter, in our view. We also believed that there would have been negative economic effects, including more tax avoidance. So we concluded that the proposal wasn\u2019t ready for advocacy. We held off from finishing and publishing that paper.Today, though, there are some possibilities that might alleviate, at least partially, any increasing inequality in future years. A relatively minor change like this should be politically acceptable. It is a reframing of inflation indexing, which is already a sacrosanct principle, and would be revenue-neutral. By 2025, Mr. Burman argued, it could pay for a doubling of the earned-income tax credit, \u201cwith more than $100 billion left over to adjust middle-income tax liabilities.\u201d Such a plan would be a nice first step toward making our tax system manage the risk of future increases in inequality.ROBERT J. SHILLER is Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Cube With a Twist: At 40, It Puzzles Anew", "Date": "2014-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERSEY CITY \u2014 A Rubik\u2019s cube can be twisted and twiddled in 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 different ways, and 43,252,003,274,489,855,999 of them are wrong.Those truths \u2014 especially the second, maddeningly frustrating one \u2014 have been known since soon after the modish, Mondrianish plastic object was invented in 1974. The cube went on to become the must-have toy of 1980 and 1981.Its popularity faded fast.Lately it has undergone a resurrection in a world in which engineers and computers can generate helpful algorithms that would-be cube solvers can share with each other. But some things have not changed. The typical Rubik\u2019s cube still has nine squares on six sides, and the same eye-popping colors. And those unfathomable huge numbers in the first paragraph are still quintillions. \u201cFour-point-three times 10 to the 19th,\u201d explained Paul Hoffman, the president and chief executive of the Liberty Science Center in Jersey City.Rubik\u2019s cubes have trailed Mr. Hoffman for his entire career. On his first job after college, as an editor at Scientific American, he shepherded a March 1981 cover story about Rubik\u2019s \u201cmagic cubology\u201d into print. It was written by Douglas R. Hofstadter, the professor known for the Pulitzer Prize-winning best seller \u201cG\u00f6del, Escher, Bach,\u201d who said it had taken him \u201c50 hours of work, distributed over several months,\u201d to solve the \u201cunscrambling problem.\u201d He mentioned group theory, which has to do with algebraic structures, and something he called \u201ccubitis magikia,\u201d a \u201chighly contagious\u201d condition \u201caccompanied by the itching of the fingertips that can be relieved only by prolonged contact\u201d with a certain multicolored object.Now Mr. Hoffman is capitalizing on the cube again, with a $5 million exhibition that opens to the public on Saturday. It features an 18-karat gold Rubik\u2019s cube said to be worth $2.5 million that pivots and swivels like an ordinary plastic one, and a cube-solving robot that is no match for speed cubers, as competitors who try to beat the clock are known. It took the machine a minute to unscramble a jumbled cube. In that time, Anthony Brooks, a speed cuber with several records to his name, did it three times, once using only one hand.Speed cubers can memorize algorithms they have developed on their laptops and shared on websites or by email to unscramble a jumbled cube in less time than it takes to read a sentence like this one aloud. But Mr. Brooks said speed cubing also involved muscle memory and tricks, like breaking in a cube the way baseball players break in a glove with neatsfoot oil. \u201cYou can buy lubricants \u2014 cube lubes,\u201d Mr. Brooks said. \u201cOr regular silicon spray you can find in any hardware.\u201dIn the 40 years since it was invented, the cube has made some intriguing cameo appearances. Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor who has leaked intelligence secrets, told two journalists he had arranged to meet that they would recognize him outside a restaurant in Hong Kong because he would have a Rubik\u2019s cube in his hand. Mr. Hoffman said that sounded like an homage to the 2009 film \u201cDuplicity,\u201d in which spies played by Julia Roberts and Clive Owen realize who they are because they are both carrying Rubik\u2019s cube key chains.That could not have happened to the cube\u2019s inventor, Erno Rubik, 69. He said he did not travel with a cube.\u201cI don\u2019t need to,\u201d Mr. Rubik said as he previewed the exhibition this week.For the record, he calls it \u201cmy cube.\u201d\u201cFrom my mouth, it sounds strange to call it \u2018Rubik\u2019s cube,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Rubik said. \u201cIf I have a child, I call it \u2018my child,\u2019 not \u2018Rubik\u2019s boy\u2019 or \u2018Rubik\u2019s girl.\u2019 Naturally, after 40 years, I have a strong relationship with my cube.\u201dHe passed a display case containing his original pride and joy, a wooden cube. It sat in front of the Hungarian patent he was issued for his \u201cmagic cube\u201d in 1975. He invented the cube as the solution to the kind of structural problem that could bedevil an architecture professor, which is what he was at the time. The structural problem was how to keep a mechanism with many moving parts from tumbling to the floor.Do not expect him to face off against a speed cuber like Rowe Hessler, a bowling-alley manager from Riverhead, N.Y. Mr. Hessler, 23, is a former United States speed cubing champion, whose fastest time unscrambling a standard three-by-three-by-three cube was 6.94 seconds.At the science center, Mr. Hessler did it in a seemingly effortless 9.69 seconds of twisting and pivoting. The only noise was the cube, clicking like bad dentures in a cartoon.Mr. Rubik said he had not imagined when the ink on the patent was fresh that the cube would become so universal. \u201cI had a feeling about the intellectual value of the cube\u201d early on, he said, adding that items with intellectual value can be a hard sell in a material world.Mr. Rubik said he had thought that toy manufacturers would pigeonhole it as a puzzle. \u201cTraditionally, the puzzle section in the toy business is very narrow,\u201d he said, \u201cand they don\u2019t believe it\u2019s possible to make a business. They\u2019re not selling mass production.\u201dHe said the cube had changed that thinking.Mr. Hoffman said one billion to 2.5 billion cubes had been manufactured, assuming there were five counterfeits for every legitimate one sold. \u201cThey\u2019ve seized whole 747s full of illegal knockoffs,\u201d he said.Experts have calculated that a cube could be solved in as few as 20 moves, no matter how it is scrambled. But speed cubers do not have time to think about the elegance of economy implied by minimizing moves. Mr. Hessler said speed cubers averaged about 50; his lowest was 31.For his part, Mr. Rubik declined an invitation to go up against Mr. Hessler, but he said he understood the appeal of speed cubing, even if it was not the sport for him.\u201cThe main group who is buying the cube is teenagers,\u201d Mr. Rubik said, \u201cand they are competitive and they have the time. When you are working, you don\u2019t have the time.\u201d An article on Saturday about the 40th anniversary of the Rubik\u2019s cube included a quotation that misstated, in some editions, the mathematical formula for the approximate number of ways the toy can be twisted. It is 4.3 times 10 to the 19th \u2014 not 43 times 10 to the 19th.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wage Theft Across the Board", "Date": "2014-04-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialWhen labor advocates and law enforcement officials talk about wage theft, they are usually referring to situations in which low-wage service-sector employees are forced to work off the clock, paid subminimum wages, cheated out of overtime pay or denied their tips. It is a huge and underpoliced problem. It is also, it turns out, not confined to low-wage workers. The suit, brought after the Justice Department investigated the anti-recruiting scheme in 2010, has many riveting aspects, including emails and other documents that tarnish the reputation of Silicon Valley as competitive and of technology executives as a new breed of \u201cdon\u2019t-be-evil\u201d bosses, to cite Google\u2019s informal motto. The case essentially alleges white-collar wage theft. The engineers were not victimized by the usual violations of labor law, but by improper hiring practices against their interests. The result, however, was the same: Money that would have flowed to workers in the form of wages went instead into corporate coffers and from there to executives and shareholders. Moreover, the recovered wages are surely only a fraction of the wage theft nationwide because the Labor Department has only about 1,100 wage-and-hour investigators to monitor seven million employers and several states have ended or curtailed wage enforcement efforts. New York, however, has been a notable exception. Last month, investigations by Attorney General Eric Schneiderman yielded settlements with nearly two dozen Domino\u2019s Pizza restaurants in New York and one McDonald\u2019s franchise that recovered nearly $1 million in stolen wages for 1,450 fast-food employees.Those sums, vitally important redress for the low-wage victims, are small in comparison to the billions of dollars sought by the software engineers, or the hundreds of millions that would likely result from a settlement of the engineers\u2019 case. Still, as important as the recoveries is the evidence that wage theft afflicts both low- and high-wage jobs. To fight the theft from low-wage workers requires more Labor Department resources, as President Obama called for in his recent budget, and immigration reform, which would help to both stanch widespread wage theft from undocumented immigrants and improve low-wage working conditions. To fight white-collar wage theft requires a re-energized Justice Department, to pursue tough cases and settlements against industry collusion, discrimination and other illegal practices that allow employers to deny employees their rightful pay.

{"Headline": "In China, a Big Jet Becomes a Status Symbol ", "Date": "2014-04-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn the RoadIN the United States, public reaction to the corporate use of business jets can be scathing when instances of obvious excess become publicized, such as the day in 2008 when the top executives of the Detroit automakers each used a private jet to fly to Washington to argue for $25 billion in taxpayer bailouts.But in China, where sales of business jets are increasing despite a lack of large scale air-system support and a dearth of airports to handle private flights, attitudes about private jets seem to be different. While forecasters had long assumed midsize and smaller jets would prevail as China\u2019s business aviation market expanded throughout the country, that has not been the case.Instead, Chinese buyers are enthusiastically opting mostly for so-called heavy metal jets \u2014 big, long-range luxury jets that can cost $50 million or more before extras like fancy cabin fixtures. A big jet is considered a big status symbol.In China, \u201cthe distribution of cabin size is very different,\u201d said Brian Foley, whose company, Brian Foley Associates, provides market analysis on the global aerospace industry. \u201cChina leans more toward the heavy, top-end class\u201d in business jet purchases, he said.The main allure is longer range. A top-end Gulfstream G550 \u2014 price tag $56 million before cabin fittings \u2014 can fly 6,800 nautical miles nonstop, or about 7,800 miles, easily covering the distance between Shanghai and New York.\u201cChina is a pretty big land mass, and if you want to go to a business center outside of China, you just need the legs to get there,\u201d Mr. Foley said.But cultural differences also favor the market for the big luxury jets, it seems.\u201cIn China,\u201d Mr. Foley said, \u201cif you\u2019re a successful business person, you generally don\u2019t mind flaunting that and making your compatriots aware that you\u2019re doing well. And one way to do that is to buy the biggest and best business jet, if you have the money to buy it.\u201dGlobal sales of business jets, which plunged during the financial crisis, have been in a slow recovery, and will account for $250 billion in sales from 2013 to 2023, according to Honeywell\u2019s business and general aviation division. In its most recent 10-year forecast, Honeywell said that bigger, faster, more expensive long-range jets would account for 70 percent of new expenditures worldwide on business jets.Throughout Asia, Honeywell said, the total number of business jets has grown about 12 percent annually over the last five years, when large-cabin, long-range jets accounted for 77 percent of total sales.Figures from the General Aviation Manufacturers Association show marked global shifts underway in the market for business jets. In 2007, the United States and Canada accounted for 58.3 percent of the 1,136 business jets delivered worldwide. That dropped to 49.7 percent in 2012, then rose slightly, to 52.4 percent, last year \u2014 when the industry was still struggling for stability and overall shipments were 678.But there has been significant growth in the Asia-Pacific region, which accounted for 11.9 percent of shipments of business jets in 2013, up from 4.2 percent in 2007. In Latin America, the share grew to 11.1 percent in 2013 from 7.5 percent in 2007. The Middle East and Africa accounted for 9 percent of shipments last year, up from 5.2 percent in 2007.In Europe, the share fell to 16.6 percent in 2013 from 24.9 percent in 2007. In addition to Europe\u2019s struggling economy, contributing factors included cultural attitudes that are sometimes negative toward use of private jets and high-speed train service that can substitute for flying on medium-length routes.In the Asia-Pacific region, transport ministers from 21 countries have adopted a plan to ease the way for business aviation, which is often hampered by strict bureaucratic rules and \u2014 in many cases \u2014 by military control of national airspace.Those issues are to be explored at the Asian Business Aviation Conference and Exhibition, which runs Tuesday through Thursday in Shanghai. The agenda is focused on the growing importance of business aviation for the region. Among the participants will be top Chinese officials, who are expected to address obstacles to that growth in China.\u201cIn the U.S., there are about 5,000 airports that can be used by business jets,\u201d said Mr. Foley, the aerospace analyst, adding that in China the number stood at around 200 airports. \u201cAnd complicating that is the fact that there aren\u2019t a lot of services for fuel or comfort, or any of the things you expect in a longer-established business aviation market.\u201dAnd he pointed to other obstacles in the region. \u201cIn China, trying to get from point A to point B by business jet can be tricky,\u201d Mr. Foley said. \u201cIn the U.S., you can just file your flight plan and be up and on your merry way within half an hour. Not in China. It used to be days, but it\u2019s still hours to get your flight clearance. And it might not be very direct, at your requested altitude or way-points, because the military owns the airspace, and private aviation is low on the totem pole after the military and the airlines.\u201dSo a well-heeled tycoon might buy a $60 million luxury jet in China but find that using it is more complicated than in many countries. Still, that is where the market preferences lie, and business culture in a rapidly developing economy may explain part of that, Mr. Foley suggested.\u201cSome of these big jets that are bought are pretty much parked out on the ramp most of the time,\u201d he said, adding that the owners were often limited to impressing associates and clients on the ground, rather than at 40,000 feet.\u201cWe kind of refer to that as ramp jewelry,\u201d Mr. Foley said.Email: jsharkey@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ukraine Can Learn From the Past", "Date": "2014-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersRegarding \u201cThe new Cold War that isn\u2019t\u201d (Opinion, March 22): Victor Sebestyen\u2019s article explaining why the United States cannot, should not and will not assist Ukraine should be mandatory reading for anyone interested in American foreign policy. Ukraine\u2019s current problems with Russia are entirely its own fault. Kiev foolishly gave up its nuclear missiles in exchange for worthless \u201cassurances\u201d from the West and Russia that its borders would remain secure. (The Budapest Memorandum was not a treaty, only a memorandum of understanding.) Ukraine knew that the only effective way to prevent Russian aggression was to keep control of its own nuclear deterrent, but it did not want to spend the money required to do that. So it traded away its security for a piece of paper as useless as Chamberlain\u2019s Munich Agreement in 1938. Given that all that the Ukrainians got in exchange for unilateral nuclear disarmament back in the 1990s was some pocket change and a scrap of paper outlining security guarantees, Kiev should now expedite the rebuilding of its nuclear and conventional military capabilities, put its financial and energy houses in order, and facilitate the formation of a military and economic Eurasian Union with Turkey, Georgia, Poland, the three Baltic nations, Finland and Sweden as soon as possible. The writer is a former regional director of the Eurasia Foundation. As a youngster I used to wonder how people could have reacted so naively and passively to Hitler, and why they didn\u2019t wake up and forcefully assert themselves to oppose him. Though I opposed the Iraq war and continue to think it was a bad idea, I look at Europe now and say we\u2019d better move promptly and in a big way to show President Vladimir V. Putin we are prepared to oppose him with military support. That is the only thing he understands and fears.Regarding \u201cFollow the Money\u201d (Opinion, April 3): Thomas L. Friedman presents an effective means to check Mr. Putin\u2019s land grab by curbing his ambitions with a real bite into Russia\u2019s economy. To that I would add that we must help Ukraine to defend itself. First, the West should provide equipment and training for effective border control. Second, we should share intelligence about Russia\u2019s efforts to destabilize Ukraine. Mr. Putin has no intention of stopping at just the takeover of Crimea. His exploitation of ethnic Russians or Russian-speaking minorities is a threat to geopolitics and economies globally.Regarding \u201cThe case for Scotland\u201d (April 1) by Roger Cohen: Scottish nationalists would disagree that the Act of Union in 1707 was one of the most successful in history. Granted, there were immediately compelling reasons for Scottish acceptance of the Act \u2014 improved shipping access to European trade, financial recompense for the enormous losses incurred by the ill-fated Darien expeditions, the threat of English invasion against Jacobite interests if union did not take place \u2014 but Scotland traded such material benefits for the intangible loss of identity as a nation, and there was overwhelming national resistance toward the Act. Until 1707 Scotland was one of the most ancient nations of Europe, with a proud and independent history. Let\u2019s love the English, but hope that there are sufficient numbers of true Scots left who will vote for a return to independence.Regarding \u201cShaking the culture of patronage\u201d (Page Two, April 2): Adam Nossiter fails to acknowledge the divergent governance paths of Francophone West African countries. Lumping the strife-torn Central African Republic and insurgency-ridden Mali along with broadly stable and rapidly growing Ivory Coast detracts from his analysis on the challenges facing West Africa. Mr. Nossiter discounts Ivory Coast\u2019s return to growth and stability under President Alassane Ouattara, citing accusations of \u201cinfluence-peddling\u201d as indications that the country has \u201cnot learned from old mistakes.\u201d Ivory Coast lies on a different political trajectory from the Central African Republic and Mali or from other neighbors, such as Burkina Faso and Niger. Mr. Nossiter fails to mention the stabilizing effect of recent Ivorian land tenure and citizenship rights reforms under the Ouattara government, and chooses to list Ivory Coast as another African case of \u201cgovernment by patronage.\u201d A simple recognition of the divergent political trajectories of different African countries would better serve your readers.

{"Headline": "Not the Same Old, Same Old", "Date": "2014-04-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt first, the article in The Jerusalem Post last week seemed like the same old, same old: A picture of a ransacked Israel Defense Forces post in the West Bank. Then a quote from Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon: \u201cThe State of Israel will not tolerate such criminal activity, which is terrorism in all respects.\u201d Those Palestinians will never quit.\u00a0Oh, wait a minute. Yaalon wasn\u2019t talking about Palestinian terrorists. He was talking about Jewish terrorists, renegade settlers, who slashed the tires of an I.D.F. jeep parked in the settlement of Yitzhar, after Israeli soldiers came to demolish illegal buildings. \u201cSettlers clashed with security forces during Monday night\u2019s demolition and lightly injured six officers,\u201d The Post reported. \u201cA group of 50 to 60 settlers then raided an army post located to the west of the settlement, destroying generators, army equipment, heaters and diesel fuel tanks.\u201d Israel\u2019s justice minister, Tzipi Livni, warned that extremist settlers had crossed a line: \u201cAn ideology has flourished that does not recognize the rule of law, that does not recognize us or what we represent.\u201d These small stories tell a bigger one: We\u2019re not dealing anymore with your grandfather\u2019s Israel, and they\u2019re not dealing anymore with your grandmother\u2019s America either. Time matters, and the near half-century since the 1967 war has changed both of us in ways neither wants to acknowledge \u2014 but which the latest impasse in talks only underscores.Israel, from its side, has become a more religious society \u2014 on Friday nights in Jerusalem now you barely see a car moving on the streets in Jewish neighborhoods, which only used to be the case on Yom Kippur \u2014 and the settlers are clearly more brazen. Many West Bank settlers are respectful of the state, but there is now a growing core who are armed zealots, who will fight the I.D.F. if it tries to remove them. You did not go to summer camp with these Jews. You did not meet them at your local Reform synagogue. This is a hard core. But even the more tame settlers are more dominant than ever in the Likud Party and in the Israeli army officer corps. It is not a fiction to say today that the Likud prime minister, Bibi Netanyahu, represents the \u201ccenter\u201d of Israel\u2019s right-wing bloc. And it is not an accident that Israel\u2019s housing minister, Uri Ariel, who comes from a pro-settler party to the right of the Likud, approved a tender for 700 homes in Jerusalem\u2019s Gilo neighborhood, across the Green Line \u2014 just as Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s peace talks were coming to a head. As Minister Livni, Israel\u2019s chief negotiator, put it: \u201cMinister Ariel purposefully and intentionally did what he did to torpedo\u201d the peace talks. There are now about 350,000 Jews living in the West Bank. It took 50,000 Israeli police and soldiers to remove 8,000 settlers from Gaza, who barely resisted. I fear the lift in the West Bank to make peace there is now just too heavy for conventional politics and diplomacy. The only way settler resistance can be trumped would be by a prime minister, and an Israeli majority, who were really excited about the prospects for peace or truly frightened of the alternative.But I do not believe Netanyahu will ever be anything other than ambivalent. And his ambivalence is reinforced by many factors: Israel today is so much more powerful, economically and militarily, than the Palestinians; Israeli (and Palestinian) security forces have effectively shut down Palestinian suicide bombers and the Israel lobby in Washington has effectively shut down any pressure from the White House or Congress. Israel has never been so insulated.But these are not your grandfather\u2019s Palestinians either. There is a young generation emerging that increasingly has no faith in their parents\u2019 negotiations with the Jews, have no desire to recognize Israel as a \u201cJewish state\u201d and would rather demand the right to vote in a one-state solution.The truth is Kerry\u2019s mission is less an act of strategy and more an act of deep friendship. It is America trying to save Israel from trends that will inevitably undermine it as a Jewish and democratic state. But Kerry is the last of an old guard. Those in the Obama administration who think he is on a suicide mission reflect the new U.S. attitude toward the region. And those in Israel who denounce him as a nuisance reflect the new Israel. Kerry, in my view, is doing the Lord\u2019s work. But the weight of time and all the changes it has wrought on the ground may just be too heavy for such an act of friendship. If he folds his tent, though, Israelis and Palestinians will deeply regret it, and soon. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jeb Bush\u2019s Rush to Make Money May Be Hurdle", "Date": "2014-04-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs it sought to recruit well-heeled investors, an untested and unprofitable Miami company named InnoVida brought aboard a trusted Florida figure in 2007: Jeb Bush, the former governor and the brother of a sitting president.For potential stockholders, the imprimatur of Mr. Bush, who joined InnoVida as a paid consultant and a member of the board of directors, conferred credibility on the young start-up. That credibility did not last long. It turned out that the leaders of InnoVida, a manufacturer of inexpensive building materials, had faked documents, lied about the health of the business and misappropriated $40 million in company funds, records show. The company went bankrupt in 2011, its founder eventually went to jail and investors lost nearly all of their money.Mr. Bush left public office seven years ago with a net worth of $1.3 million and an unapologetic determination to expand his wealth, telling friends that his finances had suffered during his time in government.But his efforts to capitalize on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and reputation have thrust him into situations that may prove challenging to explain should he mount a Republican campaign for the White House. Records and interviews show, for example, that Mr. Bush participated in the fevered, last-ditch efforts to prop up Lehman Brothers, a Wall Street bank weighed down by toxic mortgage-backed securities. As a paid adviser to the company in the summer of 2008, he met with Carlos Slim Hel\u00fa, a Mexican billionaire, as Lehman sought to persuade Mr. Slim to make a sizable investment in the firm, emails show. Mr. Bush sat on the board of Swisher Hygiene, a soap maker, at a time when, its executives acknowledged, their financial statements were unreliable and their accounting practices inadequate. That admission contributed to a plunge in stock price that has wiped out more than three-quarters of Swisher\u2019s value and touched off a wave of shareholder lawsuits. Several have named Mr. Bush as a defendant, accusing him and fellow board members of insufficient oversight.And in a stint that could complicate his appeal to conservatives, Mr. Bush serves as a paid director to Tenet Health Care, the giant hospital owner, which supported President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, aggressively encouraged Americans to sign up for insurance under the program and trumpeted the legislation as a boon to the company\u2019s finances.The path from public service to private riches is well trodden by politicians of both parties. But, even by that measure, Mr. Bush took an aggressive and expansive approach to making money.Since 2007, he has left few corners of the economy untouched, working on Wall Street, starting a consulting firm, investing in real estate, advising an emergency preparedness company, sitting on the board of a hospital linens provider, and giving speeches to grocery industry groups, local chambers of commerce and health care conferences.He has been well paid for his time, earning at least $3.2 million in board fees and stock grants from publicly traded companies alone, records show. His corporate speechmaking appears to have generated millions more: He commands about $50,000 for his speeches, delivering more than 100 since 2007, though some are unpaid. And he has earned millions from his work as an adviser to Lehman Brothers and Barclays, the company that took much of the bank over, according to executives familiar with his arrangements. Today, his pay from Barclays exceeds $1 million a year, these people said. Mr. Bush declined to be interviewed. His spokeswoman, Kristy Campbell, provided a statement: \u201cJeb Bush had a successful career in commercial real estate and business before serving as Florida\u2019s governor. After eight rewarding years in public service leading the state, he is enjoying running his own business again.\u201dHis business endeavors are a largely overlooked chapter in a postgovernment biography built around his reputation as a policy maven, nonprofit leader and moderate voice in Republican debates on immigration and education. But as he explores a White House bid, friends said, Mr. Bush\u2019s lucrative career is an unspoken but potent factor in his decision making. Entering the 2016 Republican field would inevitably require dismantling the business empire that he has assembled \u2014 an empire that now employs his son Jeb Bush Jr. \u201cAlthough he\u2019s been at this for seven years, it\u2019s the last few years that he\u2019s begun to flourish as an investor and build a commendable nest egg,\u201d said Al Cardenas, a longtime Bush friend and adviser. \u201cLeaving all of that behind, all he\u2019s built, is a challenge and a sacrifice for him.\u201dHis overlapping commitments risk spreading him thin. At one point, Mr. Bush sat on the boards of six companies, twice as many as leading corporate governance experts recommend given the time and fiduciary responsibilities of such a position.Fellow corporate board members are quick to praise Mr. Bush. At Tenet, they said, he has pushed for tougher hospital safety standards; at Rayonier, a major owner of forestland, he has advised them on navigating regulations.Eye-popping wealth long eluded Mr. Bush. His older brother, George W. Bush, reaped about $14 million profit from an investment in the Texas Rangers baseball team. But Jeb Bush\u2019s career as a real estate entrepreneur in Florida brought him comparatively modest success: He entered the governor\u2019s office in 1999 with a net worth of about $2 million, according to his financial disclosure forms, a figure that fell throughout his two terms. \u201cPeople thought of him as wealthy,\u201d said Lance deHaven Smith, a professor of public policy at Florida State University who has studied Mr. Bush\u2019s career. He recalled that when Mr. Bush was governor, his opponents took to calling him a \u201cspoiled little rich kid\u201d to protest his budget cuts.\u201cIt was a misperception,\u201d Mr. deHaven Smith said. \u201cHe grew up in a wealthy family, but he took a path that was quite different.\u201dHe seemed eager to change that by 2007, expressing frustration to business and political associates that he had missed out on a boom in the real estate industry during his time as governor; he also turned down a public pension when he left office.Within a year of departing the Statehouse, he had signed on as consultant to Lehman Brothers, where he was eventually enlisted to reach out to Mr. Slim in a plan code-named Project Verde. Mr. Slim, however, was not interested in making a major investment in Lehman Brothers or striking up a joint venture with it. \u201cProject Verde was unsuccessful,\u201d Mr. Bush wrote to a Lehman colleague in early July 2008.Lehman executives talked openly about the value of Mr. Bush\u2019s family connections in the midst of the crisis. Lehman\u2019s chief executive, Richard S. Fuld Jr., discussed the possibility of having Mr. Bush ask his brother President Bush to persuade the British prime minister to allow Lehman\u2019s emergency merger with a British bank, according to testimony from the company\u2019s bankruptcy case. Mr. Fuld never followed through, and Mr. Bush did not call the president, a spokeswoman for him said.Friends and colleagues said Mr. Bush carefully evaluates businesses before working with them. In the case of InnoVida, an aide said, he ran a background check on the founder, a flashy, Maserati-driving businessman named Claudio Osorio. It turned up the bankruptcy of a previous company, the aide said, but nothing to suggest wrongdoing. So Mr. Bush agreed to help market his technology, a construction system that required no cement, steel or wood. There is no evidence that board members were aware of Mr. Osorio\u2019s fraud. But Christopher Korge, an investor in the company and board member, said he recalled talking to Mr. Bush about their shared frustration with the company\u2019s delays in distributing financial information and reluctance to hold regular board meetings.In separate interviews, a lawyer for Mr. Osorio, who pleaded guilty, and a lawyer for a group of investors argued that members of the board had exercised little meaningful oversight of the company. \u201cIt was done\u00a0lackadaisically,\" said David A. Nu\u00f1ez,\u00a0the lawyer whose clients lost millions when InnoVida collapsed. If board members \u201cdid their due diligence, really did it, they would have been able to determine this company was not financially solvent and that it was a fraud,\u201d he said. Mr. Korge, a major Democratic Party fund-raiser who lost millions on his investment in InnoVida, said that once he alerted Mr. Bush to major problems inside the company, the former governor acted swiftly and forcefully to investigate them. \u201cJeb did everything that he should have done to protect the shareholder,\u201d he said.Most of Mr. Bush\u2019s career in business has steered clear of politics, allowing him to carefully hone a potential campaign message by delivering speeches, granting television interviews and writing a book. But not all of his corporate work is in sync with his public brand.Mr. Bush opposed the Affordable Care Act and has called it \u201cflawed to its core,\u201d like many of his potential rivals in the 2016 campaign. But unlike them, he has earned more than $2 million for sitting on the board a company, Tenet Health Care, that has loudly endorsed the legislation. Tenet\u2019s chief executive, Trevor Fetter, said Mr. Bush had made no secret of his objections to the health care overhaul at company meetings. But he suggested that Mr. Bush understood the difference between \u201cpersonal views and what is best for the company.\u201d Mr. Fetter predicts that in 2014, the Affordable Care Act will deliver up to $100 million in new earnings for Tenet.

Highly trained Cubans doing tasks far beneath their intellectual capacity for extra cash \u2014 whether moonlighting or full-time \u2014 are the inheritance of the Castro regime. As so much changes in the country under Ra\u00fal Castro, this remains the same. The last three years have brought tremendous economic reforms to Cuba, particularly in terms of opening up the tourism and small business sectors. The National Assembly has legalized the purchase and sale of property and cars, granted licenses to small businesses and nonprofessional independent contractors, and done away with the exit permits that have restricted Cubans\u2019 travel and migration since 1961. Just last weekend, it slashed government taxes on foreign companies operating in Cuba. And yet one group of Cubans has been systematically excluded from these transformations: professionals, like my gypsy-cab-driving doctor. Until this changes, the country, and the foreign investment it hopes to lure with reforms like this most recent one, will stagnate. It is still illegal for professionals, ranging from engineers to doctors to lawyers to architects, to practice independently. Cuba\u2019s free, meritocratic educational system has made them, the rationale goes, and so their human capital should benefit the state. But in return, they earn paltry state paychecks that hover around $18 to $22 per month. To make ends meet they drive taxis after hours or quit the jobs they were trained for altogether in order to work at restaurants, bars or privately owned shops.There has been some loosening in certain fields. Last month, the government announced that medical professionals would see steep raises in their salaries, offering \u2014 on the high end of the spectrum \u2014 a doctor with two specialties $67 monthly. And last fall, a new law began to allow Cuban professional athletes to sign contracts with foreign leagues and compete for pay abroad. Still, a Cuban can go into business as a party clown but not a lawyer; she can open a bar but not a private clinic.The newest chapter in the reshaping of Cuba\u2019s economy is the law passed on Saturday, which lowers total taxes on foreign businesses from 55 percent to 15 percent (businesses headquartered anywhere but the United States, that is, because of our trade embargo). But Cuban workers don\u2019t stand to benefit much from the change. Should foreign companies be lured to Cuba by better deals, they would not be able to hire professionals as they see fit. Rather, they would still have to contract labor through the Cuban state.This is not to say that independent practice does not happen \u2014 it does. Web programmers take on freelance assignments paid in cash, writers sell books in Spain, architects quietly make renderings for a well-connected family\u2019s new restaurant. Yet these professionals work in the underground economy, without legal protections. Five years ago, before Ra\u00fal Castro\u2019s reforms came into effect, the current generation of entrepreneurs selling religious paraphernalia or spa services were doing the same. Now they are able to be openly compensated for their work. Younger generations of Cubans are daring and savvy; they\u2019re used to a legal landscape that changes monthly. But many young professionals aren\u2019t willing to wait. Too often, they complete the two to three years of social service required to \u201cpay for\u201d their degrees and then leave the country, often for Europe, Latin America or the United States. In 2012, migration statistics shot as high as in the early 1990s, when Cuba plunged into a post-Soviet economic crisis. And the ranks of migrants were bloated with professionals. Back home, an older and more experienced generation, like the cardiologist who picked me up, drives taxis. Cuba\u2019s brain drain doesn\u2019t just cross borders, pushing skilled locals into other economies; necessity, too, forces professionals out of their fields on the island itself. This diminishes the country\u2019s appeal to some of its best citizens, yes \u2014 and to foreign investors as well. To be a professional in Cuba today is still a grim prospect. And until this changes, economic reforms or no, Cuba won\u2019t change much, either. Advertisement"}

But finding work remains tough for those just graduating. Many are settling for jobs outside their fields of study or for less pay than they expected or hoped for. The Labor Department said on Tuesday that the unemployment rate for 2013 college graduates \u2014 defined as those ages 20 to 29 who earned a four-year or advanced degree \u2014 was 10.9 percent. That was down from 13.3 percent in 2012 and was the lowest since 7.7 percent in 2007. The drop reflects the steady recovery in overall economic growth and hiring. But unemployment for recent grads was still higher than the 9.6 percent rate for all Americans ages 20 to 29 last October, when the government collected the numbers.

When he was growing up, his family ran a business where they would buy a couple of trucks, a spare engine, a transmission and supplies, and drive people on safaris from Morocco to South Africa.By his mid-20s, Mr. Fisher had an asset management job in Berlin, which is where he met his wife, an American who was studying for her Ph.D. in ancient history.\u201cThe job was just really dull,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to get back to what I loved; traveling and experiencing new cultures.\u201dAt the time, they traveled to Massachusetts a few times a year to visit Ms. Parent\u2019s family. Mr. Fisher said they used Google Maps, smartphone apps and handwritten notes to find different places to explore.\u201cWe were spending a lot of money on flights, so we just decided to make a trip out of it every time,\u201d he said.As they traveled more, the couple strayed farther from the beaten path, indulging their interest in architecture and checking out museums and cultural phenomena.\u201cWhat I\u2019ve always really enjoyed doing is exploring small towns and going around to the Deep South and finding small communities and crawfish shacks and things like that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was always the local culture stuff that I\u2019ve been interested in.\u201dWhat began as a hunger for new trips to different places gradually evolved into a business.\u201cWe thought, why isn\u2019t there a big website that\u2019s like a TripAdvisor for road travel?\u201d Mr. Fisher said.Admitting they didn\u2019t really know what they were doing initially, he said they found a tech start-up accelerator in Cincinnati that accepted their application. Beginning the process in 2011, he said they had a very basic site that could produce a map with some interesting way points. That was enough to attract investment from a couple of venture capital firms \u2014 CincyTech and Drive Capital \u2014 which have since invested about $3.2 million into the business, said Chelsea Koglmeier, Roadtrippers\u2019 operations manager.Over the last year, its staff has grown from five people to about 40, Ms. Koglmeier said.

{"Headline": "Revolutionizing the Art of Driving in Formula One", "Date": "2014-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial Report: Bahrain Grand PrixThere has been much talk in Formula One over the last few weeks about the silence of the revolutionary, environmentally friendly new racing engines and, to a lesser degree, about the skill of the engineers who built these compact \u201cpower units.\u201d There has been little focus, however, on how the changes are affecting the jobs of the 22 men behind the wheel, who on Sunday will be lining up on the grid for the Bahrain Grand Prix. Formula One had been criticized in recent years for designing cars that were too easy to drive. Now, however, the art of driving these machines goes beyond simply turning a steering wheel and braking and accelerating; it extends into a multitasking world of communicating with engineers, saving fuel, balancing power spurts and caring for tires.Most of the macho and highly competitive Formula One drivers publicly brush off any suggestion that their job has become more difficult, that it is in any way beyond them. Some will at most speak about the most obvious changes. But during unguarded moments, another truth has been seeping through.\u201cI don\u2019t think any race is ever easy,\u201d Lewis Hamilton said after winning the Malaysian Grand Prix in his Mercedes last Sunday. \u201cThere are opportunities that are presented in front of you, and obviously you have to take them with both hands, and today that\u2019s what I did. But looking after the car, looking after fuel, not making any mistakes \u2014 it was a massive challenge in that sense.\u201dDriving has indeed become a different game this season, as new regulations require drivers to come to terms with, among other things, 1.6-liter, 6-cylinder, turbo-charged engines and two separate energy-recuperation systems; a harder tire compound; a reduced minimum car weight; a 100-kilogram, or 220-pound, fuel limit for races; greater top speed; more engine torque, and less aerodynamic downforce, which means less grip in corners. To help sort it all out during races, drivers now rely more on instructions sent by radio from team personnel and engineers, who supply information about when to speed up, slow down, save fuel and make a pit stop, what condition the car is in and much else. A prerequisite for success, therefore, is a driver who communicates well. \u201cThanks to my engineer, we worked together well and we got a great start, and that allowed me to go into second place,\u201d said Nico Rosberg, who finished second in Malaysia in the other Mercedes, after having won the season\u2019s first race, three weeks ago in Australia. \u201cI had a really good start, so I was happy about that because it\u2019s not so easy this year,\u201d he added. \u201cThe rear tires are harder and we have more torque. So it\u2019s very difficult to get it right.\u201dThroughout the history of auto racing, a priority has been making the task of driving easier. As the cars changed, so have the attributes of drivers. In the first part of last century, drivers were often strong, muscular and bulky, while toward the end of the century, the series featured light, jockey-like drivers. The most recent evolution has been from physically fit drivers with strong necks needed to withstand powerful g-force to drivers with a little less muscle and a little more brains required by the latest changes. The innovative, environmentally friendly technology, along with changes in aerodynamics, tires and fuel limits, require drivers to make more mental calculations and to be attentive to their tire use and fuel consumption. In addition, a large portion of their horsepower comes not from the engine but from two energy-recuperation devices, which means drivers must master a new kind of power. \u201cThere is some incredible engineering and some incredible technology going into these cars now and you see the cars move around a lot more,\u201d said Graeme Lowdon, a director of the Marussia team, referring to how cars slide because they have less grip. \u201cThe drivers have got to work and think a lot harder.\u201d As the season unfolds, it is possible that some of the best drivers from previous years will have difficulty adapting to the new cars. But Kimi Raikkonen, a driver at Ferrari who has been struggling with the new car, compared with his teammate, Fernando Alonso, said the new cars did not make a difference for a driver.\u201cI don\u2019t really think that between the top drivers there is an awful lot of difference, whatever the rules are,\u201d he said. \u201cCertainly I think that tires make a big difference between drivers.\u201d Adrian Sutil, at the Sauber team, disagreed. \u201cFor sure, there will be a few that can handle it better, and others that struggle more,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are certain cars for certain drivers. At the moment, for us drivers there are quite a lot of things to learn, and from the drivability, it is just a very different car.\u201dSergio P\u00e9rez, a driver at the Force India team, described the biggest difference as being related to the lack of grip through less downforce. \u201cWe have less grip and more engine torque, so to arrive into a corner you are more likely to overheat the rear tires into the corner because you have less downforce,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then to go on power is also very difficult because you have very limited grip.\u201d\u201cSo I think we are going to be seeing more drivers\u2019 errors this year,\u201d P\u00e9rez added. \u201cOnce the tire degradation starts to kick in \u2014 it\u2019s very difficult to drive these cars with tire degradation. I think the good drivers will come out best in this era, and I think that the driver input is more important this year as well.\u201dSome fans have expressed disappointment that the cars are slower than last year\u2019s models, but Sutil pointed out that while the lap time may be less because of slower cornering, the cars are faster than last year\u2019s in top speed down the straights. He also noted a few other differences.\u201cYou have more torque, which is the biggest difference in the drivability of the engines,\u201d Sutil said. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t rev so high anymore, so it\u2019s a bit easier in the corners to find the gear. Whether you take it in third or fourth gear, it doesn\u2019t really make such a difference: You always have a lot of power and a lot of torque. But at the same time, you have harder tires, you have less grip in the corners from the aerodynamic part. \u201cIt makes it more tricky, it makes it more over-steering. It\u2019s quite a bit of difference.\u201dAll of which requires, as Hamilton noted, acute attention to preservation of the tires and fuel economy, which goes against the grain of a traditional Grand Prix driver.\u201cFuel saving is one of those new challenges,\u201d said Nico Hulkenberg, a driver at Force India, \u201cbut we are all in the same boat, and fuel limit is 100 kilograms and we have to work around that.\u201d \u201cNaturally, a race driver always wants to push every corner, every lap, so it goes against that instinct and that attitude,\u201d he added, \u201cbut you just have to handle it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Africa\u2019s Path to Prosperity", "Date": "2014-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEvery two or three years, African heads of state travel to a foreign capital to be wooed by one or another of the major powers jockeying for position on the continent. China has been among the more prominent organizers of these \u201cAfrica summits,\u201d while Japan, India, Turkey, Brazil and the European Union have all held their own versions. In August, President Obama will join the fray when he invites 47 African leaders to talks on trade and security in Washington.These forums have their merits: They reflect the rising importance of a continent that is home to six of the world\u2019s fastest-growing economies and can provide a platform for the discussion of development plans that can benefit everyone concerned. But to a certain extent they have more to do with geopolitics \u2014 U.S.-China rivalries for example \u2014 rather than global trade.The problem is that they reinforce the image of a continent badly in need of foreign aid to resolve its problems. The truth is that greater cooperation among African states is the most promising route to transforming the continent\u2019s economic fortunes.There is hardly any place that has less interregional trade than Africa. Whereas 68 percent of commerce in Western Europe in the last decade was with other West European nations, and 48 percent within North America is between the United States, Canada and Mexico, interregional trade in all of Africa stands at between 10 and 13 percent.The problems that hobble business in Africa are mostly man-made. Artificial barriers such as high tariffs, inefficient transportation and reluctance to facilitate the free movement of people and goods within regional economic blocs are among the biggest factors. With some exceptions, such as the conflict-ridden South Sudan and the Central African Republic, Sub-Saharan Africa is booming. But more interregional commerce would bring even greater results.In an excellent, but underreported policy paper published in January 2012, the African Union Commission and the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa outlined a road map whose implementation they projected would see intra-African trade rise to 25 percent within a decade. The central idea \u2014 establishing a pan-African free trade area \u2014 would bring an end to tariffs and import quotas, and create a market worth as much as $2.6 trillion, according to the president of South Africa, Jacob Zuma.Anyone familiar with African Union reports knows, of course, that drafting recommendations is the easy part; implementation unfolds at a glacial pace. The proposed free-trade area was first endorsed in a meeting in Abuja in 1991 but has languished in the planning phase, mainly due to protectionism.This is unfortunate because the benefits are so obvious. If the three major regional economic bodies \u2014 the East African Community, the Southern African Development Community and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa \u2014 were to move quickly to establish a single free-trade area, for example, they would form a formidable bloc with a combined population of 530 million.Trade within Africa can also fuel industrialization. Two of the better-exporting nations \u2014 Ghana (which sold 52 percent of its goods and services in Africa in 2008) and Kenya (46 percent) \u2014 send mainly primary goods to markets in Europe but trade manufactured produce within the continent. Some of Ghana\u2019s key exports within Africa that year were processed gold, nonelectrical machinery and aluminum and alloy plate and sheets, contrasted with the cocoa beans, cashew nuts and unprocessed gold it sent overseas.Kenya exported tea, flowers, vegetables and coffee to its main European markets, while its exports to other African countries, excepting tea, were mainly processed goods, including cement, medical products, cigarettes and refined fuel oil. This suggests that easing barriers within Africa might offer a greater incentive for countries to add value to primary products.The ability to expand infrastructure also lies well within the grasp of African leaders. African countries hold cash reserves outside the continent totaling nearly $200 billion. A recent report in The East African, a regional news weekly, on efforts by the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa to get the money invested back in the continent to provide much-needed funds for building infrastructure and reducing deficits, was headlined, appropriately, \u201cRich Beggar Paradox That Is Africa\u2019s Forex Reserves.\u201d With the solutions so well known, it is vital that African leaders find the political will to make way for closer economic ties. Kenya\u2019s new president, Uhuru Kenyatta, moved during his first few months in office to forge a coalition with neighboring Rwanda and Uganda to speed up integration and cut invisible barriers to trade. But he appeared to lose his nerve following a din of complaints from Tanzania, whose leaders take a much more protectionist approach to these issues. National leaders inclined to reap the benefits of integration should just plow ahead and allow the rest of Africa to move at its own speed.On a broader level, the African Union Commission should consider enlisting the services of elder statesmen like former Presidents Festus Mogae of Botswana, Thabo Mbeki of South Africa, Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria and Benjamin Mkapa of Tanzania to serve as its ambassadors to convince Africans to cooperate more closely on the business front. Mr. Mogae, in particular, has often spoken forcefully of the need for integration. \u201cAs we have learned in Botswana,\u201d he said in 2009, \u201cinvestors from wealthier nations are principally attracted to large domestic markets on the continent. Although we lowered taxes, reformed our laws and got attractive credit ratings, we still mostly received greater investment in extractive industries, not quite the diversified capital inflow we hoped for. Speedier integration in most parts of the continent would change that.\u201dAfrica certainly needs to continue engaging the rest of the world. But if its member nations traded more with one another, its leaders would stand a better chance of attending global summit meetings as equals, not supplicants.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ryan\u2019s Budget Would Cut $5 Trillion in Spending Over a Decade", "Date": "2014-04-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The unveiling Tuesday of Representative Paul D. Ryan\u2019s newest Republican budget may have redrawn the battle lines for the 2014 election, detailing what his party could do with complete control of Congress and allowing Democrats to broaden the political terrain beyond health care and the narrower issues of the minimum wage and unemployment benefits.Mr. Ryan, the House Budget Committee chairman and a possible White House contender in 2016, laid out a budget plan that cuts $5 trillion in spending over the next decade. He said it would bring federal spending and taxes into balance by 2024, through steep cuts to Medicaid and food stamps, and the total repeal of the Affordable Care Act just as millions are reaping the benefits of the law.Defense spending would increase. Domestic programs would be reduced to the lowest levels since modern government accounting. And Medicare would be converted into a \u201cpremium support\u201d system, where people 65 and older could buy private insurance with federal subsidies instead of government-paid health care.\u201cWe need to be a proposition party, not just an opposition party,\u201d said Mr. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin. \u201cWe believe we owe it to the country to offer an alternative to the status quo. It\u2019s just that simple.\u201dEven with those tough political choices, the budget would balance in 2024 only because Mr. Ryan is assuming his cuts would prompt a burst of economic growth to raise tax revenues above what independent economists forecast. He also does not adjust the government\u2019s revenue ledger to reflect the cost of repealing the health care law\u2019s tax increases and Medicare cuts, which could total $2 trillion.\u201cThis is what elections are about,\u201d said Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the Budget Committee. \u201cBudgets are the clearest roadmaps for discovering what people\u2019s priorities are.\u201dThe Ryan budget will be formally drafted on Wednesday in the Budget Committee and brought to a House vote on Friday \u2014 if Republican leaders can muster the 217 votes to pass it over the concerns of moderates who say it goes too far and conservatives who say it does not go far enough. Because Senate Democrats do not intend to even draft a budget this year, the Ryan plan will serve more as a political manifesto than a legislative roadmap for the 113th Congress.\u201cIt is not fair, and it is not acceptable to simply sit by and accept the status quo, as Democrats have chosen to do, time and time again,\u201d said Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the majority leader.Regardless of its fate, the budget will be pushed to the forefront of the coming campaigns, both parties say, not only in House races but also in critical Senate contests. In some of those contests, like Senate races in Arkansas, Louisiana, Montana and West Virginia \u2014 where Republicans seek to take seats held by Democrats \u2014 Mr. Ryan\u2019s budget will force them to choose whether to support the plan.\u201cBill Cassidy has repeatedly voted to slash seniors\u2019 retirement benefits and turn Medicare into a voucher program that forces hundreds of thousands of Louisiana seniors to pay thousands more for their health care each year, and now he must own the new reckless G.O.P. budget proposal that does exactly that,\u201d said Andrew Zucker, communications director for the Campaign for Louisiana, a Democratic group criticizing Mr. Cassidy, a House Republican running to unseat Senator Mary L. Landrieu.\u201cWe are going to make this budget the centerpiece of the next seven months,\u201d he said.Republican leaders had considered not doing a budget this year, since spending cuts for the current fiscal year and the next were set in December with passage of a bipartisan plan. But House conservatives demanded a document they could take to their strongly Republican districts.The new budget violates some tenets that both parties have tried to observe since the budget fights of 2011 and 2012. Those fights preserved a practice of cutting defense and nondefense programs almost equally while sparing the poorest Americans from the worst of the belt-tightening.Mr. Ryan\u2019s plan does not strike that balance.In all, Mr. Ryan said, spending would be cut by $5.1 trillion over the next decade. More than $2 trillion of that would come from repealing Mr. Obama\u2019s health care initiative, the Affordable Care Act, a political move that has become much more difficult with the closing of the first enrollment period. More than 10 million Americans have gotten health insurance through the law, either through private policies purchased on insurance exchanges, through expanded Medicaid or private policies purchased through brokers but subsidized by the law.As with past budget proposals, Mr. Ryan seeks to eliminate the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicaid expansion, a $792 billion retrenchment, then turn the health care program for the poor into block grants to the states \u2014 saving an additional $732 billion over the decade. He would turn food stamps into a block grant program and cap spending, starting in 2020, cutting that program by $125 billion in five years. The budget relies on imposing new work requirements on food stamp and welfare recipients.Such an approach \u201cempowers recipients to get off the aid rolls and back on the payrolls,\u201d Mr. Ryan wrote.But the toughest cuts would come from domestic programs that have already been reduced steadily since 2011, when Republicans took control of the House. Mr. Ryan\u2019s 2024 domestic spending figure would be lower in nominal dollars than such spending was in 2005. Adjusted for inflation, it would be a 29 percent cut from today\u2019s levels, and 28 percent below the average level of spending in former President George W. Bush\u2019s administration.Nor did Mr. Ryan shy away from hot-button issues. Education funding would be cut by $145 billion over 10 years. Pell grants for college students would lose $90 billion. University students would start being charged interest on their loans while still in school, reaping $40 billion.Federal subsidies for the National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities, as well as the Corporation for Public Broadcasting \u201ccan no longer be justified,\u201d Mr. Ryan said.An article last Wednesday about Representative Paul D. Ryan\u2019s budget plan and the role it might play in the midterm elections erroneously included one state among those where Republicans are seeking to take Senate seats currently held by Democrats. Georgia is not one of them. (The seat is currently held by Saxby Chambliss, a Republican; he is not seeking re-election.)Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Policy-Making Mystery in the Renminbi\u2019s Decline", "Date": "2014-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 As President Obama visits Asia in a bid to shore up American alliances, he faces an emerging challenge from the region\u2019s behemoth, China, whose currency has experienced a gradual but unrelenting decline over the last 10 days.The fall of the renminbi, which on Friday hit its lowest point since late 2012, is making Chinese exports cheaper in the United States and elsewhere. But the drop is also making it harder for foreign companies to compete in China and other markets where Chinese exporters have a significant presence. The currency\u2019s weakness helps create jobs and limit unemployment in China \u2014 two of the leadership\u2019s stated top goals for the year. But the fall of the currency, which is down 3.3 percent against the dollar since the beginning of this year, also risks hurting employment in other countries and fanning trade tensions.The Obama administration, like the administration of George W. Bush before it, has long put pressure on China to allow faster appreciation, and it has found itself in an awkward position this spring as the currency has begun to move in the opposite direction. The Treasury Department warned on April 15 that the decline in the renminbi\u2019s value \u201cwould raise particularly serious concerns\u201d if it meant that China was continuing to intervene and retreating from its policy of allowing the free market to determine the exchange rate.President Obama and the Treasury have been silent on the Chinese currency during the president\u2019s trip this week. He has already visited Japan and South Korea and plans to make stops in Malaysia and the Philippines.The big mystery lies in how much of the latest decline in the value of the renminbi reflects policy decisions and how much is the result of market worries about slowing economic growth.The slide began at the beginning of the year, when the People\u2019s Bank of China, the country\u2019s central bank, unexpectedly began reducing the midpoint for the renminbi\u2019s daily trading range. The bank set off the latest drop when it again began to push the midpoint slightly lower on most of the trading days from April 14 through last Tuesday. On Friday, the rate was 6.25 renminbi to the dollar.Tiny downward changes in the midpoint caused an exaggerated response in the market. The renminbi fell further and further toward the bottom of the allowable range. Those market declines have continued even as the central bank authorized extremely small daily strengthening of the midpoint on each of the last three days.\u201cWhile we believe the initial moves have been guided by policy makers, the depreciation has gotten a life of its own in recent weeks,\u201d said Tao Wang, head of China economic research at UBS.Yet the recent fall of the renminbi would have been nearly impossible without the acquiescence, and probably the active support, of the Chinese government.Official figures show that the central bank spent an average of $2 billion each trading day over the 12-month period ending on March 31 to buy foreign currencies and sell renminbi. This prevented the renminbi from rising and, more recently, helped weaken it.China had almost $3.95 trillion in foreign reserves at the end of March. So the central bank has had the power to halt practically any fall in the renminbi that attracts official disapproval.Xiao Geng, vice president for research at the Fung Global Institute, a nonpartisan research group in Hong Kong, said he thought the Chinese government was making a mistake in not stopping the fall of the renminbi, because it might erode business confidence if allowed to continue.\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of people trying to move assets out, and they are trying to get U.S. dollars,\u201d he said.A weaker currency has been welcomed by Chinese exporters.After stagnating in previous years, the number of overseas buyers at the last week\u2019s Canton Fair, the country\u2019s main trade show for exporters, jumped 10 percent from a year ago. One of the 24,581 exhibitors at the vast exhibition this year, Yan Xiaowei, said the fall of the renminbi had contributed to a spate of requests from interested foreign buyers for price quotes.Mr. Yan, the general manager of Yunfu Citistone Manufactory, a maker of decorative tiles and wash basins located in Yunfu, a city in southern China\u2019s Guangdong province, said he had resisted cutting prices even as each dollar in export revenue covered more renminbi of his costs.\u201cThe depreciation has helped our bottom line, and with our increased profits, we have been able to stock a better selection of stones,\u201d he said in a telephone interview on Friday.But China is facing persistent concerns about its broader economy. Housing starts and the number of real estate transactions have dropped as buyers hold out for lower prices after a construction boom. But only a few real estate developers have been willing to brave the wrath of earlier purchasers and cut prices for unsold units in apartment towers.Officially recorded unemployment edged down to 4.08 percent in the first quarter from 4.1 percent at the end of 2013, the labor ministry announced on Friday. But actual unemployment is considerably higher, particularly among recent college graduates, who have struggled to find work in an economy that still emphasizes blue-collar sectors like manufacturing and construction.The economic picture has raised worries that China may reverse course on its overhaul efforts in order to stimulate growth. But officials, at least publicly, have expressed their commitment to economic change.\u201cExchange rate reform will continue,\u201d Yi Gang, a deputy governor of the country\u2019s central bank, said at an International Monetary Fund meeting on April 12. That seemed to be a reference partly to China\u2019s gradual widening of the trading band in recent years, including again last month. But he did not address the value of the renminbi, and central bank officials could not be reached for comment on Friday. Hilda Wang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "First You Spend, Then You Save", "Date": "2014-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBehind the Wheel | 2014 BMW 535d10 PhotosThe psychology of saving fuel can get complicated, especially when it involves splurging to go from Point A to Point B. \u201cGreen\u201d luxury models \u2014 from the $75,000 Tesla Model S electric sedan to the $845,000 Porsche 918 Spyder plug-in hybrid \u2014 suggest that the wealthy can preen like Marie Antoinette while still waving the banner of energy independence and standing with the peasants in their Priuses. The BMW 535d doesn\u2019t require quite that kind of royal ransom, but even a staunch proponent of diesel engines may notice the financial commitment required. Yet that commitment has a payoff. Driven through a howling blizzard this winter in upstate New York, my 535d test car stoically chugged through drifting snow while returning 42 miles per gallon \u2014 4 m.p.g. better than the E.P.A. highway estimate. High-mileage Euro-market diesels arriving in America include models from Audi, Chevrolet, Jeep, Mercedes, Porsche and Volkswagen. All have copious torque that makes up for their relatively modest horsepower. BMW\u2019s 3-liter vies with Audi\u2019s 3-liter TDI as the most enthusiast-oriented of the bunch.With an efficient twin-scroll turbocharger, the 6-cylinder engine spins freely to 6,000 r.p.m., an unusually high engine speed for a diesel. And its 255 horsepower tops that of every diesel rival. Combining 413 pound-feet of torque and a paddle-shifted automatic transmission with 8 efficient speeds, this 4,085-pound sedan races from 0 to 60 m.p.h. in just 5.8 seconds. Adding all-wheel drive for $2,300 shaves that time to 5.7 seconds while trimming 1 m.p.g. from the highway rating, to 37.And the diesel Bimmer feels even quicker than the numbers suggest, with peak torque arriving at a low 1,500 r.p.m. for right-now acceleration. BMW has mildly updated the entire 5 Series lineup for 2014. Xenon headlamps are standard, with adaptive LED\u2019s available. New contour lines wrap the twin-kidney grille. The front air intakes are bolder and the taillamps slimmer. An optional feature opens or closes the trunk with the wag of a foot under the rear bumper. The 5 still melts over the road like butter on toast, even if its famously sporty handling has grown more aloof and Lexus-like.In the cabin, BMW avoids fixing what isn\u2019t broken. For all the deserved acclaim heaped on the Cadillac CTS, BMW\u2019s all-day-supportive seats still whip the Cadillac\u2019s standard mush-buckets. Old-school analog driver\u2019s gauges are classic and legible. The huge 10.2-inch display screen, whose iDrive control system adds a touchpad to its oversize rotary knob, is reasonably functional. But BMW needs better contrast for map displays that seem to run 50 shades of gray, to the point that I couldn\u2019t pick out the Hudson River on the map. In other areas, the lock step familiarity of BMW cabins can breed contempt, especially in monochrome black versions. As BMW\u2019s prices migrate steadily north, it\u2019s fair to ask: When are we going to see some new ideas and themes in its interiors? In this 5 Series, the rough-textured leather managed to look dull even when brand-new. But nothing sullied the BMW\u2019s hard-won image like the aluminum \u201chexagon\u201d trim, part of a $3,150 M Sport package. With its dimpled finish and tacked-on appearance, the stuff looks like 1970s lawn furniture. Buyers can choose wood that looks better.The 535d had something else in common with BMWs I\u2019ve tested lately: Even at $66,425 out the door, the test car was notable for things it lacked, including a backup camera, parking sensors and even heated seats. Such features are standard, increasingly, on Chevys, Mazdas and Hyundais. The upside is driving a car that combines Germanic muscle and assurance with small-car economy. Mash the gas, and after a half-beat of turbo lag, the 535d scoots with a muted rumble.With its 18.5-gallon tank, the 535d can cover 700 highway miles between fill-ups. Fuel savings are bolstered by features like BMW\u2019s still-obtrusive engine stop-start function, a coasting mode, brake energy regeneration and an Eco Pro setting that optimizes settings for the throttle, transmission and climate control to maximize efficiency. At $57,525 to start, the 535d costs $7,100 more than the most basic 5 Series, the 528i. But the diesel model handily beats the 23/34 m.p.g. rating of the 528i, which has a 4-cylinder 240-horsepower turbo gas engine.In a more apples-to-apples performance comparison versus the 6-cylinder gasoline 535i, the diesel sets you back an extra $1,500. According to the Energy Department\u2019s fueleconomy.gov site, the typical 535d owner will spend $2,000 a year on diesel fuel. That owner would save $200 a year versus the 4-cylinder 528i, $450 a year over the gasoline 535i and $950 a year compared with the 8-cylinder 550i. Drive the 535d for three and a half years, and fuel savings will essentially make up for the extra $1,500 you spent. Either way, you\u2019ve saved no real money, but you spent $65,000 on a 5 Series. Which proves that calculators aren\u2019t much help when it comes to buying a BMW.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Competition Intensifies in Vietnam\u2019s Aviation Sector", "Date": "2014-03-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam \u2014 Chien Anh, a restaurant manager here, used to fly on either Vietnam Airlines, the state-owned flag carrier, or the budget airline it mostly owns, Jetstar Pacific. But after the private VietJet Air started flights in 2011, Mr. Anh\u2019s loyalty began to shift.As of late last year, the start-up accounted for about a quarter of the seats on domestic flights, compared with 63 percent for Vietnam Airlines and 12 percent for Jetstar Pacific, according to the CAPA-Center for Aviation, an aerospace consulting firm.Compared with the flag carrier, VietJet is \u201ca little cheaper and the service is the same,\u201d Mr. Anh, 32, said recently at a baggage-claim carousel in Tan Son Nhat International Airport in Ho Chi Minh City after touching down in a packed VietJet flight from Hanoi.Competition is heating up in Vietnam\u2019s aviation sector just as Vietnam Airlines and other state-owned companies are considering plans for initial public offerings this year. Analysts see changes in the aviation sector as a potential bellwether of how the country\u2019s economic reform agenda may take shape in the longer term.Pham Ngoc Minh, chief executive of Vietnam Airlines, said the carrier was \u201con the right track\u201d for an I.P.O. in the second quarter of 2014, pending approval from Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung.\u201cThe development of more and more airlines has brought an overall expansion in traffic in the industry,\u201d Mr. Minh wrote in an email when asked about VietJet\u2019s rising domestic market share. \u201cIt is good for the customer because it gives them more choice.\u201dMr. Minh said that the government would initially retain a 65 to 75 percent share in Vietnam Airlines and that Jetstar Pacific, which he said would have 10 airplanes this year, planned to compete in the low-cost market. Vietnam Airlines will stay focused on its full-service business and increase its fleet to 150 planes, from 82, by 2020, he added.Stephen Moynihan, a spokesman in Australia for Jetstar Airways, a member of the Jetstar Group, declined to answer questions sent by email about Jetstar Pacific\u2019s strategic plans in Vietnam. Jetstar Airways is wholly owned by Qantas, the Australian airline; Qantas owns 30 percent of Jetstar Pacific.Vietnam Airlines is the only one of Southeast Asia\u2019s six main flag carriers that is not publicly listed, according to Brendan Sobie, an analyst at the CAPA-Center for Aviation. He said the company had not publicized details of its restructuring plans or begun a response to VietJet\u2019s domestic challenge.Airlines controlled by governments typically struggle to remain competitive because of state interference, and Vietnam Airlines might have trouble attracting investors when it sells shares, said Shukor Yusof, an aviation analyst at the ratings agency Standard & Poor\u2019s.Although it remains privately held for now, VietJet plans to have an I.P.O. in Singapore or Hong Kong in 2015, Luu Duc Khanh, the airline\u2019s managing director, said in an interview at the company\u2019s Ho Chi Minh City headquarters. He offered no further details.VietJet said in February that it had completed an agreement, worth $9.1 billion at list prices, to buy 63 aircraft, with an option to buy 30 more \u2014 a sharp expansion from the current fleet of 11.Aviation analysts say VietJet may continue to grow rapidly in the domestic market, just as AirAsia once did in its home territory of Malaysia. But, they add, the airline will face intense competition as it begins competing regionally with AirAsia and other low-cost carriers.Mr. Khanh brushed aside skepticism, saying that VietJet began making a profit after 19 months of operation and that it plans to fly within the next three to five years not only across Asia, but also to Europe and the United States. He added that the target market was Vietnam\u2019s rising middle class and the large Vietnamese diaspora, and that VietJet\u2019s first joint venture outside Vietnam would begin in Thailand in June with five routes.\u201cOur main competitor is ourself,\u201d Mr. Khanh said, adding that the company has stopped referring to itself as \u201clow cost\u201d in favor of \u201cnew age.\u201dHe declined to provide the full names of the company\u2019s major investors.An analysis of publicly available information suggests that VietJet\u2019s investors and executives have deep ties across the government, the banking sector and state-owned companies.Mr. Khanh is the former general director of An Binh Commercial Joint Stock Bank, whose strategic domestic partner is Vietnam Electricity, the state-owned power monopoly. He is also chief executive of VietJet\u2019s main shareholder, Sovico Holdings, a Vietnamese firm with investments in an arm of PetroVietnam, the state oil and gas monopoly.Both Mr. Khanh and VietJet\u2019s chief executive and vice chairwoman, Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao, sit on the board at another VietJet shareholder, HDBank, whose chairwoman, Le Thi Bang Tam, is a former vice finance minister. Ms. Thao is HDBank\u2019s general director as well as Sovico\u2019s executive chairwoman.Dinh Viet Phuong, one of Sovico\u2019s deputy general directors, previously held senior positions at the bus and truck maker Vinamotor and other large companies owned by the government.Mr. Khanh said VietJet Air worked well with the government but received no special treatment. \u201cWe bring aircraft in, we fly people, we support the economy, and the government supports us in terms of infrastructure,\u201d he said.An I.P.O. by Vietnam Airlines might be a trial balloon that leads to systemic economic changes by Vietnamese leaders, said Edmund J. Malesky, a Vietnam expert and a professor of political science at Duke University. But he cautioned that merely offering stock in the most successful corners of the vast state sector would not be lucrative because so many inefficient state companies are draining public coffers.\u201cIt\u2019s got to be everywhere, and they know that \u2014 these are smart guys,\u201d Mr. Malesky said.Mr. Dung, the prime minister, has pledged to accelerate economic overhauls, and early indications are that the one-party government is willing to reform a wasteful and outdated state sector that has long been a drag on the economy, according to analysts and businessmen who follow Vietnam\u2019s political system. That is a topic of considerable interest to the United States and Europe, which are negotiating trade agreements with Vietnam.But there has been no clear guidance from the government about the exact scale or depth of planned changes at state-owned companies, and it is also unclear which sectors will remain sheltered by the state, and whether those companies even want to go public as the economy struggles to grow. Dominic Scriven, chief executive at Dragon Capital, an investment company in Ho Chi Minh City, said that the overhaul of state-owned companies could eventually help the government reduce net borrowing but that a more immediate effect would be raising investor confidence.Vietnam\u2019s government, he added, may follow China\u2019s approach of \u201cboxing in\u201d such companies and allowing the private sector to grow around them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Germans Loosen Their Purse Strings", "Date": "2014-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 When Europe seemed to be falling apart in 2010, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund annoyed Germans by suggesting they should stop hoarding so much of their wealth and instead buy more things from their ailing European neighbors.Now it looks as if Germany is finally delivering.Statistics on German trade published on Wednesday showed a sharp increase in imports from the euro zone and the broader European Union. While monthly trade figures are subject to big fluctuations, the data reinforced other recent indications that Germans are finally spending more and helping to lift up the whole continent.The browbeatings that Christine Lagarde, the I.M.F. managing director, has periodically inflicted on policy makers in Berlin probably had little to do with the jump in German imports from other euro zone countries, which rose 8.4 percent in February compared with a year earlier.Until recently the government led by Chancellor Angela Merkel has done little to stimulate consumer spending, as Ms. Lagarde urged. Rather, the gradual increase reflects the bigger pay increases that German workers have been able to negotiate, as well as very cheap credit. In addition, price declines in countries like Spain have made products like Serrano ham or Seat automobiles more attractive to German buyers.\u201cNow is a good time,\u201d Frank Siebert, 51, said on Wednesday in Berlin as he browsed in a high-end audio equipment store in the new Bikini Berlin shopping center. He said he was in the market for new speakers. \u201cSpending a few hundred euros is no problem,\u201d said Mr. Siebert, a real estate salesman. \u201cIt should definitely be something high end.\u201dIn contrast to the huge surpluses that have been typical in recent years, Germany bought almost as much from its neighbors in February as it sold to them. German exports to the euro zone totaled 34.9 billion euros, or $48.2 billion, in February, a 3.7 percent increase from a year earlier. That compares with the 8.4 percent jump in imports, which were valued at \u20ac34.6 billion, according to the German Federal Statistical Office.German exports worldwide rose 4.6 percent during February to \u20ac92.4 billion.\u201cGerman trade with the euro zone is rebalancing,\u201d said Christian Schulz, a senior economist at Berenberg Bank. \u201cThe rest of the euro zone is becoming more competitive.\u201dThe increase in imports from the rest of Europe is mostly good news, economists say, especially for countries like Greece and Italy that suffer from very high unemployment and desperately need customers for their exports. But some analysts warn that Germany, which has Europe\u2019s largest economy, could be squandering hard-fought gains in competitiveness.Much of Germany\u2019s economic revival in the last decade was a result of wage restraint by labor unions, who sought modest pay raises in return for promises of job security. Recently, though, workers have been demanding a bigger share of Germany\u2019s economic success.Last week public-service workers won a 3 percent raise, while Ms. Merkel\u2019s government has proposed a law to introduce a minimum wage of 8.50 euros per hour. Germany has no legal minimum wage, though most workers are covered by agreements between employers and labor unions.German wages have barely kept pace with consumer price increases during the last decade; adjusted for inflation, they fell slightly in 2013. Workers have less bargaining power because companies can move production to countries like Poland that are members of the European Union but where wages are much lower.But as the economic recovery is giving workers more leverage with employers, Germans consumers are finding themselves with more money, some of which is flowing abroad. J\u00f6rg Kr\u00e4mer, the chief economist of Commerzbank, argued that German policies were eroding the discipline that allowed its economy to become the envy of the rest of Europe.In an analysis published last week, Mr. Kr\u00e4mer said that in five years Germany could be suffering the same economic stagnation now afflicting France. A decade ago, he pointed out, Germany was the sick man of Europe while France seemed to be thriving. But France undercut its competitiveness with measures such as a 35-hour workweek, which raised costs for business, Mr. Kr\u00e4mer said. Germany risks doing the same thing by raising wages too much, he said.In addition, he said, German consumer spending is benefiting from interest rates set by the European Central Bank that are probably too low for the German economy. The current benchmark rate of 0.25 percent is designed primarily to help crisis countries like Greece or Italy.Germany will continue to look like a powerhouse for several years, Mr. Kr\u00e4mer said, because of the cheap credit and wage increases. But eventually Germany will pay the price, he said.\u201cSomewhere down the road there will be a new crisis,\u201d Mr. Kr\u00e4mer said on Wednesday. \u201cThen the erosion in price competitiveness will be visible.\u201dFor now few ordinary Germans are troubling themselves with such questions. At 5.1 percent, unemployment in the country is the second-lowest in the euro zone after Austria and less than half the average for the currency union. Thrifty and risk-averse Germans have become more willing to spend in recent months as the euro zone crisis subsided.Daniela Fabienke, a 39-year-old banker who was inspecting tablet computers in a Berlin shop, said she had already budgeted money for family expenses during the coming year, including vacations, and still had enough left over. \u201cI just need the right product and I\u2019ll buy myself the new toy,\u201d she said.There are signs that German retail spending, which for years had grown very slowly, if at all, has begun to pick up. Retail sales in February were 2 percent higher than a year earlier adjusted for inflation, according to the statistical office. Many people see the increase in shopping as a healthy sign that German workers are getting their just reward after years of prudence.Holger Schmieding, the chief economist at Berenberg Bank, said he doubted that wage increases, still rather modest, were going to undercut German competitiveness. A bigger risk is Germany\u2019s switch from nuclear power to renewable energy, which will raise energy prices, he said.\u201cThe current wage settlements of around 3 percent are no threat to competitiveness at all,\u201d Mr. Schmieding said in an email.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Satellites Show Russian Forces Poised Near Ukraine", "Date": "2014-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 NATO released satellite photographs on Thursday showing Russian military equipment, including fighter jets and tanks, that it described as part of a deployment of as many as 40,000 troops near the border with Ukraine. The release came the same day that President Vladimir V. Putin reiterated a threat to curtail gas sales to Ukraine. Officials said they had distributed commercial photographs, rather than pictures taken by military satellites, because of the complexities of declassifying classified images. The United States government has a contractual arrangement with DigitalGlobe, based in Colorado, that allows images taken by the company to be shared among federal agencies, as well as with American allies. At the news conference on Thursday, Brigadier Deakin said the photographs showed a menacing force. \u201cThe Russians have an array of capabilities, including aircraft, helicopters, special forces, tanks, artillery, infantry fighting vehicles,\u201d Brigadier Deakin said, according to a NATO news release. \u201cThese could move in a matter of hours.\u201dThe photographs were taken between March 22 and April 2. One image shows more than 20 helicopters near the Russian city of Belgorod, about 25 miles from the Ukrainian border. Other images were taken farther from the border, including at Yeysk and Primorsko-Akhtarsk, across the Sea of Azov from Ukraine. In addition to accusing the West of exaggerating Russia\u2019s military presence, the Kremlin said on Thursday that any stationing of NATO troops near Russia\u2019s borders would be a violation of international agreements. The Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, said in an interview with the Interfax news service that NATO was prepared to breach those accords \u201cin order to satisfy absolutely groundless fears, phobias and ambitions of a minority of its country members.\u201d In a letter to European leaders on Thursday, Mr. Putin warned that Russia would probably start forcing Ukraine to pay a month in advance for natural gas or risk being cut off. He said in the letter that Russia had worked aggressively in recent years to support Ukraine financially, and he accused the West of exploiting Ukraine and damaging its economy. \u201cTo a large extent, the crisis in Ukraine\u2019s economy has been precipitated by the unbalanced trade with the E.U. member states, and this, in turn, has had a sharply negative impact on Ukraine\u2019s fulfillment of its contractual obligations to pay for deliveries of natural gas supplied by Russia,\u201d Mr. Putin wrote, referring to the European Union. He noted that Russia had offered Ukraine billions of dollars in loans. \u201cWhat about the European partners?\u201d Mr. Putin asked. \u201cInstead of offering Ukraine real support, there is talk about a declaration of intent. There are only promises that are not backed up by any real actions.\u201d Mr. Putin said the West\u2019s refusal to take Russia into account had left the Kremlin no choice but to demand advance payment for gas. A cutoff could threaten Europe, he added, if Ukraine tried to siphon off gas passing through its territory. Europe receives about 13 percent of its gas supply from pipelines running through Ukraine, though it has worked in recent years to reduce that dependence. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In New Tack, I.M.F. Aims at Income Inequality", "Date": "2014-04-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneStay with me. Don\u2019t go. This is not another column about global financial bureaucracy.To suffering government officials from developing countries who have knocked on its door seeking cash over the years, the abbreviation for the International Monetary Fund has long been understood to mean \u201cIt\u2019s Mostly Fiscal\u201d \u2014 a play on the lending institution\u2019s single-minded focus on spending cuts.As guarantor of global economic stability, the I.M.F. long defined success narrowly: sustained growth, low inflation and a balanced budget. The distribution of income, its many critics charged, ranked far too low on its list of interests, if it appeared at all.\u201cI hear people say, \u2018Why do you bother about inequality? It is not the core mandate.\u2019 Well, sorry, it is also part of the mandate,\u201d Ms. Lagarde told me. \u201cOur mandate is financial stability. Anything that is likely to rock the boat financially and macroeconomically is within our mandate.\u201dThe new emphasis is hugely important. The International Monetary Fund is the standard-bearer of the so-called Washington Consensus, promoting open markets, small government and limited regulation as the secret sauce of success for the developing world \u2014 however the fruits of this success happened to be distributed.Its new leanings suggest the emergence of perhaps a new consensus: Economic policy cannot be only about promoting low inflation and robust growth. Healthy, stable economies also depend on a reasonably equitable distribution of the rewards.Still, she acknowledges that the I.M.F. is paying more attention now. \u201cBecause inequality rose, we had to look at it more carefully and look at whether rising inequality in those societies in the postcrisis period in particular was relevant for the macroeconomic analysis that we do.\u201dBut the newfound attention to income inequality isn\u2019t just another facet of a more liberal, Keynesian economic worldview. The fund\u2019s economists have been producing research that suggests that inequality could make the world economy less stable.A flatter distribution of income, the study concluded, contributes more to sustainable economic growth than the quality of a country\u2019s political institutions, its foreign debt and openness to trade, its foreign investment and whether its exchange rate is competitive.\u201cRedistribution can cut both ways,\u201d Mr. Ostry told me. \u201cIf the government safety net is going to rule out the really bad outcomes, I might take more risk and thus help the economy grow. But if the government is going to take away my wealth if I take risks, then I won\u2019t take the risks.\u201dMr. Ostry and his colleagues found in the data that efforts at redistribution were generally benign. Extreme efforts at redistribution might hamper growth, but even then the pro-growth effects of greater equality cancel out its growth-slowing impact.And while the links between inequality, redistribution and stability may be hard to pin down with certainty, they are not hard to imagine.Deep inequality breeds resentment and political instability, discouraging investment. It can lead to political polarization and gridlock, as it cleaves the political system between the interests of the haves and the have-nots. And it can make it more difficult for governments to deal with brewing crises and economic imbalances.It would be a mistake \u201cto focus on growth and let inequality take care of itself,\u201d Mr. Ostry and colleagues wrote, \u201cnot only because inequality may be ethically undesirable but also because the resulting growth may be low and unsustainable.\u201dThe I.M.F.\u2019s new emphasis could make a difference for the fund\u2019s clients. Mexico, where I grew up, was run for much of the 1980s under the aegis of some agreement or other with the fund, aimed at restoring the country\u2019s finances and preventing a default on its foreign debt.It is a period known to Mexicans as \u201cthe lost decade.\u201d Public payrolls were culled. Unemployment soared. Wages collapsed. Poverty jumped.And Mexico\u2019s lopsided distribution of income got worse. According to the World Bank, the share of income taken by the top 10 percent of Mexicans rose to 40 percent in 1992, from 35 percent in 1984. The portion of the pie going to the poorest tenth shrank to 1.6 percent, from 1.9 percent.Ms. Lagarde said the fund was taking this new awareness to heart. \u201cWhen a country member asks for help and we design together with that country a program, we have that in mind,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we redesign energy subsidies with that country, we have that in mind. When we try to put in place a social safety net for the poor, we have that in mind. When we recommend better financing of pension schemes, we have that in mind.\u201dThe world may be a safer place for it.Email: eporter@nytimes.com; \nTwitter: @portereduardo Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Eyes on 2016, Perry Is Mired in the Past", "Date": "2014-04-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAUSTIN, Tex. \u2014 The last nine months of Rick Perry\u2019s tenure as the longest-serving governor of Texas were supposed to be a political victory lap.Greg Abbott, the Republican state attorney general, and Wendy Davis, the Democratic state senator, both of whom are vying to replace Mr. Perry, have been sparring across Texas. Meanwhile Mr. Perry has been traveling the country and the world promoting the robust Texas economy and bolstering his national profile as he considers another run for president in 2016. Mr. Perry, who began serving as governor in December 2000 and who leaves office in January 2015 after deciding not to seek re-election, has gone to great lengths to show he is not the same man he was during his disastrous 2012 presidential bid, including wearing designer eyeglasses to enhance his statesmanlike appearance.But in recent days, Mr. Perry\u2019s final months in office have been interrupted by a political and legal problem at home, one that could haunt him on the campaign trail should he run for president and that his Democratic critics are using to accuse him of punishing his political enemies.Mr. Perry is the subject of a criminal investigation in Austin over his handling of the local district attorney\u2019s drunken driving arrest and the state financing for a public corruption unit under the district attorney\u2019s control. Though it remains unclear what the outcome will be, the case has been taken seriously by the governor\u2019s office, the special state district judge handling it and the special prosecutor the judge appointed to investigate. Mr. Perry has hired a defense lawyer, David Botsford. And a grand jury was seated Monday to hear the case, though it was not expected to make any decisions on possible indictments for weeks or months.It started one night last April.Travis County sheriff\u2019s deputies responding to a call about a motorist driving recklessly found the district attorney, Rosemary Lehmberg, in a church parking lot with an open bottle of vodka on the front passenger seat. She was arrested on drunken driving charges and was captured on video acting belligerently during the booking process. She pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 45 days in jail.The district attorney holds a special power in Austin. Ms. Lehmberg oversees the Public Integrity Unit, which investigates wrongdoing by local, state and federal officials. It was the unit\u2019s work in 2005 that led to the indictment of Tom DeLay, the former congressman, on charges of violating state campaign finance laws.After Ms. Lehmberg\u2019s arrest, Mr. Perry and his aides threatened in public remarks to veto $7.5 million in state dollars for the Public Integrity Unit unless she resigned. He later carried through on his threat, vetoing the money and stating he could not support \u201ccontinued state funding for an office with statewide jurisdiction at a time when the person charged with ultimate responsibility of that unit has lost the public\u2019s confidence.\u201dThe special prosecutor \u2014 Michael McCrum, a San Antonio lawyer and a former federal prosecutor \u2014 is looking into whether Mr. Perry violated state laws with his veto threat, including coercion of a public servant and abuse of official capacity. The crimes range from misdemeanors to felonies. The legal questions involve not only Mr. Perry\u2019s veto itself but also the public threat that preceded it, and whether the threat rises to the level of a crime under state law. The criminal proceeding began after the nonprofit Texans for Public Justice filed a complaint against Mr. Perry.A spokeswoman for the governor, Lucy Nashed, said his office had retained Mr. Botsford \u201cto ensure the special prosecutor receives the facts in this matter.\u201d She said Mr. Perry stood by his actions.\u201cThe facts will show this veto was made in accordance with the veto power afforded to every governor under the Texas Constitution,\u201d Ms. Nashed said in a statement. Mr. McCrum said that he was proceeding with the investigation, but that it was inappropriate for him to elaborate on comments he had already made. In an interview with The Austin American-Statesman and KVUE-TV, Mr. McCrum said he was concerned about the actions of Mr. Perry and his aides.\u201cI cannot elaborate on what exactly is concerning me, but I can tell you that I am very concerned about certain aspects of what happened here,\u201d Mr. McCrum said. \u201cI have not prejudged this. We\u2019re still looking into matters to evaluate whether or not a crime has occurred. Governor Perry expects that. The citizenry of Texas expects that. And I intend to look into this as thoroughly as possible.\u201dMs. Lehmberg refused to step down after her arrest and remains the district attorney. Though the public corruption unit lost the state financing, county officials used local dollars to keep it operational, though it went from having 35 employees to around 22. A spokesman for Ms. Lehmberg said she was not commenting on the case. A previous grand jury was sworn in last year to determine whether Ms. Lehmberg should be removed for misconduct, but its term expired and it did not seem to consider the issues surrounding Mr. Perry\u2019s threat and veto.Complicating matters for Mr. Perry was the timing of his veto, and his role in choosing Ms. Lehmberg\u2019s successor.Mr. Perry would have appointed a district attorney to replace Ms. Lehmberg had she stepped down. His appointee would probably have been a Republican. Ms. Lehmberg is a Democrat. In addition, the unit she oversees was investigating, at the time of the veto, a state agency called the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas. The agency finances cancer research and prevention programs and has been championed by Mr. Perry, but it came under attack amid allegations of corruption. A former agency executive was indicted in December for his handling of an $11 million grant awarded to a company without proper review.Democrats have pounced on Mr. Perry over the criminal inquiry, saying it was the first time since 1917 that a Texas governor had faced possible indictment, while Republicans have defended him. Political observers, meanwhile, have been skeptical that Mr. Perry will be indicted.\u201cThis is one of those cases where you\u2019re trying to criminalize politics,\u201d said Calvin C. Jillson, the author of \u201cTexas Politics: Governing the Lone Star State.\u201d He added: \u201cHe thought that he saw a political opponent weakened and that he would tip her over. It was hardball politics, but it was by no means criminal activity.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Terror Suit Against Jordanian Bank Tests U.S. Diplomacy and Secrecy Laws", "Date": "2014-04-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In 2004, relatives of some American citizens killed or injured by terrorist attacks in Israel sought redress in an unusual way. They filed a multibillion-dollar lawsuit against Arab Bank, the largest financial institution in Jordan, accusing it of transferring funds to Hamas leaders and other terrorists responsible for the attacks.A decade later, the case has provoked a significant split in the Obama administration, according to current and former officials, pitting the State Department, which wants the administration to come to the bank\u2019s aid, against the Treasury and Justice Departments, which want the government to stay out of it. The case is scheduled to go to trial in August. But Arab Bank has asked the Supreme Court to intervene now and overturn sanctions imposed by the trial judge when the bank refused to turn over private customer records. The Supreme Court has asked whether the government thinks it should hear the case, and the Obama administration is at an impasse over what to tell the justices.The quandary facing the administration stems from the unusual trade-offs between issues that are rarely linked, including diplomatic efforts to achieve Middle East peace, the rights of American victims of terrorism, and an American campaign to tear down Swiss banking secrecy laws that have long aided tax evasion.The lawsuit was filed in Federal District Court in Brooklyn. Known as Linde v. Arab Bank, in its current form it focuses on the deaths of 39 Americans and the injury of 102 others in two dozen terrorist attacks during the second intifada in the early 2000s. The plaintiffs contend the Jordanian bank transferred money to Hamas leaders and administered a Saudi-funded program that paid a standard benefit of $5,316 to thousands of families of people killed in the conflict with Israel, including several suicide bombers. The judge also restricted the bank\u2019s ability to present information to the jury that could rebut that conclusion, such as bringing up the secrecy laws. Arab Bank called those sanctions \u201cdraconian\u201d and appealed. The Office of the State Department Legal Adviser, the officials said, has strongly urged Mr. Verrilli to back Supreme Court intervention on behalf of Arab Bank. It cited the role Jordan plays as an American ally on matters like the war in Syria, counterterrorism investigations and the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.The State Department\u2019s arguments appear to closely track those made by the government of Jordan, which hired Neal K. Katyal, a former acting solicitor general in the Obama administration, to file a brief before the Supreme Court. The bank has hired Paul Clement, who served as solicitor general in the George W. Bush administration.The Jordanian brief said the country is a vital ally of Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s renewed peace efforts between Israel and Palestinians. And it warned that proceeding to a trial under the sanctions order \u201ccould devastate the bank,\u201d and destabilize the economies of Jordan, the Palestinian territories, and the surrounding region.On the other side are some lawyers with the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division and with the appellate section of its Civil Division who are reluctant to have the government intervene against American victims of terrorist attacks, officials said.The Justice Department\u2019s Tax Division and the Treasury Department have raised a different concern: The Internal Revenue Service is cracking down on tax evasion, and if the Justice Department says foreign bank secrecy laws should take precedence, it could complicate their efforts to overcome such laws in Switzerland and elsewhere, officials said.Swiss banking secrecy laws were an impenetrable barrier for generations. But in 2009, amid the financial crisis, the Swiss government and UBS agreed to turn over information about accounts belonging to Americans, and UBS paid a $780 million fine. The United States has built on that precedent to seek access throughout the Swiss banking system, and may expand that effort to Luxembourg, Israel and Hong Kong, said William Sharp of Sharp Partners, an international law firm that focuses on taxation issues.\u201cTo say that this Lebanese and Jordanian information is protected by secrecy laws would seem to be contrary to what is going on within the Department of Justice and the I.R.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand why D.O.J. and the I.R.S. would not be happy with this.\u201dProponents of helping Arab Bank have argued that Mr. Verrilli could say that respect for foreign bank secrecy laws should give way when the government seeks information to enforce laws, but not when people sue for civil damages, officials said. But internal critics of intervening have argued that the bank can make that argument itself.\u201cAll we want is a fair trial,\u201d he said. \u201cWe feel there are very compelling defenses, and we\u2019d like to be able to present them.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bye-Bye, Baby", "Date": "2014-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionAt just over two births per woman (down from nearly four in 1957 at the peak of the baby boom), the United States is more fertile than most other rich countries, like Germany and Japan. In large, emerging economies where labor is still relatively cheap \u2014 places like Brazil, Russia, Iran, much of southern India \u2014 fertility rates have steadily fallen since the 1980s. The working-age population in China, an economic miracle over the last 35 years, may have peaked in 2012, fueling planners\u2019 fears that China will grow old before it gets rich.Very high national fertility rates have not disappeared, but they are now mostly concentrated in a single region: sub-Saharan Africa. Last year, all five countries with estimated total fertility rates (the average number of births per woman) at six or higher \u2014 Niger, Mali, Somalia, Uganda and Burkina Faso \u2014 were there. So were nearly all of the 18 countries with fertility rates of five or more (the exceptions were Afghanistan and East Timor).Sub-Saharan Africa also makes up a substantial portion of countries with estimated fertility rates between three and four: Notable exceptions include Iraq, Jordan, the Philippines and Guatemala. Fertility rates just under three were reported in countries like Pakistan, Egypt, Haiti, Honduras and Bolivia.These dark prophecies have a long history, and they are as misguided as they are unoriginal. Theodore Roosevelt warned of Anglo-Saxon \u201crace suicide\u201d and, during the Depression, books like \u201cTwilight of Parenthood\u201d (1934) caught the Western public\u2019s imagination. After the powerful (and largely unanticipated) baby boom in the West, the chorus of calamity resumed. Dire Malthusian projections of mass starvation resulting from population growth outstripping the food supply \u2014 fear-mongering briefly revived after the end of the baby boom by Paul R. Ehrlich\u2019s 1968 book, \u201cThe Population Bomb\u201d \u2014 were discredited. But the march of fear continued, with evocatively titled books like \u201cThe Birth Dearth\u201d (1987) and \u201cThe Empty Cradle\u201d (2004).In reality, slower population growth creates enormous possibilities for human flourishing. In an era of irreversible climate change and the lingering threat from nuclear weapons, it is simply not the case that population equals power, as so many leaders have believed throughout history. Lower fertility isn\u2019t entirely a function of rising prosperity and secularism; it is nearly universal.The new hand-wringing stems from a gross misunderstanding of the glacial nature of population change.Even when the total fertility rate falls below 2.1 children, the \u201cmomentum\u201d effects of earlier fertility trends will keep a population growing for many decades. In cases when the absolute size of a national population declines, the drop often turns out to be short-lived, and in aggregate numbers usually is so slight as to be of little significance.THERE are exceptions, of course. After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Russia experienced an unusual combination of rapid fertility decline to very low levels (falling to about 1.2 in 1999) coupled with remarkably high mortality for adult males \u2014 the latter largely attributable to alcohol abuse. This singular combination did produce a modest, and widely reported, decline in the Russian population. The Russian fertility rate has rebounded to just over 1.6, and mortality among working-age men has declined, perhaps because of concerted alcohol-regulation measures.In nearly all countries that are not desperately poor, women of childbearing age inevitably compare the burdens of bearing children against the potential rewards. And in many of these countries, young women especially, but also young men, increasingly see marriage and childbearing as major risks, given high divorce rates and the responsibility to support aging parents, who are enjoying longer lives. The task of assessing these risks is heaviest for young adults (ages 20 to 35), who happen to be the same people who produce the most births in all societies. In Brazil, Italy, Turkey and the United States, these young adults must prepare for careers that now require extended years of higher education and, often, high levels of debt. Even with college degrees, employment is uncertain and career paths are increasingly unstable.Meanwhile, dual-earner partnerships have become essential, in countries rich and poor alike, even as earnings have become increasingly precarious. High home prices and rents, along with limited access to mortgages, have restricted the ability to create the independent homes typically considered essential for new families.Rapidly declining fertility \u2014 especially if rates go very low \u2014 does pose challenges. Yet it also can provide substantial benefits that have received less attention.First, as noted, fertility decline is associated nearly everywhere with greater rights and opportunities for women. The deferral of marriage and the reduction of births to two, one or none across so much of the world \u2014 and, again, in countries that are still far from rich \u2014 are broadly consistent with the higher educational attainment and career aspirations of young women. It is no surprise that the hand-wringers over fertility decline are usually men.Second, the work forces of societies with low-to-moderate fertility rates often achieve higher levels of productivity than do higher fertility societies. This is one reason China\u2019s economic growth far outstripped India\u2019s from 1970 to 2010 \u2014 a period when fertility declined rapidly in China (though only partly because of the one-child policy, now being relaxed) but did not decline as much in most of India.Substantial fertility declines in southern India, notably in the state of Kerala, have been associated with significant economic and educational gains. It is not hard to figure out why. Children, teenagers and young adults are generally less productive than middle-aged workers with more experience, especially as employment in services rises and physical labor in agriculture and industry declines.The fewer children who need primary and secondary education, the more resources there are that can be invested in higher-quality education per child \u2014 especially crucial for younger children \u2014 and in expanding access to higher and continuing education for teenagers and young adults.Although China, in the early stages of its economic rise, benefited by tapping into a large pool of rural migrants moving to low-wage manufacturing jobs in towns and cities, the country is clearly trying to move rapidly (perhaps too rapidly) toward mass higher education, from which it anticipates rising productivity from a slower-growing but higher-paid work force.Third, by enhancing the employment and career experiences of young adults, lower fertility can also bring about greater social and political stability. High-fertility societies commonly produce large numbers of young adults who have trouble finding productive employment \u2014 many experts have attributed everything from terrorism to the Arab Spring to this \u201cyouthquake\u201d of disaffected young adults in the Middle East and North Africa \u2014 but this begins to change 20 to 30 years after fertility rates start to decline.By then, young adults are no longer in great surplus relative to labor market demand; their relative economic value for employers begins to rise and their economic and career prospects improve. Over time, this should facilitate marriage and family formation.It\u2019s true that in the United States \u2014 the world\u2019s largest economy for more than a century \u2014 younger workers face significant employment and career problems, which may partly be because of older workers\u2019 holding on to their jobs. The labor-force participation rate among older workers, especially older men, has increased over the last decade (but represents only a recent reversal). Indeed, the uptick may have something to do with improved health and productivity of older workers; the rise of service industries and the decline of manual-labor occupations; gradual but small increases in the Social Security retirement age; and the destructive effects of the financial crisis on the housing and retirement assets of many baby boomers. One cannot extrapolate a long-term trend from the last six years.Finally, lower fertility rates may gradually reduce the incentives that have led a surprisingly large number of governments to encourage the emigration of their own young citizens, both to find work and send home hard-currency savings, as well as to remove them from potential political activism at home.SUCH policies \u2014 sometimes explicit, sometimes implicit, but always accompanied by real ambivalence \u2014 can be seen in countries as diverse as Mexico, the Philippines, Bangladesh, Pakistan and India, as well as in many other countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean. Out-migration as a way of life (and an instrument of national economic policy) has its limits.Like all major social changes, the spread of low fertility poses challenges to established practices. Political systems that fail to adjust will predictably face vexing fiscal challenges, even crises. Generous public pension systems in Europe, with fewer younger adults employed and paying taxes while life expectancy at older ages rises, are a grave source of anxiety for members of the European Union. National leaders will have to decide whether the early retirement ages and high \u201cwage replacement\u201d payout rates of their pension systems, created decades ago under very different economic and demographic circumstances, can be adjusted to become sustainable over the long term.There are, in fact, ways that low fertility can be moderated, or even reversed, over time. Indeed, this already has happened to modest degrees in some of the countries with the earliest fertility declines. Sweden and France were among the first European countries to experience low postwar fertility rates. Sweden\u2019s declined to about 1.6 in the 1970s and again in the 1990s, but has since rebounded to about 1.9, possibly because of a variety of support mechanisms for young families with children. In France, where public support for young families with children has been long-term public policy, fertility rates over the past half century did not decline as much as in Sweden, and are now around two (about the same as in the United States). Part of the reason is that France provides subsidized day care for children, starting at 2 1/2 months. Fees are on a sliding scale based on family income. Other countries have been reconsidering traditional school schedules, such as half-days and early closing times that impose serious work-family conflicts for parents, and housing subsidies for young families.The experience of places like Sweden and Russia suggests a modest recovery in fertility rates in countries where they have fallen to very low levels \u2014 rather than the \u201cdeath spiral\u201d feared by some commentators.But with the global economy still quite fragile, it\u2019s a safe bet that ominous jeremiads about endangered, geriatric societies will continue. Population doom of one kind or another is a recurring fad. Like most fads, this one can be safely ignored. Humanity has many legitimate problems to worry about. Falling fertility is not one of them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In France, a Move to Limit Off-the-Clock Work Emails", "Date": "2014-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Given France\u2019s 35-hour workweek, generous vacations and persistent, if not altogether accurate, reputation for indolence, it may come as a surprise that the French are only now considering limits on the work emails and phone calls that come at all hours of the day and night. Labor unions and corporate representatives in France have agreed on an \u201cobligation to disconnect from remote communications tools\u201d that would apply to 250,000 employees of consulting, computing and polling firms. The accord, signed this month but yet to be approved by the Labor Ministry, would require that employers verify that the 11 hours of daily \u201crest\u201d time to which all workers are legally entitled be spent uninterrupted.\u201cWe really want there to be 11 consecutive hours,\u201d said Marie Buard, a project leader at the Federation of Communication, Consulting and Culture, a branch of the French Democratic Confederation of Labor. Still, Ms. Buard said, \u201cWe also wouldn\u2019t like this to squeeze businesses and cause them problems.\u201dUnder the agreement, she said, each company would develop a policy and enforcement mechanisms. One might choose to block communications from 11 p.m. to 10 a.m. by shutting down its email servers, while another might simply ask employees not to check email between 9 p.m. and 8 a.m.The image of French people \u201cwho don\u2019t get anything done, who just take vacations \u2014 that\u2019s not what this is about at all,\u201d said Max Balensi, an official with the Syntec federation, one of the employers\u2019 groups that signed the accord. Mr. Balensi, who said he previously worked for Accenture and BP \u2014 not French companies \u2014 called such reports \u201cdisinformation.\u201dIn fact, the agreement will affect perhaps 250,000 consultants and technology workers whose contracts stipulate only an annual number of workdays, but not daily working hours, said Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Lebon, a spokeswoman for Cinov, another employers\u2019 federation that signed the deal. The agreement is meant to establish safeguards that would ensure balance in the lives of employees, many of whom work with foreign companies in far-flung time zones, Ms. Lebon said.\u201cFor us, it was extremely important to say that the employers in this sector are very attentive to the health of our employees,\u201d she said.French labor law is highly protective of workers\u2019 rights, but businesses and even some officials in the French government say it is a significant impediment to economic growth. With the economy stagnant and the unemployment rate above 10 percent, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande has pledged billions of euros in tax cuts for businesses, part of a broader effort to make French companies more competitive.Mr. Balensi, at Syntec, said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t have employees who are in good health, your competitiveness is going to fall.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senate Panel Approves Nominees to Help Fill Fed", "Date": "2014-04-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday approved the nominations of Stanley Fischer and Lael Brainard to join the Federal Reserve\u2019s depleted board, and it approved the nomination of Jerome H. Powell to a new term.It remained unclear whether Senate Democrats would push the nominations through the full Senate by the end of May, when the Fed\u2019s board will otherwise be reduced to just three members for the first time in its 100-year history.Adam Jentleson, a spokesman for Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, said\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0that Mr. Reid hoped to schedule final votes \u201cas soon as possible,\u201d but could not guarantee a final vote before Memorial Day. Republicans routinely impose procedural delays on nominations, requiring Democrats to invest substantial time in each confirmation at the expense of other priorities.The remaining members would be left to do the work of seven people. They also would be required to schedule a public meeting in order to discuss policy, because even a conversation between two officials would involve a majority of the board.The banking committee acted by voice vote. The committee\u2019s chairman, Senator Tim Johnson, Democrat of South Dakota, described the nominees as \u201cextremely well qualified,\u201d and he said he wanted to act quickly to move them toward confirmation.Senator Mike Crapo, the ranking Republican on the committee, from Idaho, said that the nominees had \u201cdemonstrated their understanding of the challenges facing the Federal Reserve Board in returning to normalized monetary policy.\u201dThe bipartisan support contrasted with Republican opposition to most of President Obama\u2019s previous Fed nominees, including his choice last year of Janet L. Yellen as the Fed\u2019s chairwoman. Senator David Vitter, Republican of Louisiana, was the only member of the committee to vote in opposition. He said the Fed\u2019s board already had too many academic economists, and not enough community bankers.Mr. Fischer is a former academic who had an influential career as a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before entering public service in the early 1990s. He served in senior positions at the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. He worked at Citigroup in the early 2000s before taking charge of the Bank of Israel, where he was widely credited with helping to insulate the country\u2019s economy from the consequences of the global economic crisis.Ms. Brainard served in the Obama administration as Treasury under secretary for international affairs from 2010 until late last year, representing the nation\u2019s financial interests. Mr. Powell, who joined the Fed\u2019s board in 2012, is a former private equity executive and was a Treasury official in the first Bush administration.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Justice Gap", "Date": "2014-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cLow-class people do low-class things.\u201d What\u2019s notable in this reflexive dismissal of those with modest means are not the words themselves. Rather, please turn your attention to the person whom Matt Taibbi, in his ambitious new book documenting America\u2019s unequal administration of justice to rich and poor, quotes saying them: a private attorney hired by New York State to defend low-income people in criminal court. We never learn his name, but Taibbi calls him Waldorf because he resembles the grouchy old balcony heckler on \u201cThe Muppet Show.\u201dWaldorf\u2019s casual contempt for his defendants (and tacit approval of the sloppy policing dragnet that puts them at his mercy) is voiced at the conclusion of a grimly comic vignette worthy of Joseph Heller \u2014 one of many deeply reported, highly compelling mini-narratives of dysfunction within the criminal justice system that make \u201cThe Divide: American Injustice in the Age of the Wealth Gap\u201d as infuriating as it is impossible to put down.A 35-year-old black man named Andrew Brown is arrested for \u201cobstructing pedestrian traffic\u201d in Bedford-Stuyvesant. Brown, having been similarly harassed by the cops countless times before, refuses to provide ID and accept a summons, and is consequently brought into court. Once there, Brown explains to Waldorf that he was talking to a friend outside his own apartment building after getting off work, and that, given the lateness of the hour (shortly before 1 a.m.), there wouldn\u2019t have been any pedestrian traffic on Myrtle Avenue to obstruct. None of this seems to register with Waldorf. \u201cWhat are you arguing?\u201d he asks. He wonders aloud whether Brown was \u201cbeing a wise guy\u201d with the cops, and expresses surprise that a person such as Brown would have a job. He advises his client to pay the $25 fine. Brown refuses and explains it all over again to the judge. The judge turns to Waldorf and asks whether Brown will pay the $25 fine. Waldorf explains, for the second time, that Brown won\u2019t pay, his manner suggesting that for the life of him he can\u2019t figure out why not. Only then does the judge bestir himself to ask the arresting officer whether he saw any other people on the sidewalk that night. No? \u201cO.K., then,\u201d the judge sighs. \u201cNot guilty.\u201d Out in the hallway, Taibbi asks Waldorf why white people never get arrested for obstructing pedestrian traffic. Oblivious to the lesson that has just played out, and puzzled as to why Taibbi would want to include any of this in a book, Waldorf replies, \u201cLow-class people do low-class things.\u201dTaibbi wrote \u201cThe Divide\u201d to demonstrate that unequal wealth is producing grotesquely unequal outcomes in criminal justice. You might say that\u2019s an old story, but Taibbi believes that, just as income disparities are growing ever wider, so, too, are disparities in who attracts the attention of cops and prosecutors and who doesn\u2019t. Violent crime has fallen by 44 percent in America over the past two decades, but during that same period the prison population has more than doubled, skewing heavily black and poor. In essence, poverty itself is being criminalized. Meanwhile, at the other end of the income distribution, an epidemic of white-collar crime has overtaken the financial sector, indicated, for instance, by a proliferation of record-breaking civil settlements. But partly because of an embarrassing succession of botched Justice Department prosecutions, and partly because of a growing worry (first enunciated by Attorney General Eric Holder when he was Bill Clinton\u2019s deputy attorney general) that any aggressive prosecution of big banks could destabilize the economy, Wall Street has come, under President Obama, to enjoy near-total immunity from criminal prosecution. It had more to fear, ironically, when George W. Bush was president.The argument isn\u2019t laid out in a particularly rigorous or nuanced manner, but it seems plausible enough. Taibbi, a longtime Rolling Stone writer who is currently developing a publication about political and financial corruption for First Look Media, has in the past written in a blustery style that put me off, but here the gonzo affectation is kept largely in check. What I failed to notice previously \u2014 or perhaps what Taibbi shows off to especially good effect here \u2014 is what a meticulous reporter he can be, with a facility for rendering complex financial skulduggery intelligible. Especially noteworthy are Taibbi\u2019s detailed accounts of self-\u00addealing amid the dismantlement of Lehman Brothers \u2014 which involved, among other things, hoodwinking Lehman\u2019s bankruptcy judge \u2014 and of a vicious harassment campaign waged by hedge fund managers against the employees of a Canadian insurance company whose stock they\u2019d shorted. In both instances, one is struck that, however tricky the standard of proof may be for the white-collar criminal class, the evidence available nowadays in the form of compromising email communications would make Eliot Ness weep with gratitude. And yet the gangsters got away.Taibbi is similarly skillful at explaining how bureaucratic imperatives in the criminal justice system can spin scarily out of control. In New York City, you start with a \u201cbroken windows\u201d theory that says cracking down on petty crime can prevent little criminals from becoming big criminals. Possibly because that\u2019s right, violent crime goes down. But paradoxically, that makes a cop\u2019s life more difficult rather than less, because criminals are getting harder to find even as new computer systems are enabling the police commissioner to keep track of which precincts are making the most arrests. The solution turns out to be aggressive use of a stop-and-frisk policy that gives cops a blank check to \u201csearch virtually anyone at any time.\u201d The police start behaving \u201clike commercial fishermen, throwing nets over whole city blocks.\u201d Some of the fish get prosecuted or ticketed for ever-pettier offenses; 20,000 summonses, for instance, are handed out annually for riding a bicycle on the sidewalk. But most fish aren\u2019t guilty of anything and must grow accustomed to being routinely cuffed and ridden around in a police van before they are tossed back into the water. These fish are, of course, typically black and poor. Anecdotal evidence suggests that throwing a similar fishnet over entire Wall Street firms would produce a criminal yield at least as high as any random ghetto block. But innocent Wall Street fish would have a much bigger megaphone with which to proclaim their constitutional rights, and guilty Wall Street fish would have much better lawyers.One theme implicit in Taibbi\u2019s reporting is the extent to which the justice system\u2019s newer kinds of inequalities are driven by technology. Computers encourage both the government and the banks to operate on a scale at which consideration of individual circumstance isn\u2019t really possible. The result is unstoppable error by government (say, the frequent miscalculations that leave welfare recipients at constant risk of being wrongly accused of fraud) and unstoppable fraud by banks (say, \u00adrobo-signing endlessly repackaged and resold mortgages and credit card debt). For both government and banks, such scaling up inevitably creates injustices for certain individuals, but so long as the victims are powerless there won\u2019t be much of a legal or political reckoning. The person tossed into jail for welfare fraud he didn\u2019t commit or tossed out of his house because he was mistakenly judged not to be paying his mortgage may or may not get it all sorted out in the end, but even if he does the feedback loop won\u2019t impose too much pain. We may be approaching a day when any kind of personal attention from a large institution that wields substantial control over your life becomes a luxury available only to the few, like a bespoke suit or designer gown.

{"Headline": "The Global Diabetes Epidemic", "Date": "2014-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionTwelve years ago, my husband and I packed up all of our belongings and moved to Trivandrum \u2014 a steamy, tropical town at the southern tip of India in Kerala. At the time, I was a medical student interested in studying stroke. For the next six months I dressed in a sari and walked to work on jungle roads. At the hospital, I immediately began seeing a steady stream of young patients affected by strokes, many of whom were so severely disabled that they were unable to work. I initially suspected the cause was tuberculosis or dengue fever \u2014 after all, this was the developing world, where infections have long been primary culprits for disease. But I soon learned that my hunch was wrong. One of my first patients was a woman in her mid-30s who came in with a headache, vomiting and an unsteady gait. Her scan showed a brainstem stroke. Her blood sugars were very high. The underlying cause of her stroke was most likely untreated Type 2 diabetes. Here I was, halfway around the globe, in a vastly foreign culture, but I was looking at a disease \u2014 and the lifestyle that fostered it \u2014 that was startlingly familiar. Today, I am an endocrinologist, and diabetes has become a full-blown epidemic in India, China, and throughout many emerging economies. In the United States, diabetes tends to be a disease that, while certainly not benign, is eminently manageable. Just this month, federal researchers reported that health risks for the approximately 25 million Americans with diabetes had fallen sharply over the last two decades. Elsewhere on the globe, however, diabetes plays out in a dramatically different fashion. Patients often lack access to care and can\u2019t get insulin, blood pressure pills and other medicines that diminish the risk of complications. As more and more people develop the disease, hospitals may soon be overrun with patients experiencing all of its worst outcomes: blindness, limb amputation, kidney failure (necessitating dialysis), coma and death. Within the last few decades, South Asia has experienced a rapid economic transition paralleled by an epidemiological shift in disease patterns. Recently, when I returned to India for a yearlong fellowship, I saw this for myself. Indians are now living more sedentary lives, working in banks, labs and call centers; all the while, their diet is changing, as they eat out more and consume foods higher in calories and saturated fats. What\u2019s more, evidence suggests that Indians may be especially predisposed to diabetes, so even those who are slightly overweight are more likely to be at risk. India also has a high malnutrition rate among children, and poor nutrition in early life appears to trigger metabolic changes that lead to diabetes in adulthood. The result is a perfect storm of commerce, lifestyle and genetics. According to the International Diabetes Federation, there are now an estimated 65 million adults with diabetes in India. That number is projected to increase to 109 million by 2035. China also has a diabetes epidemic \u2014 with an estimated 98 million people affected. Indonesia has nearly 9 million, and Pakistan nearly 7 million. All told, 382 million people worldwide are living with diabetes, a vast majority in low- and middle-income countries \u2014 places where many cases go undiagnosed and untreated. The costs associated with diabetes are enormous; they include expenses related to acute and chronic complications, the costs of therapies to prevent them, and the fact that those affected may be unable to work and support their families. Many patients are pushed into bankruptcy. In India, only 10 percent of people have medical insurance, and patients cover most expenses out of pocket. In some low- and middle-income countries, diabetes patients living on $1 or $2 per day would need to spend as much as 50 percent of their monthly income to buy just one vial of insulin. Additional materials such as syringes, needles and glucose monitoring tests push costs even higher. There is much to be done to prepare for this global epidemic. The sheer size of it means that strategies focused solely on treatment will be far too costly. If nothing changes in the next two decades, India will need to provide chronic care for more than 100 million people with diabetes \u2014 close to the entire adult population of Russia. The solution in India and other developing countries has to include prevention, which means promoting healthy eating and physical activity. It\u2019s not easy: We have by no means succeeded in the United States. In India, it will require better policies that favor fruits and vegetables over refined-food products. One opportunity involves India\u2019s Mid Day Meal Scheme, a program that provides lunches to 120 million children. The program has been tainted by corruption and deadly contamination problems, but as the Indian government addresses these issues, it also has a chance to reshape the dietary habits of many young people. Exercise is the other crucial element. Taking a jog or even walking to work in Indian cities often means choking on exhaust fumes and dodging speeding cars. Creating more sidewalks and bike paths could go a long way.The second step is providing diabetes patients with medicines that are effective, safe and affordable. On the bright side, for at least a decade, India has manufactured affordable generic insulin. But in recent years, pharmaceutical companies, sensing the potential for profits, have begun to market their products aggressively. In one major government hospital, I saw lines of pharmaceutical representatives with glossy pamphlets and drug samples waiting to speak with clinicians. Some classes of drugs they\u2019re pushing, such as incretin mimetics \u2014 which are injected to lower blood sugars \u2014 are very costly, and though they are approved for use in both the United States and India, we don\u2019t know enough about their safety in the long run. They don\u2019t appear to lower blood sugar levels any better than cheaper alternatives like metformin, which comes as a pill and is considered the best first choice for many people with diabetes. In America, expenditures on diabetes medications have soared as newer drugs have been rapidly adopted. India desperately needs to create evidence-based guidelines that take into account cost-effectiveness so that marketing doesn\u2019t drive treatment. But even the best medicines will not work without a well-functioning health care system. Diabetes care is not a quick fix. You can\u2019t take a pill for 10 days and be cured. It means working with a clinical team to control the disease month after month, year after year. This requires a system that is geared toward chronic care, which in many countries simply doesn\u2019t exist. In India, there is now a call for universal health care. This is encouraging but is a long way from being realized. In the meantime, India could leverage the lessons learned from many successful H.I.V. programs throughout the developing world that have empowered communities to deliver complex clinical services to millions of people at low cost. In order for policy makers and health officials to bring about these changes, we must change how we think about the disease. Most of us in the West assume we know what the risks and burdens of diabetes are. And if we\u2019re talking about a patient in Kansas City or Tokyo, we\u2019re probably right. But when it comes to diabetes, location is everything, and much of the world is now vulnerable to the most devastating consequences of this disease. If we\u2019re going to be any help at all, we need to make a conceptual shift. We think we know diabetes \u2014 and that\u2019s the problem. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Leaps, Job Losses and Rising Inequality", "Date": "2014-04-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneIt\u2019s hard to overstate the excitement of tech people about what is on the verge of happening to the practice of medicine.This is just the beginning. \u201cThe real innovative things have yet to be activated,\u201d Mr. Rao said. \u201cWhatever happens will be disruptive.\u201dThat\u2019s not the half of it.A few years ago, this kind of technological development would be treated like unadulterated good news: an opportunity to improve the nation\u2019s health and standard of living while perhaps even reducing health care costs and achieving a leap in productivity that would cement the United States\u2019 pre-eminent position on the frontier of technology.But a growing pessimism has crept into our understanding of the impact of such innovations. It\u2019s an old fear, widely held since the time of Ned Ludd, who destroyed two mechanical knitting machines in 19th-century England and introduced the Luddite movement, humankind\u2019s first organized protest against technological change.In its current incarnation, though, the fear is actually very new. It strikes against bedrock propositions developed over more than half a century of economic scholarship. It can be articulated succinctly: What if technology has become a substitute for labor, rather than its complement?But, Mr. Delong pointed out, no law of nature ensures this will always be the case. Some jobs \u2014 nannies, say, or waiting tables \u2014 may always require lots of people. But as information technology creeps into occupations that have historically relied mostly on brainpower, it threatens to leave many fewer good jobs for people to do.These sorts of ideas still strike most mainstream economists as heretical, an uncalled-for departure from a canon that states that capital \u2014 from land and lathes to computers and cyclotrons \u2014 is complementary to labor.But evidence is emerging that this long-held tenet is no longer valid. In the United States, the share of national income that goes to workers \u2014 in wages and benefits \u2014 has been falling for almost half a century.Today it\u2019s at its lowest level since the 1950s while the returns to capital have soared. Corporate profits take the largest share of national income since the government started measuring the statistic in the 1920s.In a recent interview, Professor Solow stressed that his proposition of relatively stable labor and capital shares assumed \u201can economy in a steady state with no systematic structural changes occurring.\u201d That assumption doesn\u2019t seem to hold anymore. \u201cOver the last few decades something structural might be happening to the economy that seems to want to increase the capital share,\u201d he said.Professor Solow suggests that technology is probably not the only cause of labor\u2019s declining share. He cites \u201ceveryday reasons,\u201d including the erosion of the minimum wage, the decimation of trade unions and anti-labor legislation.But technology clearly plays a role. \u201cWe will know better in 10 or 15 years,\u201d Professor Solow said. \u201cBut if I had to interpret the data now, I would guess that as the economy becomes more capital intensive, capital\u2019s share of income will rise.\u201dAs the cost of capital investments has fallen relative to the cost of labor, businesses have rushed to replace workers with technology.\u201cFrom the mid-1970s onwards, there is evidence that capital and labor are more substitutable\u201d than what standard economic models would suggest, Professor Neiman told me. \u201cThis is happening all over the place. It is a major global trend.\u201dThe implication is potentially dire: The vast disparities in the distribution of income that have been widening inexorably since the 1980s will widen further.This is hardly a consensus reading of the record. \u201cIt is hard to make a very definite prediction about how the capital-income share will evolve over the next 10 years,\u201d Daron Acemoglu, a colleague of Mr. Solow\u2019s at M.I.T., told me. \u201cFuture technology could maybe increase the contribution of labor.\u201dTyler Cowen, a professor of economics at George Mason University, argues that the very definitions of labor and capital are arbitrary. Instead, he looks around the world to find the relatively scarce factors of production and finds two: natural resources, which are dwindling, and good ideas, which can reach larger markets than ever before. If you possess one of those, then you will reap most of the rewards of growth. If you don\u2019t, you will not.Conventional wisdom in economics has long held that technological change affects income inequality by increasing the rewards to skill \u2014 through a dynamic called \u201cskill-biased technical change.\u201d Losers are workers whose job can be replaced by machines (textile workers, for example). Those whose skills are enhanced by machines (think Wall Street traders using ultrafast computers) win.It is becoming increasingly apparent, however, that this is not the whole story and that the skills-heavy narrative of inequality is not as straightforward as economists once believed. The persistent decline in the labor share of income suggests another dynamic. Call it \u201ccapital-biased technical change\u201d \u2014 which encourages replacing decently paid workers with a machine, regardless of their skill.So what about the long-term prospect of good jobs in medicine? Policy makers hold fast to the hope that a growing health care industry will support the American middle-class worker of the future. But technology could easily disrupt this promise too.\u201cHealth care jobs may be safe now,\u201d said Gordon Hanson, a professor of economics at the University of California, San Diego, \u201cbut our sense of what\u2019s safe has been consistently belied by the impact of our technological progress.\u201dOr as Mr. Rao put it, diagnosing depression from Twitter posts \u201cdoesn\u2019t require any medical training.\u201dThe only safe route into the future seems to be to already have a lot of money.Email: eporter@nytimes.com; \nTwitter: @portereduardo Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Old Forecast of Famine May Yet Come True", "Date": "2014-04-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneMight Thomas Malthus be vindicated in the end?Two centuries ago \u2014 only 10 years after a hungry, angry populace had ushered in the French Revolution \u2014 the dour Englishman predicted that exponential population growth would condemn humanity to the edge of subsistence.\u201cThe power of population is so superior to the power in the earth to produce subsistence for man, that premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race,\u201d he wrote with alarm.This was, we now know, wrong. The gloomy forecast was soon buried under an avalanche of progress that spread from England around the world. Between 1820 and the year 2000 the world\u2019s population grew sixfold. Economic output multiplied by more than 50.Nonetheless, Malthus\u2019s prediction was based on an eminently sensible premise: that the earth\u2019s carrying capacity has a limit. On Monday, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change provided a sharp-edged warning about how fast we are approaching this constraint.The list of present damages outlined by the United Nations panel \u2014 melting ice caps and rising sea levels, stressed water supplies, heat waves and heavy rains \u2014 underscored the risk if humanity does not figure out how to curb the use of fossil fuels that have provided the lifeblood for economic development since the time of Malthus.The panel\u2019s past report in 2007 had concluded: \u201cGlobally, the potential for food production is projected to increase with increases in local average temperature over a range of one to three degrees Celsius.\u201dBut the new report is much more pessimistic about the prospect of extra grain production in the globe\u2019s temperate zones, where more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would increase the rate of photosynthesis, raising yields, and warmer weather would lengthen the growing season.Faster photosynthesis will help weeds more than cereal crops, while the accumulation of ozone and high temperatures would reduce yields of all the major grains, according to the report.This would be bad enough if demand for food were to remain constant. It won\u2019t. Studies suggest that feeding more than nine billion people in 2050 will require 70 percent more calories than the world\u2019s population consumes today, according to Craig Hanson, director of food, forests and water programs at the World Resources Institute.Indeed, the panel calculates that food demand is rising at a pace of 14 percent per decade. But it estimates that climate change is already reducing wheat yields by 2 percent each decade \u2014 compared with where they would be in the absence of climate change \u2014 and corn yields by 1 percent.\u201cThis is a wake-up call for the agriculture sector,\u201d Mr. Hanson said. \u201cClimate change is a food security issue. It\u2019s not just an environmental issue.\u201dThe climate panel\u2019s findings do not quite endorse the Malthusian idea that famine will spread practically everywhere. But a world with a more unstable food supply is likely to be a more volatile place. And those most exposed, of course, will be the world\u2019s poor.Recent experience suggests that the productivity of farmland won\u2019t decline gradually as the world grows warmer. World food prices stopped their long secular decline around 2007 and have been on a roller-coaster ride since. More volatile weather patterns promise to bring sharp disruptions to agricultural production that can cause spikes in food prices.Instability spreads easily. When rice prices jumped in 2007, big producers like India and Vietnam banned exports to protect their domestic markets, while importers like Bangladesh, Nigeria and Iran went out on the market to hoard as much grain as they could. The combination wreaked havoc in commodity markets.Since then big food importers, like China, Saudi Arabia and South Korea, have tried to insulate themselves from future food shortages by buying or leasing agricultural land in places like Sudan, Madagascar and Uzbekistan. The strategy is still to be tested in a situation in which Africa or Central Asia were to suffer itself shortages of grain.\u201cI have run some war game scenarios,\u201d Mr. Holland said. \u201cThe tendency becomes very quickly for a country to look after its own interests.\u201dStill, there are good reasons to take prophesies of doom with more than a pinch of salt. Ecological Cassandras have consistently underestimated humanity\u2019s capacity to invent ways around constraints, using resources more efficiently and switching from scarcer commodities to more abundant ones.In \u201cThe Population Bomb,\u201d published in 1968, the noted Stanford ecologist Paul R. Ehrlich wrote \u201cin the 1970s the world will undergo famines \u2014 hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death.\u201d In \u201cThe End of Affluence,\u201d written six years later, he forecast \u201ca genuine age of scarcity\u201d by 1985.Indeed, the climate panel suggests a variety of ways in which countries could adapt to a changing climate. Farmers could breed new species to better resist heat and drought. Water harvesting techniques could be used to delay evaporation. Rotation of crops could help improve yields.The United Nations panel reported that a survey of various studies concluded that adapting crop management could raise yields of wheat, rice and maize from 15 to 18 percent compared with doing nothing.Changes in demand and logistics could also help cope with scarcer food. Mr. Hanson pointed out that fully one-quarter of the food produced in the world today is wasted \u2014 by either poor storage and transport infrastructure in developing countries or wasteful consumers in the rich world.But for all the evidence of humankind\u2019s ability to adapt to its environmental constraints, it would be reckless to assume that ingenuity will arrive just in time to pull us from the brink.The Economic Scene column on Wednesday, about challenges posed by climate change to the world\u2019s food supply, misstated the middle initial for a noted Stanford ecologist who predicted famine resulting from overpopulation.

{"Headline": "Massaging Your Soul", "Date": "2014-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI felt a nap coming on, but I was late for class. I should be totally upfront here and confess that the class was on sleeping. For $75 and an hour and a half of my day, a registered nurse named Sheryl went through a few pro tips on how to get the most restful seven hours possible.We all need a sleep plan, she told the class of about eight of us, guests at a desert oasis outside Tucson called Miraval, most of them women in their 50s and 60s. We make plans for eating, exercise and our workdays. So why not for something we spend a third of our lives doing?As Sheryl was going through a checklist of things we needed to do and not do to ensure better rest \u2014 do expose yourself to natural sunlight; do not look at any lighted screens like iPads, smartphones or television sets less than an hour before bedtime \u2014 I started to realize that I had spent much of the last week on my vacation to Arizona in a state of repose. Rest wasn\u2019t something I was in need of, and the same was probably true for most of the people I encountered that week.There was the Restorative Yoga class I took at the Mii amo spa in Sedona that basically consisted of lying on the floor for an hour. One woman gave up halfway in, propped herself up on the wall and just went to sleep.There was the two-hour Desert Gemstone Ritual that I had at the Ritz-Carlton Dove Mountain outside Tucson, which included a foot rub, an hourlong full-body massage and a 20-minute soak in warm, lavender-oiled bathwater.Then there was Floating Meditation at Miraval, a sublime experience that involved lying in a silk hammock while the instructor rocked me like a baby and played sonorous harmonies on crystal singing bowls.\u201cIt\u2019s O.K. if you fall asleep,\u201d she told the class. \u201cBut if you start snoring, I will have to wake you up,\u201d she added, upholding what seemed to be one of Miraval\u2019s most sacred tenets: No one\u2019s relaxation should disturb anyone else\u2019s.Arizonans like to brag of the state\u2019s five C\u2019s, copper, cotton, cattle, citrus and climate. There should be a sixth: convalescence. The state has a booming economy of resorts and spas that cater to people seeking relaxation, restoration and a little Zen reassurance that everything will be just fine. It has become such a big business, in fact, that it can be hard to trace the earthy, modest roots in the culture of self-improvement that became so popular with places like Canyon Ranch and Miraval when they first opened. Canyon Ranch started out in 1979 as a Tucson fat farm. It now has branches with full spa services in Lenox, Mass.; Las Vegas; Miami Beach; and aboard the Queen Mary 2. Miraval was the creation of a health-care services company when it started welcoming guests in 1995. It advertised itself as the place for a \u201clife balancing, stress management vacation experience.\u201d It is still all that, just now under the ownership of Steve Case, the AOL co-founder, with rates that will easily set you back $1,500 per night for two people. Now, too, the place has the taint of \u201cThe Real Housewives of New Jersey,\u201d which filmed an episode at Miraval last year, much to the horror of the spa\u2019s regulars. Enchantment Resort, which houses Mii amo, finished up a $25 million face-lift in 2012. Even Arizona\u2019s grandes dames like the Phoenician and the Biltmore have had extensive work done in the last few years. No one can afford to appear a little frayed around the edges with such competition. At the same time that these spas are spending fortunes on their own exteriors, they have thoroughly embraced treatments that focus as much on your inner well-being as your outer blemishes. Spa and activities menus are studded with bizarre-sounding services like Past-life Regression, a form of hypnosis; Interactive Aura Photography, an analysis of your energy field; and the Equine Experience, a group session in which you learn to manage anxiety and tension by cleaning a horse\u2019s hoof. These days you don\u2019t go to an Arizona spa to emerge with a glow, unless it\u2019s a spiritual one. My partner, Brendan, and I spent a week dipping into these resorts, sampling the newest and most intriguing options we could find \u2014 some wonderfully decadent, some genuinely revelatory on a personal level, and others that we should have skipped. Our first stop was at Enchantment, which was probably the most physically beautiful of the three properties we visited. The resort occupies 70 meticulously maintained acres inside one of the red rock canyons for which Sedona is so famous. The Mii amo spa is actually its own oasis within Enchantment, with its own hotel, pool and restaurant that all guests of the resort are free to use \u2014 as long as they purchase one of the pricey treatments.It\u2019s the kind of place where people are urged to write down their worries and discard them, literally and symbolically, in a wicker basket. (The staff burns them, I was assured.) The most popular attire for guests at all times of day seemed to be one of the spa\u2019s plush robes. We saw a very unburdened-looking Susan Sarandon lounging in the hot tub one afternoon.My first treatment was something called the Dosha Balancing Wrap, a detoxifying and cleansing therapy that drew from the traditions of ayurvedic medicine, an ancient science developed on the Indian subcontinent.My therapist explained what was going on every step of the way. First I had to smell a few different oils and choose the one my body responded to best. I picked a peppery-scented one called Vata, which she said was made locally by a company that does work for Deepak Chopra.She ran brushes all over my body then rubbed in the oil with her hands. Next she got out a bunch of hot towels that had been soaked in herbal tea, which she wrapped around me, \u201clike a burrito,\u201d she said. And for 20 minutes or so she just scratched me behind my ears as though I was a house cat. It was wonderful.I was less impressed with my next treatment, the Psychic Massage. It was neither psychic nor much of a massage. \u201cI don\u2019t see into the future or anything like that,\u201d my therapist told me when I asked him to elaborate on what supernatural powers he might possess. He was more like a $250-an-hour life coach who happened to have good hands, which he ran lightly over my arms, legs, lower back and abdomen. He said he did this to get a better read of my energy. And when he was done, he reported, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with you, Jeremy.\u201d He reassured me I was just sensitive. Brendan, a dermatologist, generously agreed that in our division of the hard, research-intensive labor, he would focus on the skin care offerings. He started with something Mii amo called the Journeyman\u2019s Facial. It got off to a rough start. \u201cDermatologists have a tendency to prescribe something and then say \u2018See you in a year!\u2019 without really looking closely at your skin,\u201d the woman providing his treatment told him, unaware of his profession. At the end of the session, which included some uncomfortable pimple popping, having steam blown in his face and a pumpkin mask followed by a pineapple scrub, he was presented with a list of all the products used on him. As if the $160 cost weren\u2019t enough (that\u2019s before tipping), he was being urged to pick up a thimble of $90 eye cream on his way out the door. He had a lot better luck at Mii amo with his astrology reading. At $250 for an hour, it certainly wasn\u2019t cheap. The astrologist, a very friendly and encouraging woman, reassured him about his Libra tendencies. He may be indecisive, but he is grounded, balanced and warm, she said. She prepared him to expect an identity change sometime in April, which sounded somewhat alarming but, she promised, would actually be quite subtle. She also told him he liked massages. (How convenient!)He found the whole experience entertaining, though he became slightly deflated after another hotel guest from Louisiana told him, \u201cI could take you to New Orleans and get that done for $7.\u201d One of the best parts of the Mii amo experience was just soaking in the surroundings. The spa building itself is a glorious sanctuary about five minutes\u2019 walk from the main resort lobby. (The staff will happily ferry you over by golf cart upon request.) Brendan and I spent hours on the daybeds by the indoor pool, reading as the rush of a waterfall blocked out any other sounds. In the treatment rooms were skylights and panoramic windows, so you could gaze up at the red rock cliffs as you drifted off into a state of semiconsciousness.Our next stop was a three-and-a-half hour drive south to the Tucson area, where we checked into the Ritz-Carlton Dove Mountain. It was less of a true spa getaway than the Miraval or Mii amo and more of a full-service resort with country club trappings like golf and swimming.But the Ritz\u2019s spa was probably the most elegant we visited that week. It\u2019s just a few years old and is so well kept that it still looks brand-new. The locker rooms are done in soothing cream tones, and the soft lighting is enough to ease you into a relaxed state. The spa has its own saltwater infinity pool surrounded by canopied sun beds and tall, multiarmed saguaro cactuses. It is so idyllic, so removed from the bustle of the main resort that it feels like a little boutique within the vast, 850-acre Ritz compound. The treatment rooms are all connected to an open-air courtyard. The one I had was the size of a large one-bedroom apartment and had two fireplaces \u2014 one inside and one out on a private terrace. There was a bathtub the size of a Mini Cooper.I opted for the Desert Gemstone Ritual because it sounded the most unusual. In fact, the Ritz menu was light on the New Age offerings that the other spas had, though my treatment did begin with reaching my hand into a large bowl and withdrawing a guide stone. With my eyes closed, I chose an amethyst, which was presented to me in a little bag at the end of the massage \u2014 a token freebie $245 later, plus tip. My therapist first met me outside the men\u2019s locker room with a cup of warm tea. Inside the treatment room, she had a footbath waiting for me and asked me to carefully test it for warmth. \u201cJust dip a toe in,\u201d she said. The whole treatment, which lasted almost two hours, including the 30 minutes or so I had to myself in the bath, consisted of a sugar scrub foot rub, a full-body exfoliating rubdown and a deep tissue massage. Her hands were so efficient and her motions so perfectly in sync, at times it felt as if I was being worked on by a machine.The extravagance of the experience almost felt silly, like when she set down a path of towels from the massage table to the tub so my feet wouldn\u2019t have to touch the floor. Then there was the inevitable upsell. She asked if I wanted to \u201cenhance\u201d my service with a scalp massage for $25. I declined. The massage ended with her placing the crystal on my forehead in a symbolic gesture for clarity. \u201cYour third eye,\u201d she said.We saved Miraval for our last stop, knowing it would probably be the most memorable, given its reputation as the place where Oprah and Ellen go to recharge. We started our first of two days and nights there with the famed Equine Experience. The point was not to learn to ride the horse but to treat him as a kind of therapist. We were skeptical of the abilities of a horse to teach us much about dealing with anxiety, tension or resolving conflicts. But it ended up being quite a revealing two hours.After a quick stop at the juice and smoothie bar, which is free to guests and one of the better perks we enjoyed on our trip, the staff packed eight of us into a van and drove us off the grounds of the resort to its stables. The first thing we noticed after taking our seats in a little circle was the Kleenex box. Carolyn, our guide, assured us that it was O.K. if we didn\u2019t cry. The way it worked was Carolyn showed us how to squeeze the back of the horse\u2019s leg in just the right spot to get him to lift his hoof so we could then scrape it with a little cleaning tool. This took some perseverance and patience, since the horse usually responds to cues from the human\u2019s body language. So if you aren\u2019t confident, attentive and careful, the horse just ignores you. Carolyn chided Brendan after he started laughing nervously at his inability to get the horse to respond. \u201cLaughter is just a defense mechanism, and it solves nothing,\u201d she told him. Re-approach the horse and communicate what you want. It worked. Once I got my horse to lift his foot, he started to struggle. My impulse was to let go of him. But Carolyn said to stick with it. Just like any conflict, you want to see it through. Then it came time to walk the horse. I guided him out into the middle of the ring. Then he stopped suddenly. What did I do wrong, I wondered urgently? What character flaw did he detect in me? Nothing, it turned out. He just had to relieve himself.Guests at Miraval could spend a week taking self-actualization classes like these. They are given resort credits to use toward spa treatments and sessions like the Equine Experience. Our package gave us each $150 per day, which got eaten up rather quickly.There were classes on \u201cmindful stress mastery\u201d and the \u201cABCs of emotional intelligence.\u201d You could do all kinds of yoga, like Floating Yoga, which was taught in the same silk hammocks as my floating meditation exercise.The sleeping class I took, called Are You Sleeping?, was full of useful advice like never, ever under any circumstances look at the clock if you get up in the middle of the night. I did something called Naga in which my massage therapist walked over parts of my lower body, using silk scarves suspended from the ceiling to adjust the amount of pressure she was exerting. This cost was a staggering $215 for 50 minutes. (There is no tipping at the resort.)You could be as carefree with your money as you wanted. But Miraval could be a bit of a nudge when it came to conservation. In our room there was a sign we could hang on the doorknob that said: \u201cI have made a CHOICE today to reuse my linen and terry products to promote water conservation in the desert.\u201d The biggest indulgence for me at Miraval was actually the $265 Mindful Massage, which was billed as a way \u201cto align bodywork with visualization for a deepening body awareness.\u201d I still have no idea what that meant. But the massage was enough to put me in a state of delirium.The therapist used a series of hot and cool stones all over my body combined with some light and medium hand work on areas of the body that don\u2019t usually get a lot of attention during massages, like the pectoral muscles and belly. She guided me to focus on taking deep breaths that I could feel all the way into my lower abdomen. The experience was so intoxicating that at one point while she was massaging my chest and rotating my right arm in a kind of cranking motion I became convinced that my left arm was back in the hotel room. I began to panic, thinking that she wouldn\u2019t be able to massage it. Later that night, our last in Arizona for the week, we met an older couple from Ohio at the bar as we were waiting for our table. They had been coming to Miraval almost every year since it opened and had watched it evolve. They said they could remember the days when there was no bar, and no $18 glasses of wine because, first, the resort didn\u2019t even serve alcohol and, second, there was no need for a place to wait for a table because it never got that crowded. The bar and the dining room were packed. The table of free hors d\u2019oeuvres had been picked clean. And judging by the number of people drinking $20 cocktails, the relaxation would go on well after the spa closed for the day. Jeremy W. Peters is a correspondent in the Washington bureau of The New York Times. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "British Financial Firms Expect to Keep Hiring, Survey Finds", "Date": "2014-03-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 In a further sign of optimism about strengthening economies in Europe, financial services firms in Britain said they expected to employ 1.16 million people by the end of the second quarter of this year, adding as many as 26,000 more jobs than in the same period a year earlier, according to a survey released on Monday.The pace of hiring remains strong and companies continue to expect to rapidly expand their head count during the next three months, according to the quarterly survey by the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers and a trade group, the Confederation of British Industry. At the peak in the fourth quarter of 2008, about 1.21 million people worked in the financial services sector in Britain, the C.B.I. said.\u201cFinancial services firms are growing steadily and are optimistic about their business situation,\u201d said Matthew Fell, the C.B.I.'s director for competitive markets. \u201cThe fact that competition is growing as a potential business constraint highlights intensifying activity in the sector.\u201dFirms, however, said they were becoming more concerned that a shortage of professional staff might limit their business during the coming year: Thirty-eight percent said they feared a lack of qualified candidates could constrain growth, the highest level since March 2006.Of the 87 banks, asset managers and insurance companies surveyed, 41 percent said they felt more optimistic about the overall business situation compared with three months ago.Business volumes grew for the second consecutive quarter, across all industry subsectors except for life insurance, the poll found, but growth was more moderate than expected.In the second quarter, 49 percent of the companies said they expected business volumes to increase. In the insurance sector, growth in business volumes slowed markedly in the first quarter, partly because of a sharp fall in business with industrial and commercial companies, the survey found. The slowdown was expected to continue in the second quarter.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is the American Middle Class Losing Out to China and India?", "Date": "2014-04-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Obama may be right: Free trade is a winning strategy that will lower consumer costs and expand employment in exporting industries.In the short run, however, trade imposes heavy costs on American workers in both the manufacturing and service sectors, particularly on those least equipped by training and education to adapt.Milanovic has his critics.As Bhagwati put it: \u201cThere is an alternative narrative that says the pressure on our workers\u2019 incomes arises from continual and deep labor-saving technical change; that many labor-intensive activities have already been lost here; and that therefore the workers are not going to lose as producers from lowered world prices of labor-intensive goods, but rather the workers will gain as consumers benefit from these cheapening prices. In this scenario or narrative, trade with the poor countries (e.g., flip-flops, cheap lingerie from Macy\u2019s rather than more expensive lingerie from Victoria\u2019s Secret) moderates the fall in wages that technical change brings about.\u201dTheir findings show why voters are wary of free trade agreements.Relative to the average employee in manufacturing, workers in industries that face stronger competition from imports \u201cgarner lower cumulative earnings and are at elevated risk of exiting the labor force and obtaining public disability benefits,\u201d Autor, Dorn and Hanson write.And if manufacturers are ranked on a scale of 1 to 100 for exposure to import competition from China, between 1992 and 2007, workers in firms high on the exposure scale lost nearly half a year\u2019s pay, compared with workers in firms at the low end of the scale.The exposure of American workers to import competition from China more than doubled after China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001; one quarter of the decline in manufacturing employment in the United States since 2000 can be explained by import competition.The authors calculate the income losses over a period of 10 years during which imports from China increased by $1,000 for each American worker in a competitive industry. The decline was sharper for the subset of workers without college degrees, at 1.21 percentage points, compared with a 0.53 percentage point decline for those with college degrees, but it is notable that wages for both groups fell.The domestic employment declines resulting from trade with China are disproportionately high in states where labor-intensive manufacturing of furniture, toys, apparel, footwear and leather goods has been most concentrated: Tennessee, Missouri, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina and Indiana.The question that arises next is whether the detrimental consequences of trade for developed countries are inevitable in a global marketplace, and whether those negative consequences outweigh the benefits.Free traders argue that attempts to ameliorate the effects of trade can prove to be extremely costly.The Obama administration\u2019s decision to restrict tire imports from China, they contend, \u201csaved a maximum of 1,200 jobs\u201d at \u201cthe total cost to American consumers from higher prices\u201d of $1.1 billion in 2011. \u201cThe cost per job saved was at least $900,000 in that year. Only a very small fraction of this bloated figure reached the pockets of tire workers. Instead, most of the money landed in the coffers of tire companies, mainly abroad but also at home.\u201dBut even the E.P.I. analysis acknowledges that market forces are unlikely to be constrained: \u201cthe globalization of investment and production has eroded links between what is in the best interest of U.S. corporations and the national interest.\u201d\u201cWill each future generation continue to enjoy a better quality of life than its immediate predecessor? In developing countries that have not yet reached the technological frontier, the answer is almost certainly yes. In advanced economies, though the answer should still be yes, the challenges are becoming formidable.\u201dFor those American workers who have been battered by foreign competition, the possibility of a prolonged free fall cannot be discounted.Advertisement"}

For some, the storm-tossed shore is a blank canvas, awaiting new construction that could redefine the look and feel of the coastline. Others, in the market for a safer bet on the beach, are zeroing in on areas that emerged relatively unscathed. In short, Hurricane Sandy hit the reset button on the Jersey Shore.\u201cAt the end of the day, we\u2019re going to be in a better spot,\u201d said Eric J. Birchler, the owner of Birchler Realtors, which sells properties in Ortley Beach and Lavallette, two of the hardest hit areas. \u201cYou just stepped the entire gentrification of Ortley Beach forward five years because everything had to be rebuilt.\u201dSoon after Hurricane Sandy destroyed the vacation house and seasonal business of Chris Marino and Joanne de Fran\u00e7a-Marino in Lavallette, the couple began putting their lives back together. At first they planned to rebuild their 2,500-square-foot house across the street from the bay. But then they saw a listing for a nearby 12,000-square-foot parcel on a cove with 180 feet of bulkhead on the bay.Before the storm, the property had been listed for $1.898 million. But the Marinos bought it in March for $999,000. They plan to tear down the existing 1,600-square-foot brick house and invest about $1 million in a 4,200-square-foot, two-and a-half-story replacement. Outside will be a gazebo and an in-ground pool.\u201cIt\u2019s a phenomenal buying opportunity,\u201d said Mr. Marino, whose family has been summering on the Jersey Shore for generations. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the largest bulkheads on the whole island.\u201dOf the 127 miles of New Jersey coastline that spans four counties from Cape May in the south to Monmouth County in the north, Hurricane Sandy hit Ocean and Monmouth counties the hardest. In all, the storm destroyed or damaged 346,000 homes in New Jersey.But Sandy was not evenhanded in her wrath. While whole blocks in Ortley Beach were leveled, neighboring Midway Beach, replete with the very same style of bungalows, survived largely intact. While the handsome seaside mansions of Mantoloking were gutted, nearby Bay Head fared much better. Many people credit protective armor like sand dunes and sea walls for providing critical cover.Rebuilding in a high-hazard area is not cheap. If a house was destroyed or sustained substantial damage, it must be rebuilt to local floodplain requirements, which in the most risky areas can require costly measures like elevating the house on pilings or columns.Other protections include hurricane-proof windows and breakaway walls, which are exterior walls designed to collapse during a severe storm without causing damage to the elevated part of the house or to the foundation. Homeowners with federally backed mortgages must also buy flood insurance, which can be expensive. Owners who can\u2019t afford the flood insurance premiums or who can\u2019t afford to rebuild to these standards are selling.\u201cThis is now an opportunity to build bigger homes and they are certainly going to have to build them at a higher elevation and it\u2019s going to cost more,\u201d said Peter S. Reinhart, the director of the Kislak Real Estate Institute at Monmouth University. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to lose some of that blue-collar flavor in the area.\u201dFor Ortley Beach homeowners like John and Gina McConeghy, Hurricane Sandy closed a chapter on their lives. After the storm flooded their 800-square-foot bungalow with 22 inches of water, the couple ripped it down to the frame. But without flood insurance, they could not afford the $400,000 it would have cost to rebuild to floodplain requirements. So last February, the couple sold their property with views of the bay for $200,000.\u201cWhen you\u2019re down there and it\u2019s a nice day and the sun\u2019s out, and you hear the ocean, you\u2019re going to miss it,\u201d said Mr. McConeghy, a 54-year-old contractor who lives in Wayne, N.J. \u201cBut it became a business decision. I\u2019m not in the financial position to pay that kind of money for a summer home that I only use a few months out of the year.\u201dPrices for waterfront property in hard-hit areas plunged after the storm, largely because of damage to houses. Suddenly, towns where land was rarely available, like Mantoloking, had listings. Of waterfront homes that sold in the area between November 2012 and June 2013, the median selling price dropped 34 percent from the same time period a year earlier, according to an analysis of listings data by Tom Wissel, Multiple Listing Service coordinator for the Ocean County Board of Realtors.Buyers who had previously been priced out of the market may now be able to get a foothold in a town like Mantoloking, where a house with 70 feet of footage on the ocean sold for $3.75 million before the storm. After the storm, a similar lot with more than double the oceanfront footage sold for $2.75 million.In Lavallette, bayside lots that listed for $550,000 before the storm now list for $400,000. And in Ortley Beach, bayside lots that listed for $350,000 before the storm now list for $200,000, according to Birchler Realtors.\u201cPeople are starting to say, \u2018Hold it, I\u2019m going to miss out on this,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Shawn Clayton, the owner of Clayton & Clayton Realtors, which sells properties in Mantoloking and Bay Head. \u201c\u00a0\u2018Let me get my financing together so I don\u2019t miss out.\u2019\u00a0\u201dMuch of the area has been transformed into a construction zone. Drive along the oceanfront in Mantoloking and scores of stately houses are covered in Tyvek sheeting or are raised off their foundations.In Ortley Beach, whole blocks have been reduced to sandy lots punctuated by the occasional framing for a new house.\u00a0But other communities look pristine, with shops, homes and boardwalks largely restored.Since last July, Mr. Clayton\u2019s office has sold eight oceanfront properties, about one a month. Before Sandy, his company generally sold five such properties a year. Most buyers are tearing down what exists and building large elevated houses according to the stricter guidelines and adding elevators, swimming pools and walls of windows.Paul J. Scriffignano, 32, is one such buyer. He\u00a0has been summering on the Jersey Shore since childhood. After his parents\u2019 house in Brick was damaged by Sandy, Mr. Scriffignano began spending more time in the area helping his family recover.Last summer, he and his wife, Alexandra, 28, bought a property in Normandy Beach. They plan to tear down the existing house because of its condition and small size, and to replace it with a three-story 3,100-square-foot home built on pilings with a hurricane-proof roof and windows, five bedrooms and a swimming pool.\u201cI don\u2019t know if a storm like this is ever going to happen again, but I have a lot of friends and family here,\u201d said Mr. Scriffignano, whose sister and brother-in-law bought a vacation home in Curtis Point last summer. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like we wanted to band together and say, \u2018We don\u2019t want to give up on this area. Whatever happens, happens.\u2019\u00a0\u201dBarrier islands like Long Beach face another challenge: they sit on top of sediment that is slowly compacting, causing them to sink. As the sea level rises, the risk of coastal flooding increases even in a moderate storm.Flooding is already a chronic problem in New Jersey, and some wonder if allowing homeowners to rebuild in high-risk areas is good public policy. In the past nine years, the state has had 11 separate flooding events that have been severe enough to trigger a presidential disaster declaration. Yet the state remains committed to rebuilding rather than encouraging homeowners in flood-prone areas to relocate to higher ground.Since Sandy, New Jersey has provided homeowners with grant money to rebuild and has invested in infrastructure in flood-prone areas, like the new Route 35, which was breached during Sandy and is being rebuilt to withstand a 25-year storm, a $265 million project.The Jersey Shore is integral to the state\u2019s economy and to its identity. Tourism accounts for nearly 7 percent of the state\u2019s economy and half of the $40 billion-a-year tourism industry comes from the Shore. For people whose families have strolled the boardwalks for years, walking away is simply unimaginable.But a future with rising sea levels \u201cis where reality meets the romance of the coast,\u201d said Robert W. Freudenberg, the New Jersey director of the Regional Plan Association. \u201cYou want to be there, you want a piece of that, but if the reality is a future of evacuations and flooding, it puts a damper on that romance.\u201dLast summer, the first in Hurricane Sandy\u2019s wake, offered a glimpse of what evacuations and flooding can look like for the tourism industry. By the time the season opened, many boardwalks had been rebuilt and stores were ready for business, yet tourists were slow to arrive. Since vacationers typically book summer rentals in the winter, it appeared that many had decided to vacation elsewhere. A cool and wet spring only further dampened enthusiasm. Restaurants, shops and beaches were quiet, particularly in June and July.\u201cIf you were going on vacation, would you want to go to a spot that had been pretty devastated and you had to commit to a rental in January?\u201d said Joseph Feudi, 54, who struggled last summer to rent his vacation home in Loveladies on Long Beach Island.But by August, day-trippers and last minute vacationers returned to the Shore, making up for much of the lost revenue. Both Cape May County and Monmouth County came out ahead. And in Ocean County, tourism sales ultimately dropped by only 2.3 percent, according to a report by Tourism Economics.Already, summer 2014 is looking brighter as vacationers plan beach getaways after a particularly harsh winter. On the website HomeAway.com, inquiries for North Jersey Shore summer rentals are up 66 percent from the same time last year, according to the company.\u201cWhat I\u2019m hearing from everybody is the tourists are coming and we better be ready for them,\u201d said Robert Hilton, the executive director of the Jersey Shore Convention and Visitors Bureau.\u201cAlmost everyone asks about the storm,\u201d said Dawn Nassaney, the sales manager for 55 Melrose Terrace at Pier Village. \u201cIf we came through Sandy unscathed, that\u2019s a huge selling point.\u201dAnd on Long Beach Island, Ellen and Bob Farrell spent years searching, but had not been able to find a turnkey property for less than $1 million. It wasn\u2019t until after the storm that they finally found one: a 2,600-square-foot clapboard house with wood floors throughout, an open floor plan and an updated kitchen just a block from the beach in Surf City. The Farrells bought it on Halloween for $723,000.\u201cWith all the devastation that went on, there is no time like the present,\u201d Ms. Farrell, 50, said. \u201cSandy was a reality check for a lot of people, especially for us. We felt like we really need to step back and enjoy our lives.\u201d\u25a0Who has to elevate?Any home in a flood zone that was declared substantially damaged \u2014 meaning it would cost 50 percent or more of the home\u2019s pre-damage market value to restore \u2014 must be rebuilt to current standards, which may require elevating the property. New construction in a flood zone may also have to be elevated.How high must I build?Flood insuranceRequired for anyone with a federally backed mortgage in a flood zone. This can be costly for homes that aren\u2019t elevated. For example, the annual premium for a house built three feet below the recommended elevation level is $7,806 per year, and $374 a year for the same home built one foot above that level. FEMA can help policyholders cover some costs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lebanon Hosts Over a Million Who Fled Syria, U.N. Reports", "Date": "2014-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 The number of registered Syrian war refugees who have flooded into Lebanon exceeded one million on Thursday, the United Nations said, describing it as a devastating milestone in a humanitarian crisis that has overwhelmed this small country and severely taxed the ability of the government and aid organizations.Lebanon now has the highest concentration of refugees as a percentage of population in the world, with about one Syrian for every three Lebanese. And new refugees keep coming as the civil war, which by some estimates has left more than 150,000 people dead, grinds into its fourth year. Each day, the United Nations registers 2,500 refugees in Lebanon, equivalent to more than one person per minute.\u201cThe influx of a million refugees would be massive in any country. For Lebanon, a small nation beset by internal difficulties, the impact is staggering,\u201d Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, United Nations high commissioner for refugees, said in announcing the new number in a joint statement with Lebanon\u2019s minister of social affairs, Rachid Derbas. \u201cThe Lebanese people have shown striking generosity, but are struggling to cope.\u201dMr. Derbas called the breached threshold of one million \u201can occasion to launch a humanitarian and political call under the title: \u2018Lebanon should not be left alone.' \u201dGovernment and United Nations officials have said they believe that the actual number of Syrians in Lebanon because of the conflict is much higher, because many do not register their presence.This influx has overwhelmed public services, damaged the economy and raised fears that the same sectarian and political splits fueling the war in Syria could lead to greater violence here. Already, gunfights between neighborhoods that support opposite sides in the war are routine in the northern city of Tripoli, and a series of car bombs believed to be linked to the Syrian conflict has killed dozens of civilians.Unlike some of Syria\u2019s other neighbors, Lebanon has not built camps for refugees, leaving them to search for accommodations in host communities, often in unfinished buildings, storerooms or animal sheds. This has created tensions with the Lebanese, who often see the Syrians as a drain on resources.Half of the refugees in Lebanon are under 18, and only a quarter of the 400,000 school-age refugee children are in school.Reflecting the desperation of many refugees, a Syrian mother of four who fled Syria two years ago set herself on fire after her aid was cut, according to a United Nations official cited by Reuters. And a video that circulated online on Thursday showed a Syrian man committing suicide by leaping from the roof of an apartment building after losing his job.To handle the crisis, the Lebanese government, the United Nations and other aid agencies say they need $1.89 billion for 2014 and that only a fraction of that amount has been given so far.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Extends Tax Break Program to Spur Economy", "Date": "2014-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 The Chinese government on Wednesday announced a modest package of economic stimulus measures, the latest sign of concern by Beijing that growth may be slowing more than expected.The State Council, China\u2019s cabinet, decided at a meeting to extend tax breaks for small and very small enterprises through 2016 and said it was considering a significant broadening of those breaks.The council also gave a strong hint that it was preparing a broader response to recent signs of economic weakness, which have included lackluster business orders, industrial production and investment.\u201cOfficials attending Wednesday\u2019s cabinet meeting also said China will improve macrocontrol in 2014 with measures to stimulate enterprises, expand domestic consumption and boost employment,\u201d the government said in a statement distributed shortly before midnight by Xinhua, the state-controlled news agency. \u201cThere will also be fiscal help in coping with unexpected challenges.\u201dThe statement contained few other details, except to mention that railroad construction would be carried out rapidly and the renovation of rundown urban neighborhoods would continue. China plans to open 6,600 kilometers, or 4,100 miles, of new rail lines this year, an increase of 1,000 kilometers, or 620 miles, from last year. Prime Minister Li Keqiang had said the government would build or renovate homes for 4.7 million people currently living in makeshift shelters.China also intervened in currency markets on a huge scale in late February and through March, issuing torrents of renminbi so as to buy up dollars. That had the effect of at least temporarily driving down the value of the renminbi about 1 percent, which helps make Chinese exports more competitive in foreign markets. The extra renminbi moving through the economy also brought down short-term interest rates, making it easier for troubled real estate developers and other large borrowers to continue borrowing.But the scale of China\u2019s measures so far is much smaller than in 2009, during the global financial crisis. China limited its slowdown then with a huge spending program. The nation\u2019s central bank also expanded China\u2019s broadly measured money supply on a scale that dwarfed what the Federal Reserve achieved in the United States with its \u201cquantitative easing.\u201dChinese leaders have called repeatedly since then for a shift toward consumption-led growth, but achieving that has proved difficult.The Asian Development Bank in a report\u00a0on Tuesday called for governments across Asia, including China\u2019s, to adjust their fiscal policies to promote economic growth that is more inclusive of the poor. Zhuang Juzhong, the deputy chief economist of the Manila-based regional lending institution, said in an interview in Hong Kong\u00a0on Wednesday\u00a0that China relies heavily on consumption taxes to finance government spending, which does little to address the country\u2019s gap between rich and poor.At the same time, China has struggled to figure out how to introduce property taxes, which would tend to fall more heavily on the rich, and collects only a tenth of government revenues through personal income taxes, compared with roughly a third for affluent countries.Advertisement"}

Exactly the same three-sided tower was drawn on April 6, 1962, for Hertz Rent-a-Car and its archrival, Avis.Despite the ups and downs of leasing spherical, needlelike and cone-shaped buildings, the Port Authority achieved what Moses had a hard time doing elsewhere on the fairgrounds.\u201cWe announced in October 1963 that we had rented all two million square feet of space,\u201d said Patty Clark, the senior adviser for aviation policy in the authority\u2019s aviation department. \u201cWe did our job, and Moses was grateful.\u201dMs. Clark recalled a meeting in the mid-1990s with officials of the city\u2019s Department of Parks and Recreation. On the office wall was a rendering of dinosaurs, stamped \u201cPort of New York Authority.\u201d\u201cI was wondering what were we designing dinosaurs for,\u201d she said.The question was left hanging until last year, when Ms. Clark and her colleagues were researching the authority\u2019s role at the fair. The agency is involved with promoting tourism and economic development in Queens, home of La Guardia and Kennedy Airports.They reached out to Milton Pachter, 84, the senior litigation counsel at the authority, who was working for the agency in the 1960s and recalled the extent of the deal with Moses.Steven Rizick, the director of document services for capital projects in the parks department, made 150 original fair drawings available to the Port Authority, whose own archives were destroyed in the collapse of the World Trade Center in 2001.\u201cThank God they have them,\u201d Ms. Clark said, \u201cbecause we wouldn\u2019t.\u201dSome reproductions of the drawings will be on display through July 31 at the Queens Theater in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, then move to the Queens Botanical Garden.Ms. Clark surmised that a generous niche in the theater\u2019s curving wall might have served as the display area for a large-scale model of the World Trade Center. It was on the Port Authority\u2019s drawing boards at the time of the fair.Standing in the old theater, Ms. Clark called up the score for the documentary on her iPad and simply let it play. The darkened space filled with poignant melodies reminiscent of Aaron Copland.Up on the roof, from a ballroom built where the helipad used to be, one could have seen the silhouette of the new 1 World Trade Center against the growing twilight.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Recovery Has Created Far More Low-Wage Jobs Than Better-Paid Ones", "Date": "2014-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The deep recession wiped out primarily high-wage and middle-wage jobs. Yet the strongest employment growth during the sluggish recovery has been in low-wage work, at places like strip malls and fast-food restaurants.\u201cFast food is driving the bulk of the job growth at the low end \u2014 the job gains there are absolutely phenomenal,\u201d said Michael Evangelist, the report\u2019s author. \u201cIf this is the reality \u2014 if these jobs are here to stay and are going to be making up a considerable part of the economy \u2014 the question is, how do we make them better?\u201dThe report shows that total employment has finally surpassed its pre-recession level. \u201cThe good news is we\u2019re back to zero,\u201d Mr. Evangelist said.But job losses and gains have been skewed. Higher-wage industries \u2014 like accounting and legal work \u2014 shed 3.6 million positions during the recession and have added only 2.6 million positions during the recovery. But lower-wage industries lost two million jobs, then added 3.8 million.With joblessness high and job gains concentrated in low-wage industries, hundreds of thousands of Americans have accepted positions that pay less than they used to make, in some cases, sliding out of the middle class and into the ranks of the working poor.That includes Connie Ogletree, a former administrative and executive assistant who now earns $7.25 an hour at a McDonald\u2019s in Atlanta. \u201cIt was 40 years ago that I had my first fast-food job, at a Dairy Queen,\u201d said Ms. Ogletree, 55. \u201cThis is my second.\u201dMs. Ogletree is in school working toward a bachelor\u2019s degree, in the hope of returning to a white-collar position. But in the meantime, she and her older sister have scrimped and saved to make ends meet on her meager earnings.She said that she appreciated her job \u2014 many do not have one \u2014 but that she found the work tough. \u201cWhen you go into a fast-food restaurant, you want to be sure the people in the back are doing the best job they can,\u201d she said. \u201cYou want them not to be worried about missing a day if they\u2019re sick, to be able to go to a child\u2019s play at school or a P.T.A. meeting. I\u2019d like a vacation once a year, but my employer doesn\u2019t offer that, or sick days.\u201dThe National Employment Law Project study found that there were about a million fewer jobs in middle-wage industries \u2014 including parts of the health care system, loan servicing and real estate \u2014 than there were when the recession hit.Economists worry that even a stronger recovery might not bring back jobs in traditionally middle-class occupations eroded by mechanization and offshoring. The American work force might become yet more \u201cpolarized,\u201d with positions easier to find at the high and low ends than in the middle.The swelling of the low-wage work force has led to a push for policies to raise the living standards of the poor, including through job training, expansion of health care coverage and a higher minimum wage.President Obama has supported a Democratic proposal to lift the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour from its current level of $7.25.Raising it to $10.10 would \u201clift wages for nearly 28 million Americans across the country,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not just talking about young people on their first job. The average minimum-wage worker is 35 years old. They work hard, often in physically demanding jobs.\u201d But with congressional inaction stalling that proposal, many state and local governments have forged ahead on their own. States including Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, California and Rhode Island have raised their local minimum wages. And a total of 34 states are considering lifting their wage floors, while activists in other states are pushing for ballot referendums to do so.\u201cThey\u2019re actually getting the job done, so that workers get a raise,\u201d said Thea Lee, the deputy chief of staff of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. \u201cThe hope is that it creates momentum nationally and builds an activist base.\u201d But many Republicans oppose raising the wage floor while the economy remains weak. And many businesses staunchly oppose higher minimum wages because of the threat to their bottom lines.The National Employment Law Project study found especially strong growth in restaurants and food services, administrative and waste services and retail trades. Those industries \u2014 which often pay wages at the federal minimum \u2014 accounted for about 40 percent of the increase in private sector employment over the past four years.There has also been strong jobs growth in some high-paying industries, like professional, scientific and technical services \u2014 a category that includes accountants, lawyers, software developers and engineers. That sector accounted for about 9 percent of the private-sector job gains in the recovery.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Syria\u2019s Lost Generation", "Date": "2014-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionSOMETHING about the boy was not right. He seemed disoriented, detached from his surroundings. He barely spoke, and when he did, it was in flat monosyllables, his eyes unfocused and downcast, as if too heavy to roll up from the weight of all they had seen. He was the picture of quiet devastation, of a childhood forever splintered. He was 14 years old, a Syrian refugee, sitting with his family in a small room in the registration building of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Erbil, northern Iraq. In the crowded, noisy offices downstairs, scores of newly arrived refugees queued to register, including an exhausted-looking, dust-sheathed family of Dom Gypsies and a Syrian woman with a club foot, who limped about the hallways and pleaded with every passer-by to give her asylum in Germany.In the upstairs office, the boy\u2019s father sat across a table from me. A supple, boyish-looking 36-year-old, he recounted, with admirable calm, the story of his family\u2019s harrowing escape, two weeks earlier, from their hometown, Aleppo, and their subsequent trip across the Turkish border and into the Kurdistan region of Iraq. Before the war, he said, he worked at a shoe store, and his three children excelled at school. It was a modest but happy middle-class life. But then came war, and suddenly rocket-propelled grenades were whooshing in all day and Aleppo was honeycombed by falling bombs. He lost his job and his children\u2019s school closed; they would lose two full years of schooling before the family\u2019s eventual escape.Soon, there was no electricity, no telephone service, no food. The father sold the family\u2019s belongings, down to the last piece of furniture. When the money ran out, he borrowed flour from neighbors for his wife to make bread. \u201cSometimes we weren\u2019t eating for two or three days, but just giving the bread and water to the children to eat to survive,\u201d he said.Still, he felt comparatively lucky, as blasts had somehow missed the building where they lived. But the family\u2019s luck ran out when a bomb struck their five-story building. The top floor was demolished. He described a scene of carnage. Four people died: one old man and three children; many more were wounded. That was when the family decided to flee and come to Erbil to stay with his brother, who worked at a hotel. I found myself hoping he would not tell me this, but he did: \u201cOur kids have seen everything. People torn into 100 pieces. The meat of humans torn apart in front of us \u2014 flesh and blood.\u201d I stole a look at his boy, and caught a darkness flitting across his face.I am a father of two children. I cannot imagine what it would do to them, to see such grisly things. Yet that is happening every day in Syria. A whole generation of children, witness to the unfolding catastrophe, is unable to attend school, their lives shaped by violence, grief and displacement.They face a broken future. Syria is on the verge of losing a generation. This is perhaps the most dooming consequence of this terrible war.PAYMAN wore a striped blue T-shirt with a cartoon butterfly on the front, but like many Syrian children I have met, her demeanor had a maturity exceeding her years. In the family tent, Payman showed me old photographs and played for me home videos of a long-ago birthday party. They had watched those videos countless times, she said, and still, every night, they gathered to watch them again, transfixed by those grainy images of freer, happier incarnations of themselves. Payman remained composed until I uttered the word \u201ceducation.\u201d Tears came to her dark eyes as she told me that her hopes of finishing school and becoming a writer seemed like a threadbare dream now. \u201cWithout school there is no future,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no happiness.\u201dT. S. Eliot once wrote that humankind could not bear very much reality. But this is one reality that we must all bear, one we cannot let vanish in a fog of apathy. Syria\u2019s neighboring countries cannot and should not carry the cost of caring for refugees on their own. The international community must share the burden with them by providing economic aid, investing in development in those countries, and opening their own borders to desperate Syrian families looking for protection. And ordinary citizens can help fund the education of millions of Syrian children like Payman, to ensure that their future is not wrecked.When we left the registration building, I spotted the father I had met earlier, and his family, waiting in a crowded office to be registered. His son sat on a wooden chair, unmoving, his arms crossed, unseeing eyes staring ahead.For a moment, he looked in my direction. I glimpsed the plight of an entire generation of Syrian children, caught between the pain of what has happened and the uncertainty of what is yet to arrive. The boy blinked and looked away. I saw no recognition in his eyes. Advertisement"}

Cast in the leading role of the rotund Doug Heffernan was an actor who was slim and fit and more suited to global-economy television. Looking at Queens from a certain vantage point, say, the F.D.R. Drive just south of the United Nations, it is hard not to mine a metaphor from this, because these days Queens itself is taller and skinnier and cosmetically rearranged; in some sense it isn\u2019t the new Brooklyn so much as it has become the old Manhattan.So if you haven\u2019t been paying attention, Queens is over before you even knew it got going. Long Island City, not too long ago, acquired its own branch of TriBeCa Pediatrics, founded by a French laissez-faire parenting guru, Dr. Michel Cohen, the preferred pediatrician of the Lower Manhattan celebrity class.

The $5,388,000 penthouse had been used as a pied-\u00e0-terre, and with a small dining area, vast terrace and large bar, it had the vibe of a place you keep girlfriends, not longstanding wives and grandchildren.

{"Headline": "A Billion-Dollar Bracelet Is the Key to a Disney Park", "Date": "2014-04-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byORLANDO, Fla. \u2014 Walt Disney World has spent more than a year rolling out a $1 billion system that changes how visitors do everything from enter their hotel rooms to ride Space Mountain. But a few weeks ago a front desk agent at one of Disney\u2019s marquee hotels was still wrestling with the technology.Among other perks, the system provides a service called FastPass+, which allows visitors to prebook front-of-the-line access to three rides, parades or character meet-and-greets. The system also strives to make it easier for guests to buy food and merchandise \u2014 just stand at the register and swipe your wristband, called a MagicBand, which also functions as room key, park ticket and V.I.P. access. Disney thinks people will spend more money and time at the 40-square-mile mega-resort if they find it easier to navigate.\u201cWe are pretty transparently upping our promise to our guests, and that is why we\u2019re being so deliberate about this test-and-adjust period,\u201d said Thomas O. Staggs, Disney\u2019s parks and resorts chairman. \u201cDelight turns very quickly to expectation.\u201dHe added: \u201cCertain things have taken longer to make broadly available than we initially would have liked, but our rollout was designed to be flexible to ensure that the guest experience was always our first priority.\u201dMr. Staggs said that about three and a half million people had participated in tests of the new system, adding that the early feedback had been \u201cfantastic.\u201d Among the findings: Because guests no longer have to present paper tickets at turnstiles, the system has reduced the park entry time by 25 percent.The technology allowed Disney to accommodate 3,000 additional daily guests at its Magic Kingdom park over Christmas. Mr. Staggs said use of the new FastPass reservation system has increased 40 percent over the old one, freeing people from standing in line and increasing the number of experiences they have there. Still, investors have been keenly waiting for financial evidence that the $1 billion investment is paying off. Disney\u2019s parks business has lately been a good one \u2014 operating profit climbed 17 percent last year, to $2.33 billion \u2014 but the company\u2019s spending on the project has dented margins at its flagship property here. Underscoring its importance to the company, analysts have peppered Disney executives with questions about the system in recent conference calls.\u201cWe have a positive view of the project, and technology this complex always takes longer than you expect to roll out,\u201d said Michael Nathanson, an analyst at the research firm MoffettNathanson. \u201cBut we\u2019re still trying to figure out how to measure the return on what is a rather large investment. That\u2019s where the frustration is.\u201dRobert A. Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive, has encouraged patience. \u201cThis is still a very new product, so we are not even close to being able to quantify it,\u201d he told analysts in February.Seated in his office at Disney headquarters in Burbank, Calif., a smiling Mr. Staggs dismissed such chatter. He said that the initiative had stayed within budget. He also said that a faster-than-expected consumer shift to mobile devices had actually saved Disney money; most guests are using their smartphones to gain access to the system while inside the parks, reducing the need for Disney to install costly kiosks.Mr. Staggs emphasized that a longer-than-expected testing period had resulted in multiple enhancements, with more on the way.For instance, Disney will soon allow visitors additional quick reservation access on the day of their visit. It is also working on an upgrade that will give guests more flexibility \u2014 using the line-skipping feature across multiple parks in a single day, for example, and making it easier for groups of people to use the system.The company has also been tweaking the hotel room door sensors, some of which were installed in locations that made them awkward to tap with a wristband. \u201cWe want it to be comfortable,\u201d Mr. Staggs said.Changes at Disney\u2019s parks often prompt a degree of consumer crankiness, a reflection of how deeply people care about the properties. (A simple pruning of trees at Disneyland a few years ago prompted a social media panic.) The new wristband system has been no exception. But some of the bigger Disney fan sites give the system high marks.Advertisement"}

Though selling citizenship outright is rare, Malta\u2019s move comes as a growing number of European countries buffeted by economic hard times, including Portugal, Spain and Greece, are dangling the possibility of residency to high-flying foreigners in return for substantial investments. The United States also offers residency, though not citizenship, for entrepreneurs who invest at least $1 million and meet other criteria.The citizenship offer \u2014 which will enable travel within the European Union\u2019s 27 other member states and visa-free trips to 69 countries outside the bloc, including the United States \u2014 comes at a steep price: $891,000 in cash, and up to $685,000 in property and investments.Officials in the government of Prime Minister Joseph Muscat reject criticism that the plan is a get-rich-quick scheme that could expose Europe to a flood of undesirable entrants. \u201cWe are not trying to make a quick buck,\u201d Kurt Farrugia, a government spokesman, said in a phone interview. \u201cWe are a small country, and we want people to know about us and invest in our country.\u201dMr. Farrugia insisted that the screening would be rigorous and that the government would make the final decision on citizenship for each applicant.But opponents say they are concerned about a potential conflict of interest in the vetting process, which is being subcontracted chiefly to Henley & Partners, a consulting firm based in the British Channel Islands. The company is both recruiting applicants and examining them to weed out criminals, terrorists and other questionable characters.Eric G. Major, the chief executive of Henley & Partners, said in a telephone interview that Iranian and Syrian applicants would not be accepted because of the international sanctions imposed against those countries. He said those interested in the program came mainly from countries from which travel is restricted.\u201cThey can get the travel monkey off of their backs,\u201d Mr. Major said. Those with murky pasts, he added emphatically, need not apply.Mr. Major said there was no conflict of interest because Henley had created a strict separation between the departments doing marketing and vetting.Opponents say they are particularly concerned about a provision in the law that allows someone with a criminal record to obtain citizenship, at the discretion of the internal affairs minister, if the Maltese agency overseeing the program is \u201csatisfied that the applicant is still worthy of being considered for approval due to special circumstances.\u201d Among the worries is that wealthy criminals could abuse this provision by claiming they are fleeing politically motivated charges.Mr. Major said the vetting process encompassed multiple steps, including criminal and financial background checks using online databases, vetting by independent security contractors and an analysis using risk assessment software. He said the Maltese government would then do its own checks through resources such as Interpol and American government agencies. American officials said the United States reviewed the security impact of its visa waiver programs with individual countries every two years. They stressed that visa-free travel does not guarantee admission to the United States.Some people with criminal records have slipped through the cracks in countries offering immigrant investment programs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "College for Criminals", "Date": "2014-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe punch lines of the opposing politicians (mostly Republicans, but some Democrats) all struck the same theme: How dare the governor offer taxpayer money to educate convicted criminals when decent citizens skimp and borrow to send their kids to college? \u201cIt should be \u2018do the crime, do the time,\u2019 not \u2018do the crime, earn a degree,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said George D. Maziarz, a state senator from western New York. \u201cIt is simply beyond belief to give criminals a competitive edge in the job market over law-abiding New Yorkers who forgo college because of the high cost.\u201d In other words, let criminals be criminals.An upstate assemblyman, James N. Tedisco, warned that educating inmates \u201cmakes them smarter criminals.\u201d Invoking the chemistry-lessons-gone-lethal of \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d he envisioned Mr. Cuomo\u2019s proposal \u201cturning a bunch of Jesse Pinkmans into Walter Whites \u2014 all on the taxpayer\u2019s dime.\u201d You can take from all this a lesson about the impetuous politics of Andrew Cuomo. You can deplore the eagerness of cynical or small-minded lawmakers to pander to our least generous instincts. But the instincts are real. The larger shame is the deep American ambivalence about the very purpose of prison.Considering that the United States is the world\u2019s leading warden, we should be able to answer with some conviction this question: What is prison for?First, punishment, although it is often demeaning, brutal, psychologically debilitating and wildly disproportionate to the offense. Second, public safety. Social scientists argue about how much of our recent decline in crime is attributable to a surge in incarceration (I\u2019ve heard estimates from 3 percent to 30 percent). But common sense says at least some of it is.Third, rehabilitation. The bureaucracies that run prisons are called departments of \u201ccorrections\u201d for a reason. This is at least as important as the first two purposes, because nearly 95 percent of the incarcerated are eventually released back into society. Yet while 76 percent of prisons in the country offer high school diploma programs, only a third offer college degrees, which are, more than ever, a prerequisite for decent jobs. Education programs are among the first things to go in a recession. Now \u2014 when the economy is in slow recovery, the crime rate is relatively low, and there is an emerging national awareness that our way of punishment wastes money and lives \u2014 should be an opportune time to expand inmate education. But it has to be sold, not sprung without groundwork.Experts who have studied the American way of crime and punishment far longer than I have tell me, to quote Michael P. Jacobson, a veteran corrections official who heads a public policy institute for the City University of New York, that they see \u201calmost a complete disconnect between what we know and what we do.\u201d\u201cThe influence of high-profile crimes, fear of crime, issues of race, the acquisition of cheap political capital \u2014 all have had far more influence on criminal justice policy than what we know works, or what is fair or just,\u201d Mr. Jacobson told me.Governor Cuomo is now trying to rally private donors to underwrite his college program for a year, with an understanding that he will get the state to take over in Year 2. Let\u2019s hope. But apparently the inmates of Sing Sing and Attica are not the only ones in need of correction. Advertisement"}

That\u2019s Good News.", "Date": "2014-04-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEveryday EconomicsIf people in your office seem to be tingling with excitement this week, it is probably because of all the big economic news on the way. The two biggest regular United States economic reports are scheduled to come out, with first-quarter gross domestic product on tap for Wednesday and April jobs numbers out on Friday. Federal Reserve policy makers are meeting Tuesday and Wednesday for one of their regular sessions to set the nation\u2019s monetary policy. And a variety of other important data releases are coming, including personal income and spending, manufacturing and home prices.What, no tingling? You\u2019re not alone. Because as important as all that stuff is, it is substantially less important, and less interesting, than it has been any time in the last seven years. The economy has gotten boring, and that\u2019s fantastic news \u2014 even if it would be even better news if that underlying growth path were a bit stronger.After a steep housing downturn, a catastrophic recession and a glacially slow return to growth, the United States economy has spent the last three years displaying astonishing consistency. It is growing a bit, but only a bit, faster, than 2 percent. It is adding about 2 million jobs a year.The last few years, miserable as they have been for typical workers, have been glory days for the people who parse the latest evidence to see whether the economy is slowing up or speeding down: business forecasters, bank economists, central bankers, economic journalists.In 2007, everybody was looking for evidence of whether the housing sector collapse and financial freeze-up that began was going to have an impact on the overall economy. (It didn\u2019t, at least until the end of the year.) In 2008, a deep recession was underway, and in 2009 it ended. In 2010 and 2011, the recovery seemed so soft and fragile that there seemed to be new evidence every day that it was faltering. But since 2012, the story has been quite different.Economic data can jump around for any given month or quarter for all kinds of reasons. For example, fourth-quarter gross domestic product was relatively strong thanks to a one-time buildup of business inventories, and the first-quarter number is expected to be weak because of bad winter weather. But over a longer time horizon, those fluctuations should wash out and the true trend become evident.The accompanying chart shows that trend, in the form of job creation.You\u2019ll see similar consistency if you look at G.D.P. growth, industrial output or any number of other measures of economic well-being. In a reflection of that consistency in the economic data, the Federal Reserve is on a similarly predictable path, slowing the rate of its stimulus program gradually over the course of this year (a path that the central bank is all but certain to affirm at its meeting this week).So why do I take this consistency as such good news, even though it is slower than the kind of growth that would rapidly return the nation to a position of full economic health?Because it is a sign that the nation has gotten out of crisis mode. No longer does another downturn seem to lurk around every corner. Corporate executives have spent the last several years complaining about uncertainty hanging around the economy. Now the economy \u2014 and business confidence \u2014 seems to take even potentially damaging episodes, like the government shutdown last October, in stride.And while 3 or 4 percent growth would be better, steady repair of the economy beats a return of a boom-bust cycle that might have accompanied a quicker recovery, particularly if it had been driven by a return to bubble-era housing construction.Boring consistency is terrible news for people who want to write splashy headlines about the latest data. But it\u2019s good news for everybody else.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ailing Pulaski Skyway Offers a Lesson in Creative Financing", "Date": "2014-04-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGothamThe governor of New Jersey is bullish on honesty.\u201cWe are failing our taxpayers when we refuse to honestly address these problems and try to fool them into believing that choices do not need to be made,\u201d Chris Christie said in his budget address in February. \u201cWe are better than that.\u201dThe governor was talking at that point about public union pensions, a favorite whipping boy. If he had felt a seizure of honesty coming on, however, he might have done well to start barking the words \u201cPulaski Skyway\u201d over and over again.Because so much of what plagues his economically damaged state can be explained by the fate of that Neolithic-looking black iron and steel bridge that crawls over the Hackensack and Passaic Rivers. Each day tens of thousands of commuters beep and curse as their cars crawl across this ungainly bridge toward the Holland Tunnel. Like a striking number of this state\u2019s bridges and highways, the 82-year-old Skyway is on life support. This week state officials shut down its Manhattan-bound lanes for two years, while a billion-dollar repair is carried out.Necessity is not the question here. The state transportation commissioner recently pointed to its rusting crossbeams and noted to The Record, a northern New Jersey newspaper, that the structure \u201cis rotting away.\u201dHow to fund these repairs, however, is a grave problem. The governor loves to talk of the New Jersey Miracle, but his state is a transportation pauper. Its transportation trust fund teeters on insolvency, with most of its money going to pay off old bonds. Desperate to find funds, the governor embraced the chop shop option. First he killed a planned $8.7 billion commuter train tunnel under the Hudson River. Many argued this tunnel would ensure the future health of the region\u2019s economy. Whatever: Today trumps tomorrow in politics.Federal officials tried to renegotiate the cost of that tunnel, and the governor and his aides kept shaking their heads. \u201cThey could never take \u2018yes\u2019 for an answer,\u201d a transportation planner familiar with these negotiations said. \u201cThey needed the money to fix their roads.\u201dThe Pulaski bridge, alas, leads to the Holland Tunnel, which does not qualify, as it was built before the creation of the Port Authority.The governor stomped and demanded. Soon the Port Authority\u2019s lawyers rebranded the Pulaski Skyway an \u201caccess road\u201d to the Lincoln Tunnel.Legal fiction is a creative field.The governor had other options. He could have sought to raise New Jersey\u2019s gas tax, which is the second lowest in the nation. Every penny added to that tax is good for about $50 million. Raise the tax by a dime and you can repair a lot of bridges and roads.Administered by a candid fellow like the governor, a tincture of persuasion and honesty might have helped residents understand that a tax increase would result in a $4 to $5 monthly increase for most drivers. As it is, an engineering study found that the state\u2019s banged-up roads exact another toll. The average New Jersey driver now spends $600 each year fixing pothole-damaged cars. \u201cIt would have been a tough sell,\u201d Janna Chernetz, of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, said. \u201cBut you accept the governorship and you accept all the problems that come with it.\u201dThe governor, to his credit, has signed off on toll increases on the turnpike, the Garden State Parkway and the bridges and tunnels. He gave a thumbs up for a big fare increase for train commuters. In his lexicon, however, those are \u201cuser fees.\u201d Taxes remain a no-walk zone. It should be noted that the governor\u2019s concern for cost overruns is a flickering candle. The Delaware River Port Authority is carrying out a massive rail repair on the Ben Franklin Bridge from Camden, N.J., to Philadelphia. Mr. Christie\u2019s appointees on that authority approved a deal with politically powerful labor unions that led in part to costs jumping from about $69 million to close to $103 million. A few years back, Mr. Christie explained why he cashed in the Hudson River tunnel and demanded that the Port Authority give him the money. \u201cWe understand that nothin\u2019 is given to us,\u201d he said. Take it and offer no apologies. That approach at least has the virtue of honesty. Email: powellm@nytimes.com; \nTwitter: @powellnyt Advertisement"}

The Dow Jones industrial average also rose above its record closing level during trading, but finished just short of its first record high of the year.The market has turned higher this week after moving largely sideways for most of the year as reports have suggested that the economy is strengthening after slowing during an unusually harsh winter.The catalyst on Wednesday was a private survey that showed that companies increased hiring at a rapid pace last month after a strong manufacturing survey on Tuesday.\u201cIn January and February we had that weather weakness,\u201d said Jerry Braakman, chief investment officer of First American Trust.

The payroll processor ADP said private employers added 191,000 jobs. It revised February\u2019s job creation to 153,000 from the 139,000 reported earlier. The ADP report precedes the government\u2019s report on March employment on Friday.Economists are forecasting that employers added 200,000 jobs in March, according to the data provider FactSet.

The sector has risen 2.7 percent in the last week, in the face of signs that manufacturing is strengthening. After the jobs report on Friday, investors will focus on corporate earnings, as companies start to report first-quarter results. Earnings are expected to grow by just 0.4 percent for the quarter after rising 7.8 percent in the fourth quarter, according to S&P Capital IQ. Expectations for earnings are low, in part because of the harsh winter, said Jeffrey Kleintop, chief market strategist for LPL Financial. But investors will be looking for signs that companies are expecting revenues to increase in the rest of the year.\u201cThe question is, did they start to see a reacceleration toward the end of the quarter, as we\u2019re seeing in some of this economic data,\u201d Mr. Kleintop said.In the bond market, interest rates moved higher after the ADP hiring report. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note climbed to 2.80 percent from 2.76 percent late Tuesday, while its price fell 13/32, to 99 18/32.Among stocks on the move, MannKind soared $2.97, or 74 percent, to $6.99 after Food and Drug Administration advisers voted unanimously to recommend approval of the drug Afrezza, a fast-acting insulin, for patients with the most common form of diabetes.

Islamic, Shariah-compliant, finance is growing in both scale and sophistication but there is a catch: Experts say there is a shortage of qualified people to work in the field.\u201cThere aren\u2019t a lot of Emiratis specialized academically in this field, and I had always had an interest in how it works differently from conventional finance,\u201d said Ms. Ahmed, who is studying finance at the British University in Dubai. \u201cI made sure to get work experience in Islamic finance, too, and now if it becomes the capital of the Islamic economy, I should be able to get a good position.\u201dWhile general finance degrees and courses are easy to find in the United Arab Emirates, Islamic finance studies have remained limited, even for dedicated students like Ms. Ahmad, hindering efforts by the Gulf state to challenge the established market leaders, Kuala Lumpur and London. At stake is a substantial and growing volume of potential business. According to a recent report by the ratings agency Standard & Poor\u2019s, issuance of sukuk, or Islamic bonds, is projected to exceed $100 billion worldwide in 2014. That is about the same level as last year, but within that total, double-digit percentage growth is expected in issues by Gulf borrowers, to finance heavy infrastructure spending in the region.Following the December decree, higher education institutions in Dubai are strengthening their programs in Islamic finance. New offerings include the master\u2019s course that Ms. Ahmad hopes to join, at the British University.Total Islamic financial assets are growing 17 percent per year and are set to reach a value of $2.67 trillion in 2017, according to Pricewaterhouse Coopers. A recent analysis by Tahseen Consulting, which advises on strategic and organizational issues in the Arab world, forecasts that employment in Islamic financial services in the Emirates will double, to 20,000, in 2015, from 10,000 now.As the industry has evolved, academia has tried to keep up by offering relevant training. According to a report issued late last year by Thomson Reuters and ICD, the Islamic Corporation for the Development of the Private Sector, more than 530 institutions worldwide now offer courses or degrees in Islamic finance. The U.A.E., in third place behind Britain and Malaysia, has 31 course providers and 9 fully accredited degree providers. But the jointly produced Islamic Finance Development Report, based on a survey of 60 banks in 15 countries, said that half had reported difficulties in hiring suitably skilled graduates for entry-level positions.The Emirates has \u201ca long way to go when it comes to quality teachers, diversity and number of programs offered and curricula,\u201d said Abdullah Alshamsi, a business professor at the British University in Dubai. \u201cIt\u2019s not all up to academia,\u201d he added. \u201cWe have to work together with banks and lawyers and other stakeholders to address the shortage of skills.\u201dDubai International Academic City is a free zone for international university campuses. Established in 2007, it has 21 campuses with 20,000 students in over 400 programs. But Ayoub Kazim, its managing director, said, \u201cHistorically, the focus on training and education in such a specialized industry has been pretty limited.\u201d \u201cWe are working on that,\u201d the director said, \u201cas we bring together industry experts, government officials and leading academics to identify the existing and emerging skills gaps within the Islamic finance sector.\u201dWithin the banking industry, some institutions are developing their intern programs to provide more hands-on training for students to get practical experience. Emirates Islamic, for example, which has run a summer program for the past five years, expanded it this year to 20 interns from 12. Still, more is needed. \u201cEmployers must dedicate themselves to providing genuine on-the-job training,\u201d said Rashid Mahboob, senior vice president at Dubai Islamic Bank. \u201cWe need to work together with academia to nurture the human capital needed to meet the sector\u2019s expected growth.\u201dMuneer Khan, a partner at the law firm Simmons and Simmons Middle East, who specializes in Islamic finance in London and Dubai, said, \u201cWhat Dubai recognizes is that the local population is relatively small and the corporate community is not huge, so they want to be able to cater to a wider community as Islamic finance grows in popularity regionally and internationally.\u201d \u201cDubai wants to position itself in a way so that the expertise in terms of bankers and lawyers are available here to structure products anywhere in the world,\u201d he added.Over the past five years, Mr. Khan says, he has received resum\u00e9s from hundreds of students worldwide who want to join the firm\u2019s Islamic finance team: but while many had academic qualifications, most lacked work experience, he said. In Britain, there are agreements under which leading law firms pay school fees for a student\u2019s final year after an internship, which allows for synergy between industry and academia. Not so in Dubai, he said: When his firm takes on interns in Dubai, they lack essential skills because academic programs have failed to keep up with the industry.\u201cIf banks, which are the largest potential Islamic finance employers, are saying to universities that students aren\u2019t ready for business, they need to work directly with them to provide the right skills,\u201d Mr. Khan said. \u201cIf this isn\u2019t resolved in the next few years, there will be a really serious problem in the marketplace.\u201d Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Are Iran and Israel Trading Places?", "Date": "2014-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionSTANFORD, Calif. \u2014 Although the Israeli and Iranian governments have been virtually at war with each other for decades, the two countries have much in common. Both are home to some of the oldest civilizations on earth, and both are primarily non-Arab states in a mostly Arab region. In the 1950s, David Ben-Gurion\u2019s Israel and Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi\u2019s Iran were bastions of secular nationalism; the shah pushed authoritarian modernization, while Ben-Gurion advanced a form of nonreligious Zionism. Only after the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran did radical Islam all but eclipse this secular brand of politics. It held on for much longer in Israel but is now under threat.Both Iran and Israel are now entering potentially challenging new stages in their relations with the outside world, and particularly with the United States. Over the last seven years, United Nations Security Council resolutions have imposed sanctions on Iran with the aim of halting its nuclear program. For years, Iran\u2019s former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad railed against the \u201cGreat Satan.\u201d But even if Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is still opposed to reforms, it appears that some officials inside Iran have finally realized that continued intransigence and bellicosity will beget only more sanctions and catastrophic economic consequences. As the winds of change blow across Iran, secular democrats in Israel have been losing ground to religious and right-wing extremists who feel comfortable openly attacking the United States, Israel\u2019s strongest ally. In recent months, Israel\u2019s defense minister, Moshe Yaalon, called Secretary of State John Kerry \u201cobsessive and messianic,\u201d while Naftali Bennett, Israel\u2019s economy minister, labeled Mr. Kerry a \u201cmouthpiece\u201d for anti-Semitic elements attempting to boycott Israel. Israel\u2019s secular democrats are growing increasingly worried that Israel\u2019s future may bear an uncomfortable resemblance to Iran\u2019s recent past.For more than three decades, Iran\u2019s oil wealth has allowed its religious leaders to stay in power. But sanctions have taken a serious economic toll, with devastating effects on the Iranian people. The public, tired of Mr. Ahmadinejad\u2019s bombastic and costly rhetoric, has replaced him with Hassan Rouhani, a pragmatist who has promised to fix the economy and restore relations with the West. But Mr. Rouhani\u2019s rise is in reality the consequence of a critical cultural and demographic shift in Iran \u2014 away from theocracy and confrontation, and toward moderation and pragmatism. Recent tensions between America and Russia have emboldened some of Iran\u2019s radicals, but the government on the whole seems still intent on continuing the nuclear negotiations with the West. Iran is a land of many paradoxes. The ruling elite is disproportionately made up of aged clerics \u2014 all men \u2014 while 64 percent of the country\u2019s science and engineering degrees are held by women. In spite of the government\u2019s concentrated efforts to create what some have called gender apartheid in Iran, more and more women are asserting themselves in fields from cinema to publishing to entrepreneurship. Many prominent intellectuals and artists who three decades ago advocated some form of religious government in Iran are today arguing for popular sovereignty and openly challenging the antiquated arguments of regime stalwarts who claim that concepts of human rights and religious tolerance are Western concoctions and inimical to Islam. More than 60 percent of Iranians are under age 30, and they overwhelmingly believe in individual liberty. It\u2019s no wonder that last month Ayatollah Khamenei told the clerical leadership that what worried him most was a non-Islamic \u201ccultural invasion\u201d of the country. As moderate Iranians and some of the country\u2019s leaders cautiously shift toward pragmatism and the West, it seems that many Israelis are moving away from these attitudes. In its 66 years, Israel has seen its share of ideological shifts from dovish to hawkish. These were natural fluctuations driven mainly by the country\u2019s security situation and prospects for peace. But the current shift is being accelerated by religion and demography, and is therefore qualitatively different. While the Orthodox Jewish parties are currently not part of the government, together with Mr. Bennett\u2019s Jewish Home, a right-wing religious party, they hold about 25 percent of seats in the Knesset. The Orthodox parties aspire to transform Israel into a theocracy. And with an average birthrate of 6.5 children per family among Orthodox Jews (compared with 2.6 for the rest of the Jewish population), their dream might not be too far away. By contrast, Iran has a falling birthrate \u2014 a clear indication of growing secularism, and the sort of thing that keeps Ayatollah Khamenei awake at night. The long-term power of these demographic trends will, in our view, override Iran\u2019s current theocratic intransigence and might eclipse any fleeting victories for liberalism in Israel.Israel\u2019s shift toward orthodoxy is not merely a religious one. Since the vast majority of Orthodox Jews are also against any agreement with the Palestinians, with each passing day, the chances of reaching a peace deal diminish. Nor is time on the side of those who want to keep seeing a democratic Israel. If Israel continues the expansion of settlements, and peace talks serve no purpose but the extension of the status quo, the real existential threat to Israel will not be Iran\u2019s nuclear program but rather a surging tide of economic sanctions.What began a few years ago with individual efforts to get supermarket shoppers in Western countries to boycott Israeli oranges and hummus has turned into an orchestrated international campaign, calling for boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Israeli companies and institutions. From academic boycotts to calls for divestment on American university campuses to the unwillingness of more and more European financial institutions to invest in or partner with Israeli companies and banks that operate in the West Bank, the \u201cB.D.S.\u201d movement is gaining momentum. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has recently called B.D.S. advocates \u201cclassical anti-Semites in modern garb.\u201d In the past, Israel could rely on Western nations and especially the United States to halt such initiatives, but as the fabric of Israel\u2019s population changes, and Jewish populations in the West become less religious and less uncritically pro-Israel, the reflex to stand by the Jewish state, regardless of its policies, is weakening. Moreover, as Western countries shift toward greater respect for human rights, the occupation is perceived as a violation of Western liberal norms. A new generation of American Jews sees a fundamental tension between their own liberal values and many Israeli policies.This, coupled with the passing of the older generation and a high rate of interfaith marriage among American Jews, means the pro-Israel lobby will no longer be as large or as united as it used to be. While American presidents from Lyndon B. Johnson to Barack Obama have declared that the United States\u2019 commitment to Israel flows from strategic interests and shared values, in a generation or two, interests may be all that\u2019s left. An opposite shift is occurring in Iran\u2019s diaspora. An estimated five to seven million Iranians live in exile. Their economic, scientific, scholarly and cultural achievements are now well known in the United States thanks to people like the eBay founder Pierre Omidyar. They are increasingly establishing themselves as a powerful force advocating a more democratic Iran and better relations with the United States. Just as a united Jewish diaspora once helped the new state of Israel join the ranks of prosperous, industrialized states, Iran\u2019s diaspora could one day play a similar role for a post-theocratic Iran.One of Israel\u2019s most popular singers, the Iranian-born Rita Jahanforuz, laments on her recent album, \u201cIn this world, I am alone and abandoned, like wild grass in the middle of the desert.\u201d If Iran\u2019s moderates fail to push the country toward reform, and if secular Israelis can\u2019t halt the country\u2019s drift from democracy to theocracy, both Iranians and Israelis will increasingly find themselves fulfilling her sad prophecy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Salvation Gets Cheap", "Date": "2014-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut there is one piece of the assessment that is surprisingly, if conditionally, upbeat: Its take on the economics of mitigation. Even as the report calls for drastic action to limit emissions of greenhouse gases, it asserts that the economic impact of such drastic action would be surprisingly small. In fact, even under the most ambitious goals the assessment considers, the estimated reduction in economic growth would basically amount to a rounding error, around 0.06 percent per year.What\u2019s behind this economic optimism? To a large extent, it reflects a technological revolution many people don\u2019t know about, the incredible recent decline in the cost of renewable energy, solar power in particular.Before I get to that revolution, however, let\u2019s talk for a minute about the overall relationship between economic growth and the environment.Other things equal, more G.D.P. tends to mean more pollution. What transformed China into the world\u2019s largest emitter of greenhouse gases? Explosive economic growth. But other things don\u2019t have to be equal. There\u2019s no necessary one-to-one relationship between growth and pollution. People on both the left and the right often fail to understand this point. (I hate it when pundits try to make every issue into a case of \u201cboth sides are wrong,\u201d but, in this case, it happens to be true.) On the left, you sometimes find environmentalists asserting that to save the planet we must give up on the idea of an ever-growing economy; on the right, you often find assertions that any attempt to limit pollution will have devastating impacts on growth. But there\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t become richer while reducing our impact on the environment.Let me add that free-market advocates seem to experience a peculiar loss of faith whenever the subject of the environment comes up. They normally trumpet their belief that the magic of the market can surmount all obstacles \u2014 that the private sector\u2019s flexibility and talent for innovation can easily cope with limiting factors like scarcity of land or minerals. But suggest the possibility of market-friendly environmental measures, like a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions, and they suddenly assert that the private sector would be unable to cope, that the costs would be immense. Funny how that works.The sensible position on the economics of climate change has always been that it\u2019s like the economics of everything else \u2014 that if we give corporations and individuals an incentive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, they will respond. What form would that response take? Until a few years ago, the best guess was that it would proceed on many fronts, involving everything from better insulation and more fuel-efficient cars to increased use of nuclear power.One front many people didn\u2019t take too seriously, however, was renewable energy. Sure, cap-and-trade might make more room for wind and the sun, but how important could such sources really end up being? And I have to admit that I shared that skepticism. If truth be told, I thought of the idea that wind and sun could be major players as hippie-dippy wishful thinking.But I was wrong.Thanks to this technological leap forward, the climate panel can talk about \u201cdecarbonizing\u201d electricity generation as a realistic goal \u2014 and since coal-fired power plants are a very large part of the climate problem, that\u2019s a big part of the solution right there.It\u2019s even possible that decarbonizing will take place without special encouragement, but we can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t count on that. The point, instead, is that drastic cuts in greenhouse gas emissions are now within fairly easy reach.So is the climate threat solved? Well, it should be. The science is solid; the technology is there; the economics look far more favorable than anyone expected. All that stands in the way of saving the planet is a combination of ignorance, prejudice and vested interests. What could go wrong? Oh, wait. Advertisement"}

Quite simply, a majority of Ukrainians got mad as hell at the game imposed on them \u2014 serving as bit players in Putin\u2019s sphere of influence, so Russia could continue to feel like a great power, and also being forced to tolerate a breathtakingly corrupt pro-Russian regime in Kiev. After a bottom-up revolution in the Maidan, Kiev\u2019s central square, which cost 100-plus lives \u2014 \u201cthe Heavenly Hundred\u201d as they are referred to here \u2014 Ukrainians are asserting their own sphere of influence, a desire to be part of the E.U. But, in doing so, they\u2019re posing a deep philosophical and political challenge to Putin\u2019s Russia \u2014 as well as to the E.U. and America. How so?If Putin loses, and Ukraine breaks free and joins the E.U., it would threaten the very core identity of the Russia that Putin has built and wants to expand \u2014 a traditional Russia, where the state dominates the individual and where the glory of Mother Russia comes from the territory it holds, the oil and gas it extracts, the neighbors it dominates, the number of missiles it owns and the geopolitical role it plays in the world \u2014 not from empowering its people and nourishing their talents. If Putin wins and prevents Ukraine from holding a free and fair election on May 25, his malign influence over his neighbors would only grow. And you would see more of what you saw last week when Joe Kaeser, the chief executive of Siemens, the German engineering giant, went to Moscow to slobber over Putin and reassure him that all their deals would proceed \u2014 despite what Kaeser called \u201cpolitically difficult times.\u201d (That\u2019s German for Putin\u2019s blocking Ukrainians from E.U. membership that Germans already enjoy.) You can\u2019t walk the cobblestone streets of the St. Sophia Square in Kiev, or tour the magnificent 11th-century onion-domed church of the same name, without learning just how much Russia and Ukraine have influenced one another over the centuries \u2014 and today will be no different. The first unified \u201cRus\u201d state was born in Kiev, when \u201cSt. Vladimir the Great, the Grand Prince of Kiev,\u201d unified all the tribes and territories in the region into an entity called by historians \u201cKievan Rus.\u201d St. Vladimir also made Orthodox Christianity the official religion.Now fast-forward 1,000-plus years, and you have another \u201cVladimir the Great\u201d \u2014 Mr. Putin \u2014 massing troops on Ukraine\u2019s border to re-establish Russia\u2019s influence here. Putin recently hinted that it might be time for him to reclaim \u201cNovorossiya\u201d or New Russia, which is how a region of southeastern Ukraine was referred to by the czars in the 19th century, when it was part of Russia.So when Putin says New Russia, he really means Old Russia \u2014 a Russia that used to dominate Ukraine. And he wants to prevent a New Ukraine from arising that again influences today\u2019s Russia with new ideas, only this time liberal ones. \u201cThis has become an existential fight for everybody,\u201d explained Pavlo Sheremeta, Ukraine\u2019s new economy minister, who added that his liberal Russian friends are calling him, saying: \u201cPlease hang on. Don\u2019t betray us.\u201d Don\u2019t let Putin crush the model that Ukraine is trying to build, otherwise Russia will never change.\u201cLong term, Russia\u2019s success depends on how it competes in the 21st century, and you don\u2019t just compete with oil and tanks and by bullying someone else,\u201d added Sheremeta. That may make you feel strong \u201cat the moment, but it is just a drug. Ukraine\u2019s eventual success can be another proof that democracy, rule of law and human rights are the best recipe for sustainable development \u2014 and not the drug [Putin] is giving to his people.\u201dNataliya Popovych, a businesswoman and civil society activist here, said Ukrainians have learned from their Orange Revolution in 2004, when they got rid of an old order but just turned everything over to a new group of corrupt politicians. This time the Maidan revolution has spawned a web of civil society groups that are acting as watchdogs on every minister and working to guarantee fair presidential elections.\u201cThe Heavenly Hundred died here for human rights and European values,\u201d Popovych told me. But for these to get consolidated into a new politics in Ukraine, the fledgling new state \u201chas to survive\u201d and that will require the E.U. and America to help protect it. \u201cWe would love this to be all about us,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it is a civilizational battle going on.

{"Headline": "Taking a Risk, Investors Snap Up Once-Shunned Greek Debt", "Date": "2014-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 Investors shunned Greek bonds at the height of the European economic crisis, fearful that the region\u2019s sickest nation would collapse from its financial woes.But on Thursday, pension funds, banks and other big money managers were snapping up billions of dollars of new Greek debt and trying to get their hands on even more. Greece\u2019s return to the bond market after four long years adds to the growing optimism that the most troubled nations in the euro zone are finally recovering from a wrenching downturn. But in their rush to profit, investors are putting aside the still fragile economic situation and rampant joblessness that continue to plague Greece and others.The disconnect reflects the near-insatiable appetite for higher-paying investments around the globe. With interest rates at record lows, investors are aggressively hunting for returns wherever they can find them, even if risks abound. While Greece sold $4.2 billion of bonds on Thursday, demand for the debt was five times that amount. \u201cInvestors don\u2019t look to the long-term health of economies,\u201d said Simon Tilford, the deputy director of the Center for European Reform in London. They are looking at whether they can extract gains \u201cwithout losing their shirts. At the moment, they figure they can, but that doesn\u2019t tell us much about the sustainability of the euro zone or whether governments have taken it on a path to sounder footing.\u201dInvestors may be playing a dicey game, but in the case of Greece and other shaky euro zone countries, they have been assuaged by the belief that the European financial machine will kick into gear should anything go wrong. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi has pledged to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to keep the crisis from reigniting. Such assurances have been reflected in the lower and lower yields that investors have been willing to accept, even for less-than-stellar economies or companies. At the height of the crisis, the rate on 10-year Greek bonds exceeded 30 percent; now, it is less than 6 percent. The rate on the new five-year bonds in Greece was 4.75 percent. Last week, Spain\u2019s five-year borrowing costs briefly dipped below comparable United States Treasuries.\u201cPeople must be really desperate for yield, which is what this is all about,\u201d said Carl Weinberg, chief economist of High Frequency Economics.Investors, though, seem to have forgotten that private bondholders absorbed huge losses from Greece\u2019s partial default in 2012 \u2014 losses that the E.C.B. refused to share. \u201cPeople might suspect there is an implicit or even an explicit guarantee behind these bonds,\u201d Mr. Weinberg said. While European leaders have shown they are unwilling to let Greece fail, they have also demonstrated that \u201cthey are willing to skin the private investors to keep Greece from failing,\u201d he said.The Greek economic situation also remains weak. Unemployment is a staggering 27 percent, and growth is essentially stagnant. As if to underscore the fragile situation, a car bomb exploded outside the country\u2019s central bank here on Thursday, in yet another expression of the populist anger that has punctuated the country\u2019s economic woes.Fadi Zaher, the head of bonds and currencies at the investment house Kleinwort Benson in London, said his group had stayed on the sidelines of the Greek bond frenzy over lingering concerns about the country\u2019s poor economic health and its mountain of debt that has risen to more than 170 percent of gross domestic product.\u201cThere is a euphoria right now over the euro area, and that euphoria is creating confidence around Greece,\u201d Mr. Zaher said. \u201cWe are cautiously optimistic about the story, but looking over the longer term we are very, very cautious about it.\u201dSuch concerns are broadly echoed by global regulators, policy makers and economists who are increasingly concerned about investors\u2019 willingness to buy risky bonds around the world. The International Monetary Fund and the Institute of International Finance, which closely track global investment flows, both warned separately this week that the bond-buying binge could come to a dangerous end, as the United States Federal Reserve pulls back on its stimulus efforts and starts to raise interest rates. Those on the front lines, the central bank governors in emerging markets, have been among the most vocal about their concerns. When the United States starts to raise rates, the fear is that much of the money that has been chasing higher returns in countries from Greece to Brazil will make its retreat.\u201cThere are vulnerabilities in emerging markets, but there is also a lot of risk taking in developed markets,\u201d Agustin Carstens, the head of Mexico\u2019s central bank, said at a conference on Thursday at the IMF meetings in Washington. \u201cThat can hurt us later on.\u201d Because global investors tend to move in unison, said Raghuram Rajan, the governor of India\u2019s central bank, the consequences can be dire when they abandon a particular market \u2014 even for developing economies that are in relatively decent shape like Mexico and India.\u201cThe Fed needs to be more sensitive to the conditions in emerging markets,\u201d said Mr. Rajan, a prominent international economist who has just taken on his new role. \u201cWhat if there are $200 billion in outflows in a month,\u201d he asked. \u201cWill the Fed be sensitive to this?\u201dTo date, there has been no wholesale investment exodus, despite turmoil in emerging markets in January. In recent weeks, global investors have continued to snap up high-yielding bonds from riskier nations in the euro zone and emerging markets, figuring the Federal Reserve won\u2019t raise rates until mid-2015. Just this week, the state-run Oil India tapped the bond markets for the first time, selling $1 billion of debt. Among the most successful recent deals was one from Pakistan, which sold a higher-than-expected $2 billion worth of bonds to a slate of blue-chip mutual funds. After seven years in bond market exile, the deal was a triumph. \u201cI wanted to put Pakistan back on the bond market map,\u201d said the country\u2019s finance minister, Mohammad Ishaq Dar. \u201cThis deal shows that we are committed to economic reform.\u201dThat hedge and mutual funds should be scrambling to buy such bonds in many ways exemplifies the new reality investors see. And these bets may prove smart, as long as the money continues to pour into these markets. In Greece, officials declared victory. Yannis Stournaras, the finance minister, said the nation had made \u201cthe biggest fiscal adjustment ever recorded since World War II\u201d in a bid to mend its finances. The prime minister, Antonis Samaras, said in a televised statement that the strong demand for the bonds was \u201ca sign of trust in the Greek economy and its ability to overcome the crisis.\u201dLiz Alderman reported from Athens and Landon Thomas Jr. from Washington.

{"Headline": "Obama Arrives in Asia as Disasters Complicate Mission", "Date": "2014-04-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhite House officials, who have come with a busy agenda of economic and security issues, worry that the leaders \u2014 particularly President Park Geun-hye of South Korea, for whom the ferry tragedy is still unfolding \u2014 will be preoccupied when they meet with Mr. Obama.\u201cThe South Korea visit could really be overshadowed by the ferry,\u201d said a senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.That would be a missed opportunity for the South Koreans, who appealed to the White House last fall to add a stop in Seoul when news surfaced that Mr. Obama was planning to visit Tokyo. It will be the president\u2019s fourth trip to South Korea, the most he has made in office to any Asian country.South Korean diplomats are characterizing it as a visit by an old friend \u2014 a pointed contrast to Mr. Obama\u2019s more formal two-day stop in Japan, which includes an elaborate welcoming ceremony at the Imperial Palace, an audience with Emperor Akihito and a state dinner.Relations between South Korea and Japan have been deeply strained since Ms. Park and Mr. Abe came into office, with the two countries replaying World War II-era grievances. This month, Mr. Obama brokered a carefully orchestrated meeting of the leaders in The Hague that was meant to clear the air.On Wednesday night, Mr. Abe took Mr. Obama to dinner at Sukiyabashi Jiro, a rarefied sushi bar in downtown Tokyo with a celebrity chef. The restaurant seats 10 customers and is booked out months in advance.The prime minister has raised hopes in Washington because of his commitment to overhauling the Japanese economy. The United States would like to announce progress, if not a signed deal, in trade negotiations with Japan during the visit, to help bolster an American-led regional trade pact known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership.While Mr. Abe is perhaps the least distracted of the leaders Mr. Obama will meet \u2014 if only because the Fukushima disaster is further in the past \u2014 he faces a political fight in persuading Japan\u2019s powerful farmers to open markets in beef and pork, which is critical to reaching a deal.On Thursday, in a news conference with Mr. Obama, Mr. Abe indicated that the United States and Japan had not closed necessary gaps on a deal, falling short of a major goal for the president\u2019s visit.Japan received a symbolic gesture from Mr. Obama when he reaffirmed that disputed Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea that are at the center of a tense standoff between Japan and China are covered under the mutual defense treaty between the United States and Japan.\u201cWe don\u2019t take a position on final sovereignty\u201d over the islands, Mr. Obama said in the news conference. \u201cBut historically, they have been administered by Japan, and we do not believe they should be subject to change unilaterally.\u201dIn Seoul, administration officials said, Mr. Obama hopes to increase pressure on North Korea, which has reverted to a pattern of missile tests and other provocative actions. Yet Ms. Park\u2019s attention is likely to be consumed by the ferry accident.On Monday, Chosun Ilbo, the largest South Korean newspaper, said in an editorial, \u201cPeople are descending into a collective sense of powerlessness, unable to trust the government with protecting them in emergency situations.\u201d Ms. Park has characterized the ferry captain\u2019s decision to abandon ship with passengers still trapped below decks as akin to murder.Mr. Obama faces an even more delicate situation in Malaysia, which his advisers had hoped to celebrate as a reliable partner in counterterrorism operations and a model of a majority-Muslim democracy in Asia. Instead, it has become a byword for confusion and opacity in the wake of the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.Malaysia\u2019s response, some critics say, reveals deeper problems with its government, which has long been under one-party rule, dominated by a Malay elite, and has compiled a record of human rights abuses that belies the White House\u2019s upbeat narrative.With the United States already taking part in the painstaking search for the plane in the southern Indian Ocean, there is little more that Mr. Obama can do, except offer solace. He will also try to focus on other issues in what will be the first visit to Malaysia by an American president since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1966.In the Philippines, at least, Mr. Obama will be able to speak openly about the typhoon and offer help for the future. He and President Benigno S. Aquino III are expected to sign a deal to expand access to bases for American warships and planes rotating through the archipelago.An earlier version of this article misstated part of the name of an American-led regional trade pact. It is the Trans-Pacific Partnership, not the Trade Pacific Partnership.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Has Fiction Handled the Theme of Money?", "Date": "2014-04-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBookendsEach week in Bookends, two writers take on questions about the world of books. This week, Pankaj Mishra and Rivka Galchen discuss how fiction writers have approached the subject of money.By Pankaj MishraFew contemporary fictions have exposed the writer\u2019s own furtive participation in the vulgar pursuits of wealth and fame.\u201cBusiness is the only human solidarity,\u201d the American novelist William Dean Howells confessed in his essay \u201cThe Man of Letters as a Man of Business.\u201d \u201cWe are all bound together with that chain, whatever interests and tastes and principles separate us.\u201d Howells acknowledged what by the Gilded Age had become an unavoidable reality. Catering to a rising bourgeois class, imaginative writers had been forced to recognize money as both the root of many evils and also, in Marx\u2019s words, \u201cthe truly creative power.\u201dBut the rebellious and anarchic energies generated by the 19th-century clash of romantic and materialist worldviews have been largely defused by the cultural patronage of rich societies \u2014 generous advances, fellowships and academic sinecures. Sheer pleasure in unacknowledged membership of the bourgeoisie \u2014 what Roland Barthes defined as \u201cthe social class that does not want to be named\u201d \u2014 seems to have replaced the onerous duties of unacknowledged legislation.One result of the steady professionalization of the imaginative life is that the working classes, let alone the poor and the destitute, have largely disappeared from contemporary fiction. The dominant tone of irony, part of a characteristically bourgeois project of self-concealment and euphemism, has merely enhanced money\u2019s amazing ability, in Saul Bellow\u2019s words, \u201cto survive identification\u201d as a great evil and \u201cgo on forever.\u201dThis is not to say that many works \u2014 from John Updike\u2019s Rabbit quartet to Dave Eggers\u2019s \u201cA Hologram for the King\u201d \u2014 haven\u2019t registered the main events in the recent history of money: oil shocks, the proliferation of technologies, the migration of low-wage jobs to the newly industrializing countries, shifts in consumer habits, hubristic technicism and reckless financialization. \u201cWithout money he was hardly a man,\u201d Jonathan Franzen writes in \u201cThe Corrections,\u201d which dramatizes the fantasies of neoliberalism (\u201cThe more patently satirical the promises, the lustier the influx of American capital\u201d). More recently, writers from Asia and Latin America such as Yu Hua, Aravind Adiga, Juan Villoro and Juan Gabriel V\u00e1squez have attested to the catastrophic effects of primitive accumulation in impoverished societies \u2014 gigantic inequalities that lead to murderous resentments and nihilistic politics. But only a few contemporary fictions have bracingly exposed the writer\u2019s own furtive participation in the vulgar pursuits of wealth and fame.In Martin Amis\u2019s \u201cMoney,\u201d the postwar ideology of global capitalism \u2014 maximization of individual choice through personal consumption \u2014 achieves a monstrous apotheosis in the figure of John Self, \u201c200 pounds of yob genes, booze, snout and fast food.\u201d Self, the gratefully Americanized refugee from post-imperial Britain, prefigured the transnational nouveaux riches on the run from their ungovernable societies. Plutocrats from China, India and Russia seem to be karaoke-ing Self\u2019s hosannas to money \u2014 \u201cYou\u2019re so democratic: You\u2019ve got no favorites. You even things out for me and my kind\u201d \u2014 as they snap up bits of London, New York and Singapore today. But Amis\u2019s shrewdest move was to turn an authorial stand-in named \u201cMartin Amis\u201d into Self\u2019s high-minded (and ineffectual) foil. \u201cI really don\u2019t want to join it, the whole money conspiracy,\u201d he equivocates before accepting a check with \u201ctumbling zeros\u201d to rewrite a trashy screenplay. Contemporary fiction, even at its most self-conscious, doesn\u2019t tell us much about this hypocrite auteur \u2014 the distinguished man of letters who is now, much less resentfully, even avidly, a man of business.\u25c6 \u25c6 \u25c6By Rivka GalchenPart of what makes some fictions literature is that they do not participate in the fiction that money can be blithely ignored.A certain well-read Spanish gentleman sets out as a knight errant and is surprised when an innkeeper asks him for money, and is later surprised again when his peasant-turned-squire presses for a salary. \u201cI certainly should have specified a salary for you,\u201d the well-read knight errant explains, \u201cif I had found in any of the histories of the knights errant an example that would have revealed to me and shown me, by means of the smallest sign, what wages were for a month, or a year, but I have read all or most of their histories, and I do not recall reading that any knight errant ever specified a fixed salary for his squire.\u201d And yet by the end of his perfectly quixotic life, on his deathbed, the gentleman repents his adventures and returns to being simply the man of some means that he formerly was, Alonso Quixano. He writes out his pragmatic will: cash to Sancho Panza, possessions to his long-suffering niece, and additional wages for his maid beyond what he owes her, so that she can buy herself a dress.Whereas Quixote was gallant, violent, delusional, charismatic and known for never paying his bills, Quixano is effectively kind; we might summarize \u201cDon Quixote\u201d as a new Damascene story of a man who, long blind to the reality of money, finally learns to see what Shakespeare termed, in one of his plays, the \u201cvisible god.\u201dIt\u2019s not a loving god, of course, only a mighty one, which may be why no enchanted reader can quite manage to celebrate Quixote\u2019s return to reality. And though we could summarize the book as we have here, we know also that the summary feels somehow off, as if we might next hear ourselves referring to \u201cMoby-Dick\u201d as the one about the guy with little or no money in his purse who takes an exciting job in one of the most economically productive sectors of the 19th-century American economy. And then there\u2019s also that one about the housewife who spends more money than she has on her lovers, and who \u2014 on the day that her house is being repossessed and the tax collector declines her offer of sexual favors for a delay in the tax bill and her former lover says he doesn\u2019t have the money to lend her 3,000 francs, even though he has a clock with tortoiseshell inlays and gold cuff links and much, much else \u2014 goes to the pharmacist and doesn\u2019t pay for the arsenic she eats straight from the jar. And then that sad one about the traveling salesman who has been working for years to pay off his father\u2019s debt, but who unfortunately awakes one morning to discover himself transformed into something incapable of holding a job.Yes, these summaries are off, but are they really so off? Part of what makes those fictions literature, instead of just varieties of chivalric fantasies, is that they do not participate in the appealing fiction that money is inconsequential and can be blithely ignored \u2014 an exceptionally popular fiction in real life, especially among the more moneyed, the original and abiding reading population.It is with this exceptionally popular fiction that Edith Wharton concerns herself in one of her finest stories, a ghost story. In Wharton\u2019s \u201cAfterward,\u201d a newly wealthy American couple move into an old English country house that is said to have a ghost, albeit a ghost that one does not realize one has encountered until \u201clong, long afterward.\u201d The couple\u2019s fortune comes from . . . well, the wife doesn\u2019t really know. She chooses to continue not to know. There\u2019s a clipping from a newspaper, rumors of an accident in a mine, a mysteriously dropped lawsuit and a strange visitor to the house with whom, one day, the husband disappears.The wife, still living in the newly purchased old house, is terrified. For a while. But eventually she becomes \u201cdomesticated with the Horror, accepting its perpetual presence as one of the fixed conditions of life.\u201d For the American wife, the once visible god has become an invisible ghost, though its power persists.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In an Uneven Economy, an Opening in the Service Sector Beckons", "Date": "2014-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMovie ReviewThe title character in \u201cFading Gigolo,\u201d a low-key, low-energy comedy about New York haves and have-nots, is Fioravante, a melancholic bookstore employee played by the film\u2019s director, John Turturro. When you first meet Fioravante, he\u2019s packing up boxes, on the verge of becoming an ex-bookstore employee. His boss, Murray (Woody Allen), has been forced to shutter his charming shop, a painful and all-too-frequent occurrence in the real New York. In a moment of inspiration, or really creative contrivance, Murray suggests \u2014 ta-da \u2014 that Fioravante take up hooking.Murray doesn\u2019t actually say those words, or not that I remember, and neither does anyone throw around any of the other, cruder descriptors that often come into play when someone has sex for money. Murray lands on this idea after learning from his dermatologist, Dr. Parker (Sharon Stone), that she and a friend, Selima (Sofia Vergara), want to have a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois (not with Murray).Sizing up Fioravante like a prime cut, Murray decides that his friend is the prostitute for the job. Fioravante shrugs off the idea, only to succumb, because, well, that is how he\u2019s written. At this point, you may already be exhausted by Mr. Turturro\u2019s frontloading this small vessel with so much leaden whimsy.It gets better gradually, largely because of the appealing performers, including the amusingly frenetic Mr. Allen, who enlivens his every scene, and Liev Schreiber, who plays a hunky Hasidic neighborhood cop, Dovi, who has his eye on a rabbi\u2019s fetching widow, Avigal (Vanessa Paradis). Avigal comes into the picture, and soon into Fioravante\u2019s life, with the strained romanticism that defines Mr. Turturro\u2019s approach: Murray meets Avigal when he takes his live-in black partner\u2019s children to her to be deloused. Before you know it, all the children \u2014 African-American and Hasidic \u2014 are playing ball with Murray, and Fioravante is meeting the nominally repressed, hot Yiddishe momme. It\u2019s a small, idealistic world, after all, heartfelt and unpersuasive. The influence of Spike Lee, with whom Mr. Turturro has worked repeatedly, shows up early in \u201cFading Gigolo,\u201d notably in the way streets transform into stages on which the diverse characters act out their comedies and dramas. This idea works better in the more intimate scenes, say, of just two people walking and talking, rather than in the busier, more populated scenes that reach for the panoramic.Mr. Turturro\u2019s penchant for layering his scenes in music also suggests Mr. Lee\u2019s influence. Yet while Mr. Lee uses music for heightened emotion, ironic counterpoint and political commentary, Mr. Turturro\u2019s musical choices in \u201cFading Gigolo\u201d tend to feel, like so much here, generically applied instead of meaningfully coaxed from some essential, lived-in truth.\u201cFading Gigolo\u201d is rated R.

The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity rose to 53.7 in March, its second consecutive monthly increase. Readings above 50 indicate expansion in the sector, which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy.Factory activity was buoyed by a 7.7 percentage point rebound in the I.S.M. production index after it contracted in February. The increase was the largest since June 2009, as the recession ended.The I.S.M. report was the latest to point to improving economic conditions, giving credence to the theory that signs of sluggishness early this year were a result of bad weather, not weakening fundamentals.\u201cThere\u2019s a whiff of spring in the economic data, which means we\u2019re starting the second quarter with signs that the economy is maintaining the kind of reasonable growth that will continue to support the market,\u201d said Jim McDonald, chief investment strategist at Northern Trust. \u201cI\u2019m comforted by the rise in discretionary and home-building stocks, since those are the ones that really show economic strength.

{"Headline": "South Korea Tests Missile Able to Strike Most of North", "Date": "2014-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Amid rising military threats from North Korea, South Korea conducted its own recent missile test, successfully launching a newly developed ballistic missile capable of striking most of North Korea, the South Korean Ministry of National Defense announced on Friday.The new missile, with a range of 310 miles and able to carry a warhead of up to 2,200 pounds, was launched on March 23 from a test site in Taean, a coastal town southwest of Seoul.The test came a day after North Korea raised tensions by test-firing 30 short-range rockets off its east coast on March 22. Kim Min-seok, a spokesman for the South Korean Defense Ministry, declined to say when South Korea planned to deploy the new missile.South Korea has been developing new missiles since Washington and Seoul revised their defense treaty in 2012 to allow it to extend the range of its ballistic missiles from 186 to nearly 500 miles to cope better with North Korea\u2019s increasingly sophisticated missile and nuclear programs.Despite its decrepit economy and chronic food shortages, North Korea has deployed short- and medium-range missiles, and is developing an intercontinental ballistic missile.Pyongyang has rekindled regional tensions in recent weeks by launching a series of short- and medium-range rockets and missiles and threatening to conduct a new nuclear test. On Monday, the two Koreas exchanged artillery shells across a disputed western sea border.On Friday, Mr. Kim said that South Korea had reached a tentative conclusion that two drones recently discovered in South Korea were flown from North Korea. A small surveillance drone crash-landed in Paju, a town north of Seoul, on March 24, and another was discovered on Monday on a South Korean island near the western waters where the two militaries exchanged artillery fire.From the memory chip of a digital camera mounted on the first drone, South Korean officials retrieved 193 aerial photos, some showing the presidential Blue House in Seoul. But the quality of the pictures was poorer than aerial photos available on Google Earth, and the drone lacked equipment to transmit them wirelessly, officials here said.Mr. Kim said that the two drones, though primitive, showed that North Korea was developing smaller drones in addition to a \u201cfairly large\u201d fleet of bigger unmanned aerial craft. In Parliament on Friday, South Korea\u2019s defense minister, Kim Kwan-jin, said that North Korea might try to develop the surveillance drones into small and hard-to-detect \u201csuicide bombers.\u201d The fact that one of the surveillance drones flew over Seoul undiscovered until it crash-landed raised concern in South Korea. Seoul said it planned to deploy a new radar system that could detect small low-flying drones.videoAdvertisement"}

He stared into her eyes, knowing that the whole proposal was riding on this moment.But it wasn\u2019t his girlfriend\u2019s answer he was waiting for. It was her grandmother\u2019s. He was asking for her diamond ring.Mr. Ross had not planned on proposing to Maddy Wendell with a secondhand diamond last May. But working as a freelance emergency medical technician, he had barely made a dent in his $25,000 student loans, and buying a new ring would have meant raiding his savings. Instead, the couple, both 24 and living in Chicago, saved thousands by using \u201cGrammy\u2019s\u201d 0.77-carat old-European-cut diamond ring.Mr. Ross is among many young people who have turned to heirlooms or other vintage rings for more affordable, often more meaningful, alternatives to new diamonds and wedding bands. Family members often pass down these rings freely or after some hand-wringing.\u201cThe De Beers campaign and the increased wealth in the economy meant that people were buying many more diamond engagement rings than they had previously,\u201d said Tim Jackson, the chief executive of the Jewelry Industry Research Institute, a consulting practice. \u201cWith the passing of those that married in the postwar years, their precious jewelry has been handed down to a younger generation.\u201d\u201cThis generation, more than any in the past, knows what De Beers is all about, so to have them tell you that you need to spend two months\u2019 salary to buy one is crazy,\u201d he said.Mr. Weissman, a former diamond salesman, answers thousands of reader emails and has seen a 50 percent increase in questions related to hand-me-down gems.That forces would-be grooms like Mr. Ross to choose between diamonds and debt. \u201cI was nervous about using an heirloom,\u201d he said. \u201cIt certainly felt weird, because it seemed not how you were supposed to go about it,\u201d he added, explaining, \u201cI felt a pressure as a man of, \u2018I should go out and buy a ring.\u2019\u00a0\u201dStephen Lussier, the executive vice president for marketing at the De Beers Group, said that the two-months\u2019 salary benchmark originated from consumer research and that it might not apply to every situation. Still, he advised grooms of all income levels to view the purchase as a long-term investment.\u201cIf you buy a car, you\u2019d probably finance it over a few years, and at the end, it\u2019s a goner,\u201d he said. \u201cWith a diamond, you\u2019re going to have it forever, so taking advantage of financing plans in jewelry is probably a helpful thing, because it means you\u2019re going to be able to buy the diamond you\u2019re going to be happy with for your whole life.\u201dBut for some couples who share an apartment \u2014 and the bills \u2014 before marriage, the idea of a groom\u2019s being required to spend an arbitrary amount on a ring is viewed as antiquated, if not outright anti-feminist.Not only was Ms. Wendell opposed to Mr. Ross\u2019s paying too much, but she also offered to split whatever the cost turned out to be. \u201cI felt like it was just crazy that he should have to pay for the whole thing, for something that I was going to wear my entire life,\u201d said Ms. Wendell, a graduate student at the University of Chicago.Those without access to Grandma\u2019s ring can explore the booming antique-jewelry market, which offers unique designs in addition to cheaper prices. \u201cTypically, other jewelers will buy old-cut stones for less, and, therefore, they have room to sell them for less,\u201d said Ilya Kunin, a jeweler and distributor of certified old-cut diamonds in Chicago. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty much a buyer\u2019s market, because it\u2019s a niche product.\u201dMr. Kunin started designing his own vintage-style line in 2007 in response to demand. \u201cThe young hipster movement has definitely opened up the vintage-jewelry market,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like those boring halo rings that you can find in your everyday mom-and-pop jewelry store. It\u2019s something that\u2019s rare and one of a kind.\u201dWhen Michael Mallick, 39, dropped to one knee last August, his girlfriend, Katie Wagner, 31, couldn\u2019t have hoped for a more perfect ring than her grandmother\u2019s 0.67-carat diamond. Its Art Deco style suited Ms. Wagner\u2019s vintage taste \u2014 her clothes hail from Goodwill and her furniture from flea markets. But more important was the ring\u2019s link to her past. Both of her paternal grandparents died when she was 6, and the ring is her only remaining connection to them. \u201cThey spoiled me because I was the first grandchild,\u201d said Ms. Wagner, the founder of Remark Media Relations in San Francisco. \u201cI just remember being the center of their world.\u201dNot everyone wants an engagement ring to be their \u201csomething old,\u201d however. \u201cWe particularly see that a lot for the bridal market, where people refer to them sometimes as \u2018virgin diamonds,\u2019 ones without any history,\u201d said Mr. Lussier, of De Beers. \u201cThey want to make their own history.\u201dLast May, when Matt Fellows asked Brittney McDermott (now Fellows), both 26, to marry him, he bought a new ring instead of using her grandmother\u2019s 1950s diamond. \u201cI wanted to get something special that just my wife, and only my wife, would ever wear as her ring,\u201d said Mr. Fellows, an accountant in Salt Lake City. \u201cThere was a degree of wanting to show that this is my commitment and this is my investment into us.\u201dBuying a store-bought ring, though, has some couples worried about supporting \u201cblood diamonds\u201d \u2014 illegally mined stones used to finance armed rebels in conflict areas of Africa.In October, Andrew Martin, 28, proposed to Mallory Pickard onstage at a concert in Raleigh, N.C., presenting her with a conflict-free 1.96-carat engagement ring that originally belonged to Ms. Pickard\u2019s great-great-grandmother.\u201cI would not be wearing a giant diamond that was new from a store had this ring not come into play,\u201d said Ms. Pickard, 27, a community coordinator, who will also use her great-great-grandmother\u2019s wedding band this weekend when the couple marry. \u201cI would have been looking at vintage rings on Etsy or getting a ring that was eco-friendly, and I knew the source of the metals or the stones.\u201dBut major retailers like Tiffany\u2019s say that they also take special efforts to ensure that their jewels have been mined and processed in an ethical manner.\u201cLate in the war, the Germans, knowing they were going to lose, took a lot of small, valuable items like diamonds into neutral countries like Sweden or Switzerland,\u201d said Greg Bradsher, a senior archivist at the National Archives. \u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible to ascertain if a particular diamond came from a victim.\u201dEthical concerns aside, sometimes the preference for vintage diamonds just comes down to sheer romance.For Stephanie Musso, 30, slipping on the ring of the great-grandmother of her fianc\u00e9, Cody Goodwin, 28, in January 2013 became her own Cinderella moment. \u201cIt felt like the universe aligned with us falling in love and deciding to get married, and then he gave me this ring, and it fit perfectly,\u201d said Ms. Musso, a public relations account executive in San Luis Obispo, Calif. \u201cIt felt like destiny.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Munster Takes Its Road Warrior Act to France", "Date": "2014-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRugbyLONDON \u2014 Munster alone stands in the way of a clean sweep for rugby union\u2019s new wave of wealthy clubs, as the Heineken Cup reaches its semifinal stage this weekend.The other three contenders \u2014 the French clubs Clermont Auvergne and Toulon, aiming for a repeat of last year\u2019s final, and Saracens of London \u2014 have six previous final-four appearances between them, none earlier than 2008. The Irish province has, by contrast, been a regular in the later stages since 2000 and will be making its 11th appearance in the semifinal on Sunday when it plays Toulon, the reigning champion, at the formidably atmospheric Stade V\u00e9lodrome in Marseilles. Saracens plays Clermont at Twickenham Stadium in London on Saturday.\u201cWe\u2019re against the champions at a great, intimidatingly atmospheric ground just a few miles from their own town, so we\u2019ll start as second favorites,\u201d said Munster\u2019s forwards coach, Anthony Foley.It is, though, a role to which Munster is well accustomed. Munster is the great road warrior in the competition that is rugby\u2019s answer to soccer\u2019s Champions League, with eight away victories in playoff matches. Nobody else has more than three.Some of the most memorable of those wins have come in France. \u201cDealing with those games is something that we got into the psyche of our players and coaches fairly early,\u201d Foley said.And if anyone should grasp the Munster psyche, it is Foley. He followed his father, Brendan, onto the team, scored a record 23 tries for it in Heineken matches, led it to its second Heineken title in 2006, and, after serving as an assistant coach, takes over as head coach next season.His challenge will be to maintain that remarkable, logic-defying record in European competition. Drawing on Ireland\u2019s southwestern quadrant, Munster rugby faces fierce competition from within in the shape of popular Gaelic sports \u2014 football and hurling \u2014 and from without from wealthy French and English clubs.Its demise is regularly forecast as leading players retire. The veteran lock forward Paul O\u2019Connell, who led Ireland to the Six Nations championship last month, was the only survivor of Foley\u2019s Heineken-winning team of 2006 to start in the quarterfinal victory over Toulouse.Such resilience is rooted in part in Munster\u2019s distinctive identity. \u201cThis is not a bunch of individuals, but a team which represents a community,\u201d said Garrett Fitzgerald, the chief executive of Munster Rugby. \u201cThe players play for the people who live next door to them.\u201dA team of veteran warhorses has been renewed by players like wing Simon Zebo, scrum-half Conor Murray and back rower Peter O\u2019Mahony \u2014 all Irish internationals, with only Murray, whose birthday was last Sunday, having reached the age of 25. \u201cYoungsters grow up wanting to play for Munster, and our academy ensures we get a flow of good young players,\u201d Foley said. \u201cAnd at the same time we\u2019ve been very lucky with players we\u2019ve brought in from abroad. It\u2019s a good place to work and to play and many of them end up staying for years.\u201dThat can have its drawbacks.\u201cNobody wants to leave, so sometimes some fairly tough decisions have to be made,\u201d said Foley, whose status as a local legend did not save him from being dropped from Heineken matches in his final season. \u201cNobody is indispensable.\u201dO\u2019Connell, though, remains less dispensable than most. \u201cHe\u2019s incredibly important to us, a talismanic presence that our next generation looks to for guidance as to what the game is about,\u201d said Foley, who believes that the 34-year-old lock forward could play another three of four years. Munster has also managed so far to ride the downturn in the Irish economy \u2014 rugby may be the last sector in which the old \u201cCeltic Tiger\u201d label still holds \u2014 and hold off the enticements held out by wealthy French clubs to top-class players.\u201cClubs like Toulon and Clermont have been able to put together squads which national teams would envy, Fitzgerald said. \u201cAnd their purchasing power will increase again with their new television deal.\u201d Munster\u2019s financing model remains rather different. \u201cAround 60 percent of our income is from gate money,\u201d Fitzgerald said. So its 26,000-capacity Thomond Park \u2014 the largest regular home venue in European rugby \u2014 is a huge plus. When Fitzgerald talks of crowds of 13,000 to 14,000 for even the least attractive fixtures in the PRO12 domestic competition, he is citing numbers beyond many clubs for their most popular games.Commercial efforts are spearheaded by a specialist board led by Niall Fitzgerald, the former chief executive of Unilever (who is not related to Garrett Fitzgerald.) Munster also employs the former player Doug Howlett, the all-time record try-scorer for the New Zealand All Blacks, as an ambassador to potential sponsors.Underpinning it all remains a remarkable supporter base. \u201cGiven the economic situation and the difficulty and cost of getting to Marseilles, it will be an exceptional effort for anyone to follow us this weekend,\u201d Garrett Fitzgerald said.Yet there will be at least six or seven thousand fans \u2014 possibly more, given the famed ability of the red-shirted hordes to source match tickets where none seem to exist \u2014 following the team to Marseilles. Both on and off the field, Munster continues to make the exceptional seem routine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Moral Power of Curiosity", "Date": "2014-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMost of us have at one time or another felt ourselves in the grip of the explanatory drive. You\u2019re confronted by some puzzle, confusion or mystery. Your inability to come up with an answer gnaws at you. You\u2019re up at night, turning the problem over in your mind. Then, suddenly: clarity. The pieces click into place. There\u2019s a jolt of pure satisfaction.We\u2019re all familiar with this drive, but I wasn\u2019t really conscious of the moral force of this longing until I read Michael Lewis\u2019s book, \u201cFlash Boys.\u201d As you\u2019re probably aware, this book is about how a small number of Wall Street-types figured out that the stock markets were rigged by high-frequency traders who used complex technologies to give themselves a head start on everybody else. It\u2019s nominally a book about finance, but it\u2019s really a morality tale. The core question Lewis forces us to ask is: Why did some people do the right thing while most of their peers did not? The answer, I think, is that most people on Wall Street are primarily motivated to make money, but a few people are primarily motivated by an intense desire to figure stuff out.If you are primarily motivated to make money, you just need to get as much information as you need to do your job. You don\u2019t have time for deep dives into abstract matters. You certainly don\u2019t want to let people know how confused you are by something, or how shallow your knowledge is in certain areas. You want to project an image of mastery and omniscience.On Wall Street, as in some other areas of the modern economy that I could mention, this attitude leads to a culture of knowingness. People learn to bluff their way through, day to day. Executives don\u2019t really understand the complex things going on in their own companies. Traders don\u2019t understand how their technological tools really work. Programmers may know their little piece of code, but they don\u2019t have a broader knowledge of what their work is being used for. These people are content to possess information, but they don\u2019t seek knowledge. Information is what you need to make money short term. Knowledge is the deeper understanding of how things work. It\u2019s obtained only by long and inefficient study. It\u2019s gained by those who set aside the profit motive and instead possess an intrinsic desire just to know.The heroes of Lewis\u2019s book have this intrinsic desire. The central figure, Brad Katsuyama, observes that the markets are not working the way they are supposed to. Like thousands of others, he observes that funny things are happening on his screen when he places a trading order. But, unlike those others, this puzzling discrepancy between how things are and how things are supposed to be gnaws at him. He just has to understand what\u2019s going on.He conducts a long, arduous research project to go beneath the technology and figure things out. At one point he and his superiors at the Royal Bank of Canada conduct a series of trades not to make money but just to test theories. Another character, Ronan Ryan, taught himself how electronic signals move through the telecommunications system. A third, John Schwall, is an obsessive who buried himself in the library so he could understand the history of a particular form of stock-rigging called front-running.These people eventually figure out what was happening in the market. They acquire knowledge both of how the markets are actually working and of how they are supposed to work. They become indignant about the discrepancy.They could have used their knowledge to participate in the very market-rigging they were observing. But remember, the pleasure they derived from satisfying their curiosity surpassed the pleasure they derived from making money. So some of them ended up creating a separate stock exchange that could not be rigged in this way. One lesson of this tale is that capitalism doesn\u2019t really work when it relies on the profit motive alone. If everybody is just chasing material self-interest, the invisible hand won\u2019t lead to well-functioning markets. It will just lead to arrangements in which market insiders take advantage of everybody else. Capitalism requires the full range of motivation, including the intrinsic drive for knowledge and fairness.Second, you can\u2019t tame the desire for money with sermons. You can only counteract greed with some superior love, like the love of knowledge.Third, if market-rigging is defeated, it won\u2019t be by government regulators. It will be through a market innovation in which a good exchange replaces bad exchanges, designed by those who fundamentally understood the old system.And here\u2019s a phenomenon often true in innovation stories: The people who go to work pursuing knowledge, or because they intrinsically love writing code, sometimes end up making more money than the people who go to work pursuing money as their main purpose.

{"Headline": "America\u2019s Last Task in Kabul", "Date": "2014-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Until now, fighting the Afghan war has been an American project, and Americans have feared most that their withdrawal will be followed by chaos. That\u2019s why they have focused on handing over the fighting to Afghanistan\u2019s military.But the first round of the presidential election on April 5 opened a new prospect. Just by turning out in large numbers in defiance of Taliban denunciations, Afghans showed that they craved a stable future \u2014 and would need friends in the neighborhood to help broker their differences. That creates an incentive for every nearby country to collaborate on holding Afghanistan together after the Americans leave. With that in mind, it might be best for the United States to focus first on handing over the peacemaking to Afghanistan\u2019s neighbors, as the most credible strategy for ending the war quickly. Ever since 9/11, Washington demanded that the region\u2019s powers support its strategy in Afghanistan. But the region was split: India and Russia were content to see America seek outright victory over the Taliban and pursue the war to its end; Pakistan and Iran, which share ethnic roots with groups in Afghanistan, have long wanted America to end the fighting by negotiating its way out. Because the neighbors\u2019 interests never coincided in clear support of America\u2019s view, the region watched America experiment \u2014 with mixed results \u2014 at counterinsurgency and state-building, and later at peacemaking with the Taliban.Now it will be up to the neighbors, who \u2014 despite all their differences \u2014 share an interest in seeing Afghanistan avoid a new bloodletting. They question the Afghan Army\u2019s ability to defeat the Taliban in battle; the force is still largely made up of ethnic Tajiks and Hazaras from Afghanistan\u2019s north and west, leaving it likely to provoke resistance among the Pashtuns of the embattled south and east, from whom the Taliban spring. The neighbors remember the collapse of an earlier Afghan army soon after the Soviets who had trained it left, as well as the decade of civil war that followed in the 1990s. No neighbor wants that experience repeated, and a regionally supported peace deal would be the surest way to dissuade outsiders from supporting any Afghans who did. So how does the United States proceed?It should keep reminding everyone that it is about to leave, and that it is in their own best interest to build a regional consensus for an Afghan peace. That means joining hands with the Americans to ensure that a strong president emerges from the messy election process. On Election Day, the first reaction was relief at the turnout. But now there is concern that the final ballot count will prompt claims that the margin of fraud exceeds the margin of victory. The early first-round results point to a tight runoff race between Ashraf Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah, and a need for America to help broker a fair outcome, since a disputed outcome could divide the country. America should call on Afghanistan\u2019s neighbors to assist. Any political wrangling would draw in Iran as well as America, since the two nations have had the most influence on Afghan politics. They should take a page from their quiet cooperation in 2001, when they supported a conference of Afghan leaders in Bonn, Germany, that prepared Afghanistan for its transition to a constitution and elected government. Once in office, Afghanistan\u2019s next president will face myriad problems, not least that the Afghan economy will shrink as American funding for the war ends. Meanwhile, the most important task will remain keeping the Taliban at bay. If Afghan forces are not up to the job, Afghanistan will need a strong president with American and regional backing all the more. His job will be to negotiate a reconciliation with the Taliban. Which raises the question of how his disparate neighbors might find common ground to help. They should, because chaos in Afghanistan would threaten all of them.Moscow still sees extremism in Afghanistan as a threat to Muslim regions of Russia like Chechnya, and to the Muslim-populated former Soviet republics of Central Asia. China similarly worries that upheaval in Afghanistan could exacerbate Islamic extremism in Xinjiang; India thinks the same could happen in Kashmir. And Shiite Iran almost went to war with the Taliban, an extremist Sunni movement, in 1997; its leaders do not want a repeat of that crisis. Iran is already home to over two million Afghan refugees, and to a huge number of addicts dependent on heroin trafficked from Afghanistan. War next door would aggravate the first problem, and lawlessness would compound the second. Pakistan may be the most problematic \u2014 and important \u2014 neighbor. It has long looked to the Taliban to protect its interests in Afghanistan, but lately its government has been challenged by its own violent Islamist groups, including the Pakistani Taliban. Pakistanis have opposed Indian influence in Afghanistan on the ground that India might turn Pashtun nationalism against Pakistan. But that hypothetical fear has to be balanced with the tangible threat that, in the absence of American troops, Pakistan\u2019s own ascendant Taliban could feel free to join hands with Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban.In other words, these days even Islamabad is interested in putting the Taliban in a cage \u2014 or a peace agreement. In fact, Islamabad has favored a negotiated reconciliation between the Afghan government and the Taliban all along, if Kabul would agree to include a role for Pakistan and its interests. The United States is now talking to Iran. Its relations with Pakistan have stabilized. Its withdrawal from Afghanistan is in the works. All of this could make possible the kind of regional dialogue that could give Afghanistan a chance for a future. Afghanistan had a good election, but the war is not over. America will not be fighting that war, but it can help bring about a peace. Advertisement"}

He was 68.The cause was esophageal cancer, his wife, Sara Bershtel, said.At the time, the cost of shooting movies in New York had driven both independent and big-budget studio filmmakers to seek alternative locations, even when authenticity would seem to have been called for. \u201cA Rage in Harlem\u201d (1991), starring Forest Whitaker and Gregory Hines, was filmed in Cincinnati. \u201c29th Street\u201d (1991), a drama set in Queens starring Danny Aiello and Anthony LaPaglia, was filmed in Wilmington, N.C. (On the other hand, \u201cHangin\u2019 With the Homeboys,\u201d a 1991 film set in the Bronx and produced by Mr. Brick, was filmed in the Bronx.) He could. Through a marketing blitz, much of it carried out in person-to-person contacts, Mr. Brick, helped by new union agreements and the mayor\u2019s support, persuaded the studios and many independent producers to return to New York. His rejuvenated and enlarged department guided them through the welter of logistics and regulations that had made filming in the city so expensive and forbidding. Mr. Brick stepped down from the job in January 1994 after Mr. Dinkins lost a re-election bid to Rudolph W. Giuliani. But on Mr. Brick\u2019s watch, film production in New York rose 38 percent over all in 1993, contributing $3 billion to the city\u2019s economy, according to The New York Times. He was born Richard Michael Brick in Manhattan on Sept. 20, 1945, and grew up in Greenwich Village, where he attended the Little Red School House. His father, Seymour, an aspiring playwright, was a supplier for and later an owner of Manhattan gas stations. His mother, Sylvia, was a librarian and teacher. When Richard was a teenager, the family moved to Scarsdale, N.Y., where he went to high school. He graduated from New York University and received a master\u2019s degree in film studies from Columbia. For three decades, he taught in the graduate film program at Columbia, serving for a time as the department chairman. \u201cHis decision was to stay in New York, rather than go to Hollywood in search of bigger films to make,\u201d his wife said.He later worked with the television newsman Peter Jennings on documentaries about the Kennedy assassination and sightings of unidentified flying objects. At the time of Mr. Brick\u2019s death, films he had produced about the aerospace industry and the cardiac care unit at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan were awaiting release.Mr. Brick\u2019s marriage to the documentary filmmaker Geraldine Ashur ended with her death in 1984. He subsequently legally changed his middle name to Ashur. He married Ms. Bershtel, a book publisher, in 1989. He is also survived by a son, Noah Ashur Brick.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Democrats Assail G.O.P. After Filibuster of Proposal to Raise Minimum Wage", "Date": "2014-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 With the Republican-led filibuster of a Senate proposal to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 on Wednesday, Democrats moved swiftly to frame the vote as an example of the gulf that exists between the two parties on matters of economic fairness and upward mobility.The question is not just one of money, they said, but of morality. And in doing so the Democrats returned to the themes that were successful for their party and President Obama in 2012 when they convinced swing voters that Democrats were mindful of the best interests of all Americans \u2014 not just those who are powerful and wealthy.Speaking from the White House shortly after the measure was defeated 54 to 42, with 60 votes needed to advance, Mr. Obama admonished Republicans and called on voters to punish them at the polls in November. \u201cIf there\u2019s any good news here, it\u2019s that Republicans in Congress don\u2019t get the last word on this issue, or any issue,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cYou do, the American people, the voters.\u201d\u201cIf your member of Congress doesn\u2019t support raising the minimum wage,\u201d he added, \u201cyou have to let them know they\u2019re out of step, and that if they keep putting politics ahead of working Americans, you\u2019ll put them out of office.\u201dBut if Democrats thought that the defeat of the minimum wage increase gave them the opportunity to remind voters why they should remain in control of the Senate, Republicans felt just as strongly that Wednesday\u2019s vote was the latest sign that Democratic policies and politics are failing.\u201cLet\u2019s talk about the 800-pound gorilla here in the Senate chamber,\u201d Mr. Cornyn said. \u201cThis is all about politics. This is all about trying to make this side of the aisle look bad and hardhearted.\u201dA Republican-led filibuster prevented the minimum wage bill from moving forward to a full debate in the Senate. Just one Republican voted with the Democrats who supported the measure.Democrats said Wednesday that it was their intent to bring up the bill again when they had the Republican support to break a filibuster. But they added that they had no qualms about forcing a vote again even if Republicans seemed likely to reject it. That, they believe, would further underscore the Republican resistance to increasing the minimum wage from $7.25, a rate that has been unchanged since 2009. Harry Reid, the majority leader, said after the vote: \u201cThis is a moral issue. It\u2019s not who\u2019s going to vote for whom. It\u2019s about whether or not it is right that people who are working 40 hours a week get a fair shot at being able to provide for their families.\u201dThe Democrats\u2019 plan, called \u201cA Fair Shot for Everyone,\u201d also includes a bill to help make college more affordable, the next one that is likely to come to a vote, and other measures that would close tax loopholes that benefit corporations with business overseas and provide family and medical leave for workers.Yet it is unclear whether this will become a voting issue for most Americans in November. The Times/CBS News poll tested the impact that six issues would have on voting, and the minimum wage provoked the least reaction. A majority of registered voters, 52 percent, said they were willing to vote for someone who disagreed with them on raising the minimum wage. The hot-button issue was health care.Some Democrats from more conservative, rural states have expressed reservations about going as high as $10.10. Senator Mark Pryor of Arkansas, a Democrat who is locked in one of the tightest re-election fights, has said he does not support the plan voted on Wednesday. But he was not present for the vote. The one Republican who voted to allow the bill to move forward, Bob Corker of Tennessee, said that he disagreed with the policy but favored having a robust debate. But most Republicans said they felt boxed in by Democrats who would not consider a smaller increase.\u201cThere\u2019s no interest, apparently, on their side in having that conversation,\u201d said Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio. \u201cThis is more of a political exercise.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated when voters in Alaska will address raising the minimum wage. It will be in November, not August.David S. Joachim contributed reporting from Washington, and Megan Thee-Brenan from New York.Advertisement"}

The 2015 version takes a significant leap forward, even if the gains have little to do with brute strength. Instead, Subaru focused on the WRX\u2019s more pressing deficiencies. The interior, which used to scream \u201ceconobox,\u201d now announces itself with just a whisper. And though the WRX is still wild, its woolier elements have been tamed, including excess body roll, a raucous cabin and middling steering.The WRX\u2019s fan base must deal with some regrets. There\u2019s no longer a hatchback, only a sedan. And while there is still a higher-priced track-ready STI version, it stands pat on power with a carried-over engine. The STI\u2019s familiar 2.5-liter 4-cylinder boxer makes 305 horses, just 37 more than the base model.Yet Subaru conservatively cites the STI\u2019s 0-to-60 time at 5.2 seconds. Anyone who thinks a car that quick is underpowered is welcome to tinker with it himself \u2014 and indeed, many Subaru owners are active in the tuner hobby.The bigger disappointment is the bait-and-switch of the WRX concept car that Subaru unveiled at the New York auto show last year. After teasing the public with perhaps the most physically attractive Subaru in history, the company put little of that muscular design into production.Though the WRX has dropped the Impreza name, the physical connection to that frumpy budget sedan remains clear. But the Impreza\u2019s gym-rat cousin flexes some muscle: There are slanted LED headlamps and a gaping hood scoop that sends fresh air to the turbo\u2019s intercooler. Looks aside, this WRX is much more than an Impreza with a big motor, a firmer suspension and all-wheel drive. Subaru says the chassis is 40 percent more rigid than before, a fine starting point for precise handling and body control. The new WRX also benefits from a fresher cabin design. Rear legroom grows by nearly two inches, and trunk space is up as well. The seats are more stylish and better bolstered, with leather-and-Alcantara trim in the STI that I tested. A flat-bottom three-point steering wheel looks and feels good, and there are strips of faux carbon-fiber trim across the dash and center console. Buyers are welcome to skip the WRX\u2019s available navigation and infotainment system, a maddening hodgepodge of Atari-level displays and tiny, hard-to-operate touch-screen buttons. All models get a new 4.3-inch LCD display screen and backup camera. But a real-time fuel-economy gauge serves up nonstop distraction in direct view of the driver.The standard WRX gets the all-new engine that fans of its acclaimed BRZ sports car have been dreaming of: a turbocharged version of the BRZ\u2019s 2-liter boxer 4, with 268 horses and 258 pound-feet of torque. Its pistons are laid horizontally in opposition \u2014 hence the boxer name \u2014 in a balanced, distinctive-sounding layout that only Subaru and Porsche continue to use in cars. The regular WRX scoots from 0 to 60 m.p.h. in about 5.4 seconds. The brakes are larger and stronger, though the pedal still feels squishy when the brakes first bite. A 6-speed manual transmission replaces a 5-speed. New electric-assisted steering ranks among the best of such systems: Subaru credits its natural, lively feel to lessons learned from the system in the BRZ.It\u2019s all hard to beat at a starting price of $27,090, or $29,290 for the Premium version I tested.\u00a0And that, to me, feels like the sweet spot in price. The WRX now performs so well there is less reason \u2014 except for track drivers, or those who live to challenge Mitsubishi Evolutions \u2014 to spend thousands extra on the STI.I didn\u2019t drive a car with Subaru\u2019s new continuously variable automatic transmission, a type of gearbox usually associated more with saving fuel than posting lap times. But the Subaru C.V.T. does feature modes that let drivers mimic the operation of a conventional paddle-shifted automatic. Making no concessions to those wedded to automatics, the STI comes with a 6-speed manual, take it or leave it. With a rear wing so tall it reminds you of St. Louis\u2019s Gateway Arch, the STI is the kind of car that the police assume is carrying Vin Diesel and a trunkful of illicit cash. And like a rangy hound, this version lives for regular exercise, whether on a track or through the orange cones of an autocross course. The STI\u2019s base price has been held to $35,290, the same as the departing version. I drove a $38,190 STI Launch Edition, limited to 1,000 units. It comes in one signature color, a screaming metallic blue with gold-painted 18-inch BBS alloy wheels. The STI Limited tops the charts at $39,290, with features like an eight-way power driver\u2019s seat and a premium audio system. For the STI, Subaru further bolstered the chassis and suspension and added Brembo brakes. One caution: Both WRX models ride more stiffly than ever. The STI\u2019s sturdier, largely handbuilt manual gearbox rows smoothly through the six forward speeds. A special short-throw shifter, standard on the Launch Edition and optional otherwise, is simply the best yet on a WRX. A new torque-vectoring system blips individual front brakes to help the car rotate through turns. Drivers can toggle the all-wheel-drive system to vary power between front and rear wheels, and can lock the center differential for a full-time 50-50 split.In the interest of fingertip sensation, the STI keeps a traditional hydraulic steering unit, but one with a brilliantly quick 13.0:1 ratio, versus 14.5:1 for the standard WRX. A rotary console knob adjusts throttle mapping through three modes, including a maximum setting called Sport Sharp.In competitive terms, the WRX and the Mitsubishi Evolution represent the Japanese version of the long-running war between the Camaro and Mustang. Over two weeks with the WRX and STI, not one person inquired about the styling or asked about new features. But close to a dozen people demanded to know: Is it better than the Evo?For some time, the Evo has held the performance edge. But the pendulum has swung back to Subaru even as Mitsubishi struggles to stay afloat in America. The WRX\u2019s newfound tautness and agility makes the cars\u2019 performance a virtual tossup. And compared with the Mitsubishi\u2019s dated, plasticky interior, the new cabin is a nicer place to be.\u00a0Even on dry pavement with Dunlop winter tires \u2014 not an ideal combination \u2014 the Subarus\u2019 uncanny grip and control make them fierce competitors to BMW M cars or Mercedes AMGs at twice the price. The Subarus feel stirring and vital, high-feedback analog cars in a world of ghostly digital appliances. Like vintage musical instruments, the WRX and STI have an honest, old-fashioned quality that\u2019s become increasingly rare. And the analogy fits, because these Subarus were born to rock.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "March Hiring Data Shows a Spring Thaw", "Date": "2014-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Companies stepped up hiring in March for a second month, offering fresh evidence that the American economy was regaining momentum after a weather-driven lull over the winter.Private employers added 191,000 workers to payrolls last month and 39,000 more were added in February than had been previously believed, the payroll processor ADP said on Wednesday.The signs of hiring added to a steady stream of fairly upbeat data suggesting that the economy has started to accelerate as the grip of an unusually severe winter has loosened, inspiring hope that the economy\u2019s performance in 2014 will be its best since the recession ended almost five years ago.\u201cWhatever impact the weather was having is starting to dissipate, and we are starting to see the economy gain traction,\u201d said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities.The figures were made public ahead of the government\u2019s more comprehensive report on employment in March, which is set to be released on Friday. That report is expected to show that nonfarm payrolls grew by 200,000, the largest gain in four months, according to a Reuters poll of economists. A separate report showed that small-business hiring increased for a sixth straight month in March. The National Federation of Independent Business said small-business employment increased by an average of 0.18 workers per business, up from 0.11 in February. The signs of improvement in the labor market will be welcomed by the Federal Reserve, which has registered a vote of confidence in the economy by tapering off its monthly bond-buying program.Strength in the labor market raises speculation about the timing of an interest rate increase by the Fed, which some economists expect next year. It has held its benchmark overnight lending rate at a record low of zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008.\u201cFor the Fed, employment growth in the 200,000 to 225,000 range will be seen as good enough to justify their current bias for tapering and a pivot toward a 2015 start to policy tightening,\u201d said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities.The unusually cold and snowy winter was just one factor that hobbled the economy at the end of 2013 and the start of this year. Businesses working through a pile of unsold goods also placed fewer orders with manufacturers, and the expiration of long-term unemployment benefits and cuts to the food stamp program exerted a temporary drag.Signs of an economic thaw were also evident in a report from the Commerce Department showing that new orders for manufactured goods jumped 1.6 percent in February, the biggest rise since September. But January\u2019s numbers for factory orders were revised to show a 1 percent drop instead of the previously reported 0.7 percent fall.Inventories at factories rose 0.7 percent in February, the biggest increase since October 2011. Mr. Bullard of Wells Fargo said that was most likely because other businesses were holding the line on their inventories, resulting in a buildup at factories.In another positive economic sign, shipments from factories rose 0.9 percent, the largest increase since last July.Advertisement"}

But it is not just conservatives who are watching the race.

{"Headline": "Fashion District Robberies Turn Heads, and Some Can\u2019t Help Smirking", "Date": "2014-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byParis JournalPARIS \u2014 Since the reign of France\u2019s Sun King, the historic Place Vend\u00f4me has served as this city\u2019s capital of luxury, home to high-end fashion boutiques and diamond shops, Coco Chanel\u2019s mansion, and the palatial H\u00f4tel Ritz Paris. Lately, though, this quarter snug in the heart of Paris has turned into the hub of a decidedly more low-rent form of plunder: smash-and-grab robberies.Common crime is an indiscreet topic among merchants in the Vend\u00f4me quarter of stone streets and graceful arcades. But many are clearly jittery from a wave of daytime robberies \u2014 three in the last three weeks \u2014 that have targeted ostentatious wealth in an otherwise weak economy, provoking more satire than sympathy.The culprits have mostly hit jewelry stores, and on Friday the police arrested two men in connection with one of the thefts who were tripped up by DNA left at the scene and by the ubiquitous video surveillance cameras.The latest break-in, on March 22 by masked robbers armed with a pump-action gun and an ax, struck the city\u2019s temple of hip, Colette. The eclectic three-story shop ordinarily attracts the likes of Kate Moss, Jay-Z and Kanye West with its mix of limited-edition clothing, books, dishes, jewelry and a water bar where sparkling water is pricier than wine.But shortly before the store opened in the morning, two thieves stormed the entrance and barked orders at seven employees, according to the police. The robbers smashed a display case of watches on the first floor, and then fled within minutes on a motorcycle with more than 600,000 euros, or about $822,000, in deluxe watches.\u201cThey didn\u2019t want to steal clothes,\u201d said Colette Roussaux, the owner. \u201cThey came for the opportunity and the beautiful watches here. And we don\u2019t sell Swatches.\u201dWith its high-fashion profile, the Colette caper quickly provoked black humor about the low concept of fashion crime. A satirical French television show, \u201cLe Petit Journal,\u201d re-enacted the robbery with air-kissing thieves in mustaches. Leafing through their wardrobe, they bickered over mix-and-match accessories. What to wear to a heist? Louis Vuitton gloves? A Jacquemus ax?In one frantic day, a group of ambitious students created a website selling T-shirts emblazoned with \u201cI Robbed Colette.\u201d Twitter users scoffed, too, remarking that 600,000 euros at the pricey store equaled two white T-shirts and a pair of shoes.But it was no laughing matter in the Vend\u00f4me quarter, where many store employees and the local merchant group, the Vend\u00f4me committee, said they preferred not to comment.Since the latest robbery, the police have stepped up their presence in the commercial area, increasing foot patrols, said Xavier Castaing, a police spokesman. Mr. Castaing said robberies in Paris were down overall, a trend led by banks that have reduced their cash on hand and adopted new security measures. Now, he added, the police are working with merchants to improve security in the Vend\u00f4me district, which is already covered by extensive surveillance cameras that have helped crack earlier robberies.In the Friday arrests, that was the case again. The police said that both men, ages 56 and 63, had extensive criminal records, and that one had recently been released after serving time in prison for jewelry store robberies in 2005 and 2009. In one instance, he sported a Borsalino hat; in the recent robbery, the police said, the look was more classic: a mask and a handgun.Typically, the private security men in suits who are now ubiquitous outside the jewelry stores are forbidden to bear arms. But in the south of France, some owners of small jewelry stores have shot and killed fleeing robbers, provoking soul-searching debates about how to prosecute them.Among the more exotic security alternatives under discussion is a special powder or fluid that is invisible to the eye and can be sprayed on valuable items. If a thief touches a sprayed object, the fluid leaves a DNA trace that can be read over a period of six weeks with an ultraviolet light. But the approach still has not been accepted as legal evidence.Jacques Morel, a security adviser to the French association of jewelers, said that stolen jewelry lost 80 percent of its value when resold, but that there was a thriving trade between wealthy buyers from Eastern Europe and thieves from that region. The number of attacks on jewelers fell last year, he added, but what has changed is the audacity of foreign thieves coming to Paris, who create high drama by barging in and out in three minutes.\u201cThey are using new techniques of smash and grab, using weapons to smash glass,\u201d he said, adding that the thieves sometimes strike in large numbers. \u201cPassive security doesn\u2019t work effectively, so there is reflection now among law enforcement about how to improve.\u201dIn October, about 15 men demonstrated such brute force, attacking the jewelry store Vacheron Constantin, near the Place Vend\u00f4me, with axes. They snatched 20 watches and streamed away on foot, an odd scene that a witness captured in a shaky video.Some suspects, who were Romanian, were captured by the police on the same day. Others were picked up a few months later in a second heist turned slapstick.In January, eight men from Romania were arrested on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es after they attacked a door of a jewelry store with sledgehammers and axes. In a form of poetic street justice, they were trapped in a space as they tried unsuccessfully to force their way through a second door.In such cases, it is difficult to resist the comic possibilities of crime. After Colette was robbed, a group of university students of technology, business and marketing decided to exploit the headlines.David, 20, who declined to disclose his last name to \u201cremain discreet,\u201d dreamed up the \u201cI Robbed Colette\u201d T-shirts with four friends. They sold about 1,000 over two days and then closed up shop. Spring exams beckoned.\u201cWe did it to be creative and funny and to have a good time doing it,\u201d David said. \u201cColette is so expensive. Every time we run past it, we see those Chanel backpacks for about \u20ac2,500. That was the aim of the project \u2014 to react to people wanting to buy so much stuff there. It\u2019s so expensive.\u201dIn contrast to Colette\u2019s \u20ac135 ($185) designer Kenzo T-shirts \u2014 \u201cNo Fish. No Nothing\u201d \u2014 the student collection was itself a steal: \u20ac25, or about $34.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Cappuccino for Public Safety", "Date": "2014-04-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLeaks matter for at least three reasons. One is solely economical: Leaks waste gas, and therefore money. Another is a threat to long-term health: Natural gas contains methane, benzene and other greenhouse gases and carcinogens; the less of it in the air, the better. And the third is a threat to short-term health: When gas blows up, it can kill people. Unnecessarily.With some elementary math, however, we can use leaky gas mains as an example of how simply and nearly painlessly government could better ensure public safety and welfare \u2014 which is, after all, one of its primary purposes. If national defense is an example of how government is useful in protecting us from external and usually uncontrollable threats, public works is an equally valid and important example of how it can be useful in protecting us from internal \u2014 and highly avoidable \u2014 threats. (Myself, I don\u2019t care whether I\u2019m killed by a terrorist or in an explosion resulting from a leaky gas main; I\u2019d like to die of what used to be called \u201cold age.\u201d)One estimate puts gas line replacement at $10 million a mile. Ten million times 6,000 is $60 billion. A lot of money, even if you\u2019re Bill Gates. But a significant percentage of these pipes could be replaced decades from now; this is, after all, a continuing process, just like the updating of roads and bridges and subways. And we can assume that a boatload of money would be saved in not repairing leaks or in emergency calls, let alone tragedies.For the sake of argument, though, let\u2019s just work with the $60 billion. Over, say, 20 years, that\u2019s \u201conly\u201d $3 billion per year. Which, admittedly, is also a lot of money.That\u2019s why we\u2019re in this collective called a society: We share costs. And despite the best efforts of many members of Congress, we still share at least some costs based on our ability to pay.About a third of New York\u2019s residents don\u2019t pay city income taxes because their income is too low, but for better or worse even they pay sales taxes. On the other hand, we have more billionaires and millionaires than anyplace else in the country. The point is you can whack this $3 billion up however you like; if 3 million people \u2014 the average number of people who are in Manhattan on a given workday \u2014 were to pay it, that would come out to about the cost of less than a cappuccino a day, assuming $3 a pop. (In case you were wondering, the \u201caverage\u201d American is already paying that daily cappuccino cost for national defense.) If you budget \u201conly\u201d $2 billion a year, enough to make a serious dent, you can pay for this with a cup of regular coffee. And, if you charged every one of the 50 million plus tourists who come to the city every year $60, natives and commuters could pay zero. (I\u2019m just saying.)Of course, New Yorkers and others have to pay for more than gas pipes; the entire country\u2019s infrastructure is crumbling, so it\u2019s a federal problem. But the math on a bigger scale is not that different; for dollars a day, we can gain public safety, efficiency and convenience.And although it\u2019s an old argument, it\u2019s not invalid: Public expenditures in building infrastructure create jobs and boost the economy; only those who see government as the enemy oppose this. But maybe those who see government as the enemy can\u2019t imagine dying in a gas explosion. They certainly can\u2019t do much driving on the Van Wyck Expressway.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Abusive and Frivolous Patent Suits", "Date": "2014-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialAbusive and frivolous lawsuits brought by holders of patents are costing the American economy billions of dollars. Fortunately, Congress is on the case. A large bipartisan majority in the House approved a bill last year that would reduce such litigation; the Senate, where a similar bill is being negotiated, may soon follow. Lawmakers are particularly concerned about cases in which patent owners sue small businesses like cafes and hotels for their use of technology \u2014 for example, Internet routers made by Apple or Cisco Systems. The firms that bring these suits sometimes also sue the manufacturers of the equipment, but they often sue the users of technology since they know that many small businesses would rather settle than fight costly court cases. The Senate and House bills would allow manufacturers, which are in the best position to defend these cases, to step in and fight claims on behalf of their customers.Some lawmakers in the Senate, notably Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, are pushing for legislation that would give judges more discretion than the House bill would. Granting judges more freedom to award fees in patent cases can reduce the number of abusive cases. But Congress should be careful not to adopt a standard that is so tough that it effectively closes the courthouse door to small inventors, universities and other patent holders.Advertisement"}

He and his partners face a housing market that has not rebounded with the economy.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the economy still feels stuck, blame the housing market. That may not match how people in a handful of big, prosperous cities see things. After a disastrous and historic crash, housing is booming in places like San Francisco and New York. Bidding wars are back, and the question is not whether the real estate market is recovering but whether new bubbles are inflating.But there\u2019s another reality that is more important for the national economy. Except in a few booming markets, housing is nowhere close to pulling its economic weight. Consider this:Investment in residential property remains a smaller share of the overall economy than at any time since World War II, contributing less to growth than it did even in previous steep downturns in the early 1980s, when mortgage rates hit 20 percent, or the early 1990s, when hundreds of mortgage lenders failed.So what is holding housing back? Sure, a glut of housing was built during the last great mania, and in some markets buyers are still working through those supplies. Bank lending is only now thawing, both for homebuilders and buyers. But those restraining factors have eased a lot in the last few years. The bigger thing holding back housing is simply demand. Fewer people can or want to fulfill the American dream of starting a household of their own.It may yet prove to be temporary, but for now at least, millions more people are doubling up with roommates, living at home with parents and otherwise finding ways to avoid doing the one thing that would get the housing economy back to normal: buying a home.Overbuilding, UnderbuildingThe housing market in Roanoke, Va., is a good place to see what\u2019s happening. A city of just under 100,000 people in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, Roanoke has a history as a rail and manufacturing hub and nowadays has a strong health care industry. It also has this distinction: Its housing market \u2014 based on measures like housing prices and building activity \u2014 closely matches the nationwide data. The number of new houses and apartments that are needed in the United States is determined over the long term largely by demographics \u2014 immigrants arriving and young people moving away from home. From 2000 to 2007, the number of households rose 1.24 million a year on average \u2014 about what economists would expect, given those demographic trends.Add in the 300,000 or so homes that fall into disrepair each year and need to be replaced, and builders would have to construct around 1.5 million homes a year to keep up with the longer-term demand.During the boom, builders were much busier than that, putting up 2.1 million more houses from 2000 to 2006 than if they had stuck to that 1.5 million trend rate.Roanoke never experienced the sort of extreme bubble in prices and construction of a Phoenix or a Miami, or the structural economic decline of the industrial Midwest, or the kind of humming regional economy that spurred a speedy rebound in the likes of San Francisco and Washington. In that sense, Roanoke is like hundreds of midsize cities nationwide that are trying to climb out of a long, deep downturn. Back in 2005, builders in the Roanoke metropolitan area took out permits for more than 1,600 new housing units. At the low point, in 2009, they took out just 449. The rebound since then has been modest, with only 656 permits issued in 2013.\u201cA lot of builders just quit building,\u201d Mr. Fields said. \u201cThey parked their trucks and decided to do something else.\u201d Banks stopped lending for new development. Nearby subdivisions that had been in the planning stages remained only blueprints. Houses that had been started before the bust sat empty, waiting for buyers.Now, though, those houses have owners, and new houses are rising. But things aren\u2019t good enough to lead a builder like Mr. Fields to crank up the pace of production. Whereas three years ago a builder would offer a $20,000 discount to a willing buyer, now the discounts run only $5,000 or so. Thanks to a run-up in prices for supplies like lumber and wallboard, his profit margins remain squeezed. Standing over the granite countertops in a house nearing completion, waiting for a washer and dryer to be installed and some tile work to be finished, Mr. Fields explained that he wants no more than three houses in inventory at any given time, to avoid the risk of being stuck with empty houses. What is keeping Peter Fields from building more houses isn\u2019t too much competition from foreclosures or excess houses from the boom years (inventories are fairly tight by historical standards) or a shortage of land (he has 30 more lots graded and ready to build upon) or a shortage of capital (his bankers are eager for him to continue building). It\u2019s simple as can be: \u201cWe\u2019ll build more houses as soon as we see some people ready to buy them,\u201d he said. Mystery of the Missing BuyersGiven demographic trends, there should be plenty of housing demand. Immigration has slowed in recent years, but the nation\u2019s population has still grown by about 20 million since the housing downturn began in 2006. Yet those additional people are translating into fewer new households than historical patterns would predict.This is a problem for the whole economy, and at its core is the mystery of the missing buyers.\u201cHousehold formation,\u201d as economists call it, is the foundation of demand in the housing market. When a young adult moves away from home and gets her own apartment, a household is formed; when a retiree moves out of his own place and into the apartment above an adult child\u2019s garage, one ceases to exist. The number of American households is in constant motion; it is determined by millions of individual decisions that Americans make about their living situations.Since 2007, those decisions have tilted overwhelmingly toward not dividing up into as many households as in the past. The number of households rose by an average of 569,000 a year from 2007 to 2013, according to census data, down from 1.35 million a year from 2001 to 2006.Why the missing households? To a large degree, they can be explained by young people choosing \u2014 or being forced by circumstance \u2014 to remain at home longer than they have in previous generations.Reed Bergloff, 28, is a Roanoke resident with a solid job selling windows and doors. He lives at his parents\u2019 house, he said, not because of the cost of a rental but because he wants to save money to buy his own place.\u201cIf I rented a place, something decent that doesn\u2019t have bedbugs and stuff like that, I\u2019d be looking at $600, $700 a month plus cable and Internet and all that,\u201d Mr. Bergloff said. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to put away as much as I can. It\u2019s harder for people to get a loan these days. For a while, banks were just handing money out left and right to unqualified people, but I know I\u2019m going to need a solid down payment. It just makes sense to save as much as possible while I can.\u201dFor other young people, there are different explanations: They may sense that their jobs are not secure, or they have a lot of student debt that limits what they can spend on rent or a mortgage payment. Whatever the cause, the effect is to delay signing a lease or getting a mortgage. The reason Peter Fields doesn\u2019t see the kind of demand for houses that might coax him to speed up building activity, in other words, is precisely that there aren\u2019t the new households that would normally snap them up.Mixed Blessing of ApartmentsThe little center is starting to bustle, with residents attending concerts at an open pavilion or popping into the Tap House for beer and a $12 lobster mac and cheese. But it\u2019s not because Mr. Kelderhouse sold many houses.At the end of 2012, he broke ground on three buildings with 120 rental apartments. It seemed an unconventional step to take in the rolling hills of southwestern Virginia, where the default domicile is a detached single-family home. But apartment demand has proved surprisingly strong, especially for larger units. The 83 units that were complete as of early April were all leased \u2014 some with higher rents than the company had projected. It has already raised the rent on three-bedroom units from $1,250 a month, when they first went on the market last year, to about $1,500 today.\u201cIt\u2019s not just for young professionals or young families,\u201d Mr. Kelderhouse said of his rental units. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of retirees as well who don\u2019t want the hassle of a house.\u201dSo there is something of a boom underway in the nation\u2019s housing market. It just isn\u2019t for single-family homes.Building of rental multifamily properties, as the industry calls them \u2014 buildings with five or more housing units as part of one construction \u2014 was higher last year than it was even at the peak of the housing boom. Some 34 percent of all housing permits issued nationwide were for multifamily properties in 2012 and 2013, the highest since 1984.It appears that many people who once set their sights on buying a stand-alone house are now deciding that renting an apartment is a better option. While renting may make plenty of sense for cash-short individuals or downsizing retirees, the boom in apartment construction is doing less to support the overall economy than if it were happening with single-family homes. On average, it cost $102,000 to build each of those new apartment units last year, according to census data, compared with $224,000 for each single-family home. Moody\u2019s Analytics estimates that every single-family home that is started creates 3.7 jobs over the ensuing year, compared with 1.8 jobs for a unit in each multifamily home. In other words, it\u2019s great that the Daleville Town Center is finally starting to fill up with residents. But because each apartment is less expensive to build than a stand-alone house, the impact on the Roanoke regional economy is less than you might expect.From his office window, Mr. Kelderhouse surveyed the distant hills that were meant to contain $350,000 brick houses by now but are still occupied by apple trees. All these years later, there is only one small cluster of five single-family homes on the fringe of the property.The United States economy has been stuck in a vicious cycle: A moribund housing market saps the economy of strength, and the ensuing weakness \u2014 high unemployment, slow wage growth \u2014 means that fewer people are leaving the nest for a home of their own. Those who do are choosing smaller rental apartments that generate less spillover benefits for the broader economy.How to get out of the cycle? Through a grinding, gradual process in which the 2.3 million missing households start looking for their own places, which generates more building activity, which strengthens the economy and results in more jobs and higher wages. It will require people like Reed Bergloff to decide that their savings have built up enough for them to buy a house, which people like Peter Fields and Andy Kelderhouse build on those long-vacant parcels of land, hiring more construction workers.None of that, however, can happen instantly through some policy change, like a tweak in federal housing rules to make it easier to get a loan, or further measures from the Federal Reserve to lower mortgage rates. More than anything, it takes time.Mr. Kelderhouse says that 2017 \u201cis the year everybody throws out as when we\u2019re back to normal. He adds, \u201cThat still seems believable to me.\u201d This article is part of The Upshot, a Times site that provides news, analysis and data visualization about politics, policy and everyday life: nytimes.com/upshot.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pro-Russian Militants Seize More Offices in Eastern Ukraine", "Date": "2014-04-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKIEV, Ukraine \u2014 Pro-Russia militants seized more state offices in Ukraine\u2019s troubled east on Tuesday, in apparent defiance of the latest Western sanctions announced against them and their presumed backers in the Kremlin, which also showed no sign of wilting in its worst confrontation with the West in decades.Speaking to reporters in Belarus, President Vladimir V. Putin said he had vetoed suggestions within the Kremlin that Russia respond in kind to the latest sanctions. \u201cThe government has already proposed some steps in response, but I consider that there is no need for this,\u201d Mr. Putin told reporters, according to the Interfax news agency. But if it continues, he said, Moscow will have to think about who works and how they work in key sectors of Russia\u2019s economy, including energy.Mr. Putin was in Minsk, the capital of Belarus, to attend the summit of the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council \u2014 the economic bloc of former Soviet republics he started in order to try to counterbalance the draw of the European Union. Its viability without Ukraine has been called into question.But Mr. Putin said the integration of the Eurasian union would not be affected by Western sanctions. In a similar vein, he also denied that Russians were playing any role in fomenting unrest in Ukraine\u2019s east \u2014 echoing similar denials in March over Crimea, where Mr. Putin later admitted Russian forces were involved.Unopposed by the local police, armed militants stormed into the regional government headquarters in the city of Luhansk, capital of the Ukrainian region closest to Russia on the eastern border, a live video stream on the Internet showed. Militants had already taken over the city\u2019s security headquarters on April 6.Hours after the storming of the Luhansk regional government headquarters, militants seized control of the prosecutor\u2019s office in the city, Yelena Bugayets, head of the regional press service, said by telephone.The Luhansk action followed violent attacks on peaceful demonstrators in Donetsk late on Monday, when masked men, several of them wielding bats and clubs, pounced on marchers carrying the blue and yellow Ukrainian national flag.The police in Donetsk also proved ineffectual, doing little or nothing to stop what Geoffrey R. Pyatt, the American ambassador to Ukraine, said on Tuesday were attacks on women, children and elderly people \u201cwho were willing to put it on the line\u201d for Ukraine.There was no sign on Tuesday that the German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, had made any progress in securing the release of a German-led team of six military observers who were seized by militants last Friday in the eastern town of Slovyansk. The observers were brought before television cameras by their captors over the weekend, a sight Mr. Steinmeier described as \u201crevolting.\u201dThe observers were working under the auspices of the 57-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, whose negotiators returned to Slovyansk on Tuesday.The self-declared mayor of Slovyansk, Vyachislav Ponomaryov, canceled a planned news conference, and the Russian news agency Interfax reported that he had said the observers \u2014 four Germans, a Pole, a Czech and a Dane \u2014 would be released only if the European Union lifted its sanctions against militants who back Moscow.Map of European energy imports that come from Russia.In general, there was a sense on Tuesday that Ukraine\u2019s east was falling further under the sway of the pro-Russia militants, although the situation remained volatile and hard to read. There was no independent confirmation, for instance, of a report by the Russian-owned RIA Novosti news agency that administrative buildings in five smaller cities and towns between Donetsk and Luhansk had replaced Ukrainian flags with separatist flags.Five militants in eastern Ukraine \u2014 the two from Luhansk and three from Donetsk \u2014 were included among the 15 new names on the European Union\u2019s sanctions list. So were two of Russia\u2019s most senior military commanders \u2014 Gen. Valery V. Gerasimov, the chief of staff, and Lt. Gen. Igor Sergun, identified as the head of the G.R.U., the Kremlin\u2019s military intelligence agency. Two prominent Russian politicians, Dmitri N. Kozak, a deputy prime minister, and Lyudmila I. Shevtsova, a senior figure in the lower house of Parliament, were on the list as well.The American measures were announced on a day of ominous developments in eastern Ukraine, including the seizure of the city of Konstantinovka by militants and the attempted assassination of Gennady A. Kernes, the mayor of Kharkiv.The police said that the bullet that struck Mr. Kernes, 54, in the back had been fired from a sniper rifle and had missed his heart by a few millimeters. He was transferred to Elisha Hospital in Israel late on Monday after a two-hour operation to repair damage to his lungs, an aide said. The hospital issued a statement saying that the mayor \u201cunderwent diagnostic tests that showed the operations were successful.\u201dMr. Kernes\u2019s aide said he underwent a second minor procedure on Tuesday, but declined to elaborate. The hospital said \u201che is under observation by the best doctors and it appears that there is no need for further surgical intervention.\u201dIt was not immediately clear why Mr. Kernes, who is Jewish but is not believed to have Israeli citizenship, was transferred to the hospital in Haifa, 1,200 miles from Kharkiv. Alison Smale reported from Kiev; Andrew Roth from Kharkiv, Ukraine; and Neil MacFarquhar from Moscow. C. J. Chivers contributed reporting from Slovyansk, Ukraine, and Alan Cowell from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rochelle Feinstein: \u2018Love Vibe\u2019", "Date": "2014-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byArt in ReviewOn Stellar Rays1 Rivington Street, between Bowery and Chrystie Streets, Lower East SideThrough May 11In her latest show, the wryly autobiographical painter Rochelle Feinstein explores a vacuous bit of art world parlance: the phrase \u201cLove your work,\u201d typically delivered with an air kiss. Manipulating it with humor and surgical dexterity, she finds hidden reserves of meaning.The words float, in cartoon speech bubbles, through her installation of six large paintings. Each has a bright green background, which we are meant to see as a kind of \u201cgreen screen\u201d (to judge from a digital projection near the reception desk) that suggests any number of possible settings. And each text must be read in mirror image, defamiliarizing the words.The placement of the bubbles varies; as you look around the room, they appear to rise and fall, or to shift left and right. Sometimes they are cropped so that only snippets of the original phrase \u2014 \u201cLove You\u201d or \u201cWork\u201d\u2014 are legible. The subtext shifts accordingly, from hyperbolic admiration to purposeful exhortation. Sometimes the whole phrase becomes a kind of mantra, transcending its breezier associations.With remarkable economy, not to mention painterly brio, Ms. Feinstein turns a cocktail party platitude into a symphonic arrangement of the many different voices heard by creative professionals. And she reminds us that although the art world is inherently social, it\u2019s sometimes necessary for the people who make art or look at it to tune out all the chatter. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Top Player Accused, and a Flawed Rape Inquiry", "Date": "2014-04-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTALLAHASSEE, Fla. \u2014 Early on the morning of Dec. 7, 2012, a freshman at Florida State University reported that she had been raped by a stranger somewhere off campus after a night of drinking at a popular Tallahassee bar called Potbelly\u2019s. As she gave her account to the police, several bruises began to appear, indicating recent trauma. Tests would later find semen on her underwear. For nearly a year, the events of that evening remained a well-kept secret until the woman\u2019s allegations burst into the open, roiling the university and threatening a prized asset: Jameis Winston, one of the marquee names of college football. Three weeks after Mr. Winston was publicly identified as the suspect, the storm had passed. The local prosecutor announced that he lacked the evidence to charge Mr. Winston with rape. The quarterback would go on to win the Heisman Trophy and lead Florida State to the national championship.In his announcement, the prosecutor, William N. Meggs, acknowledged a number of shortcomings in the police investigation. In fact, an examination by The New York Times has found that there was virtually no investigation at all, either by the police or the university. The police did not follow the obvious leads that would have quickly identified the suspect as well as witnesses, one of whom videotaped part of the sexual encounter. After the accuser identified Mr. Winston as her assailant, the police did not even attempt to interview him for nearly two weeks and never obtained his DNA.The detective handling the case waited two months to write his first report and then prematurely suspended his inquiry without informing the accuser. By the time the prosecutor got the case, important evidence had disappeared, including the video of the sexual act.\u201cThey just missed all the basic fundamental stuff that you are supposed to do,\u201d Mr. Meggs said in a recent interview. Even so, he cautioned, a better investigation might have yielded the same result. The case has unfolded as colleges and universities across the country are facing rising criticism over how they deal with sexual assault, as well as questions about whether athletes sometimes receive preferential treatment. The Times\u2019s examination \u2014 based on police and university records, as well as interviews with people close to the case, including lawyers and sexual assault experts \u2014 found that, in the Winston case, Florida State did little to determine what had happened. University administrators, in apparent violation of federal law, did not promptly investigate either the rape accusation or the witness\u2019s admission that he had videotaped part of the encounter. Records show that Florida State\u2019s athletic department knew about the rape accusation early on, in January 2013, when the assistant athletic director called the police to inquire about the case. Even so, the university did nothing about it, allowing Mr. Winston to play the full season without having to answer any questions. After the championship game, in January 2014, university officials asked Mr. Winston to discuss the case, but he declined on advice of his lawyer. When The Times asked Mr. Winston for an interview, an Atlanta lawyer advising his family, David Cornwell, responded, \u201cWe don\u2019t need an investigation, thorough or otherwise, to know that Jameis did not sexually assault this young lady.\u201d Mr. Cornwell, who has represented major sports figures and the N.F.L., added, \u201cJameis has never sexually assaulted anybody.\u201d Mr. Winston has previously acknowledged having sex with his accuser but said it was consensual. His account has been supported by two friends from the football team who were with him that night, Chris Casher, who took the video, and Ronald Darby. A month before the rape accusation became public, the university\u2019s victim advocate learned that a second woman had sought counseling after a sexual encounter with Mr. Winston, according to the prosecutor\u2019s office. The woman did not call it rape \u2014 she did not say \u201cno.\u201d But the encounter, not previously reported, \u201cwas of such a nature that she felt violated or felt that she needed to seek some type of counseling for her emotions about the experience,\u201d according to Georgia Cappleman, the chief assistant state attorney, who said she had spoken with the advocate but not with the woman.The victim advocate was concerned enough about the episode to have alerted Mr. Winston\u2019s first accuser. Ms. Cappleman said that based on what she was told, a crime had not been committed. Nonetheless, Ms. Cappleman said she found the encounter troubling, because it \u201csheds some light on the way Mr. Winston operates\u201d and on what may be \u201ca recurring problem rather than some type of misunderstanding that occurred in an isolated situation.\u201dMr. Cornwell called her comments \u201cout of bounds,\u201d adding, \u201cI\u2019m not interested in a prosecutor expressing an opinion based on a personal moral compass.\u201d The university, after initially speaking with The Times, recently stopped doing so. A university spokeswoman, Browning Brooks, said she could not discuss specific cases because of privacy laws but issued a statement, saying that the university\u2019s \u201ccode of conduct process has worked well for the vast majority of sexual assault cases\u201d and has \u201cprovided victims with the emotional and procedural help they need.\u201d On Feb. 13, before the university stopped granting interviews, Rachel Bukanc, an assistant dean who oversees student conduct issues, said she knew of no student who had secretly videotaped sex. After The Times questioned that response, the university began an inquiry and recently charged Mr. Casher with a student-code violation for taking the video. Mr. Darby has also been cited in connection with the episode.It would be difficult to overstate the importance of football to Florida State and its hometown. In Tallahassee, rooting for the Seminoles is a matter of identity and economy. The 2013 championship season generated millions of dollars for the athletic department and city businesses, and favorable publicity beyond measure.Patricia A. Carroll, a lawyer for Mr. Winston\u2019s accuser, said the police investigator who handled the case, Scott Angulo, told her that because Tallahassee was a big football town, her client would be \u201craked over the coals\u201d if she pursued the case. Officer Angulo has done private security work for the Seminole Boosters, a nonprofit organization, with nearly $150 million in assets, that is the primary financier of Florida State athletics, according to records and a lawyer for the boosters. It also paid roughly a quarter of the $602,000 salary of the university president, Eric Barron, who was recently named president of Penn State. The Tallahassee police declined to make Officer Angulo available for an interview, but his report states that he suspended the investigation because the accuser was uncooperative, which she denies. The department issued a statement, saying that police reports in the Winston case \u201cdocument that our department took the case seriously, processed evidence and conducted a thorough investigation based on information available when the case was reported.\u201d The case came at a time of turmoil for the Tallahassee police. In March 2013, a grand jury investigating police misconduct in an unrelated matter called police supervision \u201ccareless, uncaring, cavalier and incompetent.\u201d The grand jury said supervisory deficiencies were so deeply ingrained that the city police, which has more than 350 sworn officers, should merge with the sheriff\u2019s department, with the sheriff assuming overall control. Late last year, Mr. Winston\u2019s accuser and another Florida State student filed internal-affairs complaints, charging that Tallahassee police officers had investigated them, rather than the accused, and then prematurely dropped their cases. \u201cMy attorney\u2019s repeated calls to Tallahassee Police Department prove that I had not dropped the case,\u201d Mr. Winston\u2019s accuser wrote in her Dec. 19 complaint. Two days earlier, the other student had written, \u201cWhy did the detective insist my case was closed and refused to answer calls and emails?\u201d She added, \u201cI am SO ANGRY!\u201d Both complaints were quickly dismissed.Purgatory at Potbelly\u2019sPotbelly\u2019s is a classic campus bar: big and boisterous, a place to drink, dance and mingle inside or at a tiki bar outside. A Thursday tradition, Purgatory at Potbelly\u2019s, allows students to drink all the alcohol they want for $10 from 9 p.m. to midnight. On Purgatory Thursday, Dec. 6, 2012, Mr. Winston\u2019s accuser, who at 19 could not legally buy alcohol, shared at least five mixed drinks with friends, according to police records. At one point, a man she did not know grabbed her arm, pulled her close and introduced himself as Chris, a football player. He said he was looking for his roommate, and when he requested her phone number, she gave it to him. She did not recall seeing him again that night.The woman did not appear drunk, her friends said. But after a stranger gave her a drink, she recounted, her memory became hazy and fragmented. Soon, she found herself in a taxi with three unfamiliar men, all of whom turned out to be Florida State football players. Jameis Winston was one of them. A redshirt freshman quarterback, 6 feet 4 inches and 235 pounds, Mr. Winston had been a prize recruit, well-known in football circles but not yet a widely recognizable name.Because of the young, combustible clientele, Potbelly\u2019s protects itself by operating more than 30 security cameras. If something untoward happens, the cameras are there to record it. They were in position to fill in the blanks from that evening, recording how the woman came to leave without her friends, her general behavior and the face of the man who gave her the final drink. Taxi records also contained a footprint for investigators to follow: The woman recalled that someone in the car swiped a Florida State student identification card to get a discounted fare.After partially blacking out, the woman said, she found herself in an apartment with a man on top of her, sexually assaulting her. She said she tried unsuccessfully to push him away, but he pinned down her arms. Meanwhile, according to her account, another man walked in and told her assailant to stop. He did not. Instead, she said, he carried her into the bathroom, locked the door and continued his assault. Afterward, the woman told investigators, the man put her on a bed, dressed her and drove her on a scooter to an intersection near her dormitory and dropped her off. Upon returning to her room, she posted a plea online for someone to call her. Two friends did. One was Jenna Weisberg, another Florida State student. \u201cI was awake and I called her and she was hysterically crying,\u201d Ms. Weisberg said. \u201c\u00a0\u2018I think I just got raped,\u2019\u00a0\u201d she recalled her saying. Ms. Weisberg drove immediately to the friend\u2019s dorm. Ms. Weisberg said her friend was reluctant to call the police because she did not \u201cwant anybody to be mad at her.\u201d Eventually she relented, and at 3:22 a.m., Ms. Weisberg called 911.A campus police officer responded, listened to the accuser\u2019s account and then drove her to the hospital for a sexual assault examination. Because the woman believed the encounter occurred off campus, a city police officer, Clayton Fallis, interviewed her next. Soon, Officer Angulo, an investigator with the special victims unit who joined the force in 2002, arrived at the hospital and took over the case. Again the woman began to recount what had happened, until the investigator, seeing she was tired, told her to go home and come to Police Headquarters later in the day. She returned, accompanied by a friend, Monique Kessler, who was with her at Potbelly\u2019s, and they recounted what they had seen and heard, including the encounter with Chris, the football player. Officer Angulo had three solid leads to identify the suspect: the name Chris, the bar\u2019s security cameras and the cab where a student identification card had been used. What the investigator did next \u2014 or did not do \u2014 would later confound prosecutors and muddied the outcome of the case. An Inquiry Begins, and EndsOfficer Angulo\u2019s investigation was halting at best. His first report, filed more than two months after the encounter, includes no mention of trying to find Chris or looking at Potbelly\u2019s videotapes.Not only would Chris have been easy to find, but the police already had an investigative file that identified Chris Casher as Mr. Winston\u2019s roommate. A little more than a week before the sexual encounter, the Tallahassee police had interviewed both men in connection with 13 damaged windows at their off-campus apartment complex, all caused by football players engaging in a long-running BB gun battle. The Florida State athletic department promised that the $4,000 in damages would be paid, and no charges were filed. Officer Angulo did contact the cab company, without success. \u201cThe GPS units on the vehicles are not precise enough to eliminate enough cabs to focus the search,\u201d he wrote. He then asked the cab company to email all drivers who had worked that night, with \u201cthe demographics of the passengers and the pickup location.\u201d No one responded, and there is no indication that he attempted to interview drivers. Officer Angulo, who had told his superiors that he \u201chad no real leads,\u201d suddenly got a big one on Jan. 10, a little more than a month after the encounter. As a new semester was beginning, the accuser called to say she had identified the suspect \u2014 Jameis Winston \u2014 after seeing him in class and hearing his name called out. Again, Officer Angulo hesitated. Nearly two weeks passed before his backup investigator contacted Mr. Winston \u2014 by telephone, records show. \u201cWinston stated he had baseball practice but would call back later to set a time,\u201d Officer Angulo wrote. The police did get a response \u2014 from Mr. Winston\u2019s lawyer, Timothy Jansen, who said his client would not be speaking to anyone.With Mr. Winston identified, the next logical step would have been to quickly obtain his DNA. Officer Angulo decided against it. Ms. Carroll, the accuser\u2019s lawyer, said the officer told her that testing Mr. Winston\u2019s DNA might generate publicity. \u201cI specifically asked and he refused,\u201d Ms. Carroll said. Officer Angulo concluded his six-page report by saying: \u201cThis case is being suspended at this time due to a lack of cooperation from the victim. If the victim decides to press charges, the case will be pursued.\u201dTwo parts of that statement struck Ms. Carroll as strange. The officer, she said, never informed her client that he had suspended his investigation, and her client never said she would not cooperate. She said that while her client was indeed concerned about the prospect of pressing her case against a star-in-waiting, \u201cat no time did we call him and tell him we don\u2019t want you to do an investigation.\u201d Her client, she added, simply wanted more information before deciding what to do. Such reluctance should not keep the police from investigating, according to Ms. Cappleman of the prosecutor\u2019s office. \u201cIt makes the most sense to me, if somebody comes in to report a violent crime, investigate it, and we\u2019ll talk about what to do with it after we\u2019ve collected the evidence and have the most thorough picture,\u201d she said. If an accuser later decides she does not want a trial, Ms. Cappleman added, her office might offer a suspect a better plea deal.Officer Angulo\u2019s investigation apparently stirred no concern within his department. His superior officer signed off on his work, records show. In the weeks that followed, not knowing the investigation had been suspended, Ms. Carroll called the police periodically to see if lab tests had come back. Sometimes, her calls were returned, she said, but not always. A Deputy\u2019s DaughterEarly last October, a 19-year-old Florida State student was studying on a Saturday night while her roommates went drinking. She said they returned drunk, and a roommate\u2019s former boyfriend, also a student, raped her in her room. The student reported the encounter to the Tallahassee police. The episode had nothing to do with Mr. Winston, but it, too, raised questions about how the city police deal with rape accusations. The police response was so inappropriate, according to the father, that later on, in a complaint filed with the police, he compared it to the Winston inquiry, which had recently drawn criticism in the news media. The father, a part-time deputy sheriff in another county, said he was away on business when he called his daughter and found her crying and confused. With prodding, she disclosed that she had just spoken to the police about \u201ca situation,\u201d but would say no more. An officer had told her that \u201cit might be better not to inform me,\u201d her father said.Alarmed, he asked his wife to call. She did, and their daughter said she had been raped. The mother and a family friend, also a law enforcement officer, immediately drove more than two hours to Tallahassee. They found the daughter with what appeared to be choke marks on her neck. According to the father, a Tallahassee police officer named Christopher Pate characterized the young woman as confused and having had a hard time communicating. \u201cWhy was I not given an advocate to speak with?\u201d his daughter said in a complaint she filed later with the police. \u201cI was raped and was stressed and scared.\u201dIn a report, Officer Pate said he had offered the woman \u201cmany different avenues of help (victim advocate, female officer etc.). She refused them all.\u201d Rape crisis counselors, while not speaking specifically about this case, say traumatized victims often experience memory problems. \u201cVictims themselves feel like they are losing their minds when they can\u2019t remember, when they remember fragments that don\u2019t seem to connect up,\u201d said Meg Baldwin, executive director of the Tallahassee-based Refuge House, a haven for victims of domestic violence and rape. \u201cThe interpretation so often is, well, she\u2019s lying, she\u2019s in any event an unreliable witness who won\u2019t be believed.\u201d Officer Pate\u2019s blunt interviewing style did not help, the student said. \u201cThe first thing he asked me,\u201d she recounted, \u201cwas if I was sure this was rape or if I just didn\u2019t want a baby or wanted the morning after pill.\u201d He also made comments, she said, \u201clike, \u2018Are you sure you want to file a report? It will be very awkward, especially for a female.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIn his complaint to the police, the father wrote that Officer Pate had suggested that an investigation \u201cwould be futile, as \u2018this kind of stuff happens all the time here.\u2019\u00a0\u201d The family also said the police had focused more on the accuser than on the accused. \u201cFrom my perspective, T.P.D. demonstrated a poor initial response, poor investigative techniques and perhaps most importantly failed to support the victim of a violent crime,\u201d the father said. Unlike in the Winston case, the police did ask prosecutors to review the evidence, but they declined to bring charges because statements from the roommates conflicted with the accuser\u2019s account. After receiving the family\u2019s request for an internal affairs investigation, the police found no basis for punishment. \u201cWhile no policy violation was identified, Officer Pate was counseled on the public perception of officer actions and speech during investigations,\u201d according to police documents. The department declined to make the officer available for an interview. The woman, an A student, dropped out of school, left the city and underwent therapy for extreme depression, according to the family. \u201cGoing to F.S.U. had been a longtime dream for her,\u201d her mother said.The News BreaksIt was Wednesday of homecoming week last year and Florida State, ranked No. 2 in the nation with a 9-0 record, was preparing to play Syracuse. Mr. Winston, described by teammates as both playful and intense, had already thrown 26 touchdown passes, amassing 2,661 passing yards with a completion percentage just south of 70 percent. After his first game, an ESPN draft expert had identified him as a legitimate No. 1 choice in the 2015 N.F.L. draft. If Florida State was going to ascend to the national championship game on Jan. 6, it would do so on the arm and poise of Jameis Winston. The Heisman voting was but a month away, and his crowning as America\u2019s best college football player appeared all but certain. Then, suddenly, that glorious vision began to go out of focus. On Nov. 13, the Tallahassee police, responding to a public-records request from The Tampa Bay Times, released documents on the sexual assault case, setting off a frenzied scramble in the news media and prosecutor\u2019s office to learn what had happened. As the news broke, and before investigators could talk to them, Mr. Winston\u2019s lawyer had the two witnesses, Mr. Casher and Mr. Darby, submit affidavits attesting to their recollection of that now-distant night. They gave similar accounts: A blond woman who was not intoxicated willingly left the bar with the three football players, they said, and joined Mr. Winston in his room. Because the door was broken and would not close, they looked in and saw the woman giving the quarterback oral sex. At one point, Mr. Casher said, he entered the room, but the woman told him to leave, got up to turn off the light and then tried to close the door. At no time, both men said, did she appear to be an unwilling participant. (The men did not respond to phone messages, conveyed through university officials, seeking comment.) Mr. Meggs immediately directed his staff to reinvestigate the case. In the recent interview, Mr. Meggs said he was surprised that the police had not quickly found Mr. Casher. \u201cHow long does it take to identify a freshman football player \u2014 about 10, 15, 16 seconds?\u201d he asked, adding, \u201cAnybody that looked at this case would say you get a report at 2 in the morning, by noon you could have had the defendant identified and talked to.\u201dWhy Officer Angulo had not asked to see the Potbelly\u2019s security video is unknown. A Times review of sexual assault complaints handled by the campus police last year found that in one case, officers asked for the Potbelly\u2019s video when they were trying to identify a suspected assailant who had been seen at the bar. As for not finding the taxi driver, \u201cI am convinced that we would have identified the cabdriver that night and had an interview with him,\u201d Mr. Meggs said. \u201cDon\u2019t know what we would have learned, but we would have learned the truth. I am also convinced that had it been done properly, we would have had the video from Potbelly\u2019s.\u201dBy the time the prosecutor asked for that video, the tape had long since been recycled. Unlike the police, prosecutors said they interviewed every cabdriver they could find who had worked that night, but they turned up no new information. Mr. Meggs said that while his investigators probably spoke to the driver they were seeking, \u201cat 11 months later, maybe he didn\u2019t remember, maybe he didn\u2019t want to remember.\u201dMr. Meggs said he was shocked that the police investigator\u2019s first attempt to contact Mr. Winston was by telephone. \u201cHe says, \u2018I have baseball practice, I\u2019ll get with you later,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Meggs said. That call allowed Mr. Winston to hire a lawyer who told him not to talk.\u201cIt\u2019s insane to call a suspect on the phone,\u201d Mr. Meggs said. \u201cFirst off, you don\u2019t know who you are talking to.\u201d He said he would have gone straight to the baseball field. \u201cIf you walked up to Jameis Winston in the middle of baseball practice and said, \u2018Come here, son, I need to talk to you,\u2019 he would have said, \u2018Yes, sir.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Meggs added: \u201cHe\u2019s not in custody, you don\u2019t have to read him his rights. He might have said, \u2018I didn\u2019t have sex that night.\u2019\u00a0\u201dOnly after the prosecutor took over the case did the authorities obtain Mr. Winston\u2019s DNA. It was a match to DNA found on the accuser\u2019s clothing. Belatedly, Officer Angulo and his backup were asked to conduct a crucial interview \u2014 to question Mr. Casher about the events of Dec. 7, 2012. Mr. Casher made a startling admission: he had secretly videotaped part of the sexual encounter through the partly opened bedroom door, and deleted the video from his phone a couple of days later. Had the police found him quickly, they might have obtained that video. Mr. Casher had never mentioned the video in the affidavit he submitted with the help of Mr. Winston\u2019s lawyer. Even so, officers did not ask why he had omitted that important fact, why he had deleted the video or whether he had shared it with anyone. And though Mr. Casher said he had a new phone, the officers did not ask what he did with the old one. Neither the police nor the prosecutor\u2019s office subpoenaed the phone records of Mr. Casher, Mr. Darby or Mr. Winston \u2014 even though they investigated all electronic communications to and from the accuser around the time of the sexual encounter. The failure to seek similar electronic communications from the three football players surprised one former assistant state attorney, who prosecuted a Florida State football player on a rape charge a decade ago. \u201cWhy that was done, I don\u2019t really know the answer to that,\u201d said the former prosecutor, Adam Ruiz. \u201cTo me, that\u2019s a no-brainer.\u201dMr. Ruiz said his children, aged 7 to 21, all had iPhones, and even for something as mundane as rain: \u201cYou\u2019re texting 30 people about it. I can\u2019t imagine there would not have been something coming off that cellphone after the incident.\u201dThree weeks after it began, with evidence lost and memories faded, the state attorney\u2019s investigation was over.\u201cI have personal concerns about what happened in that room that night,\u201d Ms. Cappleman said, \u201cbut that\u2019s completely separate from whether I\u2019m able to prove a crime occurred.\u201d The University\u2019s RoleThe news that Mr. Winston had been accused of rape moved through campus like an electric charge. On social media, the discussion quickly lost any semblance of civility, prompting one female student to send an email expressing her anger to Mary Coburn, vice president for student affairs.\u201cAll day every day I am bombarded with messages of hatred for the alleged victim,\u201d the woman wrote. \u201cI am sad and ashamed to be part of a student body that is quick to support a man who is accused of sexual assault, simply because he is a good football player, and even quicker to condemn the alleged victim of the crime as a liar.\u201dMs. Coburn replied: \u201cI agree with you and have been thinking about how we address the ugliness that has been circulating.\u201d She promised to gather a group of students in January to discuss the problem. The athletic department had known early on that Mr. Winston had been accused of a serious crime. According to an internal Tallahassee police email on Jan. 23, 2013, one officer wrote that Officer Angulo\u2019s backup on the case \u201creceived a call from the Athletic Directors Assistant inquiring about the case.\u201dThis knowledge should have set off an inquiry by the university. According to federal rules, any athletic department official who learns of possible sexual misconduct is required to pass it on to school administrators. Florida State declined to respond when asked if top officials, including the university president, had been informed of the encounter.\u201cWhy did the school not even attempt to investigate the matter until after the football season?\u201d said John Clune, another lawyer for the accuser. His client filed a complaint with the civil rights office of the federal Department of Education, and the agency recently agreed to examine whether Florida State properly responds to sexual violence complaints. The inquiry was first reported by USA Today. It was not just the Winston case that was causing concern on campus. In January, the mother of a student who said she had been sexually battered at a fraternity the previous April contacted the campus police asking why the university \u201cdoesn\u2019t do more to protect women from rape,\u201d records show. The police response was to inform the mother of a self-defense class for students.That did not satisfy the mother, who told an officer, \u201cThe university should take a harder stand on the men who are identified as having committed rapes.\u201d According to the campus police, the student had said she did not want officers to investigate the case.Determining the extent of the problem is difficult, because so many students are reluctant to report sexual assaults. President Obama, in announcing the creation of a task force earlier this year to protect students from sexual assault, cited surveys showing that one in five women is a victim of \u201cattempted or completed sexual violence\u201d while in college. Last year, 28 Florida State students received forensic exams after suspected sexual assaults, according to Refuge House, which is not affiliated with the university. Seven occurred on campus and 17 off campus; in four cases the location was not clear. \u201cI\u2019d like to see a higher reporting rate so that we can address the problem,\u201d said Ms. Cappleman of the state attorney\u2019s office. \u201cA lot of these cases go unreported, so having a higher reporting rate will lead to a higher success rate of prosecution and hopefully a deterring effect.\u201dIf cases are reported, the university is obligated to investigate, regardless of what the police do. According to the federal Education Department\u2019s civil rights office, \u201ca school that knows, or reasonably should know\u201d about sexual harassment, including rape, \u201cmust promptly investigate to determine what occurred and then take appropriate steps to resolve the situation.\u201d Universities must also inform the federal government of reported sexual assaults on their property or in the immediate vicinity. Florida State has not yet reported its 2013 sexual assault numbers, but in the three previous years it reported four, five and five. Those numbers place Florida State in the lower half nationwide of similar-size public universities, according to federal data analyzed by The Times. The number of reported rapes can be affected by the percentage of students who live off campus. Ms. Baldwin, the Refuge House director, said accusers report that the university\u2019s internal complaint system tends to bury their experience rather than address it responsibly. \u201cWhen I compare F.S.U. with other universities within the last five years that have done a great deal to address this issue, I\u2019m not seeing that level of energy here,\u201d said Ms. Baldwin, a former Florida State law professor.In its statement, the university said that, in complying with federal rules, \u201cThe need to investigate possible harassment must be balanced against the rights of and consent from the complainant.\u201d A decade before the Winston case, the inspector general found that Florida State had violated its policy when the athletic department failed to inform the campus police of a rape accusation against one of its standout football players. Mr. Ruiz, the former prosecutor who handled the case for the state attorney\u2019s office, recalled that the coach at the time, the revered Bobby Bowden, attempted to convince him that a crime had not occurred. A jury eventually acquitted the player. \u201cI learned quickly what football meant in the South,\u201d said Mr. Ruiz, who grew up in New York State. \u201cClearly, it meant a lot. And with respect to this case I learned that keeping players on the field was a priority.\u201dKitty Bennett, Alain Delaqu\u00e9ri\u00e8re and Ramsey Merritt contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Crimea, Russia Showcases a Rebooted Army", "Date": "2014-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPEREVALNOYE, Crimea \u2014 The soldiers guarding the entrances to the surrounded Ukrainian military base here just south of the capital, Simferopol, had little in common with their predecessors from past Russian military actions.Lean and fit, few if any seemed to be conscripts. Their uniforms were crisp and neat, and their new helmets were bedecked with tinted safety goggles. They were sober.And there was another indicator of an army undergoing an upgrade: compact encrypted radio units distributed at the small-unit level, including for soldiers on such routine duty as guard shifts beside machine-gun trucks. The radios are a telltale sign of a sweeping modernization effort undertaken five years ago by Vladimir V. Putin that has revitalized Russia\u2019s conventional military abilities, frightening some of its former vassal states in Eastern Europe and forcing NATO to re-evaluate its longstanding view of post-Soviet Russia as a nuclear power with limited ground muscle.Across Crimea in the past several weeks, a sleek new vanguard of the Russian military has been on display, with forces whose mobility, equipment and behavior were sharply different from those of the Russian forces seen in the brief war in Georgia in 2008 or throughout the North Caucasus over nearly two decades of conflict with Muslim separatists.Past Russian military actions have often showcased an army suffering from a poor state of discipline and supply, its ranks filled mostly with the conscripts who had not managed to buy deferments or otherwise evade military service. Public drunkenness was common, as were tactical indecisiveness and soldiers who often looked as if they could not run a mile, much less swiftly.Not so in Crimea. After a Kremlin campaign to overhaul the military, including improvements in training and equipment and, notably, large increases in pay, the results could be seen in the field. They were evident not only in the demeanor of the Russian soldiers but also in the speed with which they overwhelmed Crimea with minimal violence.The troops in Crimea may be the elite of the new Russian military. But the Kremlin\u2019s investment, analysts said, has revived the military, which has now shown that it can field a competent and even formidable force, and both guard the nation and project power to neighboring states.\u201cThe development of Russian armed forces is going in two big trends, first strengthening of strategic nuclear forces, giving a guarantee that no one country in this world will try to attack Russia,\u201d said Aleksandr Golts, an independent military analyst in Moscow.\u201cSecond, the development of these rapid deployment forces,\u201d he said, \u201cto deal with any kind of local conflict, such as the war against Georgia, or this operation in Ukraine or anywhere.\u201d\u201cAs a result of these reforms,\u201d Mr. Golts added, \u201cRussia now has absolute superiority over any country in the post-Soviet space.\u201dOne Western official who analyzes military forces in the region said the differences from the past were striking. \u201cIt does seem to us that they are much more professional this time around,\u201d the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. \u201cIt\u2019s impressive.\u201dThe transformation of the armed forces has been a personal priority of Mr. Putin, who as prime minister from 2009 to 2012 and more recently in his return to the presidency has overseen billions of dollars in new military expenditures. The military was one of the few areas of the Russian budget to receive big spending increases, along with preparations for the Sochi Olympics, the 2018 World Cup and improvements to the railroad system, which is also a military asset.Since the start of 2012, salaries for most military personnel have roughly tripled, to between $700 and $1,150 a month for privates and sergeants \u2014 a respectable amount in Russian terms. The Kremlin has also expanded housing and education benefits.In a speech to military officers in February shortly after the raises were enacted, Mr. Putin declared, \u201cI have always believed that military servicemen should be paid, as has always been the case in Russia, by the way, even more than skilled specialists in the sphere of economics or administration or other civilian sectors.\u201dMr. Putin has been unapologetic. He has repeatedly emphasized that rebuilding the military is crucial to Russia\u2019s future.At his direction, a comprehensive, multiagency military strategy was developed for the first time, with ambitious goals that included bringing all units to permanent combat readiness and upgrading weapons systems.As commander in chief, Mr. Putin has also presided over unprecedented training exercises, including what the Kremlin billed as the largest peacetime mobilization ever \u2014 about 160,000 troops, officials said, in Russia\u2019s Far East in the summer of 2013 \u2014 and an array of drills in western Russia to prepare for potential threats along the borders with Europe and the Caucasus.The lightning-quick seizing of strategic installations and the surrounding of military bases in Crimea, including the base here in Perevalnoye, provided a clear show of the new Russian military\u2019s capabilities.It was a sharp contrast to the brief war with Georgia in 2008, when Russia overwhelmed its much smaller foe on a tiny patch of ground, but also revealed the sorry state of its own forces \u2014 problems that stretched back to the two military campaigns in Chechnya. (In Georgia, Russian military vehicles were commonly seen broken down on the roads, with cursing soldiers beside them.)\u201cFirst of all, there were communications problems, because the communication is the basis of troop management,\u201d said Mikhail Khodaryonok, editor in chief of Military-Industrial Courier, a weekly newspaper focused on the Russian armed forces.\u201cProblems with communications were so obvious that sharp measures were taken to improve all types of communications, including the confidential communication,\u201d Mr. Khodaryonok said.The upgrade was visible down to the smallest unit levels in Crimea. Here at Perevalnoye, many soldiers on guard duty wore new push-to-talk encrypted radios \u2014 a piece of equipment long used by American soldiers but only recently provided to conventional Russian units.The Western official said the wide distribution of the encrypted radios suggested more than procurement. It might also mean that Russian noncommissioned officers were exercising more tactical latitude and decision-making, a deeper type of overhaul that could make Russian units nimbler and more effective.\u201cThat is a rather empowering device for the Russian Army,\u201d the official said.The radios were one part of a broad element of Mr. Putin\u2019s military overhaul: the replacement of equipment carried by individual soldiers. Known as the Ratnik program \u2014 from the Russian word for warrior \u2014 the upgrade includes new helmets, flak jackets with bulletproof plates, ballistic goggles, kneepads, uniforms, and communications and navigation equipment, as well as thermal and night-vision sights for firearms.Apparently modeled after the equipment upgrades visible on Western soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq for more than a decade, the Ratnik kit has not yet been fully fielded. But many of its signature components were evident in Crimea, including the uniforms, helmets, goggles, flak jackets and kneepads.Out on the roads, Russian forces could also be seen deploying electronic-warfare platforms, including the new Tigr-M and the R-330Zh jamming station, which can block GPS and satellite telephone signals.Like many of the Russian military vehicles visible in the crisis, these vehicles contrasted with those seen in Georgia or the North Caucasus in that they had fresh paint jobs and new tires, and seemed to be in an excellent state of repair.While analysts said that there was now better equipment and training throughout the Russian military, some cautioned against drawing too broad a conclusion based on the forces in Crimea, many of which were part of elite units that were among the first to benefit from the overhaul.\u201cIt is certainly a step up from where they were in 2008, but how far of a step up we don\u2019t know yet,\u201d said Dmitry Gorenburg, a senior analyst with the Center for Naval Analyses, a Virginia-based research group financed by the United States government. \u201cIs the Russian military now a conventional threat to NATO? I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that much of an improvement yet. It could be down the road.\u201dMr. Gorenburg noted that the Russian troops had faced no opposition, and that there had been no fighting. \u201cEssentially they were taking over facilities and buildings from troops that had been given no orders or who had been given orders not to resist,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was no actual combat.\u201dMr. Khodaryonok, the editor of Military-Industrial Courier, said it would be a while before the modernization campaign spreads to all the armed forces. Nevertheless, he said, the military had made extraordinary strides.\u201cEverything is in order,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no more such shame as broken tanks and A.P.C.\u2019s on the road and outdated weaponry.\u201dMore important, he said, the military was able to make it all work. \u201cThe biggest achievement, in my opinion, is how the management was organized,\u201d he said. \u201cThe operation\u2019s cover, its quickness and suddenness. There were no data leaks.\u201d\u201cThe epoch of decay has been fully overcome,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the armed forces of the country are on the rise.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Internet Choice Will Be Crucial Battlefield in Big Cable Merger", "Date": "2014-04-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Since announcing plans to take over Time Warner Cable two months ago, Comcast has steadily beat the drum with one big message: The merger will not limit consumers\u2019 choice in picking a cable television or high-speed Internet service provider.Comcast is expected to repeat this message twice this week \u2014 on Wednesday during the first Senate hearings on the $45 billion deal, and again in legal filings it is expected to give to the two government agencies reviewing the merger.But in highlighting how the two companies do not compete with each another in any metropolitan market, Comcast has exposed a potential weakness in its argument, legal experts say. The lack of overlap in cable television is the legacy of government-granted local monopolies. But the government never granted monopolies in the unregulated, highly lucrative business of high-speed Internet service \u2014 an area where the two companies face little to no competition.As a result, regulators are likely to focus as much on how the merger will affect the market for high-speed Internet, also known as broadband, as how it will affect cable TV service.The proposed takeover will come under scrutiny on Wednesday by the Senate Judiciary Committee, which oversees antitrust agencies. Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who is chairman of the committee, has indicated that broadband will play a crucial role in its investigation.The questions about broadband competition also will loom large this week if Comcast, as expected, lays out its defense of the merger in filings with the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission. The merger requires approval of both agencies. The Justice Department looks solely at whether the merger violates antitrust laws, and it faces the burden of proof.But the F.C.C. has a broader mandate in examining whether the merger serves \u201cthe public interest.\u201d In the F.C.C. inquiry, the burden is on Comcast to prove its deal serves the public interest. The company is expected to file its public interest statement\u00a0on Tuesday.Comcast has said it will lessen the merger\u2019s impact on cable television competition by keeping its share of the national cable market at no more than 30 percent. That will require it to divest itself of some of Time Warner Cable\u2019s customers.But Comcast\u2019s share of the market for high-speed Internet is bigger than its share of the cable market \u2014 at least 40 percent, the company says. Critics of the merger say that if only truly high-speed Internet service is considered, meaning data transmission rates of 25 megabits per second or more, its share tops 50 percent.As consumers steadily drop their cable subscriptions in favor of services like Netflix, Amazon and YouTube to stream movies and TV shows through the Internet, high-speed Internet service is expected to become the more important business.\u201cBroadband is the faster-growing competitor to traditional video services,\u201d said Gene Kimmelman, chief executive of Public Knowledge, a nonprofit group that opposes the merger.Comcast, however, might have provided evidence that it faces little competition in high-speed Internet in dozens of F.C.C. petitions it filed over the last few years seeking to get out from under local cable rate regulation.Cable rates cannot be regulated if a company proves there is \u201ceffective competition\u201d in a market. A market is judged to be competitive if at least two companies each offer service to 50 percent of the households in the area, and if the market share of all providers, except the largest, is at least 15 percent.In the petitions, Comcast argued that the nation\u2019s two satellite television companies, DirecTV and Dish Network, meet those requirements in many markets by accounting for at least 15 percent of television service. While a few markets also have telecoms, usually AT&T or Verizon, competing to provide television service, most of the petitions cite only the satellite companies as rivals.But satellite companies do not offer high-speed Internet service, as the technology prevents it. The time required for a television signal to travel to a satellite and back to Earth are significant enough to create untenable delays.That means that in those markets, Comcast is usually the only provider of high-speed broadband using a cable modem \u2014 the fastest service going, next to fiber optic cable, which is not widely available in the United States.Comcast said those F.C.C. filings did not refer to broadband speeds directly and said it did face competition in most markets from other broadband providers. \u201cIn most of those areas, DSL is available\u201d from the local phone company, and wireless broadband is available through mobile phone companies, said Sena Fitzmaurice, a spokeswoman for Comcast.But DSL service, which is delivered over traditional copper phone lines, does not measure up to the speeds of cable Internet service. The most recent F.C.C. figures available, from mid-2012, show that only 8 percent of DSL connections in the United States transmit at a speed of at least 10 megabits per second. Seventy percent of cable modem service travels that fast.All of that brings into focus another debate that is expected during consideration of the merger: Just what qualifies as high-speed Internet, or broadband, service?The F.C.C. has a formal definition: broadband that moves at 3 megabits per second or faster. But that speed is woefully inadequate for many sites that stream video. Many of the newest generation of mobile broadband services can transmit data at up to 8 megabits per second, but that is still below the average cable modem speed.In that respect, Comcast says it is a victim of its success. It has spent heavily to build its capacity and offer customers better Internet service. \u201cPeople who are critics of us,\u201d Ms. Fitzmaurice said, \u201ccan\u2019t decide that now that we\u2019re offering higher speeds, competition from DSL doesn\u2019t exist.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Race for a Top Job in Europe Hits the Road", "Date": "2014-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNIVELLES, Belgium \u2014 Jean-Claude Juncker, the former prime minister of Luxembourg who helped steer Europe through its currency crisis, sought to strengthen his bid to become the next president of the European Commission this week by taking to the road in an American-style campaign tour bus.Mr. Juncker\u2019s first stops on Tuesday were Nivelles, a city in French-speaking Wallonia, and Antwerp, the biggest city in Flanders, where he toured small businesses and met members of parties affiliated with the center-right European People\u2019s Party. The party hopes to win a majority in landmark elections next month to the European Parliament that, in a potentially transformative step for democracy in Europe, could determine the leadership of the union\u2019s powerful policy-making arm.\u201cIt\u2019s the first time that political families have top candidates, and these top candidates have to travel throughout Europe,\u201d Mr. Juncker said on the inaugural bus journey. Mr. Juncker said he also wanted \u201cto bridge this gap between North and South,\u201d referring to the legacy of bitterness between the wealthier members of the union, including Germany, and less-prosperous members like Greece after a bruising sovereign-debt crisis.The role of the commission includes negotiating overseas treaties like plans for a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the United States. The commission also has the power to impose huge penalties directly on companies for breaking antitrust laws. That led to fines on Microsoft totaling 1.7 billion euros during the past decade.Mr. Juncker, 59, is something of an establishment figure in Europe. He spent nearly 19 years in charge of Luxembourg, a moneyed and sedate nation, and was president of the group of finance ministers for the euro zone over the course of the European debt crisis.Although Mr. Juncker enhanced his reputation for consensual leadership while leading the so-called Eurogroup of ministers, he still presided over highly divisive decisions that forced countries like Ireland, Greece, Portugal and Cyprus to swallow the bitter medicine of austerity. He also developed a curmudgeonly reputation by griping about his aching kidney stones during marathon negotiations with finance ministers and rebuffing reporters with gnomic explanations in German or Luxembourgish.Adding to the sense that Mr. Juncker hails from a different era, he likes to pause for cigarette breaks and he greeted at least one women on his staff with a kiss to the hand in Tuesday morning.By emblazoning the exterior of his bus with his picture and his Twitter handle, Mr. Juncker\u2019s team is seeking to inject his bid with a dose of youthful razzle-dazzle for an unprecedented campaign that, at heart, is about Europeanizing politics that have remained stubbornly national more than a half-century since the building blocks for the union were laid after the Second World War.Allowing the Parliament a leading role in determining who runs the commission \u2014 a vast bureaucracy that proposes European Union laws on everything from bankers\u2019 bonuses to renewable energy \u2014 represents \u201ca democratic evolution and perhaps a revolution,\u201d said David Earnshaw, the chief executive based in Brussels for Burson-Marsteller, a public affairs company closely tracking the elections. \u201cThat is why this campaign is so very important and why the candidates must get beyond Brussels.\u201dMr. Juncker\u2019s bus left from the European People\u2019s Party\u2019s headquarters, whose digital \u201cwar room\u201d has dozens of twentysomethings from affiliated political parties across Europe working around the clock to post campaign updates on social media.\u201cIt\u2019s the first time we\u2019re doing this sort of digital campaign,\u201d said Anne Schmitz, 23, a Dutch member of Mr. Juncker\u2019s team and a member of her country\u2019s Christian Democratic Appeal. \u201cWe\u2019re going out to the people and we\u2019re going to tell our story.\u201dMr. Juncker can also can boast support from some Greeks, including Jerry Zagoritis, 26, another member of the digital war room and a member of the New Democracy party led by Prime Minister Antonis Samaras. Rather than inflicting painful wounds to the country, he said, Mr. Juncker \u201chelped the Greek economy not to collapse.\u201dMr. Juncker\u2019s campaign \u2014 and that of his main rival, Martin Schulz, the current president of the European Parliament and the top candidate of the Party of European Socialists \u2014 is partly a result of the Lisbon Treaty, which was agreed to in 2009 following the last parliamentary elections, held every five years.The treaty states that a majority of government leaders must nominate a candidate, whom the European Parliament then elects as president, also by a majority. In making their choice, government leaders must take \u201cinto account\u201d the result of the election when nominating their candidate. But if Mr. Juncker\u2019s party wins more seats than Mr. Schulz\u2019s during the May 22-25 ballot, government leaders could still try to block his nomination and select their own candidate as part of complex horse-trading for top jobs. Also up for grabs after the election are the presidency of the European Council, which represents the national leaders, and the post of foreign policy chief for the bloc.On Tuesday, Mr. Juncker insisted that either he or Mr. Schulz must be chosen for the commission. Any other result \u201cwould open a major crisis in Europe\u201d and for the \u201cdemocratic legitimacy\u201d for the union, he warned.Mr. Juncker has already sought to distinguish himself from his Socialist rival by opposing French efforts to exceed European Union deficit limits, by supporting German skepticism about sharing European debt, and by opposing a faster process for admitting Turkey to the union. For now, at least, Mr. Juncker\u2019s stances on austerity and his caution over enlargement suit other conservative leaders, like Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who are seeking to ensure a counterweight to the campaign by the socialists led by Mr. Schulz.Mr. Juncker is also preferable to many business leaders, who regard a victory by the socialists as a recipe for more, rather than less, regulation from Brussels and as potentially damaging to efforts at striking a trans-Atlantic trade accord with the United States.Business leaders are already rattled at the prospect of insurgent parties from the far right and far left winning more seats than ever before, eroding the ability of the European People\u2019s Party to push through relatively business-friendly legislation. The makeup of the new Parliament is expected to force the party to shift leftward and make more compromises with the socialists, no matter who comes out on top.Yet with so much at stake, Mr. Juncker\u2019s campaign still has a spur-of-the-moment feel.The logo for the rental company in West Flanders that operates his campaign bus was clearly visible on Tuesday morning underneath the blue stickers bearing Mr. Juncker\u2019s campaign slogan, \u201cExperience. Solidarity. Future.\u201dMr. Juncker has no plans to campaign in Britain, where the Conservatives, led by Prime Minister David Cameron, rejected the European People\u2019s Party as too federalist and instead chose another political grouping, the European Conservatives and Reformists group. That gives Mr. Juncker little leverage, at least for now, over Mr. Cameron\u2019s approach to overhauling the union, and over heading off a \u201cno\u201d vote in a possible referendum on whether to leave.\u201cI didn\u2019t receive any invitation from Britain until now,\u201d Mr. Juncker said, \u201cand so I\u2019m not imposing my bus.\u201dInstead, he said he would use the vehicle to visit up to four countries, including France and the Netherlands, and use airplanes for campaign trips to other parts of the union farther away, like Cyprus.Mr. Juncker said that as president of the commission, he would seek to respond to growing British about how some rules from Brussels that are meddlesome and even nonsensical. But he pushed back against compromising core elements of the its laws.\u201cI want to keep Britain in the European Union,\u201d Mr. Juncker said on the campaign bus on Tuesday morning. But \u201cif Britain wants to stay in the European Union, it has to accept that we cannot kill the basic principles of the European Union.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Not Flared Nostrils, but Nostrils With Flair", "Date": "2014-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDesign11 PhotosFor years, auto designers lavished attention on the grilles of cars, both for their function and for their brand identity. Now designers seem to be lowering their sights.They have shifted their focus to openings in the sides of the front bumpers. Designers call these cooling-air intakes, but after looking at them long enough, a casual observer might think of them as nostrils.\u201cThe term \u2018nostrils\u2019 makes sense, because these are where the vehicle breathes,\u201d said Bryan Thompson, an independent designer who has worked at Nissan.\u00a0\u00a0Vehicles\u2019 faces seem to be showing larger and more expressively formed nostrils, to judge from many models at the New York International Auto Show. The show, at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, runs through Sunday. There are functional reasons for these aids to heavy breathing: Modern high-efficiency engines require more air for cooling, and designers are under pressure to improve aerodynamics for the sake of fuel economy. But prominent vents in a vehicle\u2019s fascia also play into designers\u2019 desire to make cars appear wider and lower. They help to compensate visually for pedestrian-protection regulations and other factors that have raised cars\u2019 front ends. \u00a0\u201cYou have to have some sort of detail to fill up that dull space,\u201d Mr. Thompson said.As with grilles, the larger nostrils can make cars look more powerful, more sporty or more elegant and provide common cues across a brand\u2019s model lineup.\u201cThey are getting more necessary for cooling and for aero as well,\u201d Moray Callum, vice president for design at Ford, said in an interview during press previews for the auto show. \u201cBut they are also getting more and more expressive because we are using every way we can to give a car a little bit more of its own signature.\u201d An example of such a signature could be found at Hyundai\u2019s display at the New York show. Among photos of the 2015 Sonata sedan that Hyundai released to the press was an unusual close-up of one of the car\u2019s nostrils. It was carefully formed, accented with bright metal and bejeweled with a row of small lamps. Particularly in contrast to a similar view of the current Sonata, the vent exemplified the elegance and dignity that Chris Chapman, chief designer for Hyundai Design North America, said were qualities of the car\u2019s new look. Often, larger nostrils are used to suggest increased power under the hood. The Mercedes-Benz S63 AMG coupe introduced in New York, for instance, displays wider nostrils, with a sweeping shape, than the basic S-Class. BMW has given its M high-performance models large nostrils, suggesting their additional horsepower. They also have fluid, horizontal shapes that imply a lower center of gravity and metaphorically suggest agility. No marque has historically emphasized nostrils so much as Lamborghini, whose logo is a bull with flaring nostrils and whose models have often been named after famous fighting bulls. Fittingly then, large, flared nostrils like those on the new Hurac\u00e1n are an important a part of the traditional Lamborghini face, Filippo Perini, the head of Lamborghini\u2019s Centro Stile studio, said in an interview during the show. The large double openings \u201care part of our design D.N.A.,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWe work on the face of the car first. We are always trying to give to the car an expression with a face, eyes, nose. These let the car say to you, \u2018I\u2019m aggressive\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m polite.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIn addition to engine and brake cooling, some nostrils direct air through the front wheel wells to reduce drag. There is considerable variety in how nostril designs are expressed. Many nostrils are faced with aggressive black mesh textures, while others are framed in chrome or increasingly these days accented with jewellike LEDs, often in a tube configuration. Bejeweled nostrils are seen in the Range Rover Evoque, for instance.Sometimes what appears to be a nostril does not admit air at all, but is given over to a lamp of some sort \u2014 or just a blacked-out panel. The chrome or lamp can change the design message of nostrils, indicating a more expensive model or trim level.The new vents have made car faces more visually complex. Some nostrils echo the shapes of headlamps, like shadows or reflections. Several designers said they had noted a tendency to use the top half of the car\u2019s face for expression while the lower half is for function. The fronts of some BMWs are divided between a bright grille and headlamps in their upper half and darkened vents in the lower half.Whether as a functional vent or simply a lamp holder, the nostril is a handy device for designers playing on resemblances within a brand family. For instance, various Buick models make extensive use of nostrils as accents, including the upright slash of the Regal GS\u2019s aperture.Judging from the cars at recent shows, there may be even bigger nostrils to come. For instance, the Toyota FCV, a design study for a future hydrogen fuel-cell car, has nostrils as large as a Lamborghini\u2019s.Advertisement"}

But it\u2019s average Ukrainians like them who are turning this country around, defying President Vladimir Putin of Russia and his military, quite simply, because they dream to the West.On past visits to this village, which my family fled in the 1940s, it seemed impossibly backward. It was near the Romanian border, a world apart from Kiev, the capital, and even a decade ago many houses lacked electricity and plumbing. Horses did the plowing. Nobody spoke English. If people went abroad it was to Russia.Yet Ukraine has changed and opened up. Almost everyone now has electricity, plumbing and television, and many young men and women have traveled to Italy to find jobs. There is bewilderment that Poland is now so much richer than Ukraine \u2014 and resentment at Moscow for holding Ukrainians back.I asked Margaryta, the girl with the European soul, whether she could speak Russian. Everyone in the village can speak it, she acknowledged, but she added primly: \u201cI will not speak Russian. I am a patriot.\u201dEven here in the village, Ukrainians watch Russian television and loathe the propaganda portraying them as neo-Nazi thugs rampaging against Russian speakers.\u201cIf you listen to them, we all carry assault rifles; we\u2019re all beating people,\u201d Ilya Moskal, a history teacher, said contemptuously.For people with such fondness for American culture, there is disappointment that President Obama hasn\u2019t embraced Ukraine more firmly. \u201cThe U.S. is being very slow and cautious,\u201d said Anatoly Marinchuk, a retiree, scolding gently. \u201cYou should be firmer, and quicker with financial assistance.\u201dHe\u2019s right, I think.It\u2019s not just Ukrainians who are watching, and Putin himself, but all the world.

{"Headline": "British Government Seeks Lift From Economic Data", "Date": "2014-04-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Britain crossed an important economic and psychological threshold on Wednesday when growth in paychecks caught up with inflation after years of financial crisis, austerity and an accompanying dip in living standards.Adding to the positive picture, unemployment fell faster than expected once again, this time dipping below 7 percent, though that, combined with a booming housing market, led analysts to predict that interest rates may rise soon.With an election next year, the Conservative-led coalition is hoping that voters see the rapid turnaround in the British economy as a vindication of government austerity policies, which included big public spending cuts to curb the budget deficit.The increase in real wage levels is politically significant, because the opposition Labour Party has made living standards a central part of its platform. It argues that, while the economy has returned to growth, ordinary voters have yet to feel the effects.Separate figures for the euro area, where there are worries about deflation, confirmed on Wednesday an earlier estimate that annual price increases were 0.5 percent in March, down from 0.7 percent in February, according to Eurostat, the European Union\u2019s statistical office.Five of the 18 countries recorded negative inflation rates, and the euro zone\u2019s overall rate was well below the target of close to 2 percent.Inflation in the 28-country European Union was recorded at 0.6 percent in the same period; Britain, with its impressive growth, recorded the highest rate, at 1.6 percent in March.The rate of growth in wages in Britain, including bonuses, came in just above that in the December to February period, at 1.7 percent, compared with the same period a year earlier. Generally, salaries have not outstripped inflation since 2008, except for a brief spell in 2010.Official figures showed that unemployment averaged 6.9 percent from December to February, down from 7.1 percent in the previous quarter.\u201cThese strong jobs numbers are very good news,\u201d George Osborne, chancellor of the Exchequer, said in a statement. \u201cComing alongside yesterday\u2019s lower inflation, they are compelling evidence that our economic plan is working.\u201dMr. Osborne added that families were still \u201cfacing pressures on their budgets\u201d and that \u201cmuch work needs still to be done to build a resilient economy.\u201dHow quickly that happens may have a crucial impact on the election expected in May 2015. Employees have experienced years of effective wage declines since the financial crisis, which means that they may not feel that they have caught up anytime soon. The Office for Budget Responsibility, which provides independent guidance for the government, does not expect inflation-adjusted earnings to return to 2009-10 levels until 2018-19.Signs that the economy is taking off, including a buoyant housing market, raised the prospect of a rise in interest rates later this year or early next year. That would push up the cost of mortgage payments after years of record low interest rates.\u201cWith strong G.D.P. growth and shrinking slack, we continue to expect the Monetary Policy Committee to start to hike rates later this year,\u201d Michael Saunders, an economist at Citi Research, wrote in reference to the rate-setting committee of the Bank of England.Rob Wood, an economist for Berenberg Bank in London, predicted that the Bank of England would raise rates in the first quarter of 2015, before the general election. \u201cThe economy is heading in the right direction, fast,\u201d he said. \u201cThe rapidly tightening labor market and signs of a booming economy makes record low interest rates increasingly unnecessary and unsustainable.\u201dUnemployment is now below the figure of 7 percent once set by the Bank of England as a benchmark for considering a rate increase.\u201cFirms are hiring at a faster pace, the number of people out of work is at a five-year low and the majority of new jobs are full-time,\u201d said Neil Carberry, director of employment and skills at the Confederation of British Industry, the country\u2019s biggest business lobby organization.Matthew Whittaker, chief economist at the Resolution Foundation, a research institute that focuses on people with low and middle incomes, said the data represented \u201ca significant moment,\u201d but he noted that self-employed workers were not included in these wage figures.\u201cThe fact that we may now be emerging from the longest pay squeeze in living memory means there is a huge catch-up on wages that still needs to happen,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "If a Bubble Bursts in Palo Alto, Does It Make a Sound?", "Date": "2014-04-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s the EconomyThis year, Facebook purchased the mobile-messaging application WhatsApp for $19 billion, or about $350 million per employee and $40 per user, only some of whom even pay the $1 annual fee for the advertisement-free platform. But what was perhaps most remarkable about Facebook\u2019s acquisition of WhatsApp was that the start-up was making any money in the first place. In recent years, Facebook has shelled out 10-figure sums for Instagram and the virtual-reality headset maker Oculus V.R., both of which had scant or no revenue. Ditto for the safe-sexting-enabler Snapchat, which reportedly turned down a $3 billion offer from Mark Zuckerberg.Those numbers seem as bubbly as a hot bath or cold Champagne, a sure sign that Silicon Valley valuations have soared far higher than Silicon Valley balance sheets can support. A recent downturn in tech stock prices is perhaps indicative of this uncertainty. But if tech really is a bubble, would the rest of the country be harmed if it burst?There are hundreds more examples of big companies spending eye-watering sums for acquisitions, firms going public at fat valuations, tech stocks reaching high highs and venture-capital firms tossing money at start-ups. That\u2019s not to mention the cultural afterbirth of all that cash, from the medieval-themed weddings to the office ball pits. (If HBO sees fit to satirize your corner of the economy, things have probably gone a bit weird.) Meanwhile, the rest of the country slouches along, unemployment high, wages stagnant, credit tight. But Silicon Valley feels like a foam party.It turns out that one might have more to do with the other than you would think. The Federal Reserve is currently keeping interest rates very, very low. They\u2019ve been keeping them very, very low for a long, long time. The idea is to spur investors to spend now \u2014 but the economy is so crummy that few know quite how to do that. A report from Standard & Poor\u2019s released this month found that 1,700 big, nonfinancial companies were holding on to about $1.53 trillion in cash and short-term securities at the end of 2013. That is enough liquidity to purchase Google, Apple, General Electric, McDonald\u2019s, General Motors and Walmart outright, with a few billion to spare.Pension funds, endowments, high-net-worth individuals and the like are also trying to figure out how to invest all their money \u2014 and along with places like the Bakken and a few emerging markets, Palo Alto seems awfully appealing. A few million in seed funding might turn to billions in an acquisition in just a few years, after all. \u201cValuations are at extreme levels because you cannot get a decent return on your money doing anything else,\u201d Fred Wilson of Union Square Ventures wrote on his blog. \u201cIt\u2019s been a good time to be in the V.C. and start-up business, and I think it will continue to be as long as the global economy is weak and rates are low.\u201d In other words, the perks-laden, savior-and-ninja-saturated, TED-talking beast that has seemingly taken over Northern California in recent years might be a byproduct of high corporate profits and Fed policy as much as anything else.But what happens if and when the normal patterns of the economy reassert themselves? What happens when the easy money gets a bit harder to come by, and firms suddenly need the companies they invest in to turn a profit? I put that question to half a dozen academics and businesspeople, and the general response was a shrug.If it is a bubble, one thing that sets it apart is its relative dearth of retail investors. The dot-com bubble of the late 1990s and the economic collapse of 2008 still loom large, for investors and executives alike. \u201cIn the 1990s, as time went on, skeptics started to see Porsches in their neighbors\u2019 driveways,\u201d said Lise Buyer of the Class V Group, a consultancy for firms looking to go public. \u201cTime beat back the skepticism.\u201d It resulted in a disaster on the Nasdaq and the end of the Clinton boom. But now, she said, there is fresh memory of how badly things can go, and how quickly. For evidence, she pointed to the fact that 10 of the 19 technology companies that went public this year are trading below their offering price. \u201cThat isn\u2019t the kind of performance that drives most folks to bet the mortgage money on the next hot wonder company,\u201d she said. \u201cSanity prevails.\u201dWhat about those start-ups raising mountains of cash from investors? The queasy truth is that many of those investors could afford to lose it all. Technology giants \u2014 Apple, Facebook and Google, among many others \u2014 are raking in cash. They might be overpaying for acquisitions, but there is no reason to think that should damn their bottom lines in the long term. The same goes for the rich individuals funneling money to young companies through venture-capital firms and other vehicles.\u201cWhere\u2019s the bulk of the ownership of these companies?\u201d said Josh Lerner, a professor at Harvard Business School. \u201cThey\u2019re mostly in the hands of a small number of venture funds.\u201dBut the American public has bought into the tech boom, at least a bit, in a more concealed way. Big institutional investors, like pension funds, do put some of their money into private-equity and venture-capital firms. A drop in tech stocks or a flotilla of start-ups going belly up could sting Uncle Joe and Aunt Nancy that way.And that downturn might already be taking hold. Recently, Bloomberg asked investors, analysts and traders if Internet and social-media stock valuations were unsustainable. Only 14 percent did not see a bubble. Even some tech companies themselves have argued that expectations have drifted too high. For instance, Netflix\u2019s chief executive, Reed Hastings, recently said he sensed some \u201ceuphoria\u201d driving the firm\u2019s stock price. \u201cWe have a sense of momentum, investors driving the stock price more than we might normally,\u201d Hastings said. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot we can do about it.\u201dBut relatively few tech companies have actually gone public during this boom, which wasn\u2019t the case in the late \u201990s: With so much corporate cash sloshing around, there is less need to head to the public markets in order to raise capital. And investors seem to be more wary. This spring, many market participants ditched high-growth but volatile biotech, social-networking and cloud companies stocks, noted Kathleen Smith of Renaissance Capital, an I.P.O. investment-advisory firm. \u201cThis was a necessary correction that many had been looking for after such a strong sustained rally,\u201d she said. It\u2019s a sign of investor discipline. And although the sell-off has sent prices sliding, the damage has been contained. Far fewer Americans are mortgaging their homes to day trade, as they were back in the days of Pets.com.Perhaps the most immediate effect of a tech bust \u2014 and one I imagine would be accompanied by a certain amount of delicious schadenfreude outside Silicon Valley \u2014 would be on the local economy. Suddenly broke, start-up guys would stop buying plug-in cars and condos and expensive green juices. Housing values might tumble; fancy boutiques and car dealerships might close; yachts and vacation homes in Hawaii might go into foreclosure. But the effect would probably be fairly localized to areas of Northern California, New York, Boston and the like.The truth is that most Americans have little interaction with the big-money, small-jobs technology boom, so they might be sheltered from the worst of the technology bust, at least as it looks today, if not years from now. But that might be cold comfort: It is a sad state of affairs if one of the most vibrant, explosive and creative parts of the economy \u2014 and one of the few that is minting millionaires \u2014 seems more like a walled garden than a public park.Annie Lowrey is an economics reporter for The Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pro-Russian Insurgents Balk at Terms of Pact in Ukraine", "Date": "2014-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKIEV, Ukraine \u2014 An American-backed deal to settle the crisis in eastern Ukraine fell flat on Friday as pro-Russian militants vowed to stay in occupied government buildings, dashing hopes of a swift end to an insurgency that the authorities in Kiev portray as a Kremlin-orchestrated effort to put Ukraine\u2019s industrial heartland under Russian control.But the agreement, reached in Geneva on Thursday by diplomats from the European Union, Russia, Ukraine and the United States, appeared to arrest, at least temporarily, the momentum of separatist unrest in Ukraine\u2019s Russian-speaking east. Armed pro-Russian militants, who have seized buildings in at least 10 towns and cities since Feb. 6, paused their efforts to purge all central government authority from the populous Donetsk region. It was clear all along that for the pact to have a chance of success, the Kremlin would have to pressure the militants to leave the buildings they had seized. So far, it has shown no inclination to do so, blaming the Ukrainian government for the turmoil and denying that Russia has any ties to the rebels.Western officials said the United States planned to reassure Eastern European members of NATO by conducting company-size \u2014 about 150 soldiers \u2014 ground force exercises in Estonia and Poland. The exercises would last a couple of weeks and would most likely be followed by other troop rotations in the region. With militants vowing to ignore the agreement but halting what had been a daily expansion of territory under their control, officials in Kiev voiced some hope that a settlement was still possible. They were skeptical, however, about Russia\u2019s willingness to push the separatists to disarm and vacate occupied buildings.\u201cIf Russia is responsible before not just Ukraine but the world community, it should prove it,\u201d said Andrii Deshchytsia, the acting Ukrainian foreign minister, who took part in the Geneva talks.In a sign of the chasm separating Russian and Ukrainian views, Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry issued a statement on Friday that made no mention of the pro-Russian militants driving the unrest. It said the call for militants to disarm \u201cmeant in the first place\u201d the disarming of Ukrainian nationalist groups hostile to Russia, like Right Sector \u201cand other pro-fascist groups which took part in the February coup in Kiev.\u201dThe state-run Russian television channel, reporting from an occupied building in Horlivka in the Donetsk region, featured a masked gunman who pledged to \u201cfight to the end for his convictions.\u201d He displayed an armband emblazoned with a swastika-like symbol, which he said had been seized from supporters of the Ukrainian government.Doubts about the Kremlin\u2019s readiness to push pro-Russian militants to surrender their guns have been strengthened by its insistence that it has no hand in or control over the separatist unrest, which Washington and Kiev believe is the result of a covert Russian operation involving, in some places, the direct action of special forces.\u201cI don\u2019t know Russia\u2019s intentions,\u201d Mr. Deshchytsia said, noting that during the negotiations, Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, had repeatedly asserted \u201cthat Russia was not involved.\u201d He said Mr. Lavrov had been \u201ccooperative and aggressive at the same time.\u201dRussia\u2019s denials have stirred concerns that it went along with the agreement not to curb the turmoil in eastern Ukraine, but to blunt American and European calls for tougher sanctions that could severely damage Russia\u2019s already sickly economy. Western sanctions have so far been limited to a travel ban and asset freeze on a few dozen individuals and a Russian bank.Secretary of State John Kerry called Mr. Lavrov on Friday and urged Russia to ensure \u201cfull and immediate compliance\u201d with the agreement, a senior State Department official said. Mr. Kerry, the official added, \u201cmade clear that the next few days would be a pivotal period for all sides to implement the statement\u2019s provisions, particularly that all illegal armed groups must be disarmed and all illegally seized buildings must be returned to legitimate owners.\u201d \u201cThey have no place in the 21st century,\u201d she said.American officials gave no firm timeline for when they expect militants to pull back, but said it should be days, not weeks. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is scheduled to travel to Ukraine on Tuesday, which could be a moment to assess whether the agreement has yielded results. Russia responded with fury on Friday to remarks the day before by Mr. Obama, who said that the deal offered a \u201cglimmer of hope\u201d but that the United States would take more punitive action if Russia did not abide by it. The Foreign Ministry criticized Washington for making \u201cultimatums\u201d and for moving \u201cto threaten us with new sanctions, which is absolutely unacceptable.\u201dSpeaking to reporters on Thursday at the White House, Mr. Obama sounded a skeptical note. \u201cMy hope is that we actually do see follow-through over the next several days,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think, given past performance, that we can count on that, and we have to be prepared to potentially respond to what continue to be efforts of interference by the Russians in eastern and southern Ukraine.\u201dMilitants holed up in the headquarters of the Donetsk regional administration \u2014 which they seized on Feb. 6 at the start of a well-coordinated campaign of assaults on government buildings across the region \u2014 showed no sign on Friday of abiding by the agreement. Gunmen in Slovyansk, a city in the north of the region, also seemed unwilling to leave the local police station and other seized buildings.\u201cThey did not sign anything for us. They signed for the Russian Federation,\u201d Mr. Pushilin told reporters. \u201cThey do not ask our advice, but I believe all the actions of the Russian Federation were intended to solve the situation peacefully.\u201dMr. Pushilin said he would carry on preparing for a referendum, but was coy when asked what he would recommend if people in the region voted for independence. Would he seek for the region to become part of Russia, as occurred in Crimea, or to remain part of Ukraine under a new constitution that granted greater autonomy to the country\u2019s regions?Mr. Deshchytsia, the acting Ukrainian foreign minister, dismissed as irrelevant Mr. Pushilin\u2019s demand that the government in Kiev step down. He said this was not part of the agreement and added that the government would press on with a stalled \u201cantiterrorist operation\u201d to dislodge the militants if they refused to leave.At a news conference in Kiev, Mr. Deshchytsia declined to set a deadline to resume the military operation if the rebels refuse to disarm. He instead called on Russia to honor what he said was a commitment made in Geneva to persuade the militants to give up their weapons and leave seized buildings.Seeking to calm separatist passions, Ukrainian leaders on Friday repeated assurances that they would, as Mr. Deshchytsia promised in Geneva, pursue changes to the Constitution that would grant more power to local councils to run their own affairs and enshrine Russian as an official language \u2014 bedrock demands in the largely Russian-speaking east. Parliament also began preparing an amnesty law, honoring a Ukrainian pledge in Geneva not to prosecute rebels if they voluntarily disarm and hand over occupied buildings.\u201cWe can talk only about giving the regions more autonomy,\u201d Ms. Tymoshenko said at a news conference.With hopes of a diplomatic settlement battered, Ukraine\u2019s acting minister of economic development, Pavlo Sheremeta, summed up the mood in Kiev. Saying \u201cit is much better to shoot with words, not bullets,\u201d he described the Geneva deal as \u201ca step in the right direction\u201d but added, \u201cWe are not totally excited.\u201dAndrew Higgins reported from Kiev, and Andrew E.

{"Headline": "An Economic Gauge, Imperfect but Vital", "Date": "2014-04-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ShelfUltimately, Dr. Coyle\u2019s \u201caffectionate history\u201d offers two cheers for the G.D.P., which was designed for a simpler era of mass production, for counting widgets as they came off the line. The measure\u2019s acolytes in Washington now struggle to adapt this all-important count to fit our Internet economy, where innovation is rampant and so many benefits are free. Unlike temperature, which we measure with a good thermometer, nothing in nature corresponds to \u201cgross domestic product.\u201d It is a concept invented by learned experts to capture the overall economy\u2019s performance as best we can. It includes what experts decide it should include, with notable omissions \u2014 some deliberate, some not. Yet no one doubts that the G.D.P. is essential. Both public and private decision makers need some idea of how well the overall economy is doing. Small changes in G.D.P. make a big difference. At 4 percent growth a year, for example, the economy will double in 17 years; at 2 percent, it will take 35 years. A 1 percent decline is a national calamity; a 2.5 percent gain is something for politicians to crow about.The most common definition of G.D.P. is consumer spending, plus investment spending, plus government spending, plus exports, minus imports. The count relies on timely surveys of transactions, compiled in the United States by the Commerce Department\u2019s Bureau of Economic Analysis, with a cast of thousands. In 2008, the United Nations published its System of National Accounts as the global standard for computing G.D.P. Those rules run 722 pages, with an additional 400 pages of commentary. Devilishly complex, the rules involve innumerable estimates and arbitrary decisions about what does and doesn\u2019t fit. Only a handful of specialists fully understand the system, Dr. Coyle writes, and only a few dozen nations fully carry it out. The Bureau of Economic Analysis listed G.D.P. as one of the greatest inventions of the 20th century. It was devised during the Great Depression when the New Deal of President Franklin D. Roosevelt was desperate for a gauge of how the failing economy was faring. That early version proved invaluable during World War II, when the nation needed to decide how to apportion its scarce resources between wartime and civilian priorities. A major omission is the work we do for ourselves: cooking, cleaning, painting a room, taking care of children or an aging relative. Pay a gardener to mow your lawn,\u00a0and that\u2019s part of the G.D.P.; do it yourself, and it\u2019s not. If all such tasks were included, and priced at the going wage, their contribution to the G.D.P. would be tremendous. Nor does G.D.P. count the underground economy, conducted out of sight of regulators and tax collectors, even though this unofficial sector provides many jobs and is often highly entrepreneurial. Estimates are that in some countries the \u201cinformal\u201d economy amounts to a quarter of total output, and considerably more in the third world. (In the United States, the estimate is 7 percent.) From the very first, arguments have raged over whether the G.D.P. measures the right thing. Shouldn\u2019t we count the increase in national well-being as opposed to national production? Some economists have argued that\u00a0items they consider negative, like spending on armaments of war, advertising huckstering and stock market speculation, have no place in a measure of national betterment. The G.D.P. finesses those imponderables. If a transaction is priced in dollars, it goes into G.D.P., with no ethical debate over its contribution to human welfare. The G.D.P. accommodates both what we spend on producing electricity by burning dirty coal and what we spend on pollution abatement to keep the air clean. Dr. Coyle concludes that while imperfect, the G.D.P. is good enough as a measure of how fast the economy is growing and better than any alternative. It is closely correlated with things that do contribute to happiness. (Nobody is happy in a recession.) \u201cWe should not be in a rush to ditch G.D.P.,\u201d Dr. Coyle writes. \u201cYet it is a measure of the economy best suited to an earlier era.\u201d For one thing, it fails to count the value of the staggering growth in consumer choice. Where once we had three television networks, we now have 1,000 channels; greater choice equals greater freedom, she declares. It does poorly in measuring the Internet economy, in which so many benefits \u2014 like Google searches \u2014 are offered free. It badly lags behind the headlong pace of innovation and creativity. It struggles with the true value of a host of products or services that didn\u2019t exist before. To the degree that it misses those new benefits to consumers, it understates the pace of economic growth.Most seriously, she writes, G.D.P. tells us nothing about whether we are eating our seed corn. Does today\u2019s growth come at the expense of tomorrow\u2019s? Are we consuming our natural \u2014 and human \u2014 resources without replacing them? She urges that we add a regular, official indicator of \u201csustainability.\u201d Be warned, though, that Dr. Coyle\u2019s little book is a short history, not a primer. It is not baby steps. Though her writing is often a marvel of clarity, at times she takes on topics that are best understood only if you already know what she\u2019s talking about. Sometimes the book takes too many shortcuts.The best example is her conviction that current measures of G.D.P. greatly exaggerate the importance of financial services to overall economic output. Perversely, in the final quarter of 2008, Britain\u2019s banking industry showed its fastest growth on record, almost matching manufacturing in size, just as the money markets all but froze. \u201cThis is absurd,\u201d she writes. \u201cWhat on earth was going on with the statistics?\u201d What was going on, it appears, was that a new measure of banking\u2019s output tied a bank\u2019s contribution to G.D.P. to the degree of risk the bank was taking \u2014 an ill-timed idea, if ever there was one. That, at least, is the best I can extract from the six abstruse pages spelling out the detail. They include a cryptic reference to counting financial services as \u201cthe negative output of an imaginary segment of the economy.\u201dHuh? Run that one by me again?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "English Universities Losing International Students", "Date": "2014-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInternational EducationLONDON \u2014 The number of international students enrolling in English universities has dropped for the first time in nearly three decades, interrupting a long-term trend of double-digit growth.A new report by the Higher Education Funding Council for England examines recent shifts in enrollment patterns and discusses their possible causes. The nations that make up the United Kingdom have individual responsibility for higher education, and the report addresses only the situation in England.Britain attracts more international students than any country except the United States and puts a figure for the overall value to its economy of foreign currency earnings from higher education at about \u00a310 billion, or nearly $17 billion.The report says that the number of students enrolling in full-time \u201ctaught graduate programs,\u201d which include many master\u2019s programs, declined 1 percent from the 2010-11 to the 2012-13 academic years. That decline is especially worrying for institutions because those programs tend to be dominated by foreign students. According to the report, in 2012-13, 74 percent of entrants to full-time master\u2019s programs were from outside Britain.Master\u2019s programs, which are usually a year long, are often a significant source of income for universities, as well as a potential future source of teaching staff members. Their short duration, relative to similar programs elsewhere, puts British universities under more pressure to maintain international recruitment levels.According to Janet Ilieva, the author of the funding council report, a recent analysis by the council indicates that there is a high progression rate from full-time taught graduate programs to doctoral programs, so the drop could be a worrisome sign for future teaching and research capacity. \u201cThe implication is that this is putting the long-term viability of certain subjects under threat,\u201d she said.Another development the report highlights is a sharp drop in the number of full-time undergraduate entrants from other European Union countries. Those students pay the same tuition as domestic British students, for whom the government caps the amount of tuition that universities can charge. Their number fell by a quarter in 2012-13, when the tuition cap at most universities in England rose to \u00a39,000, or around $15,000. The report identifies the tuition increase as the likely cause of the decline.The last time international student numbers decreased in Britain was in the early 1980s, when universities began charging international students tuition.The report also calls attention to the growing numbers of Chinese students at British universities. They now represent nearly a quarter of all students enrolled in full-time master\u2019s programs and make up the second-largest cohort after British students, at 26 percent.That increase has taken place as the numbers of students from India, Pakistan, and Iran, which historically sent large cohorts of graduate students to Britain, have declined. The numbers of students coming from Pakistan and India have halved since 2010, even as entries from other countries have increased, according to the report.Those developments paint a worrying picture for British universities, which seem to have borne the brunt of a confluence of events. \u201cWe can\u2019t point to causality,\u201d Ms. Ilieva said, but the timing of the shifts suggest some factors that might be at play.Immigration, for one, has become a contentious political issue in Britain in recent years, and the government\u2019s efforts to limit immigration figures have at times conflicted with the aims of universities. Universities UK, the lobbying organization for vice chancellors, has opposed the government\u2019s approach to immigration, warning that including students in migration figures would be detrimental to universities.Policy revisions, such as the elimination of work entitlement for foreign students at private institutions, a move designed to curb abuses by bogus institutions, also had an effect on international enrollments.Those shifts, all of which may have suggested to international students that Britain was becoming less hospitable to foreigners, coincided with efforts among Britain\u2019s main competitors for foreign students to ease the path for them.Commenting on the funding council report, Nicola Dandridge, the chief executive of Universities UK, noted that at a time of growing international demand for higher education, \u201cwe should be seeing a significant rise in international recruitment figures, given the global standing of our universities. At the same time, competitor countries, who are actively promoting policies to encourage international students, have seen rises in international-student numbers.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For All It\u2019s Worth", "Date": "2014-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMost people are used to owing money to others, but few think about what money may owe us: an equitable society, a functioning political system, a peaceful economy that can stay off the exhausting roller coaster of financial booms and crashes.We don\u2019t usually think of money as a tool to accomplish all that, but Felix Martin, an economist and former World Bank official and author of the compulsively readable new book \u201cMoney: The Unauthorized Biography,\u201d says that money can give us all those things; it can deliver \u201cboth stability and freedom.\u201d The catch is that we must radically rethink money itself. It\u2019s not a fixed, physical thing, he argues, but a virtual \u201csocial technology\u201d that should be used to enable a more democratic and equitable world, bring order to the banking system and foster \u201cpeace, prosperity, freedom and fairness.\u201d Sign me up.Martin\u2019s best stories remind us of the quirky ways money existed in the past. He opens the book late in the 19th century in Yap, a Pacific island that favored as its currency enormous stone wheels the size of boulders. One especially rich family\u2019s only proof of their wealth was a boulder at the bottom of the sea. (Talk about underwater homeowners.) For centuries in England, accounts were marked on wooden tally sticks; in 1834, when Treasury officials burned the tallies in a tantrum of modernization, not only did they wipe out English financial history, they also created a conflagration that literally burned down \u00adParliament.\u201cMoney\u201d is a fascinating and entertaining pep talk for bankers, economists and armchair revolutionaries dissatisfied with the current financial system, and an attempt to galvanize them into action. The best arguments center on widespread unfairness: \u201cGlobal banking\u2019s current structure generates an unjust distribution of risks, where losses are socialized \u2014 taxpayers are on the hook for bailouts \u2014 while gains are private \u2014 the banks and their investors alone reap any profits.\u201d In addition to widespread wealth inequality and stagnant incomes, \u201cthe baby boomers own all the houses, and no one under 30 can get on the property ladder.\u201dMartin\u2019s complaint will be familiar to anyone who has kept up with the flailing of finance in the five years or so since the crash. A wide group of dissidents has strengthened its opposition to the current financial system. This worldview \u2014 which holds, roughly, that banks are greed-\u00addriven agents of chaos and governments their weak-willed enablers of social inequality \u2014 crystallized first in the back alleys of the Internet, then on the streets through the Occupy protests, on to the campaign trail with Ron Paul\u2019s \u201cEnd the Fed,\u201d and now peeks through the growing debate around the virtual currency Bitcoin, which is backed by no government or bank. This set of movements was spurred by what its adherents consider a failure of capitalism as we know it and a desire to either change it for the better or escape it entirely. Martin is very much with them \u2014 or at least with some of them.His practical solution is to break up the banks in the \u201cChicago Plan\u201d style of the Depression-era economist Irving Fisher: Some will be utilities regulated and backed by the state, and a separate set of financial institutions will make loans and speculate on their own. It sounds a little like using separate sets of plates to keep the financial system kosher. \u201cMoney and banking, incorrectly understood, and so incorrectly configured, are what brought us here.\u201d Martin writes. He adds, optimistically, \u201cMoney and banking, correctly restructured, will be what brings us out again.\u201dHis intellectual agenda takes more work. He says both consumers and economists are mistaken when they connect money to things \u2014 whether it is gold or cash or goods in a supermarket. We need to understand money as a set of promises, \u201cnot as a thing, but as a social technology\u201d that should be \u201cunflinchingly responsive to the demands of democratic politics.\u201d Economists, similarly, when they obsess about inflation, are merely conflating money with the fixed value of the things it buys, like the price of an average basket of goods.The financial crisis demonstrates, in Martin\u2019s view, that money has failed its democratic promise. He reminds us that money, as we know it, has been the primary tool of democratic government and social mobility. \u201cUnder the old social regime, social position had been absolute: born a peasant, died a peasant; born a chieftain, died a chieftain,\u201d Martin writes. \u201cIn the new world, everything was relative. The only real measure of a man\u2019s worth was money \u2014 and the accumulation of money has no intrinsic limits.\u201dOf course, those Occupy dissidents would argue that our supposedly malleable social order promised by money has turned into a new kind of feudalism, with power concentrated in the hands of a few property owners \u2014 the divide between the 1 percent and the 99 percent.Martin doesn\u2019t disagree. He may not advocate class war explicitly, but he does go for a hard sell, using language more suited to the Pentagon than to the genteel halls of central banks. \u201cThe war on financial instability requires not conventional tactics, but a counterinsurgency strategy,\u201d he argues, adding later that our current regulations and attempts to change banks behavior are inadequate. \u201cConventional warfare will be an infinite regress: attempting to supervise the financial sector is a fool\u2019s errand.\u201dThe revolutionary, populist theme is carried through to the last chapter. If we\u2019re going to reform money, \u201cit will ultimately come down to ourselves.\u201d A friend of Martin\u2019s says, \u201cIf you want something done properly \u2014 you have to do it \u00adyourself!\u201d Spoiler: That\u2019s the last line of the book, and it\u2019s a cliffhanger. Martin doesn\u2019t provide any answers on how the masses can reform money, although he provides an enjoyable account of why we should entertain the idea. Still, he says, his attempt to reform the banking system \u201cisn\u2019t meant to start a socialist revolution \u2014 it\u2019s meant to stave one off.\u201dThe outstanding flaw in Martin\u2019s argument is whether the system can change, and whether the impetus exists to change it \u2014 whether, in fact, the crash was bad enough to force a revolution of any kind. There are enough strong voices on the other side of his argument who would suggest it wasn\u2019t, including Daniel W. Drezner in his book \u201cThe System Worked,\u201d and the economists Charles W. Calomiris and Stephen H. Haber, who suggest in their book, \u201cFragile by Design\u201d (reviewed on Page 22 of this issue) that financial crises are an inevitable outcome of the push-and-pull between banks and governments. Into this pitched battle of economic ideas wanders the well-meaning American consumer, just trying to pay for a latte. Whether he uses cash, credit, loyalty cards or Bitcoins is largely irrelevant to him; he just wants coffee and isn\u2019t looking for a fight. Too bad. He is a potential economic foot soldier in Martin\u2019s view, and the war is very much on. MONEYThe Unauthorized BiographyBy Felix MartinIllustrated. 320 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $27.95.Heidi N.

Other pet themes include cloud computing and personalized medicine. \u201cWithin those, I\u2019m working to find companies with sustainable competitive advantages and managers who act like owners,\u201d he said.Mr. Baker\u2019s fund, which has an expense ratio of 0.76 percent, returned 3.1 percent in the first quarter and 41.2 percent over the 12 months through March.\u2018Six Rivers of Growth\u2019\u201cI spent my weekends in 2012 writing a paper on where the growth and innovation in our economy was, and the result was these six big rivers,\u201d he said. As an investor, he is seeking good companies that are plying \u2014 and being pushed along by \u2014 his rivers.Witness iRobot, a pure-play robotics company based in Bedford, Mass., which Mr. O\u2019Halloran termed a bet on manufacturing in the United States. The company\u2019s robots do everything from disposing of bombs to cleaning floors, pools and gutters. The stock slumped in 2012, with investors worried that a shrinking American military presence in Afghanistan and Iraq would sap sales, Mr. O\u2019Halloran said. But the consumer side of the business is making up the difference, thanks to a new vacuum and a robot for telemedicine. \u201cWe\u2019re on the verge of a big boom in robotics, \u201d he said. The surge in the North American energy industry, by contrast, has already begun. Mr. O\u2019Halloran says he sees it in both the gush of domestic gas and oil production created by horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing and the uptick in demand for renewable resources like solar power. His fund has had a greater exposure to shale producers and servicers like Flotek this year than it had before, he said, \u201cThe bear market in those names is over.\u201dNew Pockets of Energy\u201cJust before the financial crisis, there was concern that we were running out of gas and too dependent on foreign oil,\u201d Mr. James said. \u201cNow our production levels are some of the highest in the world, thanks to good old-fashioned American innovation. One of the amazing parts of this is that the major oil companies have, by and large, missed it. They were focused overseas. The micro and small caps have been generating most of the production growth.\u201d Mr. James and Mr. Buck like Callon Petroleum, which drills in the Permian Basin, a geologic formation underlying West Texas and southeastern New Mexico. \u201cHorizontal drilling and fracturing have rejuvenated the Permian Basin,\u201d Mr. James said.Mr. James, the portfolio manager, and Mr. Buck, the assistant portfolio manager, have run their fund since just November, when it opened. But they\u2019ve stewarded Driehaus\u2019s microcap investments longer: Mr. James has overseen the strategy for the company\u2019s private clients since 1998, and Mr. Buck joined him as an analyst in 2002. They seek companies undergoing \u201cgrowth inflections\u201d resulting from new technology, new management or entry into a new industry, Mr. James said. \u201cWe believe the market tends to misprice stocks following these growth inflections \u2014 the market will underestimate where the growth can go,\u201d he said. Their fund, which has an expense ratio of 1.7 percent, returned 6.3 percent in the first quarter. The fund, combined with its predecessor, a limited partnership, returned 43.8 percent over the last 12 months.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Setbacks Aside, Climate Change Is Finding Its Way Into the World's Classrooms", "Date": "2014-04-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInternational EducationLONDON \u2014 From Mauritius to Manitoba, climate change is slowly moving from the headlines to the classroom. Schools around the world are beginning to tackle the difficult issue of global warming, teaching students how the planet is changing and encouraging them to think about what they can do to help slow that process.Strapped school budgets, concerns about overburdening teachers and political opposition to what in some places is a contentious subject have complicated the spread of lessons on climate change. Nonetheless, many nations are adding or expanding such offerings, convinced that young people must learn about a phenomenon likely to have a big impact on their lives.Schools, advocates say, can play an important role in fighting climate change by teaching young people greener habits and creating a generation of voters who will back measures to cut carbon dioxide pollution.To slow dangerous warming, \u201cwe need an overall change of mind and a change of action that relates to everything that we think and do,\u201d said Alexander Leicht, of Unesco, the agency overseeing the United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development, which ends this year.\u201cWe need every individual\u2019s understanding to do something about that, every individual\u2019s motivation,\u201d he said. \u201cHow else do you reach them than through education?\u201dNot everyone agrees, however, and in some places the question of how and whether to teach the subject is politically charged. Britain\u2019s education secretary has zigzagged, with changes that environmental advocates say will reduce climate\u2019s prominence in the national curriculum there.In the United States, new science standards drawn up by 26 states and scientists\u2019 and teachers\u2019 groups call for introducing climate change to students in middle school and exploring it in greater detail in high school. That has stirred opposition in states like Wyoming, a coal and oil producer. Lawmakers there last month blocked funding for the standards, saying teaching climate change could hurt the local economy.\u201cA lot of science teachers essentially say, \u2018This doesn\u2019t feel like a very safe topic to teach. The science is conceptually difficult, and it\u2019s controversial. I might get complaints from parents and it\u2019s not part of my current curriculum, and so I\u2019m not going to take it on,\u201d\u2019 said Charles Anderson, a professor of teacher education at Michigan State University, who advised on the new standards.Still, in other countries the subject is less contentious. Irish schools, for example, cover climate change as part of a broad theme known as education for sustainable development, addressing social and environmental problems ranging from poverty to dwindling biodiversity. While officials are only now formulating a national strategy, many schools have been offering such lessons for years, said Tony Gaynor, a curriculum and assessment officer at Ireland\u2019s Department of Education and Skills. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot going on out there, and there\u2019s an awful lot of enthusiasm and passion in the sector,\u201d he said.The subject fits well with Ireland\u2019s effort to move away from rote learning and toward developing students\u2019 analytic and critical thinking skills, he noted. \u201cSustainable development is an area where there are complex issues that need to be teased out and challenged.\u201d That comes with \u201ca much more participatory, democratic approach where students are identifying problems that need to be solved, and students are doing their own research on how to solve the problems,\u201d he said. That is true, too, in island nations such as Cuba, Indonesia, Mauritius, and Trinidad and Tobago. As part of a Unesco effort called Sandwatch, students visit beaches to measure their width, analyze wave direction, collect water samples, assess wildlife and gather other data.Getting children outdoors helps even the very young to appreciate nature, Mr. Leicht, of Unesco, said.\u201cThe challenge is not to make it too threatening, but to make kids understand the value of what is being lost if climate change continues,\u201d he said.Encouraging young people to think about solutions is key to successfully discussing what can be an upsetting topic, said Annie Gregory, a program officer in Ahmedabad for India\u2019s Center for Environment Education.\u201cYou can\u2019t go to very young kids and show them the Arctic melting and all this doom and gloom,\u201d she said. \u201cWith all the negativity and all the technical information, they can really get bogged down.\u201d Instead, working with 200,000 schools, the government-backed center is using an approach suggested by a student, talking about the \u201chandprint\u201d of individuals\u2019 beneficial actions, rather than the harm suggested by an environmental footprint. Focusing on tangible actions, like repairing faucets to save water, is also important, said Ms. Gregory. \u201cYou say to the kids, \u2018Look there\u2019s a problem here, how do we fix it?\u2019 Then you can use math, you can use language, you can use science, geography, you can use history,\u201d said Brid Conneely, international director for eco-schools at the Foundation for Environmental Education, an independent nonprofit in Copenhagen.All Indian schools are required to offer environmental education, but many struggle to provide even basic skills and conveying the complexities of climate science can be difficult, said Sukhprit Kaur, a coordinator in Bangalore for the environment education center.Such constraints exist in wealthier nations, too. In the United States, the new science recommendations follow a tough Common Core of English and math skills that many states are still straining to teach.\u201cThe number of students who will not get education on climate change because of the financial and lack of adequate curriculum and teacher training issues is much larger than the number who will not get education on climate change because somebody in the legislature opposes it,\u201d Mr. Anderson of Michigan State said.Globally, teachers \u201cunderstand that the topic is very important, and they are eager\u201d to teach it, said Ingrid Jung, coordinator of an international sustainability education project at the German development agency GIZ. Unesco has been involved in such efforts, assisting, for example, with a program intended to reach 67,000 teachers in Vietnam, and working on smaller training programs in nations including Brazil, Mongolia, Namibia, the Philippines and South Africa, Mr. Leicht said.Some nations teach climate in science classes and others in geography, while others again integrate the idea of sustainability across a range of subjects. China has included sustainability education in its outline for school reform, and Japan has written it into curriculum guidelines, according to Unesco. Sometimes, educators focus on making schools themselves more environmentally friendly, so pupils can experience life in an institution with a slimmed-down carbon footprint, said Thomas Hoffman, a secondary school teacher who also helps develop sustainability curricula in southwestern Germany.Such initiatives may rile critics. In Britain, the Global Warming Policy Foundation, an organization of climate change skeptics, has accused schools of brainwashing students with political indoctrination similar to that in Mao Zedong\u2019s China. \u201cThe education system, subverted by a green political movement, now seeks conformity with environmentalist orthodoxy,\u201d the foundation warned in a report this month. Politicians, it said, are \u201ceffectively handing much of the curriculum to green activists.\u201dBritain\u2019s education secretary, Michael Gove, partly reversed course last year after scaling back coverage of climate change in a draft version of a national curriculum taking effect in September. Still, the amended version would give less emphasis to the subject than the current curriculum, frustrating advocates like Esha Marwaha, a 17-year-old Londoner whose online petition urging a strong climate emphasis drew 31,000 signatures.\u201cFor me education has been something that\u2019s opened my eyes completely to everything around me,\u201d she said. Of her climate activism, she added: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have done it had it not been for my classroom experiences.\u201d Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Test Prep Endures in New York Schools, Despite Calls to Ease It", "Date": "2014-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor several weeks, Reanna Bhola and her sixth-grade classmates at Intermediate School 126 in Astoria, Queens, spent part of nearly every day focused on test preparation. First it was reading, with sample passages, questions and review sheets mirroring the actual tests.Then came math. They did work sheets full of word problems from previous tests, and as the critical time came \u2014 three days of state math exams began on Wednesday \u2014 the students concentrated each day on test content, including double periods twice a week for what felt like \u201cevery second\u201d of class, Reanna said.Even over spring break, she said, her teacher asked the class to work on answering questions in under two minutes. \u201cEvery day, my teacher told me to at least spend 20 or 30 minutes practicing,\u201d she said.Ms. Fari\u00f1a\u2019s salvo against teaching to tests so quickly became a mantra that the State Legislature passed a law severely restricting the practice, adding New York to a short list of states trying to get a handle on the issue.But in interviews across the city this past month, students and teachers said that test prep was as robust as ever.Despite the appearance of a turned tide, teachers said, more than a decade of accountability-based reforms have so deeply changed the classroom that it would take a long time for the chancellor\u2019s message to have any effect. For one matter, state law now bases teachers\u2019 evaluations partly on test scores. For another, scores are still a factor in admissions to competitive middle and high schools.\u201cTeachers are doing more test prep because they are a little more fearful that what they teach in the classroom, even if it aligns with the curriculum, will not be reflected on the test,\u201d said Charlotte K. Steel, 27, who teaches seventh-grade math at Middle School 54 in Upper Manhattan, and who set aside several periods in the months leading up to the tests to help students get ready.\u201cFor me, I\u2019m worried because I want my students to feel successful,\u201d Ms. Steel said. \u201cTo my students, a lot of them really care how they do.\u201dIn April, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and state legislators passed a law, intended to take effect by the next school year, setting a 2 percent limit on the amount of classroom time that could be spent on test preparation, or about three and a half days in a school year. Charter schools are not obligated to comply, officials said.With the new law, the governor and legislators stumbled into deeper questions surrounding test preparation: First, what, exactly, is it? (The State Education Department was asked to define the practice.) At M.S. 447, in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, for example, some students read newspaper articles, which both kept them up with current events and helped them \u201cbuild stamina for the English test,\u201d Annie Smith, a seventh grader, said.Second, how bad is it?For years, he said, teachers leading Advanced Placement courses, or preparing students for state Regents exams, took pride \u201cin teaching to the test,\u201d because the tests were so good they forced students to master all the demanding material and synthesize it, not simply regurgitate it.But Mr. Tucker added, \u201cit is not at all clear\u201d whether the assessments being used in New York and some other states are a good reflection of the Common Core standards, which he supports.\u201cThere is far too much test prep if, by test prep, we mean setting aside good and challenging curriculum in order to prepare students for low-level tests of basic skills that rely on remembering facts and the rote application of procedures,\u201d he said.The nature of test prep varies by school. At I.S. 204 in Long Island City, Queens, some students estimated they had spent more than two-thirds of their English classes preparing for the reading test, which was given at the beginning of April.For the math tests, Oliver Greene, a sixth-grade student at M.S. 447, said he and his classmates were given mandatory packets to finish over spring break. Stamped \u201cCommon Core Learning Standards 2014,\u201d the packets were checked by teachers as soon as classes resumed, during a week already dominated by test preparation.Students at Public School/Intermediate School 276, in Lower Manhattan, also brought home packets, several parents said, though school leaders have tried to mitigate any stress by playing down the assignments: The work was not mandatory, and parents were not to pressure their children to finish.Even at M.S. 51 in Park Slope, Brooklyn, where Ms. Fari\u00f1a gave her December speech, students described withering test-prep regimens.\u201cFor about a month, all the English classes were devoted to test prep. The same with math,\u201d said Lucas Peterka, 13, who is in seventh grade at the school. \u201cIt\u2019s very stressful and a lot of work.\u201d\u201cTest prep is a big area of concern,\u201d Ms. Exstrom said.But Mr. Neill added, \u201cI fear these measures will be window dressing.\u201d\u201cNo matter what you do,\u201d he continued, \u201cthe definition of test prep is going to be vague, with lots of loopholes, and as long as there are high stakes attached, the word will still come down: \u2018Keep those test scores up.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAn Education Department spokeswoman this week did not make Ms. Fari\u00f1a available for comment on test prep in city schools. She has already taken some steps to reduce the importance of test scores, saying that they would no longer be the dominant factor in promotion decisions, and pledging to end the practice of assigning letter grades to schools. Still, even after her repeated suggestions, and sometimes admonitions, against test prep (\u201cIt has to end,\u201d she said in April), a quarter of elementary and middle school teachers surveyed recently by the New York City\u2019s teachers\u2019 union, the United Federation of Teachers, said they were spending more than five hours a week on test prep.The union\u2019s president, Michael Mulgrew, dismissed the argument that the practice was not necessarily harmful. \u201cTest prep is proven, over and over again, that it does not really lead to real acquired learning that stays with the child,\u201d Mr. Mulgrew said.Even so, many students and parents are actually clamoring for it, said Elisabeth Stephens, 36, a fifth-grade teacher at P.S. 59 in East Midtown, in part because scores still matter in admissions. \u201cI don\u2019t think there will ever be no test prep,\u201d Ms. Stephens said.Besides classroom practice, the school offered a test-prep club before and after school, beginning on March 3. The sessions included sample questions, as well as \u201crelaxation or refocusing techniques, for kids who might need to stand and stretch, or you know, \u2018How do you know when your mind is wandering?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ms. Stephens said.She added: \u201cWe try not to belabor the \u2018take another one, take another one, take another one.\u2019 Because they have three days of it coming up.\u201dAnn Farmer, Kyle Spencer and Julie Turkewitz contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Justices Seem Wary of Software Patent Case", "Date": "2014-03-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThough the case originated far from Silicon Valley, it has been closely watched as an indicator of how specific or abstract technical ideas can be to become eligible for patent protection. Patent claims over the way such ideas are incorporated into computers, cellphones and other devices have become a challenge for many high-tech companies.Most of the justices seemed skeptical about extending patent protection to the claimed invention at issue, a sort of computerized escrow mechanism that helps ensure that both sides in a transaction do what they have promised to do.But given the importance of the software industry in the information economy, the court also appeared wary of a misstep in announcing a general legal principle. The court\u2019s task, Justice Stephen G. Breyer said, was \u201cto go between Scylla and Charybdis.\u201dOn the one hand, Justice Breyer said, the court should not allow the patent system to stifle innovation. \u201cThere is a risk,\u201d he said, that \u201cinstead of having competition on price, service and better production methods, we\u2019ll have competition on who has the best patent lawyer.\u201cAnd if you go the other way and say never\u201d allow software patents, he went on, \u201cthen what you do is you rule out real inventions with computers.\u201dThe patents in question, owned by the Alice Corporation, outlined steps for mitigating settlement risks among multiple parties. The company\u2019s lawyer, Carter G. Phillips, pointed the justices to a flow chart in one of the briefs to explain how the method worked.Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. inspected it. \u201cJust looking at it,\u201d he said, \u201cit looks pretty complicated. There are a lot of arrows.\u201dBut Justice Anthony M. Kennedy asked whether \u201ca second-year college class in engineering\u201d or \u201cany computer group of people sitting around a coffee shop in Silicon Valley\u201d could convert the idea into computer code \u201cover a weekend.\u201d Mr. Phillips said yes, adding \u201cthat\u2019s true of almost any software.\u201dThe patents were challenged by CLS Bank International, which says it clears $5 trillion in foreign exchange transactions a day using methods to ensure that both sides performed. The Alice Corporation\u2019s patents, the bank said, merely recited \u201cthe fundamental economic concept of intermediated settlement of escrow.\u201dSeveral justices appeared to agree. Justice Breyer said the method had been around since the abacus and was used by his mother to keep him from overdrawing his checking account.\u201cThere is an abstract idea here,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s called solvency.\u201dThe justices considered only the threshold question of whether the Alice Corporation\u2019s ideas were eligible to be patented. The court has said that laws of nature, natural phenomena and abstract ideas do not qualify.Were Alice\u2019s ideas to make it over that hurdle, they would still be subject to challenges for obviousness, lack of novelty or indefiniteness. The initial step of patent eligibility, Mr. Phillips said, should be \u201ca very coarse filter.\u201dMark A. Perry, a lawyer for the bank, said Monday\u2019s case, the Alice Corporation v. CLS Bank International, No. 13-298, was similar to the 2010 case, Bilski v. Kappos. \u201cIt is hedging against credit default rather than price fluctuation, but it is simply hedging,\u201d he said.The Supreme Court also seemed likely to rule for the bank, though it was not clear how broadly. The justices did not seem inclined to adopt the aggressive approach urged by Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr., who argued in support of the bank and said that only a limited number of software patents should be recognized.Mr. Phillips said the government\u2019s approach would declare \u201cin one fell swoop hundreds of thousands of patents invalid.\u201dMr. Perry said the court needed only to apply its earlier decisions to find in his client\u2019s favor.\u201cThis is not the death of software patents,\u201d he said, citing supportive briefs filed in the case from prominent companies. \u201cThe software industry is all before this court saying, \u2018This is fine with us.\u2019 Every company in the United States practically, except for IBM, is saying go ahead. This will not affect software patents.\u201dJustice Kennedy asked Mr. Perry what sorts of business processes would remain eligible for patents under his theory. He rattled off a few: data compression, streaming video, encryption.Mr. Verrilli had a harder time providing an example, though he said \u201ca process for additional security point-of-sale credit card transactions using particular encryption technology \u2014 that might well be patent-eligible.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Measuring the Success of Health Reform", "Date": "2014-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThis is a remarkable turnaround that seemed unlikely after the health care exchanges operated by the federal government and by several states got off to a horrendous start in October and continued to suffer intermittent difficulties as late as Monday, the last official day for enrolling for coverage in 2014. The figures provide stark evidence of the pent-up demand for health insurance and the willingness of people to comply with a law that has been vilified by conservatives as a disaster for millions of Americans. The House speaker, John Boehner, has pledged to keep trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which he claimed is wreaking havoc on American families and the economy. But President Obama surely got it right when he said, \u201cThe debate over repealing this law is over. The Affordable Care Act is here to stay.\u201d The Congressional Budget Office projects that enrollment in the exchanges will grow to 22 million in 2016.Still, there is a lot we don\u2019t know yet, like how many people who signed up will actually pay their first month\u2019s premium (perhaps 80 percent to 90 percent by some estimates), what percentage of the enrollees are young and healthy (important for stabilizing the risk pools), how many of them were previously uninsured or poorly insured, and how many will be unhappy with their costs or choice of doctors. One big uncertainty is whether premiums, which rise every year to keep pace with rising medical costs, will increase more in 2015 with health reform than they would have without it. That will depend heavily on where a person lives and the local health insurance market, not on national enrollments and nationwide costs. Risk pools are set at the state level, and premiums are set for smaller geographic areas where competition and other local factors will play a big role. The law has already provided new coverage to millions of poor people in states that are expanding their Medicaid programs with the help of very generous federal matching funds. And it has also helped millions by reducing drug costs for chronically ill Medicare beneficiaries; allowing young adults to remain on their parents\u2019 policies; and providing preventive care without cost-sharing. The success of the Affordable Care Act will ultimately be measured by how much it reduces the number of uninsured, whether it improves the quality of care and lowers costs, and by its effects on employment and federal and state budgets. Some effects won\u2019t be known for years.In the meanwhile, Republicans and conservative political action groups are planning to make the repeal of health reform a major campaign issue in the midterm elections. Democrats will need to remind voters that many millions are already benefiting and millions more will be helped in coming years.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Carriages Belong in Central Park", "Date": "2014-04-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorI have been a New York City resident for over 20 years, and have enjoyed Central Park for as long. As a horse lover, I grew up riding and caring for two horses every summer on my aunt\u2019s small farm in County Armagh, Northern Ireland. I have continued to enjoy working with horses in a professional context over the years, appearing in a couple of Westerns and what I call \u201ccowboys in armor\u201d movies.I can appreciate a happy and well-cared-for horse when I see one. It has been my experience, always, that horses, much like humans, are at their happiest and healthiest when working. Horses have been pulling from the beginning of time. It is what they have been bred to do.Every horse must be licensed and pass a physical examination by a veterinarian twice a year; typically, the horses spend about six hours per day in the park. They cannot work in excessive cold or heat, and must also be furloughed for five weeks a year on a pasture in the country.New York\u2019s horse carriages have made an estimated six million trips in traffic over the last 30 years. In that time, just four horses have been killed as a result of collisions with motor vehicles, with no human fatalities. In contrast to the terrible toll of traffic accidents generally on New Yorkers, the carriage industry has a remarkable safety record.A majority of carriage drivers and stable hands are recent immigrants, often raised on farms in their home countries. They love their jobs and their horses, and they take pride in being ambassadors for this great city. I can\u2019t help but see the proposed ban as a class issue: Their livelihoods are now at risk because the animal-rights opponents of the industry are well funded by real-estate interests, which has led to speculation that this powerful lobby wishes to develop the West Side properties occupied by the stables.As a result, an entire way of life and a historic industry are under threat. We should ask whether this is the New York we want to live in: a sanitized metropolis, where local color and grit are thrown out in favor of sleek futuristic buildings and careening self-driving cars?I spent a number of years in my youth as an amateur boxer in Northern Ireland. Good boxers learn the art of shadow boxing: Understanding your moves and weaknesses helps you anticipate your opponents. In this ring, the carriage drivers are sparring in the dark. There is no discussion. No referee. Just unjustified accusations, made in a vacuum where one will win and another will lose.During my daily walks in the park, I talk to numerous New Yorkers, including police officers on their beat, about how we can save the industry. Some say that there\u2019s no reason an industry that has worked well for the last 150 years shouldn\u2019t continue for another 150. Others believe that there is an opportunity in this challenge.One such visionary is Mindy Levine, the wife of the New York Yankees president, Randy L. Levine. Her proposal is that the horse-drawn carriage business could coexist with riding stables and therapeutic riding facilities \u2014 all within the setting of Central Park itself. This would also provide access to equine-assisted therapy for children with autism and for the rehabilitation of troubled teenagers.Before we lose this signature element of New York\u2019s culture and history \u2014 instantly recognizable to the millions of tourists who visit our city and contribute to its economy \u2014 the least the mayor can do is come down to the stables and see how the horses are cared for. I urge Mr. de Blasio to meet the working men and women whose jobs are at stake and to start a dialogue that will safeguard a future for the horses that the majority of New Yorkers want.Liam Neeson is an actor who lives in New York.

The question for newcomers to a field has always been when to play along and when to push back.A culprit, many people in the field say, is a sexist, alpha-male culture that can make women and other people who don\u2019t fit the mold feel unwelcome, demeaned or even endangered.She added: \u201cA lot of times that makes me want to leave. But it\u2019s hard, because this is basically the only field that I\u2019ve ever known. And is it right for me to have to leave when I\u2019m not creating the problem?\u201dMs. Shevinsky never received death threats, but she experienced her share of come-ons and slights. A few days after Mr. Dickinson\u2019s \u201cIt is not misogyny\u201d tweet, she quit Glimpse. She had been aware of earlier cringe-making tweets in which her business partner had joked about rape or questioned even the most basic feminist precepts. (\u201cWomen\u2019s suffrage and individual freedom are incompatible. How\u2019s that for an unpopular truth?\u201d) Still, she admired Mr. Dickinson\u2019s technical skills and work ethic. Married and then 40, he was more experienced and serious about work than many other tech types she knew, and she said he always treated her with respect.But after the Twitter controversy, she decided that she just couldn\u2019t work with him anymore.Ms. Shevinsky\u2019s epiphany, however, wasn\u2019t just about Mr. Dickinson or a couple of engineers. It was about computer-engineering culture and her relationship with it. She had enjoyed being \u201cone of the bros\u201d \u2014 throwing back whiskey and rubbing shoulders with M.I.T. graduates. And if that sometimes meant fake-laughing as her colleagues cracked jokes about porn, so be it.\u201cFor years, all I wanted to do was work and code and make software,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cThat\u2019s why I didn\u2019t care about feminism. I just wanted to build stuff.\u201d\u201cBut Titstare showed me that was no longer a viable option,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had to address our culture, because something was really not working.\u201dTwo days after the TechCrunch show, Business Insider forced Mr. Dickinson to resign. The Australian entrepreneurs and TechCrunch each apologized. But incidents like these aren\u2019t exceptional.\u201cBut I think there\u2019s probably a simpler reason,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich is these guys are just jerks, and women know it.\u201dThe choice for people who are uncomfortable with the \u201cbro\u201d culture is to try to change it or to leave \u2014 and even women who are fed up don\u2019t always agree on how to go about making a change. But leaving can be hard too.\u201cThere was only one thing I wanted to do,\u201d Ms. Shevinsky said. \u201cBe the C.E.O. of Glimpse.\u201dA Bright BeginningWhen Ms. Shevinsky was introduced to engineering culture at Williams College, she got no hint of sexism. A political theory major, she learned to code from a boyfriend, and she described their engineer friends as \u201cforward-thinking feminists.\u201dShe worked in product development for a number of start-ups and was a co-founder of a dating site. She settled in New York, where she got to know Mr. Dickinson at tech meet-ups. When she had a new business idea \u2014 a kind of Snapchat for adults that prevents people from taking screen shots of private pictures \u2014 she sought out his advice.Last spring, they decided to build the app together. At first, they conceived it as a sexting product, but later they shifted to a service that could be used by anyone concerned about keeping their messages safe from prying eyes. They called it Glimpse.By August, Ms. Shevinsky had closed her dating site to work on Glimpse. Mr. Dickinson, who had his full-time job at Business Insider, helped when he could.\u201cI remember thinking just that I was so lucky that Pax was going to work with me,\u201d Ms. Shevinsky said. \u201cAt the time I was still relatively unknown, and he was one of the best technologists I\u2019d met.\u201dTech\u2019s biggest companies say that recruiting women is a priority. \u201cIf we do that, there\u2019s no question we\u2019ll more than double the rate of technology output in the world,\u201d Larry Page, the chief executive of Google, said last spring. Yet at Google, less than a fifth of the engineers are women.Sexism exists in many places, but start-up companies have particular qualities that can allow problems to go unchecked. The lines between work and social life are often blurry, because people tend to be young and to work long hours, and the founders and first employees are often friends. And start-ups pride themselves on a lack of bureaucracy, forgoing big-company layers like human resources departments. They say they can move faster that way, without becoming bogged down in protocol.\u201cIf there is no structure, that\u2019s actually more harmful to marginalized people,\u201d Ms. Horvath said in an interview while she still worked at GitHub. \u201cIt\u2019s just unprofessional. Tech needs to grow up in a lot of ways.\u201dAt GitHub, Ms. Horvath, who was the only female developer at the company when she started, said she once declined a romantic relationship with one of her co-workers. Then, she said, she discovered that code she had written had disappeared. The man, she said, had ripped it out.\u201cIt makes a hostile environment for me,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to raise my hand and call negative attention toward myself, and become the woman who is the problem \u2014 \u2018that woman.\u2019 In start-up culture they protect their own tribe, so by putting my hand up, I\u2019m saying I\u2019m an \u2018other,\u2019 I shouldn\u2019t be there, so for me that\u2019s an economic threat.\u201dMs. Horvath eventually decided that it was worth the risk, and quit. She said the people who mistreated her included a founder of the company.At bigger companies, women say harassment may be easier to stop but that other, subtler forms of sexism persist.\u201cIn engineering, whoever owns the code, they have the power,\u201d said Ana Redmond, a software engineer. When she worked as a senior engineer at a big company, Expedia, she said she was constantly underestimated by male colleagues and suffered because she was not willing to leave her children to work the hours needed to \u201cown the code.\u201dIn a statement, Expedia said Ms. Redmond had not raised these concerns during her tenure. The company added that it now has programs to develop and retain female talent; it also has a goal to double the number of women in roles at the vice-president level and higher by 2020.A \u2018Boy-Puerile Atmosphere\u2019After she quit Glimpse, Ms. Shevinsky began looking for a job outside the start-up world. Mr. Dickinson, no longer at Business Insider, made it his mission to persuade her to return. Glimpse had no office and little money, so they met at TGI Friday\u2019s and at a dive bar that served $5 beer.The conversations started at a deadlock.\u201cThere was the one where Pax said, \u2018I got to keep tweeting, I got to keep tweeting,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ms. Shevinsky recalled. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to come back to Glimpse if we both weren\u2019t going to be taking it seriously. I remember telling Pax that his tweets were going to be very expensive for us.\u201dSocial media, where people carefully build their public personas, often become bullhorns for offensive comments.After the Titstare presentation, a commenter calling himself White_N_Nerdy wrote on Reddit, \u201cI\u2019m honestly trying to understand why anyone says that females are \u2018needed\u2019 in the tech industry.\u201d He continued: \u201cThe tech community works fine without females, just like any other mostly male industry. Feminists probably just want women making more money.\u201dOnline gathering spots for engineers, like Reddit, Hacker News and 4chan, where people often post anonymously, can feel like hostile territory for women.\u201cMany women have come to me and said they basically have had to hide on the Net now,\u201d said Mr. Weinstein, who works on issues of identity and anonymity online. \u201cThey use male names, they don\u2019t put their real photos up, because they are immediately targeted and harassed.\u201dWriting code is a high-pressure job with little room for error, as are many jobs. But coding can be stressful in a different way, women interviewed for this article said, because code reviews \u2014 peer reviews to spot mistakes in software \u2014 can quickly devolve.\u201cCode reviews are brutal \u2014 \u2018Mine is better than yours, I see flaws in yours\u2019 \u2014 and they should be, for the creation of good software,\u201d said Ellen Ullman, a software engineer and author. \u201cI think when you add a drop of women into it, it just exacerbates the problem, because here\u2019s a kind of foreigner.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in no way saying that women can\u2019t take a tough code review,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m saying that no one should have to take one in a boy-puerile atmosphere.\u201dStill on the DefensiveLate last fall, Ms. Shevinsky and Mr. Dickinson flew together from a tech conference in California back to New York. When Ms. Shevinsky awoke from a nap, Mr. Dickinson asked her to look at a letter he had written on his iPad about the Titstare episode and his comments on Twitter about women.\u201cIt was a lapse in judgment and I\u2019m entirely responsible for that,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI sincerely and unreservedly apologize to anyone I offended.\u201dFor both of them, the letter was the turning point. \u201cThe biggest thing was Pax realizing he was a public figure and the responsibilities that came with that,\u201d Ms. Shevinsky said. \u201cHe wrote the apology letter, and it was very genuine and moving and impactful for me.\u201dMs. Shevinsky returned to Glimpse in December. But first Mr. Dickinson had to make some promises. Ms. Shevinsky would be the chief executive and the public face of the company. She would have to sign off on what he said on social media and in press interviews \u2014 as she did when he was interviewed for this article. And the company would add a second mission statement supporting women in tech, including through hiring.\u201cI have come to realize there are problems with sexism in technology through all this,\u201d Mr. Dickinson wrote in an interview over email.Nonetheless, he wasn\u2019t retreating from his public tweets. Rather, he said, the media had portrayed him in a way that didn\u2019t capture his full personality.\u201cI am not just my tweets, and I never was,\u201d he wrote in the email interview. \u201cThe caricature that\u2019s been painted of me isn\u2019t accurate. I realized after all this that many of my tweets came off meanspirited in a way I never intended, hence my apology.\u201dBut the debate isn\u2019t over. In fact, Ms. Shevinsky now finds herself in another argument. This time, however, she\u2019s on the defensive with other women.A prominent feminist in tech told her that she was doing a disservice to women by accepting Mr. Dickinson\u2019s apology and working with him again. The conversation, Ms. Shevinsky said, was \u201chateful.\u201dMs. Shevinsky says that she judges Mr. Dickinson \u201con his actions, how he is with other people in the company and with me,\u201d and said that there was no contradiction in both working with Mr. Dickinson and supporting feminism in tech.\u201cI care very, very much about women in tech, and I believe the best thing I can do is change the face of what it looks like and be one of the first women to build a billion-dollar social networking company,\u201d she said with entrepreneurial brio.There are strong differences of opinion, even among women in tech, about how to make the culture more welcoming. Many people at tech companies say it\u2019s important to hire women as engineers at the founding of a company and include women in management and in all job interviews.But some women argue that these kinds of initiatives are unhelpful.\u201cMy general issue with the coverage of women in tech is that women in the technology press are talked about in the context of being women, and men are talked about in the context of being in technology,\u201d said a technical woman who would speak only on condition of anonymity because she did not want to be part of an article about women in tech.\u201cI\u2019m also very good at my job, and as a technologist, I want to be recognized for that and not because I have breasts.\u201d\u201cAs a woman,\u201d she wrote, \u201cI find it insulting and patronizing to be viewed that way.\u201dAnother camp discourages emphasizing complaints about sexism. Rather, they try to focus on positive stories, to encourage women to enter the industry.\u201cPeople should say something if something bad happens, but I also want people to know that doesn\u2019t have to be the case,\u201d she said.For Ms. Shevinsky, the solution was returning to tech and trying to change the culture from the inside. And part of the reason she decided to work with Mr. Dickinson again, she said, was that both believe in another type of diversity: the diversity of thought.\u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous for us as a community,\u201d she said, \u201cto say we will only work with people who share our beliefs.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Protecting Spain's Small Victories", "Date": "2014-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical EconomySpain\u2019s recovery is clouded by politics. Mariano Rajoy has achieved a lot in the two-plus years he has been prime minister. Growth has finally returned; even unemployment is falling. But as Spain enters a new electoral cycle, the appetite for reform is waning. What is more, there is a big question mark about what will happen after the next election, which has to be held by March 2016.Mr. Rajoy cannot claim the largest share of the credit for Spain\u2019s economic turnaround. That belongs to Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, whose \u201cdo whatever it takes\u201d speech in mid-2012 was the beginning of the end of the euro crisis.However, Mr. Rajoy\u2019s center-right government has doggedly pursued reform. Most important, it has liberalized the labor market and cleaned up the banks. As a result, competitiveness has been restored and exports are booming. Meanwhile, conditions in global financial markets have been benign. Investors no longer fear a breakup of the euro zone, but are scared of blowups in emerging markets. As a result, they have returned to peripheral euro zone markets, such as Spain. Madrid\u2019s 10-year bond yield is now only 3.2 percent \u2014 down from 4.2 percent at the start of the year and a far cry from the 7.6 percent in July 2012.In the same way that Spain suffered from a vicious spiral during the downturn, it is now enjoying something of a virtuous cycle. Speculative capital is back. The government, for example, was able in February to offload a chunk of stock in Bankia, a bank that until recently was a byword for everything wrong with Spanish finance.Investors are also hunting for bargains in a property market where values have collapsed in recent years. There is still an overhang of unsold properties that were built at a dizzying rate during the bubble. But in some parts of Madrid, prices seem to have bottomed out.Although banks over all are still reducing debt, credit is beginning to flow to healthy businesses and new channels of nonbank finance are being opened up. The government has also passed a reform that makes it easier to restructure corporate debts by, for example, converting them into equity. As a result, some of the zombie companies that are haunting the Spanish economy could be revived.The official unemployment rate is still an eye-popping 25.6 percent. But unemployment is falling extremely early in this cycle. It dipped late last year after gross domestic product grew only 0.1 percent in the third quarter and 0.2 percent in the final quarter. The changed behavior of unemployment is almost certainly the result of the labor reform.With consumer confidence returning, domestic demand is also creeping back. As a result of all these factors, economists have been pushing up their growth forecasts to 1 percent to 1.5 percent for this year and 1.5 percent to 2 percent for next near.Such numbers are fantastic, compared with where Spain stood two years ago. But unless the recovery is long and strong \u2014 which is unlikely, given that deleveraging economies rarely grow fast \u2014 unemployment could still get stuck at unacceptably high levels.It is, therefore, vital that wages stay low as the economy recovers and Madrid continues to encourage employment. One government policy that should help is that of making it harder for people to get access to benefits if they do not take jobs.Another plan, the details of which are being thrashed out, is to cut the tax on employment and recoup the revenue by putting up consumption taxes. An ambitious reform on these lines, a so-called \u201cfiscal devaluation,\u201d would give a further incentive for companies to hire workers.There are two worries. One is that the government will use the tax reform as a way to increase revenue. It certainly needs to do more to cut its fiscal deficit, which was 6.6 percent last year before counting the cost of bailing out banks. But it would be better to close the gap by cutting spending, rather than raising taxes.This leads into the second worry. Elections are only two years away. As a result, Mr. Rajoy\u2019s desire to push through more unpopular overhauls may be waning. Pundits in Madrid, which I visited recently, think the tax overhaul may be the last in this electoral cycle. It would be a huge shame if it were watered down.Strong government is one explanation why Spain has picked itself up faster than Italy, which has been bedeviled by fractious coalitions, despite starting in a worse place. But looking forward, political conditions in Madrid could be about to get almost as murky as those in Rome.For a start, momentum is building in Catalonia for independence. The central government is dead set against this, arguing that the Catalan government\u2019s plan for a referendum as soon as this year is unconstitutional. In the circumstances, it is hard to see any of the Catalan independence parties supporting either Mr. Rajoy\u2019s conservatives or the socialists in a national coalition.This would not matter if either of the two traditional governing parties were likely to win an overall majority at the next election. But both have been doing poorly in the opinion polls, something that will probably be confirmed in European Parliament elections next month.As a result, there is a risk that Spain could struggle to put together a stable government, starting in 2016. That makes it all the more important to be ambitious with reforms now.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Effect Inspiring Few to Seek Office", "Date": "2014-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEric Lesser, a candidate for the Massachusetts State Senate, is one of the few participants of the promised Obama political generation.LUDLOW, Mass. \u2014 Eric Lesser was shaking hands with diners in a Portuguese restaurant last week when he spotted the owner of Manny\u2019s TV & Appliances. \u201cOh, I\u2019ve got to get a picture,\u201d Mr. Lesser eagerly said, draping his arm over Manny Rovithis, whose low-budget commercials have run for decades in Western Massachusetts. Mr. Lesser\u2019s giddiness about meeting the local celebrity had not faded when he sat down for lunch.\u201cAwesome,\u201d he said.Although Mr. Lesser spent much of the last six years in the company of President Obama and Washington hotshots, now, as an earnest, hug-prone 29-year-old candidate for the Massachusetts State Senate, he is far more interested in people like Mr. Rovithis. Which is a good thing. Mr. Lesser, a former White House staff member, has returned home on the path Mr. Obama hoped to inspire many of his young supporters to follow when he said, \u201cWe are the ones we have been waiting for.\u201dBut if Mr. Lesser, who is on leave from Harvard Law School to run for office, is the face of the promised Obama political generation, he is also one of its few participants. For all the talk about the movement that elected Mr. Obama, the more notable movement of Obama supporters has been away from politics. It appears that few of the young people who voted for him, and even fewer Obama campaign and administration operatives, have decided to run for office. Far more have joined the high-paid consultant ranks.Unlike John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan, who inspired virtual legislatures of politicians and became generational touchstones, Mr. Obama has so far had little such influence. That is all the more remarkable considering he came to office tapping into spirit of volunteerism and community service that pollsters say is widespread and intense among young people. Mr. Obama has come to represent that spirit, but he has failed, pollsters say, to transform it into meaningful engagement in the political process.\u201cIf you were to call it an Obama generation, there was a window,\u201d said John Della Volpe, the director of polling at the Institute of Politics at Harvard University. \u201cThat opportunity has been lost.\u201d He said the youth who came of voting age around the time of the 2008 election have since lost interest in electoral politics, and pointed to a survey he conducted last year among 18- to 29-year-olds. Although 70 percent said they considered community service an honorable endeavor, only 35 percent said the same about running for office.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing the younger cohort is even less connected with him generally, with his policies, as well as politics generally,\u201d Mr. Della Volpe added, referring to Mr. Obama. Sergio Bendixen, who worked as a pollster for Mr. Obama, blamed a social media-addled generation accustomed to instant gratification for the drop-off. After getting swept up by the Obama movement of 2008, he said, \u201cThey went on to the next website and then the next click on their computer. I just don\u2019t see the generation as all that ideological or invested in causes for the long run.\u201dMr. Lesser, who once worked down the hall from the Oval Office as a special assistant to David Axelrod, Mr. Obama\u2019s former chief strategist, is well aware that he is both an exemplar and exception of the Obama generation.\u201cIf you want to be involved in politics, at a certain point you\u2019ve got to walk the walk,\u201d said Mr. Lesser, who oversaw all the staff and reporter luggage during the 2008 campaign. (\u201cI never lost one bag,\u201d he likes to tell voters. \u201cNo one can say Eric Lesser doesn\u2019t deliver.\u201d)Mr. Lesser admits, however, that it is tempting to watch the new lives of many of his White House peers, among them Mr. Obama\u2019s former chief speechwriter, Jon Favreau, and all the others who have gone into consulting.\u201cMy buddies are posting pictures on Facebook of zooming around Davos,\u201d Mr. Lesser said, though he added that those who had gone that avenue had \u201cmissed the point a little bit. I think that if I wanted to get rich, politics wouldn\u2019t have been the route I would have gone down.\u201dInstead, he spoke about how Mr. Obama\u2019s return to Chicago to run for the Illinois State Senate after graduating from Harvard Law resonated with him. He said his Washington friends supported his decision to go back home, although some, he said, told him it was \u201clame.\u201dMr. Lesser is not entirely alone, and White House officials hopefully point to the scattering of young Obama veterans running for or already holding office around the country. \u201cI expect to see more of them,\u201d Mr. Axelrod said.By the time Mr. Lesser left the White House in July 2011, he had the grandiose title of director of strategic planning for the White House Council of Economic Advisers. Now he promotes his direct link to Washington\u2019s power brokers as a way to help his district fix broken roads, fight drug use and improve the local economy. On Tuesday evening, he hopes to get some pointers from the president himself at the White House Passover Seder, which Mr. Lesser first organized and always returns to Washington to help lead.Mr. Lesser also gets strategic advice from Mr. Axelrod. \u201cI tell him to stay close to home, focus on local communities, talk about it from the bottom up,\u201d Mr. Axelrod said. David Plouffe, the senior White House adviser who ran Mr. Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign, has counseled Mr. Lesser on field operations. Geoffrey Garin, a prominent Democratic pollster, threw him a fund-raiser. Chris Hughes, a Facebook co-founder who he knew from Harvard and the 2008 Obama race, contributes to his campaign.Hardly least, the White House political office did not object to his use of the president\u2019s image on his fliers. \u201cI started off carrying his bags,\u201d it says above the smiling heads of the president and Mr. Lesser. Splashed across their midsections it adds, \u201cI ended up working for his Council of Economic Advisers.\u201dBut on the ground, Mr. Lesser seems very much like the handful of other Democrats running in a September primary, just younger. On a recent morning, as he spoke to the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers about his grandfather\u2019s work as a longshoreman and his father\u2019s stint as a union organizer, Mr. Lesser learned that one of the burly 12 men who had come to hear him speak also spelled Eric with a \u201cc.\u201d\u201cAwesome, me too,\u201d Mr. Lesser said.Other times he gamely embraced the oddities of campaigns. In the town of Wilbraham, Mr. Lesser toured FloDesign Inc., a technology firm, and marveled at the work it was doing in biological research, using the ovary cells of a species called the Chinese hamster. Then he stopped to pose with the recipient of an office prize \u2014 a \u201cstuffed ovary\u201d that vaguely resembled a stuffed, oval-shaped animal \u2014 and which read \u201cova achievers.\u201dMr. Lesser then headed to a polling place for a local election, where he encountered Debra Boronski, the Republican nominee whom Mr. Lesser hopes to face in November.

{"Headline": "Japan Ends Decades-Long Ban on Export of Weapons", "Date": "2014-04-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Taking his nation another step away from its postwar pacifism, the government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe discarded a nearly half-century ban on the export of weapons and military hardware on Tuesday, a move aimed at helping Japan assume a larger regional security role to offset China\u2019s growing military might.The decision, which had been under consideration for years before Mr. Abe took office, replaced the self-imposed ban dating to the late 1960s with new, still-restrictive guidelines that permit the export of weapons only to allies and partners that agree not to sell them to third nations without Japanese approval. The new guidelines will also make it easier for Japan to join multinational development projects for expensive new weapons systems, like the American-led effort to build the F-35 stealth fighter jet.Adopted in 1967, the three principles originally prohibited arms sales to Communist nations, countries under United Nations sanctions and countries in armed conflict, but it eventually grew into a blanket ban on all weapons exports.Analysts said getting rid of the principles was partly aimed at opening new markets for Japanese defense companies at a time when Japan\u2019s own military spending, while up for the first time in a decade, remained severely constrained by ballooning budget deficits. But they said Mr. Abe had finally decided to carry out the long-discussed change to achieve a larger strategic goal: augmenting Japan\u2019s regional influence by offering its technologically sophisticated defense hardware to other countries locked in territorial disputes with an increasingly assertive China.Analysts described the decision as a step toward Mr. Abe\u2019s goal of turning long-passive Japan, which has Asia\u2019s second-largest economy after China, into a more proactive player in regional security. Japanese officials say Mr. Abe wants to do this by turning Japan into a full-fledged defense partner of the United States, which has guaranteed Japan\u2019s security since the war but has recently been forced to cut military spending because of fiscal problems of its own.American officials, who have long urged Japan to assume more of the defense burden, have said they would welcome a lifting of the ban.Japan is reacting to a shifting balance of power in the Asia-Pacific region brought by a relative decline in American dominance and a rapid military buildup by China, analysts say. One of Japan\u2019s responses has been to build military ties with nations other than the United States, including Australia and India. Analysts said ending the ban would help expand those ties by removing legal obstacles to proposed deals, including sales of Japanese-made diesel attack submarines to Australia and seaplanes to India.Tuesday\u2019s move will also make it easier for Japan to provide military aid to less developed Southeast Asian countries that would help them respond to Chinese claims to contested territories in the South China Sea. This strategy, known as capacity building, has also been adopted by the United States to check China\u2019s territorial ambitions while avoiding a direct confrontation between Washington and Beijing.Japan has already been doing this to a limited degree, by supplying civilian coast guard ships to the Philippines, which is locked in a dispute with China over control of uninhabited islands. Experts said Tuesday\u2019s move would make it easier for Japan to provide military equipment to help not only the Philippines but also Vietnam and Indonesia enforce their claims. They said the decision may also be an early step toward Japan\u2019s eventually forming military alliances with Southeast Asian countries or dispatching warships to jointly patrol contested waters.Two of Japan\u2019s neighbors were cautious in their remarks about Tuesday\u2019s decision. A Chinese government spokesman said his country was watching the move. A spokesman for the South Korean Foreign Ministry said the change \u201cshould be carried out with the maximum level of transparency in consideration of concerns by neighboring countries,\u201d according to the Kyodo News agency of Japan.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Looks for Midterm Advantage on Job Training and Immigration", "Date": "2014-04-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOAKDALE, Pa. \u2014 President Obama, seeking to shore up support for midterm elections that threaten to cost his party control of the Senate, vowed Wednesday to improve federal job training programs and chastised Republicans for blocking an overhaul of immigration law.Returning to favorite domestic issues, Mr. Obama visited this Pittsburgh suburb, where he met up with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to announce nearly $600 million in job training grants. He separately issued a statement attacking House Republicans for \u201cseemingly preferring the status quo of a broken immigration system.\u201dThe twin messages were aimed at constituencies critical to the Democratic strategy for this year\u2019s congressional campaigns as the party battles expectations that it may lose its Senate majority. But Mr. Obama\u2019s words also underscored the sense that the White House is unlikely to reach any kind of agreement with House Republicans on major initiatives between now and the November elections.The House has already passed an overhaul of job training programs, but Mr. Obama ignored it on Wednesday to focus on what he can do without congressional approval through his executive power. He announced nearly $500 million in grants for community colleges that team with businesses and trade associations to provide specialized skills and a separate competition for $100 million in grants for apprenticeship programs.\u201cThe bottom line is if you\u2019re willing to put in the work to get a job or earn a promotion in today\u2019s economy, America\u2019s job training system should give you every possible chance,\u201d Mr. Obama said during a visit with Mr. Biden to the West Hills Center campus of the Community College of Allegheny County.Speaker John A. Boehner said through a spokesman that Mr. Obama was needlessly replicating Republican efforts.\u201cWhen it comes to skills training, our first priority should be reforming our current, outdated maze of programs so that they make sense for people in today\u2019s dynamic economy,\u201d Brendan Buck, the spokesman, said by email. \u201cThat\u2019s why the House has passed the Skills Act, and we urge the president to work with us to get a bipartisan bill to his desk.\u201dThe two sides also quarreled over immigration. A day after meeting with immigration advocates, Mr. Obama released a statement critical of House Republicans, saying that they \u201chave repeatedly failed\u201d to fix the immigration system. He urged them to pass a bipartisan Senate bill introduced a year ago.\u201cThe majority of Americans are ahead of House Republicans on this crucial issue, and there is broad support for reform, including among Democrats and Republicans, labor and business, and faith and law enforcement leaders,\u201d Mr. Obama said.After releasing the statement, Mr. Obama called Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader, to talk about immigration. The call evidently did not go well.\u201cAfter five years, President Obama still has not learned how to effectively work with Congress to get things done,\u201d Mr. Cantor said in a statement. \u201cYou do not attack the very people you hope to engage in a serious dialogue.\u201dMr. Cantor said the Senate bill \u201cwill not be considered in the House\u201d and urged Mr. Obama to move on to \u201cother issues where we can find common ground,\u201d a reflection of the divisions within his own Republican caucus on immigration and the party leadership\u2019s inability to forge a consensus.A White House official said that Mr. Obama actually called Mr. Cantor to wish him a happy Passover and that the subject of immigration came up. \u201cThe call was pleasant, and I\u2019m surprised the staff readout didn\u2019t reflect that,\u201d said the official, who declined to be identified discussing the private call.Mr. Obama made his attack a day after meeting with immigration advocates who pressed him to use his powers to curb what they called excessive and abusive deportations. After the president\u2019s statement was released Wednesday, some advocates said they were unsatisfied because he focused only on legislation.\u201cBut in the absence of that reform, the president can and should take bold executive action. Period,\u201d she said.Emmarie Huetteman reported from Oakdale, Pa., and Peter Baker from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Governor With Eye on 2016 Finds His Rise Under Scrutiny", "Date": "2014-04-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySTURTEVANT, Wis. \u2014 Scott Walker is nothing if not consistent.From his time as a local official in Milwaukee a decade ago to his explosive first year as governor of Wisconsin in 2011, Mr. Walker, a Republican, has deviated little from a platform to spend less, tax less and rein in the power of public sector unions.Again and again, Mr. Walker has shown a rare aptitude for recognizing and seizing ripe political opportunities, and he has advanced himself in ways that have him being mentioned with Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio and former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida as possible Republican contenders for the presidency in 2016.But with the prospect of an even higher office on the horizon, Mr. Walker finds his earlier track record under increasing scrutiny, not only for how closely it hews to conservative principles but also for the criminal convictions of some staff members and the release of staff emails that included racial and ethnic slurs.That investigation exposed the insensitive email exchanges among his aides, like this chain email forwarded by a former chief of staff in the county office: \u201cI can handle being a black, disabled, one-armed, drug-addicted, Jewish homosexual on a pacemaker who is H.I.V.-positive, bald, orphaned, unemployed, lives in a slum, and has a Mexican boyfriend, but please, Oh dear God, please don\u2019t tell me I\u2019m a Democrat!\u201dMr. Walker has distanced himself from the conduct and denied knowledge of the campaign work being done, and he was not charged. But there were more disclosures.But if anything has defined Mr. Walker\u2019s political life over the past decade, it was his drive to limit unions just six weeks into his tenure as governor in 2011, a move foretold in his years as Milwaukee County executive. Although Mr. Walker had made it clear as a candidate for governor that unions could expect to see change, his critics say he never made clear the extent of his intentions until he was elected.But as county executive, he also clashed with public-sector unions, calling for 35-hour workweeks instead of 40, with corresponding reductions in compensation. He pushed to privatize cleaning and food-service workers. He demanded spending cuts and battled openly with the Board of Supervisors in a county that leaned Democratic. At one point, he went so far as to suggest that the county government itself might be abolished as a way to spare waste.\u201cIt came from eight years of being a county executive,\u201d he said in a recent interview in this southern Wisconsin village. \u201cNobody needed to tell me what needed to be done. Anytime I had a reasonable option, I\u2019d get shot down by the public-employee union leaders who would rather lay off hundreds of people before they would take even a 35-hour workweek. So I had just grown so frustrated with them throughout the process that I said, \u2018Something\u2019s got to change.\u2019\u00a0\u201dMr. Walker, the son of a Baptist preacher, was drawn to politics at seemingly every turn. An Eagle Scout, he came of age during the administration of Ronald Reagan, whom Mr. Walker describes as a hero of his.He lost a hard-fought race for student government president at Marquette University, and eventually withdrew without a degree \u2014 an issue that is now drawing extra scrutiny. The last president without a college degree was Harry Truman. Mr. Walker and his wife, Tonette, have two sons in college, and he has said lately that he was thinking about finishing the remaining credits.\u201cHonestly, I can\u2019t remember a time other than maybe that first year where we weren\u2019t in a fight with him,\u201d said David Eisner, who helped lead a union of county workers at the time. \u201cHe seemed like a guy on a mission.\u201dBy 2009, Mr. Walker said, frustrations led him to run for governor. \u201cI just had had it with where the economy was,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought the state was headed in the wrong direction.\u201dMr. Walker\u2019s practical message \u2014 delivered in unadorned terms and his nasal, Wisconsin flatness \u2014 matched the moment of financial crisis in a state that Barack Obama had carried in 2008 and would again in 2012. Mr. Walker regularly mentioned his daily lunch along the campaign trail: two ham-and-cheese sandwiches from home. Plain fare for austere times.Yet it was also the 2010 campaign for governor, when Mr. Walker was county executive, that has raised questions about his choices of top staff members.The conservative Wisconsin radio commentator Jerry Bader, a supporter of Mr. Walker, said the governor must \u201cbecome more selective\u201d about who is around him. \u201cWhatever his future plans are,\u201d Mr. Bader said in an interview, \u201cI think they are limited if he doesn\u2019t fix this weakness.\u201dOne embarrassing email exchange involved Kelly M. Rindfleisch, Mr. Walker\u2019s deputy chief of staff in Milwaukee. She received a message from a friend who joked about a photo of four dogs who might qualify for welfare because they were \u201cmixed in color, unemployed, lazy, can\u2019t speak English and have no frigging clue who their Daddys are.\u201d\u201cThat is hilarious,\u201d Ms. Rindfleisch answered: \u201cAnd so true.\u201dMr. Walker said his staff now underwent an elaborate training process and was required to sign a code of conduct that includes strict ethics laws and a standard of professionalism. \u201cWe apply that across the board,\u201d he said.There is a second, continuing investigation into spending by conservative groups during the Wisconsin recall election in 2012. Under Wisconsin law, no one involved is permitted to discuss the secret investigation.\u201cWe probably have faced more scrutiny than anyone in elected office anywhere in the country, at least anyone at the state or federal level,\u201d Mr. Walker said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little surreal. But it is what it is. I just keep my head up and chin forward and keep moving the pathway forward.\u201dStill, Mr. Walker has a more immediate race ahead.Ms. Burke, too, is walking a delicate political line in a state that chose to keep Mr. Walker after all the uproar over unions: She is looking to traditional Democrats, including unions, for support and has voiced support for collective bargaining. But she has not promised to repeal Mr. Walker\u2019s law that all but ended collective bargaining for public sector workers here.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bankruptcy Beyond the Potholes", "Date": "2014-04-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialCongress is lurching toward its standard emergency, edge-of-the-cliff deal for the federal Highway Trust Fund, which could run short of money as early as August. The fund pays for the nation\u2019s vitally needed road and transit projects and has operated on an 18.4-cents-per-gallon federal gasoline tax that hasn\u2019t been raised since 1993. Now it is running on fumes, raising about $39 billion a year but facing shortfalls of close to $20 billion annually as more efficient cars pay less into the fund while infrastructure repair costs rise.Worried lawmakers and administration officials are warning that road and transit projects could be halted in a matter of months and hundreds of thousands of construction workers left without paychecks unless Congress comes up with a viable solution soon. Without a long-term solution, planning, building and repairing infrastructure on state and local levels must inevitably suffer, transportation officials are warning. Increasingly, states have debated raising their own taxes to assure at least some continuity in transportation projects as Congress dawdles. Representative Dave Camp, the Michigan Republican who oversees the Ways and Means Committee, has talked about a tax code change to tax profits repatriated from abroad as a revenue source for the highway fund. While this idea has good bipartisan potential, it seems unlikely to happen given Congress\u2019s default mode of gamesmanship and procrastination.\u201cWe\u2019re running out of time,\u201d said Senator Barbara Boxer, the California Democrat who leads the public works committee, of the need to find a multiyear solution. A more stable, six-year plan sought by some lawmakers would require an additional $100 billion to cover trust fund shortfalls, according to congressional budget officials.Two years ago, lawmakers raided general budget revenues to plaster a patch on the highway trust fund until Sept. 30 of this year. Congress has very little time left to come up with something better than last-minute fiscal sleight of hand.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "France Overhauls Its Government After Voters Rebuke Socialists", "Date": "2014-03-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France announced the formation of a new government on Monday, after broad losses by his Socialist Party in recent nationwide city elections that were widely seen as a rebuke to the deeply unpopular president.Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault presented his resignation, along with those of the other ministers in his government, earlier in the day.Mr. Hollande replaced Mr. Ayrault with Manuel Valls, currently the interior minister, who has made a name for himself as a stern proponent of law and order in a political party that is sometimes accused of leniency or na\u00efvet\u00e9. Mr. Valls is also considered the most popular politician of the left, though his sharp tone, especially on immigration, has on occasion reminded leftists of their opponents on the right.\u201cThe message you\u2019ve sent me, I\u2019ve received it personally,\u201d Mr. Hollande said in a televised address. He promised a \u201ccombat government\u201d that would be charged with \u201cgiving strength back to the economy,\u201d and announced reductions in corporate and payroll taxes.Mr. Ayrault, a former schoolteacher and longtime mayor of Nantes, had served as prime minister since Mr. Hollande\u2019s arrival in power in May 2012. He oversaw the government\u2019s attempts to revive a no-growth economy and cut unemployment, while simultaneously trimming a budget deficit well in excess of the European Union limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product. Those efforts have been widely seen as marginally successful, at best.\u201cThis vote, as much on a local level as on the national level, is a defeat for the government and the majority,\u201d Mr. Ayrault said in an uncharacteristically frank statement on Sunday. \u201cI think we have not done enough to explain that the recovery efforts undertaken since 2012 were essential for the future of our country.\u201dThough the deficit has come down somewhat, growth has only barely returned, with G.D.P. increasing 0.3 percent last year. Unemployment has continued to rise, reaching 11 percent nationwide and more than twice that number among workers under 25. Adding to the pile of bad news for Mr. Hollande, the state statistics agency said on Monday that the national budget overshot government projections last year, at 4.3 percent of G.D.P. instead of 4.1 percent.In the elections on Sunday, the Socialist Party lost 155 cities to parties on the right, including traditional bastions like Limoges, which the left had held since 1912, and several other midsize cities.Voter abstention, at close to 40 percent, reached the highest rate on record. Opinion polling suggested a broad rejection of the French ruling elite, which is increasingly viewed as detached from the concerns of the population it governs.The National Front, a far-right party that has attempted to rebrand itself as a populist and nationalist alternative to traditional parties on the left and right, made significant gains on Sunday, taking control of 11 cities and winning seats on municipal councils in many more.Local politics have largely been dominated by the Socialist Party for at least a generation, but the elections on Sunday appeared to reverse that trend. Le Monde, the respected newspaper of the center-left, ran a front-page photograph of a somber-looking Mr. Hollande on Monday with a headline that claimed a \u201chistoric rout.\u201d Le Figaro, a newspaper of the right that has been unceasingly critical of the president, contended that a conservative \u201ctsunami\u201d was \u201cwashing over Mr. Hollande.\u201dOne bright spot for the Socialist Party was in Paris, where its candidate, Anne Hidalgo, was elected the first female mayor.Mr. Hollande narrowly won the presidency in 2012 with promises of a speedy return to economic prosperity and reinforced social protections. But he quickly lowered his ambitions and said he had underestimated the dire state of France\u2019s public finances. More recently, he was unable to make good on a pledge to stop the rise in unemployment by the end of 2013.The disenchantment among voters, analysts say, stems from frustration with unkept promises and a seeming lack of direction from Mr. Hollande that has been criticized even within his own camp.\u201cFor several months, there has been a lack of explanation, of pedagogy, with regards to the people,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Rebsamen, a Socialist senator and mayor, and a close friend of Mr. Hollande\u2019s. The president \u201cneeds to give his vision, say where we stand, where we\u2019re going,\u201d Mr. Rebsamen told Radio Classique. \u201cIt\u2019s this lack of direction that is so undermining for the political efforts that are being carried out.\u201dMr. Ayrault, the outgoing prime minister, was viewed by voters and commentators alike as a bit bland and lacking energy. By contrast, Mr. Valls is intense and sometimes fiery. There has been little indication, however, that the change in leadership will be much more than cosmetic, and most policies are expected to remain the same, with the exception of the future tax cuts announced Monday. Other members of the new government have yet to be announced.In his address, Mr. Hollande acknowledged the public\u2019s \u201cdiscontent\u201d and \u201cdisappointment,\u201d and offered a list of the criticisms often addressed to him.\u201cNot enough change, still too much slowness,\u201d he said. \u201cNot enough jobs, still too much unemployment. Not enough social justice, still too many taxes. Not enough efficacy in public action, and so, still too many questions about our country\u2019s ability to make it, though it has so many assets.\u201dHe promised, a bit cryptically, that the government would make the necessary adjustments while nonetheless maintaining \u201cconstancy\u201d in its chosen course.Alissa J.

{"Headline": "U.S. Weighs Harder Line on Russia Than European Allies", "Date": "2014-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As President Obama and his national security team struggle to increase pressure on Russia over its intervention in Ukraine, they have become entangled in a tense debate over how much emphasis to put on unity with European allies more reluctant to take stronger economic actions against Moscow.So far, Mr. Obama has opted to stick close to the Europeans to maintain an undivided front, even at the expense of more punishing sanctions and quicker responses to Kremlin provocations. But some inside and outside the administration argue that the United States should act unilaterally if necessary, on the assumption that the Europeans will ultimately follow.The issue came to a head in recent days as American and European leaders tried to coordinate a new round of sanctions after the collapse of a Geneva agreement to de-escalate the crisis in Ukraine. Secretary of State John Kerry delivered a blistering public attack on Moscow on Thursday night for not living up to the agreement, but the plan to follow that up with sanctions on Friday fell apart while Washington waited for Europe, postponing action until Monday at the earliest.The deliberations in the West came as pro-Russian forces in Ukraine on Sunday continued to defy international demands to stand down. An antigovernment militia paraded eight detained members of a European military observer mission before cameras, while protesters seized a regional government television station and declared they would use it to air Russian newscasts.The display of the captive European observers underscored the challenge for Washington and Brussels in defusing the conflict. The observers, who were seized at a checkpoint on Friday, were led into an auditorium in the eastern city of Slovyansk by masked gunmen. The self-appointed mayor refused to discuss conditions under which they might be released beyond mentioning a prisoner exchange, although one of the observers was later freed for health reasons.The sanctions to be announced as early as Monday would single out more people close to President Vladimir V. Putin as well as certain companies. Among them are likely to be Igor Sechin, president of the state-owned Rosneft oil company, and Aleksei Miller, head of the state-owned energy giant Gazprom, American officials said.The measures will also block certain high-technology exports to the Russian defense industry, officials added, without elaborating. But while some of Mr. Obama\u2019s advisers want him to impose sanctions against whole sectors of the Russian economy, the president has decided against it for now, cognizant of the resistance of European nations that have far more at stake economically, officials said.During internal deliberations, Jacob J. Lew, the secretary of the Treasury, and other officials have argued for caution, maintaining that, while action is needed, more expansive measures without European support might hurt American business interests without having the desired impact on Russia, according to people informed about the discussion.Mr. Obama has been particularly intent on not getting too far in front of Europe to avoid giving Mr. Putin a chance to drive a wedge in the international coalition that has condemned the Russian annexation of Crimea and destabilizing actions in eastern Ukraine.\u201cThe notion that for us to go forward with sectoral sanctions on our own without the Europeans would be the most effective deterrent to Mr. Putin, I think, is factually wrong,\u201d Mr. Obama told reporters in Asia, where he is traveling. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be in a stronger position to deter Mr. Putin when he sees that the world is unified.\u201d He added: \u201cFor example, say we\u2019re not going to allow certain arms sales to Russia \u2014 just to take an example \u2014 but every European defense contractor backfills what we do, then it\u2019s not very effective.\u201dSome officials, however, privately argue that the administration has made coordinating with Europe too high a priority and that effectively deferring to the 28-member European Union is a recipe for inaction. The United States, these officials contend, should move ahead with more decisive action on the theory that Europe wants leadership from Washington and historically joins in eventually.\u201cWhile imposing sanctions together with the E.U. would be nice, the U.S. simply has to lead and not waste more time trying to present a united approach,\u201d said David J. Kramer, president of Freedom House, an advocacy group, and a former Bush administration official, reflecting views expressed inside the government. \u201cIt\u2019s easier for us to do so than it is for the Europeans, and they will follow, as long as we lead.\u201dA task force of Russia specialists that includes Mr. Kramer sent the White House a list of possible sanctions targets, including Russian officials and business leaders as well as nine of its most significant companies.Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the ranking Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, made a similar proposal. \u201cHitting four of the largest banks there would send shock waves into the economy; hitting Gazprom would certainly send shock waves into the economy,\u201d he said Sunday on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on CBS.The fate of the European military observers remained uncertain. The observers, who come from Germany, Denmark, Poland, Sweden and the Czech Republic, were brought before reporters, and the group\u2019s leader, Col. Axel Schneider of Germany, was allowed to answer questions, although clearly under duress.With erect posture, the colonel referred to himself and his team as \u201cguests\u201d under the \u201cprotection\u201d of Vyachislav Ponomaryov, the self-appointed mayor of Slovyansk, and said they had suffered no violence. \u201cWe are not prisoners of war,\u201d he said.Colonel Schneider said the team was held in a basement for a day and then moved on Saturday to better quarters. He flatly rejected any characterization of the group as spies and denied that it carried ammunition and reconnaissance equipment. \u201cThe only thing we had was a regular business-type road map, scale one-to-one million,\u201d he said, along with \u201csmall-scale cameras.\u201dWhile Russia\u2019s representative to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe has called for the team to be freed, Mr. Ponomaryov said he had received no word directly from Moscow. Colonel Schneider made clear they were detainees. \u201cOur presence here in Slovyansk is for sure a political instrument for the decision-makers here in the region, and the possibility to use it for negotiations,\u201d he said.Separately, anti-government militants detained three men they claimed to be members of Ukraine\u2019s intelligence services. The officers were displayed to Russian media and photographed blindfolded in their underwear, hands bound and heads bloodied.\u00a0Officials from the self-styled Donetsk People\u2019s Republic allege that the men, members of Ukraine\u2019s elite \u201cAlfa\u201d unit, were sent to capture a militia commander in Horlivka before being detained and transferred to the separatist stronghold of Slovyansk. Igor Strelkov, the commander of the Republic\u2019s forces whom Kiev has called a Russian operative, told Russian media that the Ukrainian officers would be held \u201cuntil the end of the war.\u201dIn Donetsk, pro-Russian protesters clad in balaclavas and armed with bats demanded that a television channel that they had seized broadcast Rossiya-24, a Russian state channel. \u201cThere was a harsh conversation,\u201d Oleg Dzholos, the station\u2019s general director, said outside the captured building. \u201cI would say we were given an ultimatum.\u201dPeter Baker reported from Washington, and C.

At the Golden Globe awards in January, the actress Emma Watson wore a red Dior couture dress with slim pants. Versions of Yves Saint Laurent\u2019s classic Le Smoking pantsuit have also been popular this year, with Angelina Jolie wearing one to the Bafta awards, Ellen Page to Vanity Fair\u2019s Oscars party, and Kourtney Kardashian to Elton John\u2019s. Even Seventeen magazine, that bastion of prom tradition, has shot Kylie Jenner in a prom editorial wearing separates (a crop top and full skirt) and in a tuxedo with a bow tie. \u201cFor prom everyone tries to be individual,\u201d said Zoey Washington, who owns LITTLEbird, a New York brand consulting company for teenagers. \u201cThey want to have a look like no one else. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s hard to create a look that\u2019s purely individual. You can\u2019t blow people\u2019s minds unless you go completely weird.\u201dMs. Washington, 31, wore golden satin BCBG pants and a black sleeveless top to her own prom in Baltimore in the late 1990s. \u201cI thought I was so Annie Hall with pants and no date,\u201d she said. \u201cI ended up wearing the top and pants for years to come.\u201dTraditional prom designers and retailers have observed a growing market for unconventional looks. \u201cThere is a trend for more sophisticated looks for prom: less junior, less princess,\u201d said Marissa Rubinetti, the senior buyer of special occasion dresses for David\u2019s Bridal. \u201cI visited a few key vendors, and all of the sudden there were jumpsuits. I ended up picking up a couple of them to see what happens in my Manhattan store, where they have more of a fashion-forward customer.\u201dMichael La Femme, the owner of the prom wear company La Femme, decided last year to have his design team try out rompers and jumpsuits. \u201cWe were uneasy and didn\u2019t know if it would work for prom,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had people in our office betting against it. But they\u2019re selling really well and have exceeded our expectations.\u201d Jovani\u2019s design director, Julie Durocher, channeled her fondness for jumpsuits in their 1980s heyday when designing them for her line. \u201cNot everyone wants the traditional dress,\u201d she said. \u201cThe jumpsuit is just fun. You could wear it again, out to a club or a party.\u201d She designed two last year, and they did so well that this year the company is offering 20 jumpsuits or rompers that cost $500 to $800.Alexandra Gault, 17, is a devotee of vintage clothes and often dresses in head-to-toe period looks. For prom last year, Ms. Gault, who lives in Hemet, Calif., wore a tea-length lace wedding dress from the 1950s, which she found on Etsy, with a red fascinator and red pumps. Her budget was $100, but her decision to wear a secondhand dress was less about economy than personal preference. \u201cI dress vintage every day and I didn\u2019t want to compromise that and wanted to keep it in the tone of my normal style,\u201d Ms. Gault said. \u201cIt\u2019s about self-expression.\u201dModcloth, the retro-oriented San Francisco-based company, is planning on showing vintage gowns for prom with Keds or black platform boots, said Alyssa Catalano, the vintage buyer and head of styling.And Nasty Gal, a Los Angeles-based clothing company, in March introduced Anti Prom, a line with bustiers, crop tops, leather motorcycle jackets, jumpsuits and combat boots. Sheree Waterson, the company\u2019s president and chief merchandising officer,\u00a0said: \u201cMore and more young women are tired of being dictated to and want something that feels uniquely them. It\u2019s a way of embracing yourself.\u201dBut some friends, parents and schools are not embracing nontraditional prom attire. Grace Oda, 19, wanted to wear a suit inspired by the singer Janelle Mon\u00e1e to her senior prom last year at Cedarburg High School in Cedarburg, Wis. \u201cI love wearing more androgynous clothing, although I normally put more of a feminine flair to these outfits, which is why I chose Mon\u00e1e as my inspiration,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to wear the ribbon bow tie with a simple cropped black blazer, high-waisted pants tailored at the ankle for a slimmer leg, and finish with vintage dancing heels.\u201dBut her request to wear a suit was denied, said Ms. Oda, now a freshman at Portland State University in Oregon. \u201cThe teachers I asked replied that, \u2018It wouldn\u2019t be formal enough.\u2019\u00a0\u201d (Jeff Nelson, Cedarburg High School\u2019s principal, said, \u201cThis is the first I\u2019ve heard of any question about this.\u201d) She ended up choosing a blue velvet knee-length sweetheart neckline dress from Topshop. \u201cIn a way, I looked more informal than I would have had I worn my suit,\u201d she said. Daniel Friedman, who owns Bindle & Keep, a custom suit company in Park Slope, Brooklyn, that is known for fitting women, said he has seen a huge increase in inquiries regarding prom suits for girls, which he attributed partly to an increased openness about same-sex and transgender relationships. \u201cWe\u2019re getting a lot of calls, about one a day from a parent,\u201d he said. \u201cParents are much more open to embracing their teenagers\u2019 identities and very interested in showing their children that they are proud of them.\u201d With a starting price of $695 for one of his handmade suits, this form of pride can be expensive. Indeed, Jen Ongley\u2019s mother balked about the cost when her daughter wanted to rent a tuxedo for her junior prom last year in Madison, Conn. \u201cMy mom was president of the glee club when she was at Yale,\u201d said Ms. Ongley, 17, \u201cSo we ended up borrowing a tux from the Yale glee club. I\u2019m tall and it fit pretty well. My parents thought I looked classy.\u201dMs. Ongley, who describes herself as \u201cthe school lesbian\u201d and regularly wears pajama pants to class, said none of her peers were shocked by her prom look. \u201cI almost wanted someone to be mad or offended by it,\u201d she said. \u201cI was a little disappointed, but I\u2019m proud of the student body.\u201dShe attended a second prom last year with her ex, A.J., who prefers the classification of genderqueer. \u201cI wanted to look pretty and fit the part,\u201d said Ms. Ongley, who wore a vintage black lace dress ($30) that she loved so much, she\u2019s considering wearing it to her senior prom. But Ms. Wittenberg is done with simply looking pretty. \u201cUndoubtedly I will be the only one wearing pants,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t care what anyone thinks, and I want to create a spectacle.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Affluent Wine Buyers in Asia Find Their Confidence", "Date": "2014-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Six bottles of 1990 Roman\u00e9e-Conti Burgundy sold to an Asian buyer at a Christie\u2019s auction in Hong Kong last month for 980,000 Hong Kong dollars ($126,345). A case of wine from the Cros Parantoux vineyard in Burgundy, France, fetched $82,333 in a sale held by the American auction house Acker Merrall & Condit at a restaurant overlooking Hong Kong\u2019s harbor.Fine wine comes at a price in Asia, but there are plenty of buyers. Asian consumers have become a major factor in the global wine market, with China overtaking France and Italy last year as the biggest consumer of red wine. Now, customers in the region are getting more sophisticated, educated and diverse in their wine choices.\u201cThere are a lot more wine lovers in Asia, and they are enjoying a lot more wines,\u201d Simon Tam, head of wine at Christie\u2019s China, said about the auction house\u2019s recent sale. \u201cThe market is maturing very, very rapidly.\u201dAsians have traditionally been drinkers of whiskey, brandy and local spirits like baijiu, a liquor distilled from grain, rather than wine. But rising wealth, a penchant for giving gifts and a constant search for new types of investment have turned affluent Asians into avid buyers of top wines and other luxury items in recent years.Hong Kong, which was barely featured on the international wine scene a decade ago, has become a major hub for wine trading since taxes on wine were abolished here in 2008. Dozens of merchants have opened operations, including famous players like the British company Berry Brothers & Rudd, which traces its roots to 1698, and niche establishments like La Cabane, which sells natural wines from small vineyards in France.Even in Singapore, where taxes add considerably to the price of a bottle of wine, CWT, a logistics company, is spending 200 million Singapore dollars ($158 million) on a high-end wine storage facility that will be able to store 10 million bottles in air-conditioned and humidity- and light-controlled conditions.\u201cFor Asian buyers, it\u2019s a lot about prestige \u2014 about enjoying wines as a luxury,\u201d said Robert Sleigh, head of the wine department at Sotheby\u2019s in Asia. \u201cThey are prepared to pay substantial premiums for wines that come directly from the vineyard and they put a lot of importance on the cosmetic appearance of the bottle.\u201dSlowing momentum in some Asian economies and Beijing\u2019s determination to rein in flashy spending by state officials have helped to inject some sobriety into the market. Average lot prices at Christie\u2019s wine sales in Hong Kong are 30,000 to 60,000 Hong Kong dollars (roughly $3,860 to $7,730), down from about 150,000 to 200,000 dollars in 2010, Mr. Tam said. The average price of bottles sold by Acker Merrall fell by about half from 2011 to 2013. In the early years of the boom, buyers, still unsure of themselves, focused on just a few dozen notable names. French Bordeaux wines were a particular favorite and dominated sales.Now buyers have spread their wings and are purchasing more types of wines, and from more places, than they did a few years ago. This trend echoes what is happening in other categories of luxury spending, like handbags or clothing, where an initial allegiance to big-name, highly recognizable brands has begun to fade as shoppers have become more confident and individualistic.\u201cWe have a customer who used to buy a bottle of Bordeaux with us every week,\u201d said Vincent Feron, a sommelier who works at Winebeast, a small store that opened in the bustling Hong Kong neighborhood of Wan Chai last year and sells mostly French and Spanish wines.\u201cNow, he has started to explore other wines, and really likes Languedoc,\u201d Mr. Feron said, referring to an area in southern France. \u201cPeople like to be educated. As soon as they get to trust you, they are prepared to take your advice.\u201dRetailers and top restaurants have reacted to Asian consumers\u2019 rapidly evolving appetites by beefing up their wine selections and making sure they have staff members who are well trained in wine selection.The four elegant restaurants in the InterContinental hotel on the Hong Kong waterfront, for example, employ two sommeliers each. Among them, they stock 1,700 labels, costing at least $75 a bottle and as much as several thousand United States dollars at the top end, said Christoph Travniczek, a senior manager for food and beverage at the hotel. Guests do still occasionally splash out on wines that cost thousands of United States dollars a bottle. But they \u201care no longer simply buying whatever is most expensive on the wine list,\u201d Mr. Travniczek said. \u201cThey buy what they like, and they listen to the recommendations of the sommeliers.\u201dWine fans in Hong Kong, mainland China and elsewhere in Asia are also increasingly prepared to invest considerable time and effort in soaking up not just the beverage itself, but also the information that goes into drinking and purchasing decisions.Calvin Tan caught the wine bug two years ago and has since taken two wine courses, including one at a French wine academy, L\u2019\u00c9cole du Vin de France, which opened an office in Hong Kong in 2011.\u201cI needed a hobby, and I love drinking and eating good food, so this was perfect,\u201d he said.Mr. Tan, who works for an American bank in Hong Kong, is not in the market for top wines of the kind sold by Sotheby\u2019s and Christie\u2019s. The most expensive wine he ever had was an Italian red that cost about 800 Hong Kong dollars. But his eagerness to learn and branch out \u2014 his favorites now are Riojas and New Zealand pinot noirs \u2014 exemplifies the shift that is happening among Asian wine lovers.\u201cIn the beginning, many of those who signed up for our activities knew very little about wine,\u201d said Marjolaine Roblette-Geres, L\u2019\u00c9cole du Vin\u2019s representative in Hong Kong. \u201cNow, many already know quite a lot, and they want to broaden their knowledge,\u201d she said, adding that the school was considering offering classes in Beijing and Guangzhou, in neighboring mainland China.All this gives wine experts the confidence that Asian buyers will continue to spend big on wines, despite the fading growth momentum in many of the region\u2019s economies. \u201cWe still dream of the highs of 2010 and 2011,\u201d said John Kapon, the chief executive of Acker Merrall. \u201cBut 2014 got off to a good start, and greater China remains the No. 1 driver of the global market.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Home Improvement", "Date": "2014-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen my family moved to Accra, Ghana, in 1990 just as I was about to start high school, we landed in a country whose G.D.P. was less than one-quarter the size of Delaware\u2019s, despite its plentiful deposits of gold and other precious minerals. A military dictator had ruled it for almost a dozen years. Poverty, hunger and disease stalked the countryside. It felt like a place cut off from the rest of the world. If we wanted to call my grandparents in Wisconsin or Addis Ababa, all five of us would squeeze into a phone booth at the post office. We didn\u2019t have a home phone, and the waiting list to get one was decades long. When I returned to Ghana as a correspondent for The New York Times in 2005, I found a thriving democracy that had peacefully handed power between rival political parties. Everyone seemed to have a chirping cellphone. Ghanaians who had made it in the West as software developers, bankers and doctors were flocking home to set up businesses, building beach houses on the Atlantic coastline and launching Afrocentric clothing companies. Today Ghana is on the cusp of becoming a middle-income country \u2014 not too shabby a leap in less than a quarter of a century. Despite what we read in the news about war, famine and corruption on the continent, anyone who looks beyond the headlines knows that this trajectory \u2014 from brutal misrule and abysmal poverty toward democracy and prosperity \u2014 has been the lived experience of most \u00adAfricans. And so Dayo Olopade\u2019s \u201cBright Continent,\u201d as its title suggests, is a corrective to Africa\u2019s image as a dark, hopeless place. In fact, it is home to several of the world\u2019s fastest-growing economies and more than a billion would-be consumers, an increasing number of whom are reaching toward middle-class status. It is also home to a huge chunk of the world\u2019s natural wealth, though that accounts for a smaller sliver of the continent\u2019s overall growth than most people think. Africa\u2019s gains have come not because of Western largess or painful structural adjustment programs set out by the likes of the International Monetary Fund, Olopade argues, nor are they the work of governments. They are largely the fruit of Africans\u2019 efforts to help themselves, through creative means that sometimes involve breaking the rules. \u201cIt turns out we have been throwing a party in an empty ballroom,\u201d Olopade, a Nigerian-American journalist, writes of Western-led efforts to aid Africa. \u201cOne of the biggest problems with the world\u2019s longtime orientation toward Africa is a preference for interactions between governments, or between formal institutions, when the most vibrant, authentic and economically significant interactions are between individuals and decentralized groups.\u201d She excavates a hopeful narrative about a continent on the rise, \u201ca libertarian celebration of hustling, hacking and free-form development.\u201d The best solutions, according to Olopade, are local, developed by people closest to the problem, not bureaucrats in Washington or Brussels: the South African gynecologist who operates out of two shipping containers stacked together, the Kenyan family who take over an abandoned plot of land to grow vegetables to eat and sell.\u201cThe Bright Continent\u201d resists broad-brush solutions when imposed from outside, and is largely dismissive of the role of governments in transforming the continent. But transformation tends to come when people push powerful institutions to change. Take the example of Kayode Fayemi, the governor of Ekiti, the home state of Olopade\u2019s family. Fayemi is one of her story\u2019s heroes for his efforts to stamp out corruption and make government more effective and accountable. He ran for governor in 2007, but the election was flagrantly rigged. For three and a half years he fought in the courts to get that false result overturned. He didn\u2019t try to work around a corrupt system; he forced the system to do its job properly. Eventually he prevailed and was sworn in, and his example has given hope to other would-be politicians that they can fight and win. The book is full of TED-talk-ready phrases. Countries are not rich or poor, developed or underdeveloped, they are \u201cfat\u201d and \u201clean.\u201d With their shoddy infrastructures, lumbering bureaucracies and corrupt politicians, many African countries are not failed states but \u201cfail\u201d states that do not provide the basics to their citizens, with \u201cthe basic understanding that you are on your own.\u201d Indeed, it is something in between. Things like close family ties, necessity-driven innovation and ingenuity are a source of strength, Olopade writes, and gives countless examples. But in each case, the opposite can also be true. Family ties are a tremendous source of strength in many African societies, but family ties can also hold people back. In places where so few people have jobs, one earner must support many mouths, making it impossible to save anything. A journalist I know in the Central African Republic once told me that he hasn\u2019t been able to save any money, send his children to university or start a business because every spare bit of cash goes to a needy relative. For my friend, family was a drag on his upward mobility, not a boost. In the end, Olopade endorses NGOs, but chooses ones that are more closely connected to the needs of people. These are small-bore efforts, aimed at solving a particular problem. The African Leadership Academy, started by a Ghanaian named Fred Swaniker, is praised, but it takes only 100 students a year. This book doesn\u2019t really address the question that nags many scholars and analysts. Rapid growth in Africa has not been accompanied by rapid expansion of employment opportunities, which means that many people, especially the young and least educated, are left to hope that a rising tide will lift their boats. Precarious employment in what is known as the informal sector is what most young Africans can expect. The textile factories and steel mills that built middle classes from Europe to the United States to China and beyond are nowhere on the horizon in most African economies. More broadly, as Fayemi\u2019s experience shows, the most thoroughgoing change in any society is almost always political. Giving people a voice through their elected officials to transform their societies is the most empowering change of all, but in Olopade\u2019s world, government is a millstone to progress, not its engine.

{"Headline": "Playing Hockey With Putin", "Date": "2014-04-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byShortly before the Sochi Olympics, Russian President Vladimir Putin played in an exhibition hockey game there. In retrospect, he was clearly warming up for his takeover of Crimea. Putin doesn\u2019t strike me as a chess player, in geopolitical terms. He prefers hockey, without a referee, so elbowing, tripping and cross-checking are all permitted. Never go to a hockey game with Putin and expect to play by the rules of touch football. The struggle over Ukraine is a hockey game, with no referee. If we\u2019re going to play \u2014 we, the Europeans and the pro-Western Ukrainians need to be serious. If we\u2019re not, we need to tell the Ukrainians now: Cut the best deal with Putin that you can.Are we serious? It depends on the meaning of the word \u201cserious.\u201d It starts with recognizing what a huge lift it will be to help those Ukrainians who want to break free of Russia\u2019s orbit. Are we and our allies ready \u2014 through the International Monetary Fund \u2014 to finance Ukraine\u2019s massive rebuilding and fuel needs, roughly $14 billion for starters, knowing that this money is going to a Ukrainian government that, before the overthrow of the previous president, ranked 144 out of 177 on the Transparency International list of most corrupt countries in the world, equal with Nigeria? Moreover, we can\u2019t help Ukraine unless we and the European Union have a serious renewable energy and economic sanctions strategy \u2014 which requires us to sacrifice \u2014 to undermine Putin and Putinism, because Ukraine will never have self-determination as long as Putin and Putinism thrive. Putin\u2019s foreign policy and domestic policy are inextricably linked: His domestic policy of looting Russia and keeping himself permanently in power with oil and gas revenue, despite a weakening economy, seems to require adventures like Ukraine that gin up nationalism and anti-Westernism to distract the Russian public. And are we ready to play dirty, too? Putin is busy using pro-Russian Ukrainian proxies to take over government buildings in Eastern Ukraine \u2014 to lay the predicate either for a Russian invasion there or de facto control there by Russia\u2019s allies.Finally, being serious about Russia means being serious about learning from our big mistake after the Berlin Wall fell. And that was thinking that we could expand NATO \u2014 when Russia was at its weakest and most democratic \u2014 and Russians wouldn\u2019t care. It was thinking we could treat a democratic Russia like an enemy, as if the Cold War were still on, and expect Russia to cooperate with us as if the Cold War were over \u2014 and not produce an anti-Western backlash like Putinism.As the historian Walter Russell Mead put it in a blog post: \u201cThe Big Blini that the West has never faced up to [is]: What is our Russia policy? Where does the West see Russia fitting into the international system? Ever since the decisions to expand NATO and the E.U. were taken in the Clinton administration, Western policy towards Russia ... had two grand projects for the post-Soviet space: NATO and the E.U. would expand into the Warsaw Pact areas and into the former Soviet Union, but Russia itself was barred from both. ... As many people pointed out in the 1990s, this strategy was asking for trouble.\u201d\u201cI think it is the beginning of a new Cold War,\u201d Kennan said to me of NATO expansion. \u201cI think the Russians will gradually react quite adversely and it will affect their policies. I think it is a tragic mistake. There was no reason for this whatsoever. No one was threatening anybody else. This expansion would make the founding fathers of this country turn over in their graves. We have signed up to protect a whole series of countries, even though we have neither the resources nor the intention to do so in any serious way. [NATO expansion] was simply a lighthearted action by a Senate that has no real interest in foreign affairs.\u201d\u201cWhat bothers me is how superficial and ill informed the whole Senate debate was,\u201d added Kennan. \u201cI was particularly bothered by the references to Russia as a country dying to attack Western Europe. Don\u2019t people understand? Our differences in the Cold War were with the Soviet Communist regime. And now we are turning our backs on the very people who mounted the greatest bloodless revolution in history to remove that Soviet regime. And Russia\u2019s democracy is as far advanced, if not farther, as any of these countries we\u2019ve just signed up to defend from Russia. It shows so little understanding of Russian history and Soviet history. Of course, there is going to be a bad reaction from Russia, and then [the NATO expanders] will say that we always told you that is how the Russians are \u2014 but this is just wrong.\u201dWe need a strategy to help Ukraine and to undermine Putinism today \u2014 and to reintegrate Russia tomorrow. It\u2019s a big, big lift. So let\u2019s be honest with ourselves and with the Ukrainians. If Putin\u2019s playing hockey and we\u2019re not, Ukrainians need to know that now. Advertisement"}

He is a married father of two and earns about $24 per hour. After taxation, middle-class incomes in Canada appear to be higher than those in the United States.Members of the middle class in Canada worry about whether they can afford college for their children and whether their children will find jobs afterward. Housing costs are a major concern, as are everyday costs for transportation and mobile-phone plans. Middle-class Canadians worry about inequality.Yet many also believe that they\u2019re better off than their American counterparts.To get a sense for how these trends are affecting Canadians, we set out to interview members of the middle class. Most, of course, have no firsthand way of comparing their experiences with American ones, and they were quick to acknowledge as much.

{"Headline": "Obama Suffers Setbacks in Japan and the Mideast", "Date": "2014-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 President Obama encountered setbacks to two of his most cherished foreign-policy projects on Thursday, as he failed to achieve a trade deal that undergirds his strategic pivot to Asia and the Middle East peace process suffered a potentially irreparable breakdown.Mr. Obama had hoped to use his visit here to announce an agreement under which Japan would open its markets in rice, beef, poultry and pork, a critical step toward the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the proposed regional trade pact. But Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was not able to overcome entrenched resistance from Japan\u2019s farmers in time for the president\u2019s visit.Mr. Obama has not given up. Indeed, his advisers insisted that they had achieved a \u201cpathway\u201d to resolving the sticking points in a trade deal during marathon talks that continued until just before the president left Tokyo for Seoul.On Friday in South Korea, Mr. Obama continued his weeklong quest to breathe life into his shift to Asia. Mr. Kerry, the tireless campaigner for Middle East peace, was still working the phones, trying to maneuver the Israelis and Palestinians back to the negotiating room.One of the president\u2019s most grandiose foreign-policy projects, a nuclear agreement with Iran, remains very much on the table, with diplomats from Iran and the West beginning to draft language that would limit Iran\u2019s nuclear program and inhibit its ability to produce a weapon.In one sense, the latest news from the Middle East offers a rationale for Mr. Obama to keep his gaze fixed on the fast-growing economies of Asia. While the troubles with the peace negotiations have surprised almost no one, the trade talks with Japan still hold some hope of yielding a landmark deal, since it is in the interests of both Mr. Abe and Mr. Obama \u2014 a bet on the future rather than an effort to clear the enmities of the past.First, though, Mr. Obama has to overcome the stubborn hurdles to any trade agreement. Back home, he has been unable to win support from Congress for the deal. \u201cPrime Minister Abe has got to deal with his politics; I\u2019ve got to deal with mine,\u201d he said on Thursday. \u201cIt means that we sometimes have to push our constituencies beyond their current comfort levels.\u201dMr. Obama also declared that the United States was obligated by a security treaty to protect Japan in its confrontation with China over a clump of islands in the East China Sea. But he stopped short of siding with Japan in the dispute regarding who has sovereignty over the islands, and carefully calibrated his statement to avoid antagonizing China.The net result, seen in a news conference in which the leaders referred to each other a bit stiffly as Barack and Shinzo, was an alliance clearly on firmer footing than it was earlier, but still vulnerable to political frailties on each side.Similar frailties were on display in Jerusalem, where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel acted swiftly to suspend talks after his Palestinian counterpart, President Mahmoud Abbas, signed a deal seeking to reconcile his Fatah faction, which dominates the Palestine Liberation Organization and leads the West Bank government, with Hamas, the Islamist group that controls the Gaza Strip.Mr. Abbas \u201chad a choice: peace with Israel or pact with the terrorist Hamas,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said in an interview with NBC News. \u201cSo that\u2019s the blow for peace, and I hope he changes his mind.\u201dMr. Kerry told Mr. Abbas on Thursday that he was disappointed by the reconciliation announcement, and he planned to speak later with Mr. Netanyahu. The administration\u2019s Middle East peace envoy, Martin S. Indyk, remained in the region, refusing to give up.\u201cChoices need to be made by both parties, and we\u2019ll see what happens in the days ahead,\u201d Jen Psaki, a State Department spokeswoman, told reporters in Washington. Palestinian leaders sought to shift the blame for the breakdown to Israel.Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator, said Israel had \u201cdeliberately sabotaged the peace process by stopping the negotiations\u201d and by refusing to freeze settlement construction. Mr. Erekat said in a telephone interview that reconciliation was \u201can internal Palestinian affair that Israel has no right to interfere in\u201d and that it \u201cshould not be used as a pretext to evade negotiations.\u201dBut after a six-hour meeting on Thursday, Israel\u2019s top ministers voted unanimously to halt the talks and to impose an unspecified series of punitive measures against the Palestinians for their promise to form a new government within five weeks that would prepare for long-overdue elections. Negotiations could only resume, Israeli officials said, if Mr. Abbas abandoned or failed to carry out the deal with Hamas \u2014 something Palestinian analysts say is a possibility.\u201cWhat will happen now is the usual routine: Israel will try to punish the Palestinians; the Palestinians will complain; Israel will not really punish the Palestinians, because we cannot afford the Palestinian Authority to collapse,\u201d said Shlomo Brom, a researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv. \u201cSo it will be another episode in this never-ending story.\u201dEvents in Asia tend to move at a slower pace. But with trade a key pillar of Mr. Obama\u2019s strategy in Asia and each side looking for something from the other, the negotiations assumed a Middle East-like intensity.In round-the-clock negotiations this week, American and Japanese officials said, the United States pressed Japan to make major concessions, including cutting protective tariffs close to zero on agricultural products like cheese and pork.\u201cThere are a lot of people in Japan who question whether Japan should make big concessions just because Obama is here,\u201d said Nobuhiro Suzuki, a professor of agriculture at the University of Tokyo. \u201cAbe has to heed them, too, to avoid appearing like an American patsy.\u201dOther analysts faulted Mr. Obama, saying his decision not to fight for the legislative authority at home to pass major trade deals had robbed him of leverage with the Japanese, who are reluctant to make concessions for a deal that may not survive Congress.\u201cTheir strategy was to get the Japanese to do the deal, then go to Congress and say, \u2018Look what a great deal we got, now give us the authority,\u2019 \u201d said Michael J. Green, an Asia adviser to President George W. Bush. \u201cHe made a decision to go into this with one hand tied behind his back.\u201dSpeaking to reporters on Air Force One en route to Seoul, a senior administration official said that after their meeting, Mr. Obama and Mr. Abe instructed their staffs to find a way to close the remaining gaps. \u201cNothing is agreed to until everything is agreed to,\u201d the official said. But he added, \u201cWe\u2019re at a moment where we see where we\u2019re going to achieve resolution.\u201dIn Tokyo, the Japanese trade minister, Akira Amari, told reporters that no agreement had been reached, but noted: \u201cWe are moving toward a conclusion.\u201dThe president\u2019s statement about the United States\u2019 obligations toward Japan was important because it was the first time he had explicitly put the disputed islands under American protection, though Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel recently made the same statement and the policy has been held by successive administrations.\u201cThis is a very important turning point for the United States-Japan alliance because it means the period of drift under President Obama has finally come to an end,\u201d said Yuichi Hosoya, an expert on American-Japanese relations at Keio University in Tokyo. \u201cThe fact that this was said by the president will have a huge psychological impact on Japanese officials and people.\u201dThe Chinese government reacted swiftly, saying it was \u201cfirmly opposed\u201d to Mr. Obama\u2019s position. More than anything, Mr. Obama appeared eager to defuse tensions over the islands, referring to them as a \u201crock\u201d and saying they should not be allowed to derail a relationship that could otherwise be productive.\u201cIt would be a profound mistake to continue to see escalation around this issue rather than dialogue and confidence-building measures between Japan and China,\u201d Mr. Obama said.Mr. Abe said he was encouraged by Mr. Obama\u2019s pledge to protect the islands. \u201cOn this point,\u201d he said, \u201cI fully trust President Obama.\u201dMark Landler reported from Tokyo, and Jodi Rudoren from Jerusalem.

He is also right in asserting that most of the militant opposition to his government comes from the better-off parts of society and seeks to roll back many of these changes.And as he says, the Venezuelan regime is appropriately described as a democracy: I would call it a radical (as opposed to liberal) democracy that privileges majority rule rather than minority rights.Mr. Maduro\u2019s failures are three. First, he has shown no inclination so far to break his country\u2019s addiction to petroleum. Second, he and his predecessor, Mr. Ch\u00e1vez, have failed to understand that they cannot successfully run a socialist economy nested within a capitalist world.Third, Mr. Maduro has failed to assume the charismatic mantle of his predecessor.

{"Headline": "Can Paradise Be Planned?", "Date": "2014-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen the architect Robert A. M. Stern was a kid in the \u201840s, he used to spend his Sundays perusing The New York Times real estate section. In those days, recalls the self-described \u201cmodern traditionalist\u201d best known for buildings like 15 Central Park West and the George W. Bush Presidential Library, \u201cIt was all about new houses that were being built in suburbia. I would look at them and redraw the plans. At the basic level I thought they were so damn bad and I thought I could do better.\u201dDecades later, Stern is still fed up with the state of suburbia and remains resolutely committed to its betterment. He\u2019s now thrown down the gauntlet with what can be described as a McMansion-size manifesto called \u201cParadise Planned: The Garden Suburb and the Modern City.\u201dStern and his co-authors David Fishman and Jacob Tilove want to bring back the garden suburb, and in so doing hope to restore a \u201ctragically interrupted, 150-year-old tradition.\u201d While the book engages a bit with contemporary issues plaguing suburbia \u2014 homogeneity, automobile-dependency, sprawl \u2014 its primary focus is former and existing garden suburbs, in hopes of transforming the ways future suburbs are created. (It also continues a deep and fractured academic debate among modernists, traditionalists and a whole host of other \u201cists,\u201d but we won\u2019t bother ourselves with that here.)The garden suburb is \u2014 because it still exists in many places \u2014 a planned, self-contained village located usually outside a major city. Ideally, it features a variety of housing types, though by variety, we\u2019re talking single-family homes and a few low-rise multifamily buildings. These buildings are similar in architectural style, but similar is understating it. The vernacular of the garden suburb is most definitely traditional \u2014 some modernist examples crop up but they were either never built (i.e., Frank Lloyd Wright\u2019s Broadacre City and Norman Bel Geddes\u2019s Futurama, both of which might have been darn near close to paradise) or were hard to love (such as the Mussolini-backed Sabaudia). In contrast to the suburbs we\u2019ve come to be most familiar with, these featured homes are situated in a comfortably dense, highly walkable environment designed around a public center or square.Stern sees the garden suburb as an antidote to the current suburban sprawl but also views it as a smart way to think about what he calls in the book \u201cthe middle city,\u201d neighborhoods found in cities like Detroit, for example, where, he writes, \u201cnow, virtually empty of people and buildings, [they] have no discernible assets except the infrastructure of the streets and utility systems buried under them.\u201dWhat people are trying to do, Stern told me, is to get out of what he calls \u201csprawling \u2018slurbias\u2019 where they\u2019re chained to their cars whether they\u2019re taking their kids to school or getting a haircut. Everyone doesn\u2019t want to live in a 90th floor penthouse overlooking the Hudson River but people do want to live in nice communities.\u201dBut what about the people who live in the very antithesis of what\u2019s he\u2019s arguing for, yet the form that is most prevalent on the American landscape. Let\u2019s call it the \u201cpost-garden suburb.\u201d Well, Stern says that in order to go forward, we often have to go backward. It\u2019s hard to dispute that these well-planned communities he has documented are often the perfect mix between town and country \u2014 lots of green space, community gathering spots, paths for ambling, all in dense (but not too dense) urban settings. But it is easier to suggest that publishing a 1,072-page, 12-1/2-pound hardcover book might not be the best strategy for pushing the needle. When all is said and done, it\u2019s a solid historical document but only offers models for what to do if you have the luxury of starting from square one. As Stern well knows, those opportunities are few and far between. \u201cYou have to put the infrastructure in before you build the community,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd governments won\u2019t even do that anymore. It\u2019s come to that. Arguments are about who can put in the least amount of infrastructure into these developments.\u201dCase in point, one of the more successful (or controversial, depending on your point of view) garden suburbs of recent times \u2014 Celebration, Fla. \u2014 which, Stern admits, needed Disney\u2019s backing to become a reality. I\u2019m not sure that corporation-financed communities offer a replicable \u2014 or desirable \u2014 model, however, particularly when they are described, as Celebration was by Andrew Ross, an academic (and my former Ph.D. adviser) who spent a year living there, as \u201cthe product of a company that merchandises the semi-real with an attitude that the architectural historian Vincent Scully once described as \u2018unacceptably optimistic.'\u201dWhether viewed through the lens of data, nostalgia or aerial photography, automobile-dependent sprawl not only has a damaging impact on the environment but is also connected to poorer economy, health and safety. There\u2019s no question that things need to change. The Smart Growth report suggests that many decision-makers like mayors and planning commissioners are re-examining traditional zoning, economic development incentives, transportation access and availability (or the lack thereof), and other policies that have helped to create sprawling development patterns \u2014 and are opting instead to create more connections, transportation choices and walkable neighborhoods in their communities. Still, I fear we\u2019re going to be stuck in traffic for a long time.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Unemployment Malaise Lingers in Euro Zone", "Date": "2014-04-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 The labor market in the euro zone remains in the doldrums, official data showed on Tuesday, as the unemployment rate ticked higher in France and rose to a record in Italy.The jobless rate in the 18-nation currency bloc stood at 11.9 percent in February, unchanged from January\u2019s revised figure and flat since October, according to a report by Eurostat, the statistics agency of the European Union.About 25.9 million people remained without work across the 28-nation European Union, Eurostat estimated, out of a potential labor force of about 244 million.There was one bright spot in the data released on Tuesday: The number of unemployed people in the European Union fell by 65,000 from January. The monthly data does not provide a detailed breakdown explaining the decrease.While that figure was an encouraging sign, it did not affect the jobless rate for the euro zone. It did, however, nudge down the unemployment rate for the broader European Union to 10.6 percent in February from the revised 10.7 percent in January.Clemente De Lucia, an economist at BNP Paribas, said that the continuing disappointments from the labor market were not surprising, even though other recent indicators, like surveys of purchasing managers, have suggested that the economy remains in an expansionary phase.He noted that new hiring was a lagging indicator, as businesses in many European countries face substantial legal barriers to shedding jobs in a downturn and are cautious about adding workers. Thus the economy may have to pick up some steam before hiring can take off.The European economy officially rose out of recession in the second quarter of 2013, but the labor market remains in poor health more than five years after the credit crisis struck in 2008, followed by a crisis of confidence in a number of euro zone countries and in the common currency itself.European leaders responded to those crises with austerity measures \u2014 the policy of budget discipline \u2014 the only remedy that Germany, with the union\u2019s largest economy, would accept.That policy, which gave the European Central Bank enough cover to promise unlimited action in support of the euro, has calmed the markets. But the decline in government spending also hammered overall demand, undermining employment and reducing inflationary pressures.Markets were upbeat after the report, with the euro rising 0.2 percent to $1.3802 and the Euro Stoxx 50 index, which tracks blue-chip stocks, adding about half a percent in Paris afternoon trading.In Italy, the jobless rate reached a record 13 percent in February from 12.9 percent a month earlier. The rate is the highest documented by Istat, the Italian national statistical agency, in records that date to the beginning of 1977. The country\u2019s new prime minister, Matteo Renzi, is hoping an aggressive policy change will restart the faltering economy.Michel Martinez, an economist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale in Paris, said that many Italian companies had tried to hold onto their employees through thick and thin, but that many remained under pressure to cut workers to restore weakened profit margins.The Italian jobless rate is probably near its peak now, Mr. Martinez said, but will remain high for some time because of the poor state of the country\u2019s economy.In France, the jobless rate ticked up to 10.4 percent from 10.3 percent in January. Unemployment was the biggest factor in the drubbing that President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s government received in municipal elections this last weekend, which led to the ouster of Jean-Marc Ayrault as prime minister in favor of Manuel Valls, the former interior minister.The labor market in Greece remained the worst in Europe, with joblessness at a depression-level 27.5 percent. Spain, at 25.6 percent, was not far behind, but the market there is showing a glimmer of hope, edging down from 25.8 percent in January.Austria registered the lowest unemployment rate in the union, at 4.8 percent, followed by Germany, at 5.1 percent. In addition to relatively strong economies by current European standards, the two countries have extensive work-sharing programs that help to hold down the figures.The European Central Bank\u2019s Governing Council is to meet on Thursday to plot monetary policy. In addition to the dismal employment report, the central bank will be considering a report that was issued on Monday showing consumer prices rising at an annual rate of just 0.5 percent, suggesting that the euro zone is on the verge of outright deflation.The European situation contrasts with that of the United States, where the unemployment rate stood at 6.7 percent in February and where the economy has been adding an average of 189,000 new posts each month over the past 12 months. The Labor Department is poised to release jobs data for March on Friday.Mr. Martinez, of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, forecast that the gross domestic product of the euro zone would increase by 1.1 percent this year. Even assuming that slow a recovery, he said, the unemployment rate would most likely end the year around the current level.Partly, that would reflect the return of workers who had given up on finding a job altogether, he said. The pool of discouraged workers \u2014 young people who dropped out of the job market to return to school, and long-term unemployed people in countries like Spain, Italy and France \u2014 will swell the ranks of the officially jobless as hiring picks up, keeping the official jobless rate at elevated levels, he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "French Leader Approves a Cabinet of Mixed Messages", "Date": "2014-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France approved a new cabinet on Wednesday, putting some high-profile figures \u2014 including S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal, his former partner \u2014 in key positions, but sending mixed messages about his plans for France\u2019s troubled economy.The lack of clarity has worried European Union policy makers, who have watched France\u2019s faltering economy with trepidation, in part because Mr. Hollande has resisted deeper structural changes.With some of his ministerial appointments, Mr. Hollande appeared to be trying to satisfy more leftist factions within his Socialist Party, and with others to be trying to mollify the European Commission, which has called for spending cuts and overhaul of the rigid labor market. But he seemed no closer to a coherent economic policy. Mr. Hollande campaigned on a promise to move the focus of European policy makers away from austerity and toward growth, but when he came to office he largely set those ambitions aside.\u201cIt\u2019s not about making savings just for the sake of making savings,\u201d Mr. Hollande said in his televised address. \u201cIt\u2019s about preserving our social model. In short, about being more fair and more effective.\u201dFrance\u2019s growth has hovered at close to zero for the past two years, and unemployment stands at 10.4 percent, just below the European Union average, according to Eurostat, the bloc\u2019s statistical arm.European Union officials viewed Mr. Hollande\u2019s remarks warily, seeing in them a suggestion that France would seek a further delay in its commitment to bring its budget deficit under the 3 percent of gross domestic product required by European rules.\u201cFrance is aware of its commitments,\u201d Jeroen Dijsselbloem, chairman of the Eurogroup of finance ministers, said at a meeting on Tuesday in Athens in response to Mr. Hollande\u2019s speech. \u201cThey were already given more time, and more work needs to be done.\u201dFrance has not made an official request for a delay in meeting its deficit targets. It was supposed to meet them by the end of 2013, but after negotiations it was given until the end of 2015. However, in 2013, the national deficit overshot the government target, ending at 4.3 percent of gross domestic product instead of 4.1.The government reorganization began Monday with the appointment of Interior Minister Manuel Valls as prime minister, succeeding Jean-Marc Ayrault. Mr. Valls is seen as more centrist on economic issues. On Wednesday, Ms. Royal was named environment and energy minister, and Arnaud Montebourg minister of the economy.Mr. Montebourg, whose economic ideas have enjoyed populist appeal, is known for jousting \u2014 with mixed results \u2014 with foreign investors and companies he viewed as daring to criticize the French labor system.His appointment worries analysts because he has taken strong stands against the deficit reduction targets, said Guntram B. Wolff, the director of Bruegel, a European think tank.\u201cYou get again mixed messages with very different people in the cabinet,\u201d Mr. Wolff said. \u201cWith Montebourg, it\u2019s a very left approach, and for sure he\u2019s already announced he wants to delay the deficit reduction, which you can debate. But you can\u2019t not debate the need to make reforms on the labor side and the structural side. And we don\u2019t see that coming.\u201dMr. Montebourg will share economic responsibilities with the more sober Michel Sapin, a longtime friend of Mr. Hollande\u2019s, who will become the finance minister. Mr. Sapin, as labor minister, was in charge of the government\u2019s halting efforts to stem France\u2019s increasing unemployment. It is unclear how the government plans to divide tasks between Mr. Sapin and Mr. Montebourg.Ms. Royal, who lost to Nicolas Sarkozy as the Socialist Party\u2019s presidential candidate in 2007, has been largely absent from national politics in recent years. She served in previous Socialist cabinets and has remained a vocal member of the party, saying on Sunday that the election results were a \u201csevere warning.\u201dSeveral ministers maintained important portfolios, including the defense minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian; the foreign minister, Laurent Fabius; and the justice minister, Christiane Taubira, who is something of a lightning rod, reviled by the right and beloved by the left for her championing of same-sex marriage.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Climate Study Puts Diplomatic Pressure on Obama", "Date": "2014-03-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisThe report, published this week by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, concludes that the world\u2019s poorest people will suffer the most as temperatures rise, with many of them already contending with food and water shortages, higher rates of disease and premature death, and the violent conflicts that result from those problems.Countries like Bangladesh and several in sub-Saharan Africa that are the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change say the report strengthens their demand for \u201cclimate justice\u201d \u2014 in other words, money, and plenty of it \u2014 from the world\u2019s richest economies and corporations, which they blame for the problem.Those countries and nongovernmental organizations point to a 2009 pledge by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton to create a $100 billion annual climate fund for poor countries by 2020. The World Bank justified such an expenditure in a 2010 report concluding that it would take up to $100 billion a year to offset the ravages of climate change on poor countries. Climate policy experts say that the United States, as the world\u2019s largest economy, would be expected to provide $20 billion to $30 billion of that annual fund.That puts Mr. Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry, who has been working aggressively behind the scenes to forge a United Nations climate change treaty in 2015, in a tough position.But both men know there is no chance that a Congress focused on cutting domestic spending and jump-starting the economy will enact legislation agreeing to a huge increase in so-called climate aid. Since 2010, the Obama administration has spent about $2.5 billion a year to help foreign countries adapt to climate change and adopt low-carbon energy technology. It will be a stretch even to continue that level of spending. Many Republicans, who control the House and have a chance to gain the Senate this fall, question whether climate change is real.\u201cIf the White House actually wants something like this, it should begin by building support among congressional Democrats, but \u2014 at this point \u2014 I don\u2019t see any real signs of support from House or Senate Democratic leaders at all,\u201d said Michael Steel, a spokesman for Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio.Vulnerable nations, emboldened by the new United Nations report, are demanding more, not less, from the United States.Ronald Jean Jumeau, the United Nations ambassador from the island nation of Seychelles, and a spokesman for the Alliance of Small Island States, compared the proposed fund with the amount of money Congress approved after Hurricane Sandy. \u201cWe know that $100 billion is not going to be enough,\u201d Mr. Jumeau said. \u201cAfter Sandy, Congress voted for $60 billion in recovery for New York, New Jersey and Connecticut \u2014 for one storm. It shows you how much $100 billion is going to cover.\u201d\u201cThe science is getting better, and it tells us things are getting worse for us,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd the money is not coming.\u201dThe window is starting to close on Mr. Obama\u2019s ability to broker a treaty that could significantly reduce greenhouse gas pollution in time to avoid the most disastrous effects of climate change. This fall, at the United Nations General Assembly, world leaders will meet to put offers on the table for a climate change pact, a mix of commitments to cut fossil fuel pollution at home and provide money to poor countries to adapt. A few months later, at a two-week summit meeting in Lima, Peru, they will negotiate a draft of a final treaty that is set to be signed next year in Paris and take effect in 2020.Some areas of the globe are especially vulnerable to rising sea levels and inhabitants are being forced to make stark changes in their lives.Diplomats say the new report has increased pressure on governments to reach a climate deal. \u201cBy underscoring impacts and vulnerabilities, the report makes clear the urgency for strong action to reduce emissions and build greater resilience,\u201d said Todd D. Stern, the State Department\u2019s chief climate change negotiator. In a speech in London last fall, Mr. Stern made clear that there was no chance that the United States would finance most of any climate adaptation fund with taxpayer dollars. \u201cThe fiscal reality of the United States and other developed countries is not going to allow it,\u201d he said. Mr. Stern and others say the bulk of that money will have to come from private investors and corporations.Nongovernmental organizations say that relying chiefly on the private sector will not be enough, especially as food supplies grow short. \u201cThe scientists could not have been more clear, particularly in the area of food security,\u201d said Timothy Gore, an analyst for Oxfam, the antipoverty group. \u201cThere is no government that\u2019s going to be able to stick around very long if the price of bread keeps going up, if they can\u2019t feed their people.\u201d \u201cI challenge anyone in the U.S. government to explain how the private sector is going to invest in what\u2019s needed on the ground, like funding farmers in the Sahel region facing crop loss from changing rainfall patterns,\u201d Mr. Gore said, referring to the area of Africa just south of the Sahara.Hanging over the coming negotiations will be the specter of the failed 1997 Kyoto Protocol. Vice President Al Gore promised in those talks that the United States would act on climate change, only to have the Senate refuse to ratify that treaty. At a 2009 climate summit meeting in Copenhagen, Mr. Obama promised that Congress would soon pass a sweeping climate change bill. Just months later, the bill died in the Senate.Mr. Obama is now trying to bolster his credibility on the issue by flexing his executive authority and acting without Congress. His administration is moving ahead with aggressive new Environmental Protection Agency regulations to reduce carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants. At talks around the world, Mr. Kerry and Mr. Stern have sought to persuade other nations that, this time, the United States will be able to keep its commitments, since they do not require action from Congress. The United States\u2019 inability to offer more substantial aid to countries that did little to cause global warming will probably remain a major sticking point with developing nations, including India and China. Still, Connie Hedegaard, the European Union commissioner for climate action, said she hoped that could eventually be overcome: \u201cI think the $100 billion mark can be reached. It was understood in Copenhagen that it had to be a mix of public and private money. I think vulnerable groups \u2014 families in Bangladesh or the Philippines \u2014 don\u2019t care whether a dollar coming their way is public or private.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The American Middle Class Is No Longer the World\u2019s Richest", "Date": "2014-04-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLosing the LeadThe American middle class, long the most affluent in the world, has lost that distinction.While the wealthiest Americans are outpacing many of their global peers, a New York Times analysis shows that across the lower- and middle-income tiers, citizens of other advanced countries have received considerably larger raises over the last three decades.After-tax middle-class incomes in Canada \u2014 substantially behind in 2000 \u2014 now appear to be higher than in the United States. The poor in much of Europe earn more than poor Americans.Although economic growth in the United States continues to be as strong as in many other countries, or stronger, a small percentage of American households is fully benefiting from it. Median income in Canada pulled into a tie with median United States income in 2010 and has most likely surpassed it since then. Median incomes in Western European countries still trail those in the United States, but the gap in several \u2014 including Britain, the Netherlands and Sweden \u2014 is much smaller than it was a decade ago.In European countries hit hardest by recent financial crises, such as Greece and Portugal, incomes have of course fallen sharply in recent years.The struggles of the poor in the United States are even starker than those of the middle class. A family at the 20th percentile of the income distribution in this country makes significantly less money than a similar family in Canada, Sweden, Norway, Finland or the Netherlands. Thirty-five years ago, the reverse was true.LIS counts after-tax cash income from salaries, interest and stock dividends, among other sources, as well as direct government benefits such as tax credits.That is no longer the case, Professor Katz added.Median per capita income was $18,700 in the United States in 2010 (which translates to about $75,000 for a family of four after taxes), up 20 percent since 1980 but virtually unchanged since 2000, after adjusting for inflation. The same measure, by comparison, rose about 20 percent in Britain between 2000 and 2010 and 14 percent in the Netherlands. Median income also rose 20 percent in Canada between 2000 and 2010, to the equivalent of $18,700.The most recent year in the LIS analysis is 2010. But other income surveys, conducted by government agencies, suggest that since 2010 pay in Canada has risen faster than pay in the United States and is now most likely higher. Pay in several European countries has also risen faster since 2010 than it has in the United States.A second factor is that companies in the United States economy distribute a smaller share of their bounty to the middle class and poor than similar companies elsewhere. Top executives make substantially more money in the United States than in other wealthy countries. The minimum wage is lower. Labor unions are weaker.And because the total bounty produced by the American economy has not been growing substantially faster here in recent decades than in Canada or Western Europe, most American workers are left receiving meager raises.Finally, governments in Canada and Western Europe take more aggressive steps to raise the take-home pay of low- and middle-income households by redistributing income.\u201cThings are pretty flat,\u201d said Kathy Washburn, 59, of Mount Vernon, Iowa, who earns $33,000 at an Ace Hardware store, where she has worked for 23 years. \u201cYou have mostly lower level and high and not a lot in between. People need to start in between to work their way up.\u201dMiddle-class families in other countries are obviously not without worries \u2014 some common around the world and some specific to their countries. In many parts of Europe, as in the United States, parents of young children wonder how they will pay for college, and many believe their parents enjoyed more rapidly rising living standards than they do. In Canada, people complain about the costs of modern life, from college to monthly phone and Internet bills. Unemployment is a concern almost everywhere.But both opinion surveys and interviews suggest that the public mood in Canada and Northern Europe is less sour than in the United States today.\u201cThe crisis had no effect on our lives,\u201d Jonas Frojelin, 37, a Swedish firefighter, said, referring to the global financial crisis that began in 2007. He lives with his wife, Malin, a nurse, in a seaside town a half-hour drive from Gothenburg, Sweden\u2019s second-largest city.They each have five weeks of vacation and comprehensive health benefits. They benefited from almost three years of paid leave, between them, after their children, now 3 and 6 years old, were born. Today, the children attend a subsidized child-care center that costs about 3 percent of the Frojelins\u2019 income.Even with a large welfare state in Sweden, per capita G.D.P. there has grown more quickly than in the United States over almost any extended recent period \u2014 a decade, 20 years, 30 years. Sharp increases in the number of college graduates in Sweden, allowing for the growth of high-skill jobs, has played an important role.Elsewhere in Europe, economic growth has been slower in the last few years than in the United States, as the Continent has struggled to escape the financial crisis. But incomes for most families in Sweden and several other Northern European countries have still outpaced those in the United States, where much of the fruits of recent economic growth have flowed into corporate profits or top incomes.This pattern suggests that future data gathered by LIS are likely to show similar trends to those through 2010.There does not appear to be any other publicly available data that allows for the comparisons that the LIS data makes possible. But two other sources lead to broadly similar conclusions.One large European country where income has stagnated over the past 15 years is Germany, according to the LIS data. Policy makers in Germany have taken a series of steps to hold down the cost of exports, including restraining wage growth.Even in Germany, though, the poor have fared better than in the United States, where per capita income has declined between 2000 and 2010 at the 40th percentile, as well as at the 30th, 20th, 10th and 5th.Malin Frojelin lives with her two children, Engla, 6, and Nils, 3, in Vallda, Sweden, along with her husband, Jonas. Vallda is about a 30-minute drive from Gothenburg, the second-largest city in the country.\u00a0More broadly, the poor in the United States have trailed their counterparts in at least a few other countries since the early 1980s. With slow income growth since then, the American poor now clearly trail the poor in several other rich countries. At the 20th percentile \u2014 where someone is making less than four-fifths of the population \u2014 income in both the Netherlands and Canada was 15 percent higher than income in the United States in 2010.By contrast, Americans at the 95th percentile of the distribution \u2014 with $58,600 in after-tax per capita income, not including capital gains \u2014 still make 20 percent more than their counterparts in Canada, 26 percent more than those in Britain and 50 percent more than those in the Netherlands. For these well-off families, the United States still has easily the world\u2019s most prosperous major economy.Rachel Z.

{"Headline": "Sydney Biennale Draws Attention for More Than Its Wild Art", "Date": "2014-04-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byArtSydney, Australia \u2014 In a cavernous industrial warehouse on Cockatoo Island, only minutes by ferry from the Sydney Opera House, a woman dressed as a Hobbit-like creature warbled into a microphone that doubled as a tail, while a massive rock swung precariously overhead.Australia\u2019s biennale is well established \u2014 it was the first in the Asia-Pacific region \u2014 but it can take on a more experimental edge, said Juliana Engberg, the director of the festival this year. \u201cIt\u2019s Australia, you can trial things,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can be a little bit feral.\u201dBut this year\u2019s edition, which started on March 21, has also drawn attention beyond the wild nature of its art.The government\u2019s treatment of asylum seekers is one of the country\u2019s most polarizing issues. Boatloads of refugees are intercepted on their way to Australian shores and often are sent to grim detention centers on Manus Island, in Papua New Guinea, and Nauru. On Feb. 17, an Iranian asylum seeker on Manus Island was killed and many others were seriously injured after riots and clashes with the staff. \u201cIt was a perfect storm of issues,\u201d said Ms. Engberg, who added that she was initially unaware of the Transfield connection to detention centers. Two artists eventually withdrew from the biennale. \u201cI spent a lot of time helping artists come to grips with their own decision. It\u2019s not an easy thing for someone to step away from something that they\u2019ve held dear.\u201d In response to the Transfield biennale controversy, the arts minister, George Brandis, is considering developing a policy that would block government funding to culture organizations that reject prospective commercial partners on political grounds. Still, many artists chose to stay and participate, like the Melbourne, Australia-based duo Sonia Leber and David Chesworth. \u201cWe knew this is where we are most articulate,\u201d Mr. Chesworth said. Their audio installation on Cockatoo Island, \u201cThis Is Before We Disappear From View,\u201d is held in an open-air concrete space where sound bounces and distorts. A booming voice recites passages about prison and punishment from writers like Charles Dickens and Anthony Trollope, with a chorus of voices in the background. The artists updated the audio just before the festival\u2019s opening.At the Art Gallery of New South Wales, another Sydney Biennale site, the artist Deborah Kelly said she had agonized over her participation. Her series of life-size nude photographic portraits, \u201cNo Human Being is Illegal (In All Our Glory),\u201d using a phrase coined by immigration-rights activists, are embellished with intricate collages reflecting each subject\u2019s story. The unfinished collages will be worked on throughout the festival.\u201cTo be told that this beautiful artwork is linked to the detention regime felt so disgraceful, it was really unbearable,\u201d Ms. Kelly said. She decided to continue to participate in the festival, however, because her series involved more than 40 other artists and because her father was also one of the subjects. The boycott aside, politics suffuse other aspects of the biennale, which has the theme \u201cYou Imagine What You Desire.\u201d The Art Gallery of New South Wales is the beating heart, according to Ms. Engberg, with works intended to provoke. Here, the indigenous artist Yhonnie Scarce focuses on race with her lab-like installation \u201cWeak In Color But Strong In Blood.\u201d Under harsh lights, stainless steel trays of misshapen blown glass are categorized by color. The Chinese artist Zhao Zhao looked at violence in his series \u201cConstellations,\u201d with three large panes of glass splintered by bullet holes, and the Scottish artist Nathan Coley has taken black and white photographs of protests in \u201cThe Honor Series\u201d and overlaid the placards with gold leaf.The Sydney Biennale has traditionally been held during winter but the board brought the 19th festival forward by three months to run in warmer weather and align with the international arts calendar. Ms. Engberg started traveling around the world in October 2012, meeting more than 1,000 artists through her own networks and research, as well as scouring lists from government agencies. She searched for young, lesser-known names as well as more established ones. Ms. Engberg said she had no set agenda as she created her shortlist, only the idea that imagination and desire were inherent in the artists\u2019 work. \u201cI\u2019m quite pleased with this construction of the event as a bit of a wild place, a relaunch of the biennale in a way,\u201d she said.It is estimated that the Sydney Biennale brings around $60 million to the Australian economy. But the controversy around this biennale will probably have a lasting impact.\u201cThe ongoing conversations that will occur from this are very interesting,\u201d Ms. Engberg said. \u201cIt may be something of a game changer in the way we think about how funding comes to the arts.\u201d Advertisement"}

We work in dozens of countries, and manage logistics for the Agency for International Development\u2019s health supply chain. Basically, that means we work with governments to make sure that health products are available across health care systems in each country.I like to travel, but I\u2019m a bit of a homebody and like being in Boston. But I do understand that travel enriches the work we do, since you can only develop relationships so far through teleconferencing, email or phone.When I get to my destination I start working almost immediately, and I have a bad back. I have to get as much rest as I can on the plane, and that can be tough with back pain. Plus, I fly economy, so space is always at a premium. To help relax I stick on a bunch of those self-heating pain-relief pads, earplugs and a sleep mask. Then I bring out this very strange-looking banana-shaped sleep pillow, which gives you the feeling that you\u2019re sleeping on your stomach. Once I get all my gear together, the person next to me on the plane has absolutely no desire to talk to me.I\u2019m a seasoned traveler and try to make sure I have everything I need to get into a country. I learned my lesson the hard way.Several years ago I traveled to Nigeria three times in about six months. We\u2019re always required to have an invitation letter from the Ministry of Health. But on my last visit I didn\u2019t have the letter, though I did have my visa. Everyone recognized me at the airport and said hello, so I didn\u2019t think I was going to have a problem. But the immigration agent that I saw said he had to follow protocols.He did recognize my company\u2019s name, and knew that we provided family planning supplies, like contraceptives and condoms. In fact, in many places that is what we are known for. So he asked me if I had brought him some condoms. I thought he was joking and said I was sorry, but I wasn\u2019t carrying any condoms with me. He actually got a little irritated. All I could think was that no letter and no condoms meant I would have to spend a lot of time at the airport. Fortunately, everything worked out. I have not forgotten my invitation letters since then, but I still don\u2019t carry family planning supplies with me.I do love meeting people when I\u2019m in other countries. I was in Ethiopia looking at the supply chain for an antibiotic that treats trachoma, an eye infection. I was in a rural village and had to travel an entire day to get there.I went to the health center in the village and saw that the antibiotic supply was in good shape, and suddenly I noticed there were hundreds of beautiful children outside the clinic. The regional director told me that most of them had probably never seen a Caucasian woman before and they would love to practice their English. Apparently, the last white person who came to the clinic was a man who arrived by parachute about seven years before. That\u2019s a tough act to follow.The director told me I needed an Ethiopian name. I told him that, according to my mother, Carmit loosely translates to vineyard in Hebrew, so he called me \u201cwoinshet.\u201d The children thought it was the funniest thing in the world, and they couldn\u2019t stop laughing. \u201cWoinshet,\u201d I was told, means grape. I laughed too, and sharing that laughter with those children made any travel hassles worthwhile.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Recovery in Euro Zone Gathers Pace", "Date": "2014-04-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 The economy of the euro zone expanded this month at its fastest rate in nearly three years, according to a private sector survey released on Wednesday, with accelerated output from Germany leading the bloc.A reading of 50 or higher signals growth, while a level below 50 suggests contraction. Economists had been expecting an index reading of about 52.9.Subindexes showing activity in the manufacturing and service sectors also rose. Analysts watch the indexes carefully, considering them to be among the best \u201creal-time\u201d guides to the euro zone economy.\u201cThe upturn continues to be led by Germany,\u201d Chris Williamson, Markit\u2019s chief economist, said in a statement.But the best news, he said, might be found in the so-called euro zone \u201cperiphery,\u201d where economic growth \u201cis gaining traction.\u201dThe French economy continued to expand in the latest survey, but at a slowing pace, raising fears that it will tip back into stagnation.The euro zone\u2019s economic recovery, which dates to the second quarter of 2013, has had little impact on the unemployment crisis, with around 26 million people in the European Union looking for jobs, according to Eurostat, the bloc\u2019s official statistical agency.The report Wednesday showed a \u201cmodest\u201d improvement in the labor market, the first since May 2011, Markit said.Signs of continuing improvement in the bloc are welcome news for the global economy, given geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe and the prospect of slowing growth in emerging markets.The euro zone recovery also faces threats from low inflation, as the annual rate of growth in consumer prices fell to 0.5 percent in March from 1.7 percent a year earlier. The rate, the lowest since 2009 and far below the European Central Bank target of just under 2 percent, has many European officials worried that subdued price increases will put a dent in any employment gains and make it harder for euro zone countries like Greece or Italy to reduce their huge debts.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Total Taxes on Wages Are Rising", "Date": "2014-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ChartsAFTER the financial crisis, many countries cut taxes to stimulate their economies. But since 2010, with concerns about government debt rising, the trend has gone the other way.The rates shown in the accompanying chart are the O.E.C.D. estimates for the taxes that would be levied on an unmarried person who earned the average 2013 wage in the private sector in the country. You should note that the percentage figures are not based on the salary, but on the total cost of the employee to the employer, including corporate payments of payroll taxes, like Social Security taxes in the United States.The United States has a total 2013 tax burden \u2014 called a tax wedge by the O.E.C.D. \u2014 of 31.3 percent of total compensation, the study estimated. That was up from 30.4 percent in 2012, an increase largely caused by the end of the American government\u2019s temporary reduction in Social Security tax rates. That left the United States with total wage taxes well below most of the other countries. The O.E.C.D. average was 36 percent.Other nations with substantial increases last year were Portugal, where tax rates rose as the government followed a European-mandated austerity policy aimed at cutting budget deficits, and the Slovak Republic, which raised employer payroll taxes.The O.E.C.D. said it thought countries should be changing their tax laws to encourage economic growth. \u201cMore needs to be done to shift the burden from labor to other types of taxes,\u201d said Bert Brys, a senior tax economist at the organization\u2019s Center for Tax Policy and Administration. He said environmental taxes and national sales taxes could be raised while taxes on wages were reduced, and he suggested that higher taxes on housing might be called for, partly to ward off new property price bubbles.One policy that has been adopted by several euro zone countries is called \u201cfiscal devaluation\u201d by some analysts. The idea is that a country\u2019s exports can be made more competitive by reducing labor costs, which can be done by reducing the employer\u2019s share of payroll taxes. In such a case, the employee does not appear to be taking a wage cut, even though the employer\u2019s costs decline. The effect, it is hoped, is similar to that of a currency devaluation, something that cannot happen within the euro zone.In France, the O.E.C.D. said, payroll taxes paid by employers were cut to 28.7 percent of total labor costs in 2013, from 30.6 percent in 2010. That still left France with the highest employer tax rate of any country in the group. At the same time, income tax rates and employee payroll taxes were increased.Employer tax rates were also cut in the Netherlands and Greece, as well as in some countries that do not use the euro, including Iceland and Australia.

{"Headline": "Another Worrisome Drop in Euro Zone Inflation", "Date": "2014-03-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 A drop in euro zone inflation, to the lowest rate since 2009, has raised new questions about whether its economy is stuck in doldrums that could last for years and, if so, whether the European Central Bank can or will do anything about it.Official data Monday showing that annual inflation in March was just 0.5 percent, according to preliminary estimates, inflamed an issue that had already polarized economists and policy makers.Some say there is nothing to worry about, that slumping prices in countries like Greece and Portugal are part of a necessary correction in competitiveness.Another camp, though, says it sees Europe slipping over the precipice of deflation, an especially pernicious species of economic woe because it is so hard to reverse. When prices are falling on a broad front, consumers delay major purchases because they expect prices to drop even more. Companies suffer declines in sales and cannot invest or create jobs.The new figures provide ammunition for those who are pressing for the European Central Bank to try to stimulate the euro zone economy. Still, few specialists expect the central bank to do so this week \u2014 whether because the evidence of deflation is still not suitably compelling, or because the bank\u2019s remaining weapons are too limited to risk firing too soon.The situation will have to get much worse before the central bank will take that risk, Carsten Brzeski, senior economist at ING Bank, said on Monday. \u201cIs the situation bad enough? We don\u2019t think so.\u201dMembers of the too-soon-to-panic camp note that much of the unexpectedly low inflation the European Union statistics office reported resulted from falling energy prices, not slow growth.Some analysts even dismissed the drop in annual inflation in March, which compared with a rate of 0.7 percent in March 2013, to the so-called Easter bunny effect. Easter is when travel companies typically raise their prices for package tours, a component of the Consumer Price Index. Easter is in April this year, meaning any such price increases also will come later than last year, when the holiday was in March.But even people who do not expect deflation warn that very low inflation has other ill effects on a region still emerging from a debt crisis.Subdued inflation means that governments, businesses and individuals in the vulnerable countries will find it even more difficult to repay their debts. A little inflation is good for borrowers, because it chips away at the overall debt burden.\u201cFor me that\u2019s the biggest concern,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Manuel Campa, former secretary of state for finance in Spain and now a professor at the IESE Business School in Barcelona and Madrid. Low inflation \u201cjust puts a much larger burden on the adjustment that needs to take place,\u201d he said.Economists had expected prices to soften in March, after official data last week showed inflation in Germany at an unexpectedly low annual rate of 0.9 percent. In Spain, prices fell 0.2 percent. But analysts were surprised how much the rate fell.The central bank, which will meet to discuss monetary policy on Thursday, now faces intensified criticism that it is not fulfilling its mandate to keep inflation below, but close to, 2 percent. Economists consider a little inflation a good thing, in part because it creates a buffer against deflation.If inflation was as far above the 2 percent target as it now is below it, critics say, the central bank would have long ago raised interest rates to slow the economy.\u201cThe E.C.B. should be concerned that they are losing their credibility,\u201d Mr. Campa said.The problem for the central bank and its president, Mario Draghi, is that it has run out of easy options to influence the economy. The benchmark interest rate is already at a record low of 0.25 percent. The next step would have to be more radical and risky, like huge purchases of government or corporate bonds to pump money into the economy.The Federal Reserve has used such quantitative easing to stimulate growth in the United States. But in the euro zone a similar strategy faces more problems. The euro zone does not have an equivalent to United States Treasury securities or a unified bond market. The central bank would have to buy bonds or other assets in the 18 countries that belong to the euro zone. Its decisions about how to distribute the purchases could easily expose the bank to charges it was favoring one country over another.Measures like quantitative easing, said Mr. Brzeski, the ING economist, \u201care still controversial, and they are not easy to use.\u201d It is more likely that the central bank will focus on how much of the slowdown in inflation resulted from falling energy costs, and not from economic malaise, he said.The core inflation rate, which strips out volatile energy and food prices, rose at a slightly more robust 0.8 percent rate in March. Still, that was down from a 1 percent rate in February. Energy prices dropped 2.1 percent in March from a year earlier, according to Eurostat, the European Union statistics office.Mr. Draghi has said low inflation is concentrated in crisis countries where falling prices are welcome and necessary to regain competitiveness on world export markets.But that argument becomes more difficult to make when countries like Germany, where unemployment is low and growth is solid, also have very low inflation.Mr. Brzeski predicted that the central bank would continue to offer assurances that it remained ready to act if necessary, while hoping that inflation picks up in coming months.Recently even the German central bank, the Bundesbank, which is notoriously vigilant against inflation, has softened its tone. Jens Weidmann, the Bundesbank\u2019s president and a member of the European Central Bank governing council, said recently that he did not rule out some form of quantitative easing as a last resort.Such talk is intended to demonstrate European Central Bank resolve, and speech alone is likely to be the preferred policy for the time being. \u201cThe big balancing act for the E.C.B. right now is getting this message across without doing anything,\u201d Mr. Brzeski said, \u201cand keeping their fingers crossed.\u201dDavid Jolly contributed reporting from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Spite Is Good. Spite Works.", "Date": "2014-03-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBasicsNow, after decades of focusing on such staples of bad behavior as aggressiveness, selfishness, narcissism and greed, scientists have turned their attention to the subtler and often unsettling theme of spite \u2014 the urge to punish, hurt, humiliate or harass another, even when one gains no obvious benefit and may well pay a cost. Psychologists are exploring spitefulness in its customary role as a negative trait, a lapse that should be embarrassing but is often sublimated as righteousness, as when you take your own sour time pulling out of a parking space because you notice another car is waiting for it and you\u2019ll show that vulture who\u2019s boss here, even though you\u2019re wasting your own time, too. Evolutionary theorists, by contrast, are studying what might be viewed as the brighter side of spite, and the role it may have played in the origin of admirable traits like a cooperative spirit and a sense of fair play. The new research on spite transcends older notions that we are savage, selfish brutes at heart, as well as more recent suggestions that humans are inherently affiliative creatures yearning to love and connect. Instead, it concludes that vice and virtue, like the two sides of a V, may be inextricably linked. A total of 946 college students and 297 adults were asked to rate how firmly they agreed with sentiments like \u201cIf my neighbor complained about the appearance of my front yard, I would be tempted to make it look worse just to annoy him or her\u201d or \u201cIf I opposed the election of an official, I would happily see the person fail even if that failure hurt my community\u201d or \u201cI would be willing to take a punch if it meant someone I did not like would receive two punches.\u201d From the survey and related experiments, the researchers determined that men were generally more spiteful than women and young adults more spiteful than older ones, and that spitefulness generally cohabited with traits like callousness, Machiavellianism and poor self-esteem \u2014 but not with agreeableness, conscientiousness or a tendency to feel guilt. Dr. Marcus also identified circumstances that can provoke spiteful outbursts from otherwise temperate people: partisan politics, for example. (\u201cIf the other candidate wins, I hope the economy crashes.\u201d) Or bitter divorces, like the husband who threw his savings into a trash bin, Dr. Marcus said, to avoid sharing any money with his ex-wife. For their part, evolutionary theorists have long been intrigued by the origins and purpose of spite, and a new report suggests that sometimes spite can make right. Although groups of excessively spiteful or selfish players quickly collapsed, and rigidly fair-minded societies were readily destabilized by influxes of selfish exploiters, the flexible sharers not only proved able to coexist with the spiteful types, but the presence of spitefuls had the salubrious effect of enhancing the rate of fair exchanges among the genials. By the looks of it, Dr. Smead said, \u201cfairness is acting as a defense against spite.\u201d \u201cIt could be that Nietzsche was right about punishment,\u201d Dr. Forber said, \u201cthat it originated as spite and only later was turned into a mechanism for maintaining fairness and justice.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s probably not spiteful when you\u2019re looking at the long term,\u201d Dr. Marlowe said. \u201cIf you get the reputation as someone not to mess with and nobody messes with you going forward, then it was well worth the cost.\u201d The idea of selfish punishment came to him as a biology graduate student who also competed in track and field. \u201cI noticed it over and over again,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people who were most vocal against others using performance-enhancing drugs were the ones who were using performance-enhancing drugs.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like the Mafia,\u201d he said. \u201cThey end up reducing crime in the areas they inhabit.\u201d Agamemnon needed his Achilles \u2014 and we need our Tony Soprano.

{"Headline": "At Meeting, Fed Likely to Again Cut Bond Buying", "Date": "2014-04-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve is tiptoeing away from its economic stimulus campaign, and so far the broader economy has barely noticed.The Fed\u2019s policy-making committee, which meets on Tuesday and Wednesday, is widely expected to announce another $10 billion cut in its monthly bond purchases, to $45 billion, en route to ending the purchases this autumn.Fed officials, meanwhile, have focused on assuring markets that interest rates will remain near zero for the next year or so, and stay low thereafter.And after a rocky start to the Fed\u2019s retreat last summer, investors generally have accepted the official line, to judge by the prices of financial assets.\u201cWe\u2019re exactly on the right track,\u201d John C. Williams, the centrist president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, told Bloomberg News last week. Things are going well enough that a management issue is rising up the list of the Fed\u2019s concerns. The Fed\u2019s seven-person board in Washington will be reduced to just three members at the end of May, for the first time in its hundred-year history, unless the Senate moves quickly to confirm two additions. A preliminary vote on the nominations of Stanley Fischer and Lael Brainard is scheduled for Tuesday morning.If the Senate does not act in time, three people will be left to do the work of seven. Moreover, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, and her two remaining colleagues would be allowed to converse with one another only at scheduled public meetings, because any such interaction would involve a majority of the board.Other challenges are looming. Forecasters, including the Fed\u2019s own staff and its officials, generally expect the economy to grow more quickly in the coming months, rebounding from a cold winter that suppressed first-quarter activity.An early indication will come Friday, when the government is scheduled to release an initial estimate of job creation in April. Faster growth could lead some investors to conclude that the Fed will decide to start raising rates sooner, or more quickly, than it has forecast.\u201cThe Yellen-led Fed has not yet been tested,\u201d Vincent Reinhart, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley, wrote in an analysis last week. \u201cThe data thus far in 2014 have been soft enough to make it plausible that the policy interest rate can be kept low for a considerable period, but not so soft as to raise significant concerns about the economic expansion. Fed officials, however, will be pressed to speak more clearly about policy sometime soon as economic data firm.\u201dWhile this week\u2019s meetings are likely to pass quietly \u2014 the Fed\u2019s next round of economic projections will be released after its June meeting, which is also the next time that Ms. Yellen is scheduled to hold a news conference \u2014 officials are likely to discuss some of the issues that will determine the speed of their retreat from the extraordinary stimulus measures that followed the financial crisis.The Fed has chosen to leave open the course of policy once it discontinues its huge bond-buying program. Ms. Yellen said that uncertainty was a consequence of its commitment to take the necessary steps to reduce unemployment and to restore inflation to a healthy pace.\u201cTying the response of policy to the economy necessarily makes the future course of the federal funds rate uncertain,\u201d she told the Economic Club of New York. \u201cBut by responding to changing circumstances, policy can be most effective at reducing uncertainty about the course of inflation and employment.\u201dSince the start of the Great Recession at the end of 2007, the Fed has had a full complement of seven governors just 20 percent of the time. During most of that period, it operated with only five governors. Since early March, there have been only four.And soon, there could be three. Jeremy C. Stein, who has raised concerns about the stimulus campaign, said earlier this month he would resign at the end of May, preserving his position as a tenured professor of economics at Harvard.Mr. Fischer, a former head of the Bank of Israel, and Ms. Brainard, a former Treasury official, are both expected to get the banking committee\u2019s support, along with Jerome H. Powell, a board member since 2012 nominated to serve a new term.But they would then join a logjam of scores of presidential nominees for positions across the government who are awaiting action by the full Senate. While Democrats prevented indefinite delays by changing the Senate\u2019s procedural rules last year, Republicans have responded by slowing each confirmation process.And even the confirmation of Mr. Fischer and Ms. Brainard would leave a pair of vacancies on the Fed\u2019s board. The White House is under considerable pressure from community bankers and their political supporters to choose someone with small-bank experience to the board.The administration also would like to nominate at least one more woman; the Fed\u2019s board had three women when it was most recently at full strength.Two people involved with the issue, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe private deliberations, said the White House was considering, among others, Diana L. Preston, a lawyer who recently left the American Bankers Association, where she worked on securities issues; Ann Marie Mehlum, an official at the Small Business Administration who ran a small bank in Oregon; and Rebeca Romero Rainey, chief executive of Centinel Bank of Taos in New Mexico.Andrew Ross Sorkin, whose\nDealBook column normally appears\non this page, is off.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Industrial Output Climbs, and New-Home Starts Tick Up", "Date": "2014-04-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Industrial production rose at a faster-than-expected clip in March, providing another sign that the economy is gaining momentum.Groundbreaking for new homes also increased, but it remained well below the post-recession peak hit in November.\u201cSeveral parts of the economy are warming up, but housing is the exception,\u201d said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cWe are still on track for very strong second-quarter growth.\u201dThe increase in industrial production, which exceeded economists\u2019 expectations for a 0.5 percent gain, reflected in part a 0.5 percent rise in manufacturing output. There were even bigger increases in production at mines and utilities.The report added to figures on retail sales and employment in painting an upbeat picture of the economy at the end of the first quarter after it was slammed by an unusually cold and disruptive winter.But while the rest of the economy is perking up, housing continues to struggle. A separate report from the Commerce Department showed that housing starts failed to bounce back as strongly as expected from winter\u2019s doldrums.Compared with March last year, housing starts were down 5.9 percent, the biggest decline since April 2011.While the cold winter weighed on homebuilding in December and January, activity has also been hampered by shortages of building lots and skilled labor, as well as rising prices for materials.\u201cThere have been growing signs that the rebound in the housing market we have seen the past several years might be petering out,\u201d said Anthony Karydakis, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak. \u201cWe have been seeing this in other housing indicators. With the slowdown, housing will become a smaller contributor to overall growth going forward.\u201dThe housing market is under strain from higher mortgage rates and elevated house prices, which are sidelining some potential buyers. Groundbreaking for single-family homes, the largest segment of the market, surged 6 percent to a 635,000-unit pace last month. Despite rising for a second consecutive month, single-family starts are below November\u2019s 713,000-unit rate, which was the highest since March 2008.Last month, permits to build new homes fell 2.4 percent to a 990,000-unit pace, pointing to weaker starts in the months ahead. There was a ray of hope for a pickup. The Mortgage Bankers Association said Wednesday that applications for loans to buy houses rose last week. Applications for new home purchases increased 15 percent in March compared to February, which bodes well for home sales during that period. Mortgage applications are, however, well below where they were last year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dual Turning Point for Biofuels", "Date": "2014-04-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHUGOTON, Kan. \u2014 There is an old joke in the energy business that advanced biofuels are the fuel of the future, and always will be.But even as Abengoa and other companies prepare to produce significant amounts of cellulosic ethanol, using corn stalks and wheat straw as opposed to corn itself, the appetite for such fuels seems to be diminishing.The market is saturated with ethanol from corn. The automobile and oil industries are resisting efforts to increase the amount of ethanol blended into gasoline. And now the Environmental Protection Agency is considering reducing the amount of advanced biofuels required for blending into vehicle fuels this year by more than 40 percent below the original target in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. A final decision is due in June.\u201cIt\u2019s very frustrating,\u201d said Christopher Standlee, executive vice president of Abengoa. \u201cThe whole purpose of the Renewable Fuel Standard was to encourage investment to create brand-new technologies that would help the United States become more energy-independent and use cleaner and more efficient fuels. We feel like we are just on the verge of doing that and now the E.P.A. is talking about changing the rules.\u201dOther things have changed, too, since 2007. A boom in shale drilling has produced a sudden gush of domestic oil. Increasingly efficient cars and a sluggish economy have cut demand for fuel. (In recent weeks, ethanol prices spiked because of transportation problems in the Midwest. Gas stations in several states ran out of gasoline because there was not enough ethanol to blend, but the problem is considered temporary.)And there is disagreement about the potential for biofuels. Several companies have failed to develop commercial biofuels or have given up trying.The energy act\u2019s goal of reaching 21 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2022 is now considered virtually unreachable, even by biofuel enthusiasts. \u201cIt would take an enormous effort of deploying capital and labor and engineering,\u201d said Paul Winters, a spokesman for the Biotechnology Industry Organization.Many energy experts remain skeptical about the new plants. \u201cIt\u2019s stuff being built, but that doesn\u2019t mean they are cost-effective or at large enough scale to make a difference,\u201d said Michael E. Webber, deputy director of the Energy Institute at the University of Texas at Austin.For years, the future of biofuels has been debated in Congress and at various federal agencies, pitting oil companies and refiners against the biotech industry and farmers who grow corn. Oil executives say corn ethanol and advanced biofuels are uneconomical. Biofuel producers say the oil companies just want to squash a potential competitor. They insist they can compete as long as the price of oil remains above $70 a barrel (it is now roughly $100) and gasoline stations offer higher blends of ethanol.A major obstacle for the biofuel industry is the \u201cblend wall,\u201d the current 10 percent limit on ethanol at most gasoline stations. Some car companies warn that above that level, fuel could damage engines in older vehicles. The Energy Department has disputed such concerns, and the E.P.A. has approved use of 15 percent ethanol blends for cars manufactured after 2001. But gasoline stations have been slow at installing the necessary equipment. And only a modest number of vehicles can use E-85, a blend that is 85 percent ethanol.But biofuel producers and lobbyists say the country needs more of their product. \u201cCellulosic biofuel has the promise to deliver tens of billions of gallons of ethanol to the United States, but there needs to be a market for that,\u201d Brian Foody, president and chief executive of the Canadian biofuel company Iogen, told reporters in a recent conference call by industry executives discussing the impact of the E.P.A. proposal. \u201cWe believe it\u2019s critical for E.P.A. to create a segment or space in the market for E-85 to grow and to set numbers that will provide incentives.\u201dBiofuel executives say that if the E.P.A. adopts the proposal, they would probably have to limit new American investments and develop plants instead in Europe, China and South America.More than $5.7 billion has already been invested in developing advanced biofuels as they have progressed from laboratory tables to pilot and demonstration projects, and now to a handful of commercial-scale plants, according to the Biotechnology Industry Organization. The group estimates that it will take private investment of $95 billion or more over the next decade or so to scale up commercial production to meet long-term congressional targets.The biggest cellulosic ethanol plant is in Italy, and it produces 10 million gallons a year, roughly half the capacity of the Abengoa plant here. A few tiny plants in the United States opened last year and have had mixed success.But this is the year biofuel production will finally lift off, industry executives say.By the summer, the South Dakota-based ethanol producer Poet, in partnership with the Dutch company Royal DSM, will complete the start-up of its Emmetsburg, Iowa, plant, which is projected to produce up to 25 million gallons a year making use of corn cobs, husks and leaves. Within the next year, DuPont is expected to complete the biggest of the three plants \u2014 a $225 million plant near Nevada, Iowa, with a capacity of, 30 million gallons a year, that will make ethanol from corn waste.But Abengoa, which received a $134 million loan guarantee from the Energy Department, will be first out of the gate, its plant beginning full operations by early May. The company plans to produce 25 million gallons of biofuel a year at the plant here and has already started a 21-megawatt electricity plant at the site powered by biomass.Abengoa has developed a proprietary enzyme to mix with corn stalks and wheat straw to produce sugars that will then be fermented and distilled to produce cellulosic ethanol. That more efficient process can increase yields and decrease costs. Over the last four years, Abengoa has improved yields from 55 gallons of ethanol per ton of biomass to 80 gallons per ton.What is more, because cellulosic ethanol relies on the waste products of corn rather than corn itself, it does not raise demand for corn or raise corn prices.The plant here has seven giant steel tanks capable of storing a million gallons each of feedstocks and products, and three railroad spurs can accommodate 100 rail cars loading and transporting ethanol to blending facilities.The industrial process would be familiar to any brewer \u2014 one of the tanks here is even called the beer well \u2014 except perhaps for all the recycling that is done. Any excess water will be used to irrigate the adjoining 400-acre corn farm that Abengoa runs. The boiler at the electricity plant is fueled by biomass byproducts from the extraction of the alcohol. Excess electricity will be sold to local utilities, and residue from burning biomass will be sold to local governments for construction of roads.\u201cWe are very bullish on the whole idea,\u201d Mr. Standlee said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why we are moving forward.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Scots Ponder: Should They Stay or Should They Go?", "Date": "2014-04-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEDINBURGH \u2014 The Royal Lyceum Theater here has a modest hit on its hands, a slightly scabrous play that tells the story of Scotland\u2019s parliamentary vote to dissolve itself and join the kingdom of England in 1707.\u201cUnion,\u201d by Tim Barrow, depicts the English as conniving, Queen Anne as a ravenous simpleton and the Scots who voted for union as having been bribed by the English and their agents, who included Daniel Defoe. There is much to tug at the heartstrings of the Scots: a passionate poor Scottish bard, perfidious Englishmen, cynical aristocrats, plenty of sex and almost as much whisky as rain.Mr. Barrow says he will vote for Scottish independence, on Sept. 18. Mr. Thomson calls himself \u201cone of the great undecided.\u201d After each performance, there is an informal poll among the audience, with a late-night rush to vote in the ballot boxes set up in the foyer, asking whether the union 307 years ago had been a good idea \u2014 \u201cAye\u201d or \u201cNae.\u201d\u201cNae,\u201d John Menzies decided, popping his theater ticket into the designated slot.\u201cWe should never have sold out our country in the first place, never,\u201d said Mr. Menzies, a 46-year-old graphic designer. \u201cLuckily, we will soon get a chance to set that right.\u201dThe votes for independence seemed to just outnumber those against, reaching a little bit higher in the clear ballot boxes. But in real life the balance is still the other way, with every poll so far giving the pro-union camp a clear, though shrinking lead.For the independence camp it is in many ways a race against time: Over the last six months the momentum has shifted toward independence, but at least one-sixth of Scottish voters in recent polls have said they were undecided or refused to answer.\u201cIf this referendum was in five years\u2019 time it would be straightforward,\u201d said Jean Urquhart, an independent member of the Scottish Parliament from the Highlands and Islands who was in the audience. \u201cAs it is, it will probably be very close.\u201d Ms. Urquhart, an advocate of independence, was elected as a longtime member of the governing Scottish National Party, but as a supporter of nuclear disarmament, left the party in October when it reversed its policy and chose to remain a member of NATO.Such shifts have caused some doubts about Scottish independence, too, with the party also advocating use of the British pound after independence, instead of the euro, despite statements by all the British parties that an independent Scotland could not be allowed to use the pound. Would an independent Scotland be a member of the European Union? Use the British pound? These questions, which depend on the decisions of others, cannot be easily answered.With the polls tightening, the former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown spoke in Glasgow last week in defense of the union, arguing Scotland is better off economically inside the United Kingdom, especially in terms of pensions and social welfare.Sowing doubt about the strength and viability of an independent Scotland\u2019s economy is at the center of the anti-independence campaign, known as \u201cBetter Together.\u201d But the \u201cno\u201d campaign against independence emphasizes the negative, and the sense that the English are patronizing the Scots as ineffectual and incompetent also feeds the independence campaign, stirring indignation.Evidence of the debate is everywhere, with signs on shop windows along the Royal Mile displaying the preference of the owners, and stickers like \u201cEnd London Rule!\u201d plastered to sidewalks.The referendum, open to anyone registered to vote, is binding and need pass by only one vote.Bookstores feature volumes on Scottish culture and history, community centers are planning summer history classes and seemingly every segment of society has its own campaign for independence, many supported by the well-organized Scottish National Party, led by Alex Salmond. There are \u201cyes\u201d groups for pro-independence mothers, students, seniors, small businesses, lesbians, gays and bisexuals \u2014 even for taxi drivers (\u201cCabbies for Yes\u201d). Iluta Stivrina, 24, moved here four years ago from Latvia. She loves it here, but thinks many Scots do not know what they are really voting for. \u201cI know all the problems of independence for a small country,\u201d she said. At the Scottish Storytelling Center, which includes a cafe, a theater and the medieval residence of John Knox, the father of Scotland\u2019s reformation, the shelves creak with books about Scotland. Chiseled into the modern stone entry is a line from the Scottish novelist Alasdair Gray: \u201cWork as if you live in the early days of a better nation.\u201dBut for Elaine Jenkins, who works there, the debate is getting uncomfortably hot, one reason the center has decided to pull back from debate-related events. \u201cPeople can get downright nasty about it,\u201d she said.Ms. Jenkins will vote \u201cno\u201d in September, she said. She said she felt both Scottish and British and would not be bullied into giving up either identity. \u201cOn a worldwide scale,\u201d she said, \u201cwe\u2019re better off as the U.K.\u201dBut Malcolm Fraser, an Edinburgh architect who designed the storytelling center\u2019s modern building, could not disagree more. A fervent believer in independence, Mr. Fraser is on the board of the Radical Independence Campaign. \u201cThe way forward is to be small, vigorous, independent and trade with everyone,\u201d he said. He puts his faith in \u201ca very sophisticated electorate\u201d in what he calls, happily, \u201ca mongrel nation.\u201dPeople have become afraid of the passions stirred by the debate, but Mr. Fraser said they should not be afraid of that. Britain is undergoing \u201can inevitable unraveling of empire.\u201d It was time Scotland became \u201ca bit more Danish,\u201d saying goodbye to England\u2019s more right-wing politics, he said.The pro-union campaign thought of the Scots as \u201ctoo small, too poor, too stupid,\u201d Mr. Fraser said. \u201cIt plays right into the \u2018yes\u2019 campaign.\u201dThe pro-union campaign has pulled its own stunts, one of them a plea from David Bowie, who has some Scottish ancestry. \u201cScotland, stay with us!\u201d was his message to the Brit Awards ceremony in February. Mr. Bowie could not attend the ceremony, but asked the model Kate Moss, who was dressed as his alter ego Ziggy Stardust, to deliver his speech.Prime Minister David Cameron, who was watching the ceremony live on television, said he had let out \u201ca little cry of joy\u201d upon hearing Mr. Bowie\u2019s message, though not everyone was impressed. Mr. Bowie soon found his Twitter and Facebook pages flooded with vitriol and comments like, \u201cGo back to Mars.\u201dIan Rankin, a novelist who created the popular and grumpy Inspector John Rebus and his better-adjusted detective sergeant, Siobhan Clarke, is one of Scotland\u2019s stars. Mr. Rankin seems genuinely conflicted about how to vote.\u201cThe heart says, \u2018Go for it,\u2019 the head says, \u2018You need some answers first,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Rankin said.But how would his main characters vote? \u201cRebus would vote no,\u201d Mr. Rankin said. \u201cBut Siobhan would vote yes.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Creating a Two-Speed Internet", "Date": "2014-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialTom Wheeler, the chairman of the commission, is proposing that broadband providers \u2014 phone and cable companies \u2014 be allowed to charge fees for faster delivery of video and other data to consumers. This would be a totally new approach to Internet service. It would essentially give broadband companies the right to create the digital equivalent of high-occupancy vehicle lanes for content providers, like Netflix and Amazon, wealthy enough to pay a toll. In this new world, smaller content providers and start-ups that could not pay for preferential treatment might not be able to compete because their delivery speeds would be much slower. And consumers would have to pay more because any company that agrees to strike deals with phone and cable companies would undoubtedly pass on those costs to their users.But the viability of those networks are based on decades of public investments in the Internet, the companies\u2019 use of public rights of way and, in the case of some companies, a long government-sanctioned monopoly over telephone service. Public interest groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and Public Knowledge oppose the creation of two-tiered Internet service because it offers no public benefit, but would squelch innovation. They argue that under the \u201ccommercially reasonable\u201d standard, the agency will be able to review deals to make sure phone and cable companies do not abuse their market power (in most markets, there are only one or two service providers). But the proposal does not meaningfully prevent discrimination; it is largely a capitulation to the broadband industry. The commission should move in a wholly different direction. It should decide to classify broadband as a telecommunications service, which would allow it to prohibit companies like Verizon and Comcast from engaging in unjust or unreasonable discrimination.

{"Headline": "Hypocritical Tax Cuts", "Date": "2014-04-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialOn Thursday, a strong bipartisan majority in the Senate Finance Committee voted to reinstate dozens of temporary tax breaks that had expired at the end of 2013. The package, mainly tax cuts for businesses, included sensible items like tax credits for the production of wind energy and other alternative fuels, and for research and development. It also included special-interest giveaways and some silly stuff like bigger write-offs for racehorses. But what\u2019s particularly outrageous is that the bill calls for the government to borrow the entire $85 billion cost of the two-year reinstatement. That is not just imprudent but hypocritical. For the past few years, Democrats have gone along with the Republicans\u2019 refusal to incur debt for programs that are far more effective than tax cuts at boosting the economy and far more urgent \u2014 like jobless benefits and spending on education and infrastructure. Instead of borrowing to pay for such needs, lawmakers have coupled most new outlays with spending cuts elsewhere in the budget, which amounts to giving with one hand and taking away with another. In contrast, borrowing to finance the tax cuts basically transfers money to corporate owners and executives, with no reduction demanded in other forms of government aid to business and with future taxpayers left to pay the bill. The Democrats seemed more concerned about defending the tax-cut package than about the double standard involved in subjecting social spending, but not tax breaks, to offsetting budget cuts. When he unveiled a preliminary version of the bill early last week, Ron Wyden, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, emphasized that 14 of the 59 expired tax breaks were, in fact, not slated for renewal, including those for \u201cmotorsports entertainment complexes\u201d and \u201careas damaged by 2008 Midwestern severe storms.\u201d But ditching a few blatant or outdated giveaways did not make the proposal fair or sound. Worse, by the time the full committee voted, most of the rejected tax breaks had been restored. The final package is expected to sail through Congress later this year. When it does, it will stand as a testament to misguided priorities. The cost to reinstate the expired business tax cuts is eight times as much as the cost of the plan currently before Congress to renew federal unemployment benefits. Republicans insist on paying for these benefits, but so far, despite Democratic proposals of offsets, they have opposed resuming them. Assuming that the tax cuts are renewed repeatedly \u2014 a safe bet \u2014 their cost over a decade will run to hundreds of billions of dollars. In effect, they will \u201cgive back\u201d more than half of the revenue from the fiscal-cliff deal of 2012, when tax rates were raised on very high income taxpayers. There are useful provisions in the new package. But it is unconscionable to borrow and spend on behalf of corporate America while rejecting even a modicum of prudent borrowing to address the unmet needs of ordinary Americans and the nation at large.

{"Headline": "European Central Bank Hints at Bond-Buying Program", "Date": "2014-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 The European Central Bank gave its strongest signal yet that it was considering action to stimulate the euro zone economy. But the bank immediately faced criticism that talk of large-scale bond purchases \u2014 the same method used by the Federal Reserve to help restart the United States economy \u2014 was little more than a bluff.Mario Draghi, the central bank\u2019s president, said that members of the bank\u2019s Governing Council, which met Thursday, had a \u201crich and ample\u201d discussion about so-called quantitative easing, purchases of government or corporate bonds on a grand scale as a way of reducing market interest rates.In addition, the central bank left its benchmark rate at 0.25 percent on Thursday, already a low.Inflation in the euro zone was 0.5 percent in March, its lowest level since 2009. Mr. Draghi said that the Governing Council had grown concerned about some of the negative effects of subdued price increases, which make it harder for euro zone countries like Greece or Italy to reduce their huge debts.The Governing Council \u201cis unanimous in its commitment to using also unconventional instruments\u201d to confront the risks of a prolonged period of low inflation, Mr. Draghi said, reading from a prepared statement.The statement was the central bank\u2019s most explicit indication yet that it was ready to deploy quantitative easing. Use of the word \u201cunanimous\u201d in the statement was evidently intended to show that such a move would not face dissent within the council from conservative members like Jens Weidmann, who is also president of the German central bank, the Bundesbank.At a news conference, though, Mr. Draghi declined to give specifics about how quantitative easing might be carried out in Europe, where most credit comes from banks rather than from corporate bonds as in the United States. That means the central bank would have fewer assets to buy as a way of pumping money into the economy.The lack of detail caused some analysts to conclude that Mr. Draghi, whose most effective monetary tool has often been his spoken words, was bluffing.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say how much of the rhetoric is a genuine signaling of Q.E. intent and how much is just trying to talk down the euro,\u201d Luke Bartholomew, an investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management, said in an email.The euro dipped against the dollar after Mr. Draghi\u2019s remarks to $1.37, down 0.37 percent from earlier in the day.Mr. Draghi said inflation was expected to pick up this month. That was probably one reason that the Governing Council decided not to take any steps now to stimulate the economy. And while Mr. Draghi said the council expected inflation to remain low in the midterm, the bank still expects inflation to approach the 2 percent level, which the bank sees as its target, in 2016.Mr. Draghi may be hoping that an increase in inflation in April will remove pressure on the central bank to be more aggressive. Mr. Draghi betrayed some annoyance Thursday with outsiders, including top officials of the International Monetary Fund, who have been exerting such pressure.\u201cThe I.M.F. has been recently extremely generous with its suggestions of what we should do or not do,\u201d Mr. Draghi said with sarcasm. \u201cWe are really thankful for that.\u201dThe central bank\u2019s council, he said, is unanimous in its commitment to taking steps to address low inflation if it deems them necessary. But for now, he said, \u201cWe need more information.\u201dSome economists have begun to warn of the perils of \u201clowflation,\u201d a term used to describe the phenomenon affecting the euro zone.Lowflation is not as damaging as deflation, a broad-based decline in prices that undercuts corporate revenue and often leads to higher unemployment because companies stop creating jobs.But very low inflation has other negative effects. When inflation falls, borrowers effectively pay more interest on existing loans. For example, a company that took out a loan when inflation was 2 percent, the European Central Bank\u2019s official inflation ceiling, would expect the effective cost of the loan to decline over time as price rises eroded the value of the principal.But if inflation falls, the cost of the loan is higher than the company expected. If the company is not able to raise its prices, it might have trouble paying its debts. In Europe, this negative effect is especially damaging because the countries with the highest debts tend to have low or negative inflation. In Greece, Portugal and Spain, prices are falling.\u201cWith low inflation, the real value of this debt doesn\u2019t go down as fast as it would if inflation were higher,\u201d Mr. Draghi said. \u201cIt makes the adjustment of imbalances much more difficult.\u201dMr. Draghi also argued, though, that low inflation was largely the result of falling energy prices and other one-time factors and would pick up in May.He acknowledged that deflation had posed problems in Japan in the 1990s, but added, \u201cWe don\u2019t see those risks now in the euro area.\u201dThe problem for the central bank is that the measures available to stimulate the euro zone economy are all risky and controversial.Extensive purchases of corporate or government bonds, the same tool used by the Federal Reserve to pump money into the American economy, would be more difficult in Europe. The Fed can buy United States Treasury bonds, the most widely traded debt in the world. The E.C.B. would have to choose among different bonds from its member countries. In addition, the corporate bond market in Europe is much smaller because companies tend to get credit directly from banks.\u201cOur institutional and financial setup is considerably different from what it is in the United States,\u201d Mr. Draghi said. \u201cThe program has to be carefully designed.\u201dMr. Draghi\u2019s specific talk of quantitative easing on Thursday may have raised expectations that will be difficult to meet, some analysts said.\u201cFrom here on, a further verbal stepping up seems impossible,\u201d Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING Bank, said in a note to clients. \u201cIn a way it\u2019s a gamble, either the recovery continues and inflation picks up again, or the E.C.B. will have to act.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Honing the Hybrids and Diesels", "Date": "2014-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGreentechBMW has long promoted diesel engines as an important element of its plan to reduce carbon dioxide output. The automaker is still a champion of diesel power, but now it is embracing electric drive, too. \u201cWe are taking an \u2018all of the above\u2019 approach,\u201d a spokesman, Dave Buchko, said of the company\u2019s advanced powertrains.While eco-minded BMW fans are focused on the sporty and stylish i8 plug-in hybrid, which starts production this spring, BMW is pushing ahead with development of fuel-sipping versions of popular mainstream models. Like many automakers, BMW has come to see the plug-in hybrid as a smart solution to meeting fuel-economy mandates at a reasonable price. The Concept X5 eDrive may be the best indicator of where that effort is headed. The S.U.V. is still a work in progress, but it will not be limited to auto show displays and technology presentations forever: A production version, to be built in Spartanburg, S.C., like all X5 models, is coming to the United States market, though not in 2014. The X5 eDrive\u2019s 9 kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack (6 kilowatt-hours usable) has an electric-only range of about 20 miles based on the European test cycle. BMW says that is sufficient, because its research shows 80 percent of X5 trips are shorter than that. Charging at 240 volts takes about 2.5 hours; there is no provision for DC fast-charging. The Concept X5 benefits from BMW\u2019s work developing electric cars, and components like the battery cells and power electronics are similar to those in the i3 or i8. The battery pack stows under the rear compartment, raising the luggage floor slightly. The car\u2019s electric motor produces 95 horsepower, according to BMW, and that combines with a 240-horsepower 4-cylinder twin turbo gas engine that delivers 260 pound-feet of torque. BMW\u2019s 8-speed automatic transmission is stripped of its torque converter in this plug-in application. The driver has a choice of several driving modes, emphasizing economy, comfort or sport; a Max eDrive selection can keep the X5 in electric-only operation up to about 70 m.p.h., but even then hard acceleration will cause the gas engine to engage. There is also a mode that conserves battery power, saving it for the portion of road trips where an urban zone of electric-only driving is expected.In a short test drive last week at BMW\u2019s North American headquarters in New Jersey, the Concept X5 was quiet and refined, with very light steering. It had a bit of lag in battery mode, but it eventually gathered speed. As a hefty S.U.V., the Concept X5 does not have the eager acceleration of the i3 or the i8, but BMW said the Concept X5 could reach 62 m.p.h. in less than seven seconds. Sport mode was the best choice for quick getaways, because it fully engages both motors, though at a penalty in fuel economy. This X5 has not yet been rated by the E.P.A., but Gerhard Thiel, the vehicle\u2019s project director, said that the company was aiming for 40 m.p.g. or better.Driven back-to-back, the i3, which reaches United States dealerships in May, was notably more fun to drive and throw into corners than the plug-in X5. The tiny i3 city car offers something like one-pedal driving. Regenerative braking, which uses the electric drive motor to charge the battery when slowing down, is dialed to 11, and merely backing off the accelerator quickly scrubs off speed. By contrast, regenerative braking in the X5 is scaled back and barely noticeable, a choice Mr. Thiel said BMW made to keep the driving experience similar to other entries in the model line. BMW continues to improve its diesels, demonstrating that they are neither slow nor noisy. Diesel versions of the 2015 X3 and 7 Series arrive at dealerships in the next month. From behind the wheel, a driver of the 740Ld xDrive flagship sedan gets few cues that it is not a gas engine under the hood. Slow acceleration isn\u2019t going to give the game away \u2014 this long-wheelbase BMW, powered by a 255-horsepower turbocharged in-line 6, accelerates to 60 m.p.h. in 6.1 seconds. The 413 pound-feet of torque helps. The preliminary E.P.A. ratings are 23 m.p.g. in town and 31 on the highway, perhaps making it easier for buyers to write a check for $83,425 (including $925 destination).The X3 xDrive28d (there\u2019s a mouthful of a model name) has a 180-horsepower turbo diesel 4-cylinder that is not as refined as the 7 Series\u2019 6-cylinder. But the torque is plentiful at 280 pound-feet, and the preliminary mileage rating is 27 city/34 highway. The compact diesel crossover is relatively quick on its feet, with 60 m.p.h. coming up in 6.2 seconds. Including destination, it will start at $42,825. Jason Chan, a product planner for BMW, predicted that the new diesel engines would capture about 15 percent of sales in the models that offer them. Advertisement"}

Then we write a strategic plan and present it to them that says: This is how many stores we think you could have; these are the best markets to be in. Once they approve that, then we physically start to look and investigate space within those markets.

We have a very sophisticated software system that is able to slice and dice all this information to the client\u2019s best advantage.And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve been able to avoid many pitfalls in the economy.

{"Headline": "Yes He Can, on Immigration", "Date": "2014-04-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialIf President Obama means what he says about wanting an immigration system that reflects American values, helps the economy and taps the yearnings of millions of Americans-in-waiting, he is going to have to do something about it \u2014 soon and on his own. It has been frustrating to watch his yes-we-can promises on immigration reform fade to protestations of impotence and the blaming of others. All Mr. Obama has been saying lately is: No, in fact, we can\u2019t, because Republicans and the law won\u2019t let me.Mr. Obama is correct when he complains that long-term immigration repairs have been throttled in Congress. Neo-nativist Republicans fixated on mass deportation have blocked a worthy bipartisan bill. But Mr. Obama has compounded this failure by clinging to a coldblooded strategy of ramped-up enforcement on the same people he has promised to help through legislation that he has failed to achieve. That would be nice. But that is only the beginning of what Mr. Obama and Mr. Johnson should do.These immigrants, known as Dreamers, are a sympathetic group, and Mr. Obama\u2019s move to protect them was timely and wise. But millions of other unauthorized immigrants are just as vulnerable and no less worthy. There is no good reason not to extend similar relief to the Dreamers\u2019 parents, or to the parents of citizen children and others who pose no threat and should likewise be allowed to live and work here while efforts to pass reform continue. If their language needs clarifying, Mr. Johnson, once the Pentagon\u2019s top lawyer, surely knows how to write clear rules of engagement. Some states like California do, too: They now strictly limit the kinds of people local police surrender to federal authorities for deportation. The administration needs to find ways to turn off the deportation machinery when it gets abused. It should end programs like Secure Communities that enlist local police as immigration enforcers. When immigrants assert their civil and labor rights against abusive employers, it should protect them from deportation and retaliation. These and other reforms should not be confused with a comprehensive overhaul of immigration, which only Congress can achieve. But they are ways to push a failing system toward sanity and justice.Mr. Obama may argue that he can\u2019t be too aggressive in halting deportations because that will make the Republicans go crazy, and there\u2019s always hope for a legislative solution. He has often seemed like a bystander to the immigration stalemate, watching the wheels spin, giving speeches and hoping for the best. It\u2019s hard to know when he will finally stir himself to do something big and consequential. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Piketty\u2019s Book Is a Bigger Deal in America Than in France", "Date": "2014-04-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDebate That DividesThe American response to Thomas Piketty\u2019s new book on inequality has been rapturous, with reviews comparing the author, a French economist, to Adam Smith, John Maynard Keynes and Karl Marx.Doug Henwood, a journalist for Left Business Observer, who is writing about the book\u2019s reception in America for a French audience, says in an email that the book\u2019s success in the United States \u201chas the French scratching their heads,\u201d although French sales are starting to pick up. Some found the book interesting when it was published in French last year, others found it lacking, but most French reviewers and intellectuals reacted as they would to any other recent economics book of interest.We have several hypotheses to explain the more muted French response.First, Mr. Piketty has been on the intellectual scene, and the darling of the French Socialist party and intellectuals, for some time already. An early appointment as an economic adviser to S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royale, the Socialist presidential candidate in 2007, gave him a platform to present his ideas to the news media. He also has had access to President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and many other leaders for a while, so Mr. Piketty is older news to the French political elite and journalists alike.Besides, in France, unlike in the United States, most people take for granted the notion that income inequality is growing and destructive. A book that tells people what they already believe may receive approval without generating adulation.The paper argues that the higher growth of capital rests entirely on returns to housing, and takes technical issues with the book\u2019s treatment of housing, too. If Mr. Piketty\u2019s argument depends on housing, it hardly seems to match his basic story about the ongoing ascendancy of capitalists.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Underpaid German Workers Helped Cause Europe\u2019s Debt Crisis", "Date": "2014-04-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIncomes and Outcomes To understand a crucial reason for the European financial crisis that nearly caused a global financial collapse and threatened to undo a six-decade push toward a united Europe, you could look at a bunch of charts of bond markets and current account deficits and fiscal imbalances.In most advanced economies, the middle class made significant advances in earning power over the last few decades, even if the rich have done quite a lot better. But one major country stands out as the exception, with middle-income workers seeing no meaningful increase since the 1990s.It is Germany, the largest economy in Europe. And the numbers are remarkable. From 2000 to 2010, after-tax income for people in the middle of the income distribution in Germany increased 1.4 percent. Not per year. Total.If you look at a longer time span, from 1990 to 2010, the ordinary German worker did not fare well either. The median per-capita income rose 7.5 percent, which works out to a rate of only 0.4 percent a year.At one time there was a good argument that middle-class German workers were overpaid relative to international competitors. In 1990, they made 10 percent more than similarly situated Dutch workers and 29 percent more than middle-income British ones. But by 2010, they made less than either.The stagnation in wages for the German working and middle class was intentional, caused by policy decisions connected to the challenges of reunification.As West Germany absorbed Soviet-dominated East Germany in the 1990s, the united Germany was often called the \u201csick man of Europe.\u201d Wage increases outpaced productivity, and lavish unemployment benefits led many workers to stay home rather than take low-paying jobs.Through a series of overhauls introduced by the government in concert with industry and labor unions, Germany aimed to get healthy again. The nation slashed long-term jobless benefits, which encouraged more people to enter the job market. It took steps to ensure that rising productivity of German industry translated into more people in the labor force rather than higher wages.The measures worked exceptionally well, which is reflected in both the stagnant wages and a falling German jobless rate.One result was a boon for German exports. By keeping a lid on wages, Germany made its exporters\u2019 products more competitive in the global marketplace. Germany was making more stuff than it was consuming, and exporting the surplus to the rest of the world, especially the rest of Europe.Which brings us back to the euro zone crisis. People (especially Germans) often view the crisis, which first became severe four years ago this spring, through this frame: Profligate, free-spending nations along Europe\u2019s southern coast (we\u2019re looking at you, Greece, Italy and Spain) borrowed more money than they could possibly repay; then, when the bill came due, they nearly caused the collapse of the common euro currency before being bailed out by their more responsible Northern European neighbors.That\u2019s not wrong, necessarily, but it is incomplete.The run-up in debt in Spain and Greece and Italy was the flip side of Germany\u2019s success in containing workers\u2019 wages and improving exports. Germany sold more stuff to Southern Europe than it bought. It took the profits and, in effect, lent the money back to those same Southern European countries. In Greece and Italy, it showed up as government borrowing, and in Spain as a housing bubble fueled by bank loans.It all fell apart once the indebtedness of the Southern European countries became too much to bear. Because all these countries use the same currency, the euro, none could relieve the pressure by devaluing their currency as they might have with their own lira, drachma or peseta.Europe has been forced to fix its internal imbalances some other way. The approach so far has largely been one of forcing steep cuts in wages and benefits on the Southern European countries, so that they can regain competitiveness against Germany.But there\u2019s an easier way (or what should be an easier way). Middle-income German workers could be paid more. They could use those higher salaries to consume more, whether German-made widgets, vacations in Greece or Spanish wine. That would mean lower trade surpluses for Germany, lower trade deficits for Southern Europe, and less German savings being recycled into Greek or Spanish debt. Higher incomes for working-class Germans would mean a more prosperous, financially stable Europe \u2014 and it wouldn\u2019t be too shabby for German workers, either.Altogether, that would be positively wunderbar.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Embrace of Foreign Cars", "Date": "2014-04-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHONGQING, China \u2014 For more than a decade, Chinese automakers have been talking about starting large-scale exports to North America and Europe, prompting periodic worries in the West that companies like General Motors, Ford and Volkswagen might be crippled by Chinese competition the way they were by Japanese imports a generation ago.Now there are calls for protectionism, but from an unexpected direction: the biggest, most politically influential Chinese automakers.Multinational corporations are steadily clawing market share from Chinese brands in their home market, as a succession of global brands have pushed their way into China. The latest insurgent is Ford Motor, which has a joint venture based here in Chongqing and has nearly doubled its market share to 4.5 percent in the last two years by introducing new models and expanding output, selling more than 100,000 cars and light truck in March for the first time in a single month. Ford plans to double production again in the coming year by opening two more assembly plants and one of the world\u2019s largest automatic transmission factories.Chinese consumers increasingly favor American brands, which have a reputation for safety, youth and international flair. The domestic brands have tended to lag in surveys of initial quality and engineering, although they are starting to close the gap. In long-term reliability, they are far behind and falling even further. Rising affluence has left consumers reluctant to accept cheaper, spartan models from domestic manufacturers. The domestic brands have been further hurt by poor crash test results for some Chinese-designed models and a series of food safety scandals that have dented public confidence in Chinese regulations.\u201cNow that I have a child, I\u2019m considering shifting to a safer car like a Ford,\u201d said He Hai, a 29-year-old real estate salesman, as he browsed at a dealership. He was preparing to pay 254,800 renminbi ($41,500), including hefty Chinese taxes, for a light green Ford Kuga.China\u2019s mostly state-owned automakers have responded with an unusually public campaign of news conferences and statements by the industry trade association. They want to persuade China\u2019s Commerce Ministry to retain a requirement seldom found in other top manufacturing nations: Foreign automakers may assemble cars in China only through 50-50 joint ventures with domestic partners.The multinationals have not asked to be set free. Instead, the Commerce Ministry raised the idea of dropping the requirement last autumn, fearing that industrialized nations would use the restrictive rules as justification for protectionism someday if China starts exporting large numbers of cars. But the big state-owned companies are less interested in exports than in having the multinationals tied to their partners indefinitely \u2014 and collecting the sizable profits that come with those relationships.\u201cIf there is a loosening of the restrictions on foreign ownership in automotive shares, it will instigate massive changes in the configuration of our country\u2019s automotive industry,\u201d Dong Yang, the executive vice chairman and secretary general of the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, warned in a statement at a recent news conference.The industry is not entirely in agreement. Slightly smaller automakers started by entrepreneurs do not have the same incentives to maintain the status quo since they generally don\u2019t have joint venture partners. They are also much more eager to move into foreign markets, through exports and overseas acquisitions.Li Shufu, the chairman and founder of the privately held Geely Holdings Group, wrote in an email interview last month that he thought the 50 percent cap should be abolished.\u201cThe cap has hindered fair, open and transparent competition, which undermines the interests of consumers and the overall competitiveness of the Chinese auto industry,\u201d he wrote. Mr. Li\u2019s personal holding company bought Volvo Cars from Ford for $1.5 billion in 2010, a bargain price during the financial crisis. State-owned automakers have been more cautious, with one of the largest, Dongfeng Motor, agreeing on Feb. 26 to pay $1.1 billion for a 14 percent stake in Peugeot \u2014 a holding that cements the two companies\u2019 venture in China but gives Dongfeng little say in Peugeot\u2019s management.Wary of offending their state-owned partners, multinationals have defended the joint ventures. \u201cIt is our common goal to further develop these and to be successful together in the Chinese automotive market,\u201d Volkswagen said in a statement.China has been trying for more than two decades to build the country\u2019s auto industry into an export powerhouse. The original goal of the joint venture requirement was to force multinationals to work with big, state-owned automakers with ample access to credit from state-owned banks. The ministry\u2019s hope has been that the state-owned automakers would learn from their partners to build world-class cars that they could then export.But instead of creating the next Toyota, the Commerce Ministry has created companies more like Foxconn, the Taiwanese contract electronics manufacturer that makes tablets and smartphones for Apple and other consumer electronics companies.State-controlled giants largely provide the labor and government connections for the joint ventures: Shanghai Automotive is a partner for General Motors and Volkswagen; Guangzhou Automobile is the partner for Toyota; Changan Automobile is a partner for Ford; and Dongfeng Motor juggles partnerships with Nissan, Honda, Peugeot and Kia.The multinationals have continued to provide most of the designs, engineering and marketing. They build essentially the same cars that they sell in the rest of the world. In Chongqing, for example, Ford makes the Kuga and Mondeo, which are sold as the Ford Escape and Ford Fusion in the United States.The Chinese automakers\u2019 association, dominated by state-owned enterprises, insists that the industry is too important to the country\u2019s economic future to be exposed to head-to-head competition with foreign companies.\u201cAutomobile manufacturing is not a standard manufacturing sector. It is a strategic asset that supports the transformation and upgrading of the national economy,\u201d said Mr. Dong of the association.Chinese brands\u2019 share of their home market for cars and light trucks has fallen at much the same pace that American automakers lost share over most of the last three decades, about a percentage point or two each year, down to 45.1 percent last year. Exclude the bare-bones pickup trucks and minivans that make up the separately regulated light commercial vehicle market, and domestic brands had only 29.5 percent of the car market last year, according to LMC Automotive, a global consultancy.Most of the state-owned giants have experimented with their own brands, but with limited success. Their offerings frequently look a lot like the cars from their partners.Marin A. Burela, the president of Ford\u2019s joint venture here, the Changan Ford Automobile Company, said Mazda and Changan had decided to end their collaboration for business reasons that had nothing to do with Changan\u2019s car designs. He denied that Changan\u2019s own brand cars looked like Fords or Mazdas.\u201cI\u2019ve heard that said, but I also go back and look at the vehicles and I don\u2019t see it,\u201d he said.Ford\u2019s rapid expansion in China over the last two years, with more to come, offers a case study of how China\u2019s own automakers have gone from feared to hapless.Ford\u2019s joint venture here in western China has 15,000 employees who assembled more than 600,000 vehicles last year, making it Ford\u2019s largest operation outside southeastern Michigan. Ford is about to open an enormous factory here to manufacture 400,000 automatic transmissions annually, with room to expand to one million, followed by a third large car assembly plant at the end of the year. A fourth assembly plant is set to open in Hangzhou, in east-central China, in February.Changan Ford opened its first assembly plant in Chongqing in 2003 and its second in 2012. The second factory is among the most modern anywhere in the world: Steel coils go in one end and finished cars come out the other just eight hours later.Rows of 15-foot-tall orange robots resembling huge, long-necked vultures lift, assemble and weld large body panels \u2014 basic tasks that have been automated at many factories around the world. But the newer Ford factory also has robots do delicate, precise tasks like installing and gluing the rear windows of compact cars, which are seldom automated except in high-wage countries. The second factory has 160 robots, compared with about three dozen in the older factory.Domestic Chinese automakers have also bought robots for their operations from international suppliers. But they have tended to rely much more on using huge teams of workers for manufacturing, and they have struggled to figure out how to integrate robots efficiently into assembly lines \u2014 a task that took decades for multinationals to master, even as they were working on customer research that Chinese manufacturers are still learning.\u201cWe\u2019ve ticked all of those boxes\u201d on Chinese automotive preferences, Mr. Burela said, \u201cand the Chinese consumer has absolutely bought into that, which has fueled our growth.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Israel's Sustainable Success", "Date": "2014-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Hearing an Indian official talk the other day about Delhi\u2019s booming arms trade and ever-closer relationship with Israel, I had a thought that also struck me while listening to Israeli businessmen in Beijing. The idea may be summed up in three words: It is sustainable.\u201cPivot to Asia\u201d is a term that might be applied to Israel. Its trade with China has boomed, reaching more than $8 billion in 2013 from a pittance when diplomatic relations were established in 1992 (the same year as with India). Europe huffs and puffs about the West Bank settlements; Asia does business. India has already bought sea-to-sea missiles, radar for a missile-intercept system and communications equipment from Israel.Tel Aviv, one of the world\u2019s most attractive cities, has a boom-time purr about it. For all the talk of its isolation \u2014 and all the efforts of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (B.D.S.) movement \u2014 Israel has an economy as creative as it is successful. Yes, it is sustainable.Behind its barriers and wall, backed by military might, certain of more or less unswerving American support, technologically innovative and democratically stable, Israel has the power to prolong indefinitely its occupation of the West Bank and its dominion over several million Palestinians. The Jewish state has grown steadily stronger in relation to the Palestinians since 1948. There is no reason to believe this trend will ever be reversed. Holding onto all the land between the Mediterranean and the Jordan River, while continuing to prosper, is feasible. This, after all, is what Israel has already done for almost a half-century.It is time to retire the unsustainability nostrum. Facile and inaccurate, it distracts from the inconvenient truth of Israel\u2019s sustainable success.Throughout this year the Obama administration has pushed the unsustainability argument to make its case for peace. \u201cToday\u2019s status quo, absolutely to a certainty, I promise you 100 percent, cannot be maintained,\u201d Secretary of State John Kerry said in February. \u201cIt is not sustainable. It is illusionary. There\u2019s a momentary prosperity, there\u2019s a momentary peace.\u201dMore recently, President Obama told Jeffrey Goldberg of Bloomberg View that his question to Benjamin Netanyahu was: \u201cIf not now, when? And if not you, Mr. Prime Minister, then who?\u201dObama also said of Israel: \u201cThere comes a point where you can\u2019t manage this anymore, and then you start having to make very difficult choices. Do you resign yourself to what amounts to a permanent occupation of the West Bank?\u201dBut that \u201cpoint\u201d of unmanageability is a vanishing one. Permanent occupation is what several ministers in Netanyahu\u2019s coalition government advocate. Backed by the evidence, they are certain it can be managed. They are right.Of course, manageability does not equal desirability. There is no consent of the governed in the West Bank. Dominion over another people is morally corrosive; Jews, of all people, know that. The nationalist-religious credo that the West Bank was land promised to Abraham\u2019s descendants has intensified over the past half-century. Settlers see their work as the culmination of the Zionist idea of settlement. The opposite is true. Israel has undermined its Zionist founders\u2019 commitment to a democratic state governed by laws. The occupation undercuts Israel\u2019s own Founding Charter of 1948, which promised a state based on \u201ccomplete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex.\u201dThese, too, are uncomfortable facts. But the evidence is that Israelis, in their majority, prefer to live with them than believe in a sustainable peace with Palestinians. Trust your neighbor? Been there, tried that. Which brings us to the agreement (yet another) reached this week between Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, and Hamas, the militant Islamist group, to form a unity government and hold elections within six months.Netanyahu leapt on it to inter the already half-buried peace talks: \u201cDoes he want peace with Hamas, or peace with Israel? You can have one but not the other.\u201d But Israelis are smarter than that. They know that any peace with only one Palestinian faction would not amount to peace at all; that without elections, eight years after the last vote, Abbas has no real legitimacy; and that bringing a weakened Hamas under Egyptian suasion into a unity government (if that happens) would increase pressure on Hamas to meet international demands that it recognize Israel\u2019s right to exist, renounce violence and accept previous signed agreements.Moving toward a two-state peace \u2014 the best outcome for both nations \u2014 cannot be based either on the myth that Israel\u2019s current situation is unsustainable or on the myth that the Palestinian Authority, as currently constituted, represents the Palestinian national movement. It can only emerge when a majority on both sides believes, based on the facts, that painful compromise in the name of a better future is preferable to manageable conflict fed by the wounds of the past.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Jordan Town, Syria War Inspires Jihadist Dreams", "Date": "2014-04-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byZARQA, Jordan \u2014 Late one night, Abu Abdullah left his whole life behind.Abandoning his wife, two children and a modest frozen foods business, he sneaked across the border to Syria to join an affiliate of Al Qaeda.He thrived on the blasts and gunfire and relished the feeling of serving what he saw as a celestial cause. But his wife\u2019s anguish soon persuaded him to return to this desert city, where he now longs for his days as an international jihadist.\u201cIf I could go back and do it again, I would not come back,\u201d he said. \u201cThose were the best three months of my life.\u201dJordanian analysts and Islamists estimate that 800 to 1,200 Jordanians have gone to fight in Syria, more than double the number who fought in Afghanistan or Iraq. Though the fighters come from across the country, fully one-third hail from here, the most from any single area.Most fighters disappear without telling their families, only to resurface across the border with the Nusra Front, Syria\u2019s Qaeda affiliate, or the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, a Qaeda splinter group. While some are uneducated and poor, others have university degrees and leave behind jobs, homes, cars, wives and children for a cause they believe will bring them rewards in heaven.For most, it is a one-way trip, either because coming home could mean jail time or because they die abroad. Every few weeks, a Zarqa family holds a \u201cmartyr\u2019s wedding,\u201d so-called because achieving martyrdom is not seen as a cause for sadness, but for gathering and celebration.While analysts say Jordan\u2019s stagnant politics and economy encourage marginalized, devout men to seek glory on foreign battlefields, Islamist leaders, fighters and their relatives describe decisions motivated by intense conviction.Many fighters are driven by the Syrian government\u2019s extreme violence and the sense that the world is doing nothing to stop it. At the same time, they see Syria as a launching pad for their project to erase the region\u2019s borders, found an Islamic state and impose Shariah law.\u201cThere is no such thing as Syria for the Syrians,\u201d said Munif Samara, a doctor and prominent Islamist in Zarqa. \u201cIf there is Islamic land, it is our duty to implement Shariah.\u201dMr. Samara, who knows many Jordanians fighting in Syria, said he would not discourage his own son, a dentistry student, from going to Syria if he chose to.\u201cHow long do we live?\u201d Mr. Samara asked. \u201cDo I give him the world or do I give him the afterlife?\u201dTo illuminate why local men fight in Syria, Mr. Samara arranged a meeting in his clinic between reporters and Abu Abdullah, who said that growing up in Zarqa, he had long been aware of jihad as a potential career path. Men he knew had fought and died in Chechnya and Iraq, and he began growing his beard as a sign of devotion after the death of Mr. Zarqawi in 2006.After the Syria conflict started, gruesome images on TV and worries about spreading Iranian influence led him to jihad, he said, providing only his nom de guerre to avoid arrest by the Jordanian authorities.Friends already in Syria put him in touch with a smuggler, who led him across the border at night with 16 other Jordanians, he said. All carried medical supplies, mostly pills and needles. He took only a spare pair of cargo pants and some extra underwear.Over 30, he was in worse shape than his younger colleagues, so he performed poorly at military drills, he said. But since he had run his own business, he was put in charge of the group\u2019s supplies, buying food for fighters and destitute Syrian families.He called home often, and after hearing his wife complain that raising their two children alone was hard, and that his 8-year-old daughter was troubled by his absence, he said, he decided to return home.The Jordanian authorities detained him at the border but released him a month later because they lacked evidence that he had been a fighter, he said.Now, back in Zarqa, he said that he missed his old life and that the police watched him closely.\u201cHere you feel like you are in a small cage and can\u2019t move,\u201d he said.His account could not be independently verified, but Marwan Shehadeh and Hassan Abu Hanieh, Jordanian experts on Islamic movements, said its details corresponded with the stories of other men who had fought in Syria.In many cases, the fighters\u2019 sudden departures deeply affect their families, leaving many torn between support for the cause and mourning their personal loss.Sitting in his book-lined living room, one Zarqa father, Mohammed Abu Rahaim, proudly swiped through photos on his phone and spoke of his two sons who had joined the Nusra Front in Syria.\u201cHe disappeared suddenly, then called and said, \u2018I am in Syria,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Abu Rahaim said, recalling his son\u2019s departure.And there was Harith, 32, who also left a wife, three children and a steady job. One photo showed him with a rifle at his side, heating water on a wood fire. The next photo showed him dead, his bearded face protruding from a body bag. Mr. Abu Rahaim said he had been driving when the phone call came with the news. \u201cI got out of my car and bowed to God,\u201d he said, proud that his son had achieved the martyrdom he so desired.Mr. Abu Rahaim, a professor of Islamic culture, said the family had often discussed \u201cthe affairs of the Muslims,\u201d including the wars in Bosnia, Iraq and Afghanistan, but that Syria felt more personal. His wife\u2019s family fled Syria in the 1980s during the government\u2019s crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood, and some of their relatives had been killed.Like many others, he saw jihad in Syria as a noble effort to replace the countries created by colonial powers with an Islamic state. \u201cWestern countries allowed sects, misled groups and misled parties to rule the Muslims,\u201d he said. \u201cWill this last forever? Impossible!\u201dBut Mr. Rahaim\u2019s wife, Huda Wazan, cried as she spoke of her sons, recalling how attentive the younger had been to his infant daughter and how she had once hidden the elder\u2019s passport to prevent him from quitting school for jihad. \u201cYou worry because the environment and the friends really impact the way these young men think,\u201d she said.While she believed it had been her son\u2019s fate to die in Syria, she was still crushed by the loss.\u201cThere are people who say it is a wedding for the martyr instead of a funeral, but I don\u2019t agree with this,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a funeral for me.\u201dRana Sweis contributed reporting from Zarqa.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Migrant Worker Nations, Unite!", "Date": "2014-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 When I was growing up outside of Bangladesh, my parents were careful to remind me that we had not become migrants and that our loyalties remained very firmly back home. (My father was a diplomat, and we roamed the world without putting down roots anywhere.) Back then, people left home for places like America, Britain and Australia, returning after many years with children who spoke heavily accented Bangla and complained about the heat. One of my distant relatives spent the entire duration of his vacation from Atlanta holed up in a giant mosquito net drinking only coconut water. Migration to those countries is still much sought after, but the Bangladeshi migrant today tends to be of a different sort: a worker who goes abroad for a short period of time, perhaps only a few years, with the sole purpose of sending money home. He leaves his family, and his loyalties, behind. These days, as I travel back and forth from Bangladesh, I often see at the Dhaka airport a line of migrant workers, in matching jumpsuits, boarding airplanes bound for construction sites in the Middle East and Southeast Asia.Every year, hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshis leave home to work abroad, mostly in the Middle East. The money they send back is the single-largest source of foreign exchange earnings for the Bangladeshi economy. As a result, Bangladesh tends to be unduly grateful to any state willing to employ its nationals, and often acts less like a supplier than a supplicant.But the worker\u2019s journey is perilous. From the moment he steps foot outside his home, he is susceptible to fraud, and often is swindled out of vast sums of money on false promises \u2014 fake visas and jobs that don\u2019t exist. If he does arrive legally in a new country, there sometimes is rampant abuse at the other end: low wages or no wages at all, dangerous working places, unsanitary living conditions and, worse, the inability to protest or even escape.Qatar has recently come under fire for abuses of migrants hired to help prepare for the World Cup soccer tournament in 2022. At the heart of the criticism is kafala, an employment-sponsorship system that exists throughout the Middle East. Though kafala, which ties workers to their employers, is supposed to act as a safety net for workers, abuse is rife. Human Rights Watch describes the practice in Saudi Arabia, by far the biggest employer of Bangladeshi workers, as a system in which employers, in violation of Saudi law, \u201cconfiscate passports, withhold wages, and force migrants to work against their will or on exploitative terms.\u201d As is so often the case, a situation that is bad for migrant men is many times worse for migrant women, most of whom are domestic workers. Though flawed, at least kafala offers some formal guarantees, like restrictions on working hours. But it does not apply to domestic workers; even if they work for a legal sponsor, they have no protections under Saudi labor laws. In 2009, after the global economic downturn, half as many Bangladeshis went abroad on short-term work contracts as had the year before. And when one employer after another went bankrupt, Bangladeshis already working abroad started returning in droves \u2014 at the rate of up to 300 a day. Migration picked up again in 2011 and 2012, but then dropped by almost one-third in 2013. Still, the total of remittances to Bangladesh last year exceeded $13 billion.Recently, the government has taken some welcome steps to help its emigrants. There are now several nationally funded initiatives to help Bangladeshis travel safely to their jobs abroad: assessments of recruitment agencies, access to loans, training and extended consular services. Under the Overseas Employment and Migrant Workers\u2019 Bill that was passed last year, migrants and their families can lodge both criminal cases and civil complaints for compensation against recruitment agencies that try to defraud them. These efforts, however, are mostly concentrated on the problems workers face before they set foot out of the country. When it comes to advocating for the rights of workers once they are employed abroad, Bangladesh remains reluctant to ask for better standards for fear that host countries would look elsewhere to satisfy their manpower needs.It is time for supplier nations like Bangladesh, as well as Nepal, Sri Lanka and India, to take matters into their own hands. They must conduct a coordinated effort to earn better rights for their nationals. If need be, they should refuse to send any new workers to the Middle East until host countries fundamentally change the basis on which they employ migrants. Supplier countries often compete with one another to secure jobs abroad for their people. But it is in their long-term interest to band together in a multinational boycott \u2014 even if for only a fixed amount of time \u2014 to pressure host countries to improve workers\u2019 conditions. After all, it is in their long-term interest to make clear that the men and women they send abroad to build stadiums or maintain others\u2019 homes are not expendable. Individuals already know this, of course. On a recent trip home, I met a Bangladeshi woman waiting for her luggage at the arrivals hall in Dhaka airport. She was returning from Jordan because an employer there had treated her poorly. \u201cSo what will you do now?\u201d I asked. \u201cI\u2019ll go again,\u201d she replied. \u201cTo a better country.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Strong Hand Hasn't Fared Well in India", "Date": "2014-04-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From IndiaNEW DELHI \u2014 At a dinner party in one of this city\u2019s wealthy enclaves recently, the subject had turned to the Indian election, and the elegant, accomplished woman sitting beside me explained why she had decided to back Narendra Modi. \u201cWhat India needs right now,\u201d she said, \u201cis a benevolent despot.\u201d It\u2019s not unusual to hear this sentiment in New Delhi drawing rooms these days. These are not necessarily speeches in praise of Mr. Modi, the hard-nosed, pro-business leader of the state of Gujarat. They describe a yearning for restoration of control, and the hope that it will translate into growth. Over the last five years, optimism about India\u2019s future has been replaced by anxiety about slipping behind \u2014 in particular, behind China. Blame has settled on the Indian National Congress-led government: its prime minister ineffectual, its parliamentary sessions clamorous and embarrassing. The desire for a strong hand has taken hold among the elites. Mr. Modi has had fortunate timing. It reminded me of something. In the late 1990s, the same yearning had emerged in Russia, a country I had covered on and off since the Soviet collapse. With the economy in disarray \u2014 a situation far more dire than India\u2019s, it should be said \u2014 President Boris N. Yeltsin was seen by Russians as a drunken bumbler, allowing oligarchs to plunder the state\u2019s assets while ordinary people suffered. The cry went up, even among liberals, for some version of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former dictator of Chile. Against that backdrop, Mr. Yeltsin handed off power to a former K.G.B. agent, Vladimir V. Putin. Mr. Putin, alert to his mandate, set about consolidating power: He stripped the country\u2019s oligarchs of their media holdings and political voice. He neutralized the threat posed by regional political heavyweights. Creating a superpresidency, one of his aides told me years later, was the only way to get anything done. The trouble with consolidating power, even in a centralized state like Russia, is that the job is never finished. New political challenges kept arising \u2014 from the middle class, from the Internet, from economic technocrats. After the smart economic reforms of Mr. Putin\u2019s first term, vital tasks, like rebuilding the country\u2019s infrastructure and manufacturing base, went neglected. Today Mr. Putin has more unchecked authority, arguably, than any other world leader. He is certainly credited with restoring Russia\u2019s position on the world stage. But can he govern? Corruption has flourished. Russia\u2019s economy is no more diversified than it was when he took power. And after 14 years of economic growth, the road between Moscow and St. Petersburg \u2014 the most heavily trafficked cargo route in the country \u2014 remains a potholed mess. This yearning for an enlightened despot has emerged before in India. When Indira Gandhi introduced the Emergency in 1975, imposing harsh penalties for acts that \u201ccause or tend to cause public disorder,\u201d well-off Indians loved it. Trains ran on time; bureaucrats were more disciplined; the streets felt safer; and, as a New York Times correspondent wrote at the time, \u201cmany Indians feel that they are now better off, economically or in some other way.\u201d That time lasted 18 months. Unlike Russia, India has repeatedly proved ill suited to authoritarian rule, a fact that Mr. Modi will surely encounter if he becomes prime minister. Nor is it clear that a consolidation of power can give India economic growth. The 20th century was full of examples of authoritarian leaders, among them Mao and Stalin, who transformed their economies by imposing policies on unruly societies. Since then, though, the correlation has weakened. Globalization has forced leaders to consider external factors like investment and access to private capital, which are drawn to democratic systems. If Mr. Modi becomes prime minister, there will almost certainly be moments when he glances over with envy at his counterpart in Moscow, but he would be wise to focus on building roads and factories, the accomplishments that have made him popular in Gujarat. He can\u2019t behave like Mr. Putin. For that, you need 10 million barrels of oil per day. videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Think Like the Dutch in a Post-Sandy World", "Date": "2014-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn December 2012, Shaun Donovan, the secretary of Housing and Urban Development, was on vacation in Berlin when he decided to detour to the Netherlands. He wanted to get a firsthand sense of the famed Dutch approach to water management. Hurricane Sandy struck six weeks before, and in the aftermath, President Obama asked him to lead a task force, whose objective was not just to rebuild but also to radically rethink the region\u2019s infrastructure in light of climate change.In the Netherlands, a man named Henk Ovink offered to be Donovan\u2019s guide. Ovink was the director of the office of Spatial Planning and Water Management, meaning, essentially, that it was his job to keep the famously waterlogged country dry. As he learned about various Dutch innovations, Donovan was struck by the fact that Ovink looked at water as much in cultural as in engineering terms, which was a function of the centuries-old need of the Dutch to act together for protection.For his part, Ovink said it dawned on him during Donovan\u2019s visit that the post-Sandy turmoil in the U.S. was an opportunity. Dutch water-management experts have done such a good job of protecting their country that they rarely get to practice with water crises \u2014 whereas America was facing something monumental that as a culture it didn\u2019t yet grasp. When Donovan arrived back in the U.S., he opened an email from Ovink that said, in effect, \u201cI hope this isn\u2019t too forward, but could I come work with you?\u201dI first met Ovink in Amsterdam last April, as he prepared to set off for Washington to begin his new job as Donovan\u2019s senior adviser. Ovink is a compact man with a shaved head and a bird-of-prey gaze who moves as if he were struggling to keep his wiry energy in check. He was raised in the low-lying, rural, eastern part of the Netherlands, where a glimpse out any window makes apparent the country\u2019s relationship to water. His father, grandfather and great-grandfather were all architects. He began to study art and math, then bowed to the inevitable and turned his attention to architecture. He entered government as director of housing and planning for the province of South Holland. Colleagues describe him as driven, smart, fast-talking, single-minded. When I asked him what he does in his spare time, he said: \u201cI like work. Sometimes I say to myself, \u2018Henk, where are the hobbies?\u2019 \u201dHe was clearly eager for the challenge of persuading a giant country that it needs to live with water and not simply resist it. But he was skeptical about anyone\u2019s ability to effect meaningful change in the United States. He had recently taken an exploratory trip to the Far Rockaways, with a team of American engineers that was rebuilding storm walls damaged by Sandy. \u201cThese are the same walls that broke before?\u201d Ovink asked. \u201cYes!\u201d came the reply. \u201cAnd what if they break again?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll rebuild them again.\u201dBeyond that, Ovink feared that politics might undermine any chance to encourage new thinking about water management. \u201cWhen I mentioned climate change to one official,\u201d he said, \u201cshe almost hit me.\u201d He characterized some of the wishful thinking he believed he would be dealing with as: \u201cDon\u2019t hire a Dutchman \u2014 believe in angels.\u201dDutch battles against water led his country to develop a communal society. To this day, Water Boards, which date to the Middle Ages, are a feature of every region, and they guide long-term infrastructural planning. American individualism, on the other hand, has yielded a system in which each municipality has a great deal of autonomy, making regional cooperation difficult. \u201cThe vulnerabilities are regional,\u201d said Judith Rodin, the president of the Rockefeller Foundation, which is the main funding organization working with Donovan\u2019s team. \u201cYet we have individual community rule, and very little incentive to get out of that.\u201dBut the need to apply new thinking in the U.S. couldn\u2019t be greater, Ovink said. Climate scientists predict that by the end of the century, sea levels will rise by between one and a half and four feet. New York City could see storm surges up to 24 feet. Miami Beach could be under water. \u201cWater has not been a policy issue in the U.S.,\u201d Ovink said. \u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re mostly all above sea level. But what if the sea level changes?\u201dDutch skill at water management goes back to the dikes, dams and windmills with which they reclaimed much of their land from the seas and rivers starting in the Middle Ages. In the 1950s, they constructed the Delta Works, a revolutionary series of storm-surge barriers along the North Sea coast. But thinking has evolved since then. With the increasing threat caused by climate change, Dutch engineers have developed strategies that go beyond simply trying to keep water out. The city of Rotterdam, for instance, is building floating houses and office buildings and digging craters in downtown plazas that will be basketball courts most of the year but will fill up with runoff during high-water periods, taking the strain off the surrounding streets.The plan being put into place in Nijmegen and 38 other sites is called Room for the River. A wide trench is being cut through the city where the river bottlenecks \u2014 50 farms and a number of residences are being relocated \u2014 and by summer 2015 an island will come into being. The island will form a new section of the city: Higher areas of it may contain apartment buildings; other, lower-lying sections will be developed into parks and beaches. During flood periods, the lower sections of the island will simply be engulfed by water. The new embankments in this lower area will be stepped, in part so that people can relax there and enjoy views of the city center, but also to encourage daily awareness of the ever-changing water level.When the plan was first presented, the reaction in the community was anger. To the Dutch, dams and dikes mean security. Actually allowing the water in went against centuries of ingrained thinking. But after a collaboration between city planners, community groups, the national ministry in charge of infrastructure and the region\u2019s water board, the town as a whole came around to the idea that because the world had changed, water management had to change as well. \u201cTechnically this isn\u2019t a very innovative project,\u201d Mathieu Schouten of the city\u2019s development office said. \u201cIt was the process that was innovative.\u201dWhen the final design was unveiled at a community meeting in 2009, it included both expansive recreation areas and a level of security from water that promised to make the city attractive to new companies. Those who were initially most resistant to the project \u2014 residents of Lent, the community that was to be trimmed to make way for the river \u2014 started to clap. \u201cThe Applause of Lent,\u201d as the local newspaper called it, signaled what Ovink and other Dutch planners had been working toward: the acceptance of climate change as a way of life, and the dawn of a 21st-century approach to living with nature.As we stood at the river\u2019s edge, away to the east behind us scenes of chaos were unfolding as unprecedented late-spring flooding caused deaths and mass evacuations in eastern Germany, the Czech Republic, Poland, Austria and Hungary. But here, at perhaps the river\u2019s most flood-prone spot, all was calm. When the project is complete, it should ease flooding concerns not just in Nijmegen but in Germany and beyond.To Ovink\u2019s amazement, virtually all relevant parties in the Northeast have grown receptive to what he has to say, with nary a word about angels. \u201cIt\u2019s weird!\u201d he said with evident satisfaction.Last summer, the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force issued its report of recommendations for long-term change in the U.S., and it was filled with Ovink-like ideas. Among the recommendations: The Northeast has to work more to utilize existing ecosystems, like dunes and undersea barriers. Artificial storm-surge barriers need to be created in some places, but only as part of the larger regional picture (for example, if a barrier had gone up near the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge between Staten Island and Brooklyn during Sandy, it could have actually increased flooding in Manhattan). The recommendations also include things like revamping wastewater treatment, making the electrical grid less vulnerable and designing new affordable housing. Small details \u2014 like programming elevators not to go to the basement if there is flooding \u2014 are given attention. And water containment has to be layered into the urban landscape. Dutch cities now build huge reservoirs under new parking garages. \u201cEvery time you rebuild,\u201d Ovink said, \u201cyou have to think about water.\u201dThe new buzzword that accompanies all of this \u2014 \u201cresiliency\u201d \u2014 is intended as a nonpolitically charged way of getting at issues underlying climate change: the need to rebuild in ways that take ecology, economy, infrastructure and weather uncertainty into account. Much of the credit for the change in thinking has to go to Hurricane Sandy itself, which hit in one of the richest, most populous parts of the country and also the center of American media. And it came after a series of catastrophic events \u2014 Hurricane Katrina and other storms, but also 9/11 and the banking crisis of 2008 and the subsequent global economic downturn \u2014 which, taken together, seemed to solidify the feeling of living in an age of chronic uncertainty.But Ovink is the man who has harnessed that energy. \u201cWe just do whatever Henk tells us,\u201d Donovan said with only a slight smile. Realizing that the best ideas would come from a range of thinkers, Ovink instigated a design competition, called Rebuild by Design. Some 148 teams made up of experts in a variety of disciplines \u2014 architecture, urban design, engineering, ecology, communications \u2014 put forward ideas for rethinking development in the areas affected by Sandy. An innovative aspect of the competition was that the teams did not present actual projects to be judged. To do that would be to design with past crises in mind, which is too stiff an approach, given the uncertainties of climate change. (One of Ovink\u2019s mantras is: \u201cWe need to use the future as a reference, not the past.\u201d) Instead, they identified sets of problem points and areas of research.Ten teams were given funding for field research toward scalable solutions to the region\u2019s problems. One team has focused on waterfront communities in New York City and is researching ways to decentralize electricity and other utilities, which would make neighborhoods more self-sufficient in a storm. Another plan would create a protective U that would wrap around Lower Manhattan, comprising parkland and retraction walls. Another has proposed new models for New Jersey\u2019s coastal towns that reimagine the beachfront: redeploying dunes, upgrading cities\u2019 water-storage capabilities and making boardwalks do double-duty as sea barriers. In the coming weeks, a final selection of projects will receive funding, and while the goal is to implement the designs in the region hit by Sandy, the long-term plan is to adapt them to other settings across the country.Samuel Carter, an associate director at the Rockefeller Foundation, underscored that the very concept of regional planning is still a work in progress in the U.S. \u201cA lot of people feel that it goes against the American character,\u201d he said. Ovink experiences that pushback on a regular basis. He told me that not long ago he was in New Jersey talking with residents hit by Sandy who were raising their houses on stilts. He laid out for them a future situation in which, rather than have each homeowner undertake such difficult and expensive work, the community would embrace measures to protect an entire region from flooding. The response, he said, was, \u201cThat would be a socialistic approach.\u201dNevertheless, Ovink said he believed this country\u2019s individualistic attitude is in the process of giving way to the realities of climate change. One place he is paying close attention to is Hoboken, N.J., which sits right across the Hudson River from Manhattan and is particularly vulnerable to flooding. During Hurricane Sandy, 80 percent of the city was under water, and at least 90 percent of the residents were without power. In trying to recover and rebuild, Hoboken\u2019s mayor, Dawn Zimmer, was schooled in how the American system is often at odds with communal solutions. The Federal Emergency Management Agency had money available, but there was a catch. \u201cThey were willing to give me funds to protect the fire station and the senior-citizen center,\u201d she said. \u201cThat money could help get me an additional pump to protect all of Hoboken, but I couldn\u2019t use it for that. Their policy goes against protecting communities.\u201dZimmer became a fan of the approach developed in cities like Nijmegen. She has a holistic vision for Hoboken, which would attack the city\u2019s problems from several angles. She wants buildings to install green roofs, covered with vegetation, to soak up rainwater. More trees in the urban landscape would help as well, and permeable sidewalks would allow water to drain. The city has spawned a volunteer group that is creating a \u201cmesh network\u201d of linked Wi-Fi spots to serve as an emergency communication system. Zimmer said she wanted to see cooperation across the whole region. \u201cBut I\u2019m practical,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that\u2019s going to take at least 10 years.\u201dIn the meantime, Ovink said he was interested in Hoboken because the city could serve as a test case: regional planning in miniature. One of the Rebuild by Design teams has developed a plan for the whole city that would erect barriers and pumps, turn existing parks into water-containment basins, create a green belt of parkland around Hoboken to soak up excess water and reconceive the electrical grid. \u201cDawn Zimmer has the opportunity to deliver proof of a comprehensive approach within her jurisdiction,\u201d Ovink said. \u201cIf Hoboken doesn\u2019t flood when the next big storm hits, she can show everyone else that this works.\u201dOthers, including some of Ovink\u2019s biggest fans, caution that significant cultural change still has to occur before his vision takes root here. \u201cIt\u2019s a long shot,\u201d Eric Klinenberg said. \u201cThe only reason to think it will work is that we know if it fails, we\u2019re essentially doomed.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iran\u2019s Choice for U.N. Post Fuels Tension With U.S.", "Date": "2014-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUNITED NATIONS \u2014 Six months after President Obama made a groundbreaking telephone call to his Iranian counterpart, Hassan Rouhani, the administration has made clear that expectations of a complete thaw in relations between Iran and the United States are premature.The latest reminder is the appointment of Hamid Aboutalebi, a veteran Iranian diplomat who is Tehran\u2019s choice of envoy to the United Nations and who once played a still-mysterious role in the 1979 hostage crisis.Mr. Aboutalebi\u2019s visa has been pending for at least two months. For the last 35 years it has been customary for the United States to disallow anyone known to have been affiliated with the Iranian student movement that held Americans hostage for 444 days.The visa holdup, first reported by Bloomberg News this week, is one of many efforts by Washington to put pressure on Iran, even as it negotiates with the government of Mr. Rouhani over its contentious nuclear program. The United States supported last week the renewal of a United Nations human rights monitor for Iran. It has pressed a separate United Nations committee to investigate reports that Iran is supplying weapons to militants in Gaza. Samantha Power, the American ambassador to the United Nations, said at a congressional hearing on Wednesday that the Iranian economy \u201cis in the vise of sanctions,\u201d which the Obama administration, she said, has no plans yet to lift.\u201cWe share your skepticism,\u201d she told a House Appropriations Committee hearing. \u201cWe share your lack of trust.\u201dMr. Aboutalebi said in an interview in early March that he was an occasional interpreter for the group but was otherwise uninvolved. \u201cOnce or twice I helped in translation in English or French,\u201d he told the website Khabar Online. A former leader of the hostage-taking group, Ibrahim Asgharzadeh, said Mr. Aboutalebi was not among the leaders of the group that took over the embassy \u2014 \u201cthe den,\u201d he called it \u2014 nor among its stable of regular interpreters. Mr. Asgharzadeh has become a reformist politician since then and has served brief stints in jail for speaking out against Iran\u2019s hard-liners.Whether Iran is racing toward nuclear weapon capabilities is one of the most contentious foreign-policy issues challenging the West.\u201cOn the whole, I think the hard-liners are trying to hold up the progress of President Rouhani\u2019s diplomatic team and make obstacles by making up the story that Mr. Aboutalebi was one of us hostage takers,\u201d Mr. Asgharzadeh said by telephone from Mashhad, his hometown in Iran. \u201cAnd I have heard Mr. Aboutalebi is a well-versed career diplomat, and I think he was honest when he said that he only was invited to do some translation assignments and nothing more.\u201dMr. Aboutalebi, 56, studied at the Sorbonne and served as Iran\u2019s ambassador to Australia, Belgium and Italy before joining the political office of Mr. Rouhani last October. He was part of his government\u2019s delegation to the United Nations General Assembly meeting in 1994. The State Department is obliged to let even its most strident critics come to United Nations meetings \u2014 which explains the visits of Mr. Rouhani\u2019s predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad \u2014 but visa rules for diplomats based in New York fall under different rules.In a measure of the wide gulf that remains between Iran and the United States, an Iranian lawmaker, Mehdi Bazrpash, said on Wednesday that the visa delay represented the latest American insult against Iran. \u201cIt is not fitting for our country that our chosen envoy to the United Nations is not accepted by America,\u201d he said, according to the Fars news agency.If Mr. Aboutalebi has sought to cast himself as a bit player in 1979, his prospective job here is among the most important for his government. Iran\u2019s permanent mission to the world body, on the 34th floor of a high-rise on the east side of Manhattan, is the country\u2019s only diplomatic outpost in the United States.A former State Department official who specialized in the region said that even if Mr. Aboutalebi\u2019s visa cleared, his conversations with Americans would necessarily be \u201ctoxic.\u201d Mr. Aboutalebi\u2019s nomination may also reflect Iran\u2019s failure to grasp American sensitivities over 1979, the former official said, requesting anonymity because relations with Iran are politically delicate.\u201cIt is in its interest to show that Iran is not getting a free pass,\u201d he said, adding that the United States cannot be seen as letting up pressure on sanctions, human rights or visas before it secures a deal. \u201cThey\u2019re doing a whole bunch of things to show we are not giving anything away to Iran.\u201dSomini Sengupta reported from the United Nations, and Thomas Erdbrink from Tehran.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Defying Moscow, Ukraine Threatens to Blockade Pro-Russian Militants", "Date": "2014-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKIEV, Ukraine \u2014 The interim central government in Kiev threatened to blockade the eastern city of Slovyansk on Friday, defying warnings from Moscow not to confront pro-Russian militants entrenched in towns across eastern Ukraine.In another affront to the Kremlin, Kiev also warned that any Russian troops crossing the border on maneuvers would be treated as an invasion.The declarations heightened concerns that the government\u2019s efforts to move against forces aligned with Moscow would incite a Russian military incursion that the Kremlin would characterize as a humanitarian or peacekeeping initiative.But on Friday night Western powers sought to stay Russia\u2019s hand. \u201cWe have now agreed that we will move swiftly to impose additional sanctions on Russia,\u201d the Group of 7 said in a statement issued by the White House. The sanctions could be imposed as early as Monday.\u00a0The statement was released hours after the Pentagon said that Russian fighter jets had made about half a dozen incursions into Ukrainian airspace over\u00a0the previous 24 hours.Col. Steven H. Warren, a Pentagon spokesman,\u00a0said that Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had spoken with his Russian counterpart\u00a0on Thursday, but\u00a0offered no details.\u00a0The government said seven foreign observers and five Ukrainian military officers had been seized. The detention appeared to give the rebels, who on Thursday had released an American journalist held for three days, a new set of foreign prisoners.Unconfirmed early reports had identified the detainees as monitors from the security organization, but the organization\u2019s officials said all of their permanent staff members and monitors had been accounted for. Tatyana Baeva, a spokeswoman in Vienna, said the reports evidently referred to a separate German-led group of unarmed military inspectors.The German Embassy in Kiev referred questions to the German Defense Ministry spokesman in Berlin, who could not be reached.The self-declared mayor of Slovyansk, Vyachislav Ponomaryov, was quoted by Russia\u2019s Interfax News Agency as saying that rebels were trying to verify the identities of the detainees, who had been on a bus that he said was carrying ammunition.Reached by phone Friday night, his spokeswoman escalated the language, saying the observers had been detained \u201con suspicion of being spies.\u201dShe cut short the call before providing details.Interim Ukrainian leaders said operations to expel pro-Russian militants in eastern cities would continue, even though military action so far had done little more than harden local sentiments, prompt Russia to stage military exercises on Ukraine\u2019s border and raise concerns about Moscow\u2019s next move.The acting head of Ukraine\u2019s presidential administration, Serhiy Pashynskyi, said the operation to dislodge what he called terrorists was continuing in and around Slovyansk and would now focus on \u201ctotally blockading\u201d the city to prevent militants from getting reinforcements and supplies.He also claimed that Russian military movements overnight at four locations on the Russian side of the border had involved \u201c400 tanks, armored vehicles and rocket launchers.\u201dAt a checkpoint on the road just outside of Izyum, northwest of Slovyansk, a combined force of soldiers and Interior Ministry troops were equipped with rifles and machine guns, backed with armored vehicles and at least one transport helicopter.\u201cWe have a good commander, and we believe him,\u201d said Sergei, a major with Interior Ministry troops who gave only his first name. \u201cBut this will all be decided up above,\u201d he added. \u201cThe politicians should resolve it.\u201dIn nearby Kramatorsk, a Ukrainian military transport helicopter and a civilian An-2 aircraft were destroyed by mysterious fires on the airfield that caused both aircraft to explode. The cause of the blazes was unclear. Officials gave conflicting explanations, including a helicopter being struck at takeoff by sniper fire, an incoming rocket and a mechanical problem.The airfield, however, was calm, with the pro-Russian and Ukrainian troops separated by a short distance and displaying no signs of hostilities.On Facebook, Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said Ukraine\u2019s military operations in the east \u2014 known as \u201cATO,\u201d meaning antiterrorist operation \u2014 had not been suspended, despite local news reports to the contrary.\u201cThe ATO goes on,\u201d he said. \u201cThe terrorists should be on their guard round the clock. Civilians have nothing to fear.\u201dResidents of Slovyansk, the city the government said was under blockade, reacted bitterly.\u201cWhat, they will allow no food in, no products?\u201d asked Natalya Ivanyuk, a retired teacher standing with pro-Russian men near a barricade guarded by armed men. \u201cIt is like Leningrad. Is it the Second World War?\u201d\u201cBlockade!\u201d she added, with disgust. She sharply criticized the interim government in Kiev. \u201cNo one comes here and asks us what we want,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead they send tanks.\u201dAt the edges of the city, rebels and work brigades alike could be seen fortifying older positions and building new ones. At one partly erected bunker, beside a canal, women worked beside men until almost sunset, filling and hauling sandbags.\u201cIn our view, the tense geopolitical situation between Russia and Ukraine could see additional significant outflows of both foreign and domestic capital from the Russian economy and hence further undermine already weakening growth prospects,\u201d the agency wrote.In his most detailed accusation of interference yet, Secretary of State John Kerry said Thursday that American intelligence services had concluded that Russia\u2019s military intelligence services and \u201cspecial operators\u201d were \u201cplaying an active role in destabilizing eastern Ukraine with personnel, weapons, operational planning and coordination.\u201dOn Friday, Mr. Kerry\u2019s Russian counterpart, Sergey V. Lavrov, hit back, accusing Washington of seeking only to further its interests in Ukraine.\u201cThe West wants to take control of Ukraine while exclusively putting its geopolitical interests, not the interests of the Ukrainian people, at the forefront,\u201d he said at a conference of diplomats from former Soviet republics. \u201cThis is not our method. We will not blackmail, we will not threaten, we are all polite people.\u201dAndrew Higgins reported from Kiev, and C. J. Chivers from Kramatorsk, Slovyansk and Izyum, Ukraine.

{"Headline": "Leveled by Landslide, Towns Mull How to Rebuild", "Date": "2014-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOSO, Wash. \u2014 A sometimes awkward, invariably agonized conversation about the future has begun here at the site of last month\u2019s devastating landslide, about what might be rebuilt and what was perhaps forever lost that day.It is a delicate chemistry, responders and residents say, with the needs of the families grieving or looking for their loved ones \u2014 39 people were killed by the slide, with four others still missing \u2014 balanced against the needs of the many other families and businesses struggling with the slide\u2019s aftereffects on the local economy, the transportation system and the environment.\u201cWe\u2019re doing what a family would do: We\u2019re listening to each other,\u201d said Washington\u2019s governor, Jay Inslee, who has repeatedly visited the communities around the slide, helping guide a transition in tone from disaster response to recovery and reconstruction. \u201cNo one in those communities is untouched.\u201dThe impacts are daunting and deep.A one-mile section of state highway crucial to life in this corner of the North Cascades, about 55 miles northeast of Seattle, lies shattered and buried, with pieces of the yellow divider line carved out and hurled up into the debris field. State engineers said this month in community meetings that they hoped to open a primitive one-lane detour within weeks, but that restoring even partial traffic on the old Route 530, portions of it under 20 feet of mud, was months away at the earliest.The Stillaguamish River and the streams that fed it in the Oso Valley have shifted into new patterns of flood risk and water quality. Some wells have turned turbid with silt, while others are now bubbling like artesian springs, as the millions of tons of moving earth changed subterranean pressures.Perhaps most profound for many people is a new awareness of the dangers of life here, amid crumbly and steep glacial slopes, that is changing the psychology. The Cascades are uniquely prone to slides, as rivers like the Stillaguamish, fed by the wet Pacific Northwest weather, cut through the hundreds of feet of rubble left on the mountaintops when the glaciers retreated. The landslide on March 22 also came after weeks of near-record rain.\u201cI don\u2019t think it ever felt safe,\u201d said Erika Morris, a resident of Darrington, on the east side of the slide from Oso, as she stared at a map one night last week after a town hall meeting with state and local officials. The map showed old landslides in and around Oso, some dating back perhaps 10,000 years or more, with almost every stretch of the valley marked by a shadow of prior impact.\u201cThis kind of map just shows you,\u201d she said, running a finger down the surface. \u201cThese are slides, unstable slopes, glacial till \u2014 and things happen.\u201dRobin Youngblood lost her home in the disaster and says that in a recurring dream she still sees the wall of mud roaring toward her. She said she did not think any residents of Oso, which had a population of about 180 before the landslide, would ever go back and try to rebuild homes or their lives in the area. She has imagined instead a memorial and park there, with perhaps a carved totem pole made from the 100-foot-tall spruce tree near her house that withstood the slide.\u201cThe other half of the mountain is still unstable,\u201d Ms. Youngblood said. \u201cI\u2019m certainly not going to take the risk of going through that again.\u201dBruce Cheek, whose home was spared \u2014 his was the fourth house from where the mud stopped its rampaging flow on the slide\u2019s western side \u2014 raised his hand at a meeting at the Oso Community Chapel and said he thought the disaster was not even over. He lives along the Stillaguamish River, which was prone to flood even before the disaster, he said, and which is cutting a new channel through the debris field.\u201cWhat is the river going to do to us?\u201d he asked the state engineers who had posted their maps and charts on the church\u2019s music stands in front of a big golden cross on the wall. \u201cWe dodged the first bullet. We may not dodge the second or the third.\u201dThe answer Mr. Cheek got, he said afterward, was not entirely reassuring. The river\u2019s bed was raised 11 feet, the engineers said, and dammed above the slide as well, with resulting changes in flow and behavior that will require years of study.Small-business owners on both sides of the slide said they worried that state and federal disaster relief efforts, perhaps in sensitivity to the grieving families, might go so slowly that an economic disaster would compound the landslide. With the state highway closed, towns on both edges of the slide \u2014 Darrington to the east, Oso and areas of Arlington to the west \u2014 have effectively been put on dead-end roads; transit through the corridor during the crucial summer vacation season will not happen this year.\u201cI think the efforts are caught up in the emotions,\u201d said Carla Hall, 57, the owner of Fruitful Farm, a flower and organic produce market near the slide, where customers, she said, have all but disappeared. Ms. Hall, who pulled Mr. Inslee aside at one of the meetings last week to press her concerns, said that the human losses to Oso and Darrington were horrible and that she had known many of the victims. They would not want an area they loved to fall further into ruin, she said. But she also left the meeting, she said, with a better understanding of the recovery plan\u2019s challenges.An altered river flood plain, for example, means a new design for the rebuilt state highway, with a dike to hold back water or the construction of elevated sections to raise the roadbed. The two-mile detour through the mountains around the site, much of it along what was a power-line maintenance track, depends on getting approvals from private landowners. Even how much earth must be removed to build a permanent new highway corridor is uncertain; engineers are still calculating how wide a track must be carved out to keep unstable debris from sloughing back onto the roadway.\u201cThere are no simple solutions,\u201d Dan Rankin, Darrington\u2019s mayor, said in an interview at the town\u2019s Community Center after a meeting with residents in the gym. Mr. Rankin, a sawmill owner whose family came to the Cascades in the 1920s, said he worried every day that what was lost that Saturday morning in Oso was only the beginning. \u201cHow do we pick up the pieces?\u201d he asked, as volunteers and neighbors came by to say good night.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Familiar Script in Ukraine", "Date": "2014-04-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialPresident Vladimir Putin of Russia may not have the same designs on eastern Ukraine as he had on Crimea, but it is no longer possible to preclude any such moves. The United States and Europe have said time and again that further Russian aggression would prompt a stern and painful response. Now is the time to prepare it.Mr. Putin and his jingoistic supporters in the Kremlin purport to scorn Western sanctions \u2014 at least the little they\u2019ve felt so far. He knows that the tens of thousands of well-equipped troops he has massed within striking distance of eastern Ukraine would not be seriously opposed.Yet he must understand that the cost of invading eastern Ukraine would be much greater than the putsch in Crimea, both in damage to Russia\u2019s already sagging economy and in the new Cold War that would surely arise. Ukrainians would not forgive the theft of an economically critical region; NATO would be re-energized; and opposition within Russia would also grow as isolation and potential recession shut off the freedoms and prosperity Russians were learning to enjoy.So far, Mr. Putin has indicated that his goal for Ukraine is a federal structure in which the provinces would have considerable autonomy from Kiev, plus some constitutional guarantees that Ukraine would not join NATO. The secessionist turmoil in Donetsk and elsewhere may be intended to pressure Kiev into an arrangement suitable for Moscow. There is a danger, of course, that Russia would seek to dominate the eastern and southern provinces that were the industrial core of the Soviet Union, but Ukrainian leaders have agreed that some degree of constitutional decentralization is needed, and it is for Ukraine to decide its organization. Mr. Putin has awakened passions that even he may not be able to control. It is easy to imagine how secessionist demands in Donetsk, Kharkiv or Luhansk could turn violent, compelling Mr. Putin (or giving him a pretext) to make good on his pledge to \u201cdefend\u201d Russians in Ukraine. The next Western response must be ready and credible, and that means, above all, that the Europeans have to look beyond their internal problems and join Washington in agreeing to a package of extensive and strong sanctions that can be put in place immediately should that be necessary, including restricting the access of Russian banks and corporations to Western financial markets.

One of them said, \u201cI really hope that everyone does not expect Rio to be better than this.\u201dIn truth, almost everyone does not. Neither Brazil nor any of its neighbors have staged an Olympics, and it was clear that Rio, despite its high profile and abundant charms, was going to face organizational challenges of a higher magnitude. The trade-off, however, seemed worth it to bring the Games to new territory.Yet even with lowered expectations, the preparation for South America\u2019s first Olympics is clearly not up to snuff. And this week Olympic and international sports officials, concerned over the lack of construction and commitment in Rio, sounded the alarm in public at the SportAccord Convention in Turkey.\u201cPerhaps we are perceived as bad boys at this moment, but I think we are the most important ally of the Brazilian organizers because without this alarm we really could be in trouble if we miss some more time,\u201d Francesco Ricci Bitti, the president of the Association of Summer Olympic International Federations, said in a telephone interview on Friday after returning to London.Ricci Bitti is also the president of the International Tennis Federation and a member of the International Olympic Committee\u2019s coordinating commission for the 2016 Games.

Two major concerns: the Deodoro complex, essentially Rio\u2019s secondary Olympic Park, where major construction work has yet to begin, and the first Olympic golf course, which does not look remotely ready for golf.\u201cThe organizing committee for the Games is made now of professional, good people, but they have no leverage,\u201d Ricci Bitti said. \u201cSo they were always talking about the salad but never about the beef. The timeline for construction is very, very late, and very few federations are confident to have what the bid said. Very few.\u201dThe economic and political context has changed dramatically since Rio\u2019s bid prevailed in 2009. Brazil\u2019s economy is now suffering, and Ricci Bitti said the \u201cgreat cohesion\u201d between the federal and local levels of government toward the Olympic effort was no longer apparent. The politics have become much more complicated because of public protest and looming elections. Brazil\u2019s leaders \u2014 the ones with the real and requisite clout \u2014 appear distracted, and not just by the upcoming World Cup.\u201cObviously it was not a pleasure to send this strong message, but we are scared that the trend on their side was to postpone everything again for six or eight months because of the two big events: the FIFA World Cup and elections,\u201d Ricci Bitti said. \u201cThe government has to move. This was the message that has to be sent. The organizing committee has a cash flow very much lower than they need.\u201dThe reflex is to consider this Olympic business as usual, to recall the tumultuous rush before the 2004 Games in Athens with all the delays and doomsayers, who eventually had to concede that the Games turned out quite swimmingly (though the legacy and long-term costs were a different matter).After all, the drumbeat leading into an Olympics is routinely, perhaps systemically, negative.Michael Pirrie, a key adviser at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney and to the 2012 London Games chief, Sebastian Coe, often makes reference \u2014 tongue slightly in cheek \u2014 to the six stages of Olympic organization.\u201cThere\u2019s the euphoria of winning the bid, then the shock of understanding the fully massive scale of what\u2019s required,\u201d Pirrie said in an interview. \u201cThen there\u2019s the rise of the instant experts, the people who said you\u2019d never win the bid or that your city or country didn\u2019t need the bid but now are telling you how to deliver the Games.\u201cThen you have the persecution of the innocent, whereby anybody connected to the organization of the Games is somehow responsible for any major or minor detail of the planning going slightly awry. Then you have the successful delivery of the Games, with the help of the volunteers and everyone involved. And then, finally, you have the glorification of the uninvolved, all the people who sat on the sidelines and watched it all evolve and then suddenly were the ones who helped deliver it.\u201dRio still has a chance for a happy ending. As Pirrie points out, \u201cit\u2019s not like they are building a space station.\u201d Although the knowledge transfer between Games has improved, time is dwindling, and what is remarkable and troubling is the number of officials sharing their fears, when they are typically the ones reassuring the public and the news media that all will be sorted out. \u201cI think the situation in Rio is far more serious than anything the I.O.C. faced in Athens,\u201d Michael Payne, a former I.O.C. marketing director who was a consultant to Rio\u2019s successful bid, said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a case of someone shouting wolf or whatever.\u201dPayne added: \u201cI don\u2019t think the I.O.C. has faced such a serious crisis relative to the delivery of the Summer Games ever. The last time you would have had a crisis of this level impacting on the Games would have been the Moscow-L.A. boycotts in 1980 and 1984.\u201dThomas Bach, the I.O.C. president, has not ruled out moving the Olympics from Rio. But it still seems nearly certain that it will be Rio, two years after Brazil stages this summer\u2019s soccer World Cup, which has plenty of its own concerns.\u201cI would not recommend to have in the same place and in the same country two events of this kind in the same cycle,\u201d Ricci Bitti said. \u201cBut now it\u2019s happening.\u201dIndeed it is, and the next two years and four months seem guaranteed to be a much wilder ride than they should have been.Because of an editing error, the On the Olympics column on Saturday, about concerns with the 2016 Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, omitted the given name and title of the person who had not ruled out moving the event. He is Thomas Bach, who is president of the International Olympic Committee.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "White House Details Thinking on Cybersecurity Flaws", "Date": "2014-04-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In a rare insight into the government\u2019s thinking on the use of cyberweapons, the White House on Monday published a series of questions it asks in deciding when to make public the discovery of major flaws in computer security or whether to keep them secret so that American intelligence agencies can use them to enable surveillance or an attack.Mr. Daniel repeated the N.S.A.\u2019s declaration several weeks ago that \u201cwe had no prior knowledge of the existence of Heartbleed,\u201d a security vulnerability that created widespread fears that passwords or other delicate information transmitted by millions of computer users may have been revealed. But he acknowledged that the Heartbleed incident had cast a light on a balancing test the White House has until now declined to discuss in any detail: When should the government reveal flaws that it discovers, and when should it use them for its still-unacknowledged \u201cstockpile\u201d of flaws that would help it penetrate foreign computer networks?But the intelligence agencies, along with the F.B.I., have argued that giving up a key weapon in that arsenal would amount to unilateral disarmament. The White House seems to agree.\u201cIn the majority of cases, responsibly disclosing a newly discovered vulnerability is clearly in the national interest,\u201d Mr. Daniel wrote, because of the need to keep Internet transactions, on which the world economy heavily depends, as secure as possible. \u201cThis has been and continues to be the case.\u201dBut he spent the rest of his blog entry describing what conditions might lead to a decision not to publish the details of a flaw \u2014 perhaps for a short time, perhaps for much longer. \u201cDisclosing a vulnerability can mean that we forego an opportunity to collect crucial intelligence that could thwart a terrorist attack, stop the theft of our nation\u2019s intellectual property, or even discover more dangerous vulnerabilities that are being used by hackers or other adversaries to exploit our networks,\u201d Mr. Daniel wrote, describing the review that has taken place at the White House in the past few months.\u201cThis is an acknowledgment of the need to do offensive cyber, both espionage and attack,\u201d said Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard law professor who served in the Bush administration and has written extensively on the legal rationales for the use of cyberweapons. \u201cWhat\u2019s notable is that the White House has now agreed that these issues have to be considered at a higher level, that often it\u2019s a hard call, and it\u2019s not an issue that should just be left to the N.S.A. or the F.B.I.\u201dMr. Daniel wrote that the administration has now \u201cestablished a disciplined, rigorous and high-level decision-making process for vulnerability disclosure.\u201d He did not say who would participate, or whether the hardest questions would be bounced to the president, much as he sometimes reviews the details of drone strikes or other covert operations that could have diplomatic implications. Mr. Daniel did not say who runs that process, but administration officials say it is largely directed by the National Security Council, and often by Mr. Daniel himself.That group would weigh at least nine questions that Mr. Daniel enumerated. The first was: \u201cHow much is the vulnerable system used in the core Internet infrastructure, in other critical infrastructure systems, in the U.S. economy, and/or in national security systems?\u201d That seemed to suggest that a vulnerability that had potentially wide impact on the American economy, its utilities or the cellphone networks, for example, would be more important than one with narrow implications.Another question for the group to consider, he wrote, was how much harm \u201can adversary nation or criminal group\u201d could do with the vulnerability and whether it would be possible to know that such a nation or group was exploiting it. In the case of Heartbleed, the government was apparently unaware of the flaw, even though it had existed for roughly two years.Other questions turned to the issue of whether intelligence agencies think the information is necessary, for surveillance or an attack, and whether there are other ways to get it. Among the most interesting questions on the list was this one: \u201cCould we utilize the vulnerability for a short period of time before we disclose it?\u201d That suggests an option to allow the White House to split the difference between its intelligence needs and the principle of public disclosure.Advertisement"}

No surprise there. But Mr. Puri, a new business owner, was feeling pretty good, too, after weeks of worrying and calculating the cost of the new law.\u201cIt\u2019s the law and it\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt won\u2019t bust the bank. It won\u2019t put us in jeopardy.\u201dFor Mayor Bill de Blasio, who significantly expanded the law\u2019s reach when he took office in January, it is a notable and welcome victory. He has been battered and bruised as his efforts to raise the city\u2019s minimum wage and to tax the wealthy to pay for universal prekindergarten foundered in Albany.But with the paid sick leave law, the mayor has clearly succeeded in making good on his promise \u201cto lift up working families and raise the wage and benefit floor for all New Yorkers.\u201dUnder the new law, companies with five or more employees will have to provide up to five paid days off to workers if they, or their close relatives, fall ill. (Employees accrue leave based on their hours worked.) A weaker version of the law, which passed last year, would have affected businesses with 15 or more workers and did not include the manufacturing sector.In corporate conference rooms, such changes might be greeted with a yawn. After all, we professionals typically take paid sick leave for granted. But in today\u2019s economy, where the fastest growing sectors are creating low-wage jobs, this change could not be more critical.Blair Phoenix, 25, who earns $1,300 a month as a cook at Mr. Puri\u2019s restaurant, found that out the hard way. When she was out sick for a week in March, she ended up with a $325 hole in her budget that she is still struggling to fill.\u201cIt\u2019s a relief,\u201d Ms. Phoenix, a single mother, said of the new law. \u201cIt gives you room to breathe.\u201dAs for Mr. Puri, 34, he felt anguished at first over the new law. In his sunlit restaurant, he and his employees often work shoulder-to-shoulder as they chatter about their weekends and favorite musicians while serving up vegetarian sandwiches and wraps.He prides himself on being a progressive employer and pays his workers $10 an hour, $2 over the minimum wage. Even so, he acknowledges that his first reaction was: \u201cIs this going to put me out of business?\u201dHis concern faded when he learned that sick days only begin once a worker has been on the job for three months (current employees can start taking time three months after April 1). Then he crunched the numbers and realized that he could absorb the cost.Mr. Puri still worries that some employees might try to take advantage of the new law. (\u201cI guess I\u2019ll have to cross that bridge when I get to it,\u201d he said.) But as a former Wall Street analyst, he remembers how he counted on paid sick leave when he was an employee. His staff, he said, deserves the same.Email: swarns@nytimes.com\nTwitter:\u00a0@rachelswarns Email: swarns@nytimes.comTwitter:\u00a0@rachelswarnsAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "No Spring Thaw in the Job Market", "Date": "2014-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialOne of the many good things about the arrival of spring is that politicians, economists and other policy makers can no longer blame the winter weather for the slow economy and the grinding pace of job growth.The employment report for March, released Friday, indicates that weather did not have as negative an impact in January and February as originally believed; job tallies for those months were revised upward. Accordingly, the springtime bounce in employment was not as great as anticipated. The 192,000 new jobs created in March fell short of the consensus forecast for stronger growth. Monthly job growth averaged 178,000 in the first quarter, compared with the monthly average of 194,000 in all of 2013. That\u2019s not progress. The sluggish job market is consistent with economic growth forecasts for the first quarter of 2014, which generally top out around 2.5 percent, and broader economic-growth data from the last quarter of 2013, which showed little momentum heading into 2014. In March, after almost five years of achingly slow recovery, private-sector employment finally surpassed its prerecession peak. But there is more to a healthy job market than replacing private-sector jobs that were lost. A more complete picture must also include the government jobs that have been lost since the recession but never replaced, as well as jobs that were needed to keep up with population growth but never created. All told, the economy is still short a stunning 7.3 million jobs. It didn\u2019t have to be this way. The recession required a government response commensurate with the downturn\u2019s depth and damage. But after the federal stimulus in 2009, lawmakers left the economy largely to its own devices, in which the \u201cinvisible hand\u201d of market forces is supposed to spur growth. Or worse, they actively thwarted the recovery by their premature turn to budget austerity, in which public resources have been withheld and withdrawn, harming already meager growth. The Federal Reserve has been able to soften the blow of misguided and inadequate fiscal policy by keeping interest rates extraordinarily low. Its efforts are no substitute for government spending to create jobs and support consumption, but at least they have been consistently, if indirectly, aimed at promoting job growth. In a speech this week, the new Fed chairwoman, Janet Yellen, pledged to continue the Fed\u2019s efforts. And yet, she defended recent, albeit small, retreats in those efforts as warranted by \u201crecent progress in the labor market.\u201d Her remarks also seemed to indicate that within the Fed there is disagreement on whether it is realistic to believe that fostering further improvement in the job market is even feasible. In her speech, Ms. Yellen said that helping the job market was both possible and required under the Fed\u2019s dual mandate to promote full employment and ensure stable prices. As chairwoman, hers is the most important voice on the issue. But the countervailing sentiments from other Fed members is cause for concern. The job market is far from healed. It will not recover on its own. Ms. Yellen and the other Fed members need to keep that in mind in fashioning monetary policy and in their dealings with lawmakers who will blame anything, even the weather, but never themselves for today\u2019s lousy job conditions.

{"Headline": "Former Israeli Leader Is Convicted of Taking Bribes", "Date": "2014-03-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe verdict was the most severe ever against a former Israeli prime minister, and was viewed by analysts as a victory for prosecutors whose campaign against corruption has been criticized as expensive and overzealous.In a searing verdict whose reading stretched for nearly two hours and was shown live on television Monday morning, Judge David Rosen of Tel Aviv District Court said that Mr. Olmert had \u201ctold lies in court.\u201d The judge also decried \u201ca corrupt political system that has decayed over the years.\u201dAn April 28 hearing was scheduled to discuss sentencing for Mr. Olmert and 10 other government officials and businesspeople convicted on Monday, though appeals are likely; for now, they are barred from leaving the country.\u201cThis is the defining moment for the fight for the rule of law,\u201d said Amnon Reichman, a law professor at the University of Haifa. \u201cWe see the extent of the manipulation, we see the network, we see the forces, how they influence decision-making. It was a wide net. It was quite an orchestra going on. To that extent, it is a very important moment.\u201dWhen the Holyland case was first made public in 2010, a judge called it \u201cone of the worst corruption affairs in Israeli history.\u201d On Monday, Mr. Olmert was found guilty of two of the four counts against him. Three of 13 people charged in the case were acquitted.\u201cThe court said in a loud and clear voice: no more governmental corruption,\u201d Yoni Tadmor, a member of the prosecution team, said afterward. \u201cEvery bribetaker and giver should know that from now on that even if they act in the dark, they will not get away with it forever.\u201dPeople in the courtroom said Mr. Olmert held his face in his hands during the hearing, and left afterward through a side door with a pained look on his face.\u201cThis is obviously not an easy day,\u201d said Amir Dan, a spokesman for the former prime minister. \u201cThis is not the final word.\u201dMr. Olmert had consistently denied all the charges, at one point calling them \u201can attempt at character assassination unprecedented in scope and force\u201d and declaring, \u201cI was never offered a bribe and have never received a bribe from anybody in any way, either directly or indirectly.\u201dBut Judge Rosen said Monday that Mr. Olmert\u2019s version of events \u201chas been rejected by me in every way.\u201d He said that half a million shekels \u2014 about $143,000 today \u2014 was funneled in a series of postdated checks from Mr. Dechner, who was working to ease Holyland\u2019s path through the city planning process, to Mr. Olmert\u2019s brother, Yossi.The judge \u201cwas not willing to accept the idea that a public figure is not aware of what goes on around him,\u201d Moshe Negbi, a legal analyst, said on Israel Radio.Built on a ridge with interlocking apartment buildings and one outsize tower that dominates the view for miles, Holyland is called by some Jerusalem residents \u201cthe monster.\u201d Its developer, Hillel Charney, was among those convicted on Monday, along with Shula Zaken, Mr. Olmert\u2019s onetime chief of staff, whose last-minute deal with prosecutors to testify against her former boss was ignored by the judge.President Shimon Peres called Monday \u201ca sad day for the State of Israel.\u201dPoliticians from left and right rushed to praise the verdict.Shelly Yacimovich, a Parliament member from the Labor Party, said Mr. Olmert \u201crepeatedly exploited his power and connections for decades to get rich but had escaped time and again\u201d from punishment \u2014 until Monday. Naftali Bennett, leader of the Jewish Home party, called the conviction \u201ca big step forward.\u201d\u201cA leader is allowed to make mistakes, but may not be corrupt,\u201d Mr. Bennett, Israel\u2019s economy minister, wrote on Facebook. \u201cThe minute a public servant starts working in his own interests instead of the public\u2019s, the public stops believing in him and the country.\u201dMyra Noveck contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Syria\u2019s Lost Generation", "Date": "2014-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionSOMETHING about the boy was not right. He seemed disoriented, detached from his surroundings. He barely spoke, and when he did, it was in flat monosyllables, his eyes unfocused and downcast, as if too heavy to roll up from the weight of all they had seen. He was the picture of quiet devastation, of a childhood forever splintered. He was 14 years old, a Syrian refugee, sitting with his family in a small room in the registration building of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Erbil, northern Iraq. In the crowded, noisy offices downstairs, scores of newly arrived refugees queued to register, including an exhausted-looking, dust-sheathed family of Dom Gypsies and a Syrian woman with a club foot, who limped about the hallways and pleaded with every passer-by to give her asylum in Germany.In the upstairs office, the boy\u2019s father sat across a table from me. A supple, boyish-looking 36-year-old, he recounted, with admirable calm, the story of his family\u2019s harrowing escape, two weeks earlier, from their hometown, Aleppo, and their subsequent trip across the Turkish border and into the Kurdistan region of Iraq. Before the war, he said, he worked at a shoe store, and his three children excelled at school. It was a modest but happy middle-class life. But then came war, and suddenly rocket-propelled grenades were whooshing in all day and Aleppo was honeycombed by falling bombs. He lost his job and his children\u2019s school closed; they would lose two full years of schooling before the family\u2019s eventual escape.Soon, there was no electricity, no telephone service, no food. The father sold the family\u2019s belongings, down to the last piece of furniture. When the money ran out, he borrowed flour from neighbors for his wife to make bread. \u201cSometimes we weren\u2019t eating for two or three days, but just giving the bread and water to the children to eat to survive,\u201d he said.Still, he felt comparatively lucky, as blasts had somehow missed the building where they lived. But the family\u2019s luck ran out when a bomb struck their five-story building. The top floor was demolished. He described a scene of carnage. Four people died: one old man and three children; many more were wounded. That was when the family decided to flee and come to Erbil to stay with his brother, who worked at a hotel. I found myself hoping he would not tell me this, but he did: \u201cOur kids have seen everything. People torn into 100 pieces. The meat of humans torn apart in front of us \u2014 flesh and blood.\u201d I stole a look at his boy, and caught a darkness flitting across his face.I am a father of two children. I cannot imagine what it would do to them, to see such grisly things. Yet that is happening every day in Syria. A whole generation of children, witness to the unfolding catastrophe, is unable to attend school, their lives shaped by violence, grief and displacement.They face a broken future. Syria is on the verge of losing a generation. This is perhaps the most dooming consequence of this terrible war.PAYMAN wore a striped blue T-shirt with a cartoon butterfly on the front, but like many Syrian children I have met, her demeanor had a maturity exceeding her years. In the family tent, Payman showed me old photographs and played for me home videos of a long-ago birthday party. They had watched those videos countless times, she said, and still, every night, they gathered to watch them again, transfixed by those grainy images of freer, happier incarnations of themselves. Payman remained composed until I uttered the word \u201ceducation.\u201d Tears came to her dark eyes as she told me that her hopes of finishing school and becoming a writer seemed like a threadbare dream now. \u201cWithout school there is no future,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no happiness.\u201dT. S. Eliot once wrote that humankind could not bear very much reality. But this is one reality that we must all bear, one we cannot let vanish in a fog of apathy. Syria\u2019s neighboring countries cannot and should not carry the cost of caring for refugees on their own. The international community must share the burden with them by providing economic aid, investing in development in those countries, and opening their own borders to desperate Syrian families looking for protection. And ordinary citizens can help fund the education of millions of Syrian children like Payman, to ensure that their future is not wrecked.When we left the registration building, I spotted the father I had met earlier, and his family, waiting in a crowded office to be registered. His son sat on a wooden chair, unmoving, his arms crossed, unseeing eyes staring ahead.For a moment, he looked in my direction. I glimpsed the plight of an entire generation of Syrian children, caught between the pain of what has happened and the uncertainty of what is yet to arrive. The boy blinked and looked away. I saw no recognition in his eyes. Advertisement"}

She had fallen $500 behind on her rent and utilities, and neither of her boys\u2019 fathers was able to chip in. Then she needed to take time off from work when her younger son, who was only 8 months old, had to have emergency intestinal surgery. After his recovery, she started working for $11 an hour as a secretary, \u201cbut my paychecks weren\u2019t enough to cover the back bills and the new ones too,\u201d she says. \u201cI was at a point in my life where I didn\u2019t want to ask anyone else for help.\u201d There was a payday lender across the street from her office. \u201cIt seemed like a good solution.\u201dEven though North Carolina made payday lending illegal in 2001, five lenders got around the law by affiliating with out-of-state banks to offer short-term, high-interest loans. So Burke was able to walk into a storefront owned by Nationwide Budget Finance and leave with a cashier\u2019s check for $600. When the loan came due on her next payday, however, she couldn\u2019t pay it and immediately began to fall behind on the fees. So she took out another loan to cover the first one. And then took out another to cover that one \u2014 and then another and another. Eventually she wound up with seven loans, each for only hundreds of dollars, but with annual interest rates of 300 to 500 percent. It wasn\u2019t long before the lenders started calling, she says, threatening with jail if she couldn\u2019t make her payments.Worried for herself and her children, Burke eventually found her way to Carlene McNulty, a consumer rights lawyer at the North Carolina Justice Center. McNulty had heard about many cases of people who found themselves buried under the fees of payday loans. \u201cOur Legislature said: \u2018Payday lending is harmful to consumers. Get out of North Carolina!\u2019 \u201d she told me. \u201cBut they were still here, just as if the law had never changed.\u201dPayday loans are often advertised as a short-term lift that helps keep the lights on or allows you to stay in school. But borrowers often become trapped in a debt spiral. According to a new report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the government\u2019s financial watchdog, about 50 percent of initial payday loans play out into a string of 10 or more. \u201cOne could readily conclude that the business model of the payday industry depends on people becoming stuck in these loans for the long term,\u201d the C.F.P.B.\u2019s report said.McNulty wanted to go to court on behalf of Burke and tens of thousands of other payday victims, but she faced an unusually thorny challenge. The fine print on the loan agreements barred recipients from participating in class-action suits. Of course, many businesses try to protect themselves from these suits, which they argue can amount to extortion for minor sins. And by forcing every dispute into individual arbitration, companies can avoid many lawsuits in areas like misleading credit-card offers or sex discrimination. \u201cIt\u2019s like a get-out-of-jail-free card for the company,\u201d McNulty says. In part, this is because few poor or middle-class customers take up the offer to arbitrate a dispute. The awards are generally capped, and the amounts are too low to make it worth a lawyer\u2019s time or fee.But class-action lawsuits can be a powerful tool for reform. And so, suing the payday lenders under the state\u2019s unfair-trade-practice and usury laws, McNulty challenged the class-action bans. She proceeded with five class-action cases, one against each of five major lenders still offering payday loans in North Carolina. The state courts allowed the cases to go forward, ruling that consumers weren\u2019t aware that they were signing away their rights and that there weren\u2019t enough lawyers willing to take individual cases to arbitration. By early 2011, three lenders settled for $37.5 million. The North Carolina attorney general shut down the remaining payday lenders.Getting rid of predatory lenders was a victory for the citizens of North Carolina, but the larger question of the right of companies to limit customers\u2019 ability to sue for bad practices has not been rectified. In April 2011, the Supreme Court ruled on a case similar to McNulty\u2019s class-action suits, AT&T Mobility v. Concepcion, which was named for the lead plaintiffs, Vincent and Liza Concepcion, who signed a standard AT&T cellphone contract that, in the fine print, forced dissatisfied consumers into individual arbitration. As in North Carolina, a lower court ruled that AT&T\u2019s bar on class-action lawsuits was unjust under California law. But Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for a 5-4 majority, cited a 1925 federal law, the Federal Arbitration Act, and reversed the decision. The text of the law was clear, Scalia said \u2014 it \u201cwas designed to promote arbitration,\u201d and states couldn\u2019t get in the way. Judith Resnik, a professor at Yale Law School, told me that Scalia\u2019s interpretation was \u201cin no way consistent with what we know Congress was doing in 1925.\u201d Back then, \u201carbitration was negotiated between merchants, not imposed by merchants on their customers and employees.\u201d Nevertheless, at least 139 class-action lawsuits have been thrown out by courts, according to the nonprofit group Public Citizen. Burke\u2019s suit, which was against one of the lenders who had not settled, was dismissed in February.Andrew Pincus, a partner at the firm Mayer Brown, which helped win the Concepcion case for AT&T, suggested that the availability of arbitration has a net economic benefit. Arbitration is cheaper, faster and more efficient for companies and consumers alike. Anyway, he said, it\u2019s the job of the C.F.P.B. to address the \u201crelatively few legitimate claims of widespread improper conduct.\u201d And that\u2019s partly true. Since its creation in 2011, the C.F.P.B. has brought 40 actions against deceptive practices in the financial industry, reaping $3.1 billion for 9.6 million consumers. At the same time the agency has also recognized the importance of class-action lawsuits, highlighting a series of recent cases in which 13 million consumers received more than $350 million in payments and debt relief.But the tilt toward arbitration, no matter how much more efficient it may be, suggests that the balance of power has changed between companies and their customers. It has become harder and harder for ordinary people with legal problems to get into court and stay there. \u201cThis is all about access to justice,\u201d Arthur R. Miller, a law professor at New York University, says. \u201cIn a way it\u2019s part of a class struggle. We are privatizing justice to the point the rich can afford it and every one else can\u2019t.\u201d Only the Supreme Court can reverse one of its rulings, but Concepcion is based on a statute, which Congress can change. Senator Al Franken, of Minnesota, introduced a bill to bar mandatory arbitration, and even if Congress stalemates, the C.F.P.B. has the power to issue its own regulations on some arbitration claims.That payday loan or credit card that seems too good to be true? The C.F.P.B. could get you back into court to challenge it, along with everyone who went for the deal. At the moment, though, the agency will say only that it\u2019s considering its options. Burke, meanwhile, still has problems with her credit rating, which dogged her when she tried to buy a car and take out a mortgage. The payday lenders are now lobbying to get back into North Carolina.Emily Bazelon, a contributing writer for the magazine, is a senior editor at Slate.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sales of Existing Homes Slip in March", "Date": "2014-04-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Sales of existing homes in the United States slipped in March to their lowest since July 2012, as rising prices and a tight supply of available homes discouraged many would-be buyers.The National Association of Realtors said on Tuesday that sales edged down 0.2 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.59 million. It was the seventh drop in the last eight months.Sales rose in the Northeast and Midwest, suggesting that winter weather did not weigh as heavily on sales as in previous months. The cold and snowstorms contributed to lower sales in January and February.\u201cSales appear to be stabilizing following earlier weather-related disruptions,\u201d Joseph A. LaVorgna, an economist at Deutsche Bank, said in a note to clients. \u201cWe expect sales to improve as we enter the crux of the spring selling season.\u201dMr. LaVorgna noted that the Realtors group reported more buyer traffic at open houses last month, suggesting that demand was rising.Still, big price increases in the last year, along with higher mortgage rates, have made it harder for many Americans to afford a home. Pay increases have not kept up with the higher buying costs. Those trends and harsh weather have dragged down sales since last fall.For March, sales fell in the West and South, where prices have risen the most in the last year. Price increases were smaller in the Northeast and Midwest.Nationwide, the median sales price last month was $198,500, up 7.9 percent from 12 months ago.The sharpest sales increase occurred among homes priced at $1 million or above. Purchases rose 8 percent in that category. Sales fell in nearly every other price group.Other measures of home prices have shown stronger gains. CoreLogic, a real estate data provider, says prices rose 12.2 percent in the last year. That might be discouraging some potential investors, who accounted for just 17 percent of home sales in March, the lowest proportion since August. That figure was down from 21 percent in February.But in a positive sign, first-time buyers made up 30 percent of home sales in March, the highest proportion in a year. That is still below the roughly 40 percent that is consistent with a healthy housing market. First-timers have struggled to save for down payments and also face tight credit standards.Sales of existing homes rose steadily in the first half of last year, reaching an annual pace of 5.38 million in July. But sales slowed in the fall as rising mortgage rates and higher prices began to squeeze some buyers out of the market.About 5.1 million homes changed hands last year, the most in seven years. But that is still below the 5.5 million that reflect a healthy market. Many economists expect sales to rise modestly this year but to remain below 5.5 million.Home prices are rising even as sales slow, a sign that the supply of available homes is tight, forcing potential buyers to make higher bids.There were nearly two million homes for sale at the end of March. But at the current sales pace, that is enough to last only 5.2 months, below the six months\u2019 supply that is considered normal.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russia Raises Rate to Bolster Economy After S.&P. Cuts Its Debt Rating", "Date": "2014-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 With tensions over Ukraine continuing to mount, Russia is scrambling to stem the economic fallout, as its central bank unexpectedly raised a crucial interest rate on Friday.The move is intended to help halt the slide in the country\u2019s currency and stem the exodus of capital, both of which are intensifying the country\u2019s economic problems. Hours earlier, the rating agency Standard & Poor\u2019s downgraded Russia\u2019s debt to the brink of junk status, citing the destabilizing effects of capital flight from Russia. In the first three months of the year, Russian and foreign investors have moved $51 billion out of the country, according to S.&P. That sum is nearly as large as the average annual outflows of $57 billion over the last five years.Although the downgrade itself is not likely to intensify investors\u2019 fears, the threat of further sanctions may prompt additional outflows. S.&P. said that would \u201cundermine already weakening growth prospects.\u201dRussia\u2019s gross domestic product grew 1.3 percent last year, one of the weakest showings since 1999. If the Ukraine tensions ease, S.&P. said, growth could average 2.3 percent a year through 2017. But a failure to resolve the crisis would leave a \u201csignificant downside risk that growth will fall well below 1 percent.\u201dEven before tensions rose over Ukraine, economists said Russia was suffering from the combination of low growth and high inflation known as stagflation, a devilishly difficult economic problem to crack. The government waffled in its response, first advocating government stimulus and then shifting to a hawkish policy at the central bank to lower inflation and borrowing costs for businesses.But the Ukraine crisis hit the Russian economy before the new policy really took hold. Rather than lower rates, the central bank was instead compelled to raise them twice, to make saving money in rubles more appealing and to slow the flight of capital.The central bank on March 3 said it was temporarily raising the benchmark interest rate to 7 percent from 5.5 percent. On Friday, it increased the rate by half a percentage point, to 7.5 percent. The bank cited the inflationary impact of the sinking ruble and said that annual inflation stood at 7.2 percent as of Monday. It said it hoped to hold inflation to 6 percent by the end of the year.S.&P. said it viewed the central bank \u201cas being confronted with increasingly difficult policy decisions with regard to addressing inflationary pressures resulting from financial market volatility,\u201d while also trying to support growth in the economy.Reflecting such concerns, the agency cut Russia\u2019s sovereign debt rating by one notch to BBB\u2013 from BBB, leaving it at the lowest investment grade level. It said the outlook remained negative, owing to the risks that economic growth would slow and the central bank could lose room to maneuver. The agency said it could downgrade Russia\u2019s debt to junk status if additional sanctions were imposed that would harm the country\u2019s creditworthiness by restricting the operations of banks or the cash-cow oil companies at the heart of Russia\u2019s economy. Fitch and Moody\u2019s, the other two major rating agencies, have cautioned about a downgrade but have not yet acted.While the credit downgrade may not accelerate the country\u2019s woes, it complicates matters for the already troubled economy. Because of the uncertainty over sanctions, debt markets have been closed to Russian companies. None have managed a major Eurobond placement in two months, even as they are compelled to pay off bonds issued earlier.If markets remain shut, Russian companies will have to turn to domestic sources, mostly state banks, to roll over $115 billion in debt to foreign lenders coming due by the end of the year, Merrill Lynch estimated. In a financing pinch, Russian companies are likely to reduce the relatively generous dividends that had been one of the reasons foreign investors bought the country\u2019s stocks recently.The threat may not be imminent. Fitch in mid-April issued a note saying Russian companies, which paid down debt after the 2008 financial crisis, now \u201chave fairly robust financial profiles and most have sufficient liquidity to withstand a complete closure of the refinancing market for the rest of 2014.\u201d The government, too, is in a solid position to pay its debts for years to come because of Russia\u2019s large oil windfall reserves. S.&P. estimated the foreign reserves at $450 billion.The rating cut, on its own, is unlikely to prompt investors to pull their money. In Russia, the minister of economy, Aleksei Ulyukayev, told journalists that investors had anticipated the downgrade and would not reassess their holdings as a result. Derek Halpenny, a foreign exchange analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in London, wrote in a research note that foreign investors\u2019 holdings of the country\u2019s debt were \u201crelatively small,\u201d so the practical effects of the downgrade would be limited.Russian markets took the news of the downgrade in stride. The benchmark Micex index, volatile at the best of times, closed down 1.6 percent, and at the end of the trading day in Moscow the ruble was about flat, at 36 to the dollar.Still, the continued drumbeat of bad news does not help. Russia has long been a favored investment as part of a wider emerging market strategy, and the tumult is forcing many money managers to rethink. Stocks in Russia\u2019s once booming technology industry suffered on Thursday when President Vladimir V. Putin casually dropped that he thought the Internet was a tool of the Central Intelligence Agency. Earlier in the week, the founder of the Russian social networking site Vkontakte, Pavel Durov, said he had fled Russia under political pressure, raising questions about the ability of tech start-ups to help diversify the economy away from oil dependence.Obama administration officials have met with fund managers to caution them about Russian investments and warn of possible new sanctions, Merrill Lynch\u2019s Moscow office said in a note to investors. Even without additional sanctions, such an informal action could have a chilling effect on investment. Andrew E. Kramer reported from Moscow and David Jolly from Paris. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Double Standards in Bankruptcies", "Date": "2014-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialDevelopments in the Detroit bankruptcy have exposed a double standard in federal bankruptcy law, an injustice in urgent need of congressional reform. Contrast that with what happened in the housing bust. The creditors in that fiasco \u2014 including powerful banks \u2014 did not have to cut deals in court with bankrupt homeowners. Under Chapter 13 of the bankruptcy law, a section heavily influenced by the financial industry, lenders cannot be forced to rework most residential mortgages in bankruptcy. That is where the legal double standard comes in. In Detroit\u2019s bust, even pensioners have to negotiate new terms; in the housing bust, big banks did not have to negotiate, leaving many homeowners in the dust. That special treatment for banks may have helped them recover from the financial crisis. But it made things worse for borrowers and the economy. Today, 8.6 million homeowners still owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth, for a total of $430 billion in negative equity, according to Moody\u2019s Analytics. Some 2.1 million of the underwater homeowners are in or near foreclosure, on top of 9.6 million who have lost their homes since 2007. Congress could have changed the law early in the financial crisis to allow for bankruptcy court relief for homeowners. Its refusal to do so has contributed to unnecessary impoverishment and a protracted weak recovery. Going forward, the new regulator of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Melvin Watt, could consent to bankruptcy court relief for troubled loans that are controlled by the mortgage agencies, a move that could help potentially tens of thousands of struggling homeowners. Ultimately, however, Congress must change the bankruptcy law to ensure that banks have to modify mortgages in court for bankrupt borrowers. Anything less violates bankruptcy\u2019s tough principles of shared pain for creditors and second chances for debtors. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A European Energy Executive\u2019s Delicate Dance Over Ukraine", "Date": "2014-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 European executives, especially in the energy industry, have been notably wary of ratcheting up economic tensions with Russia over the Ukraine crisis. They see their business interests as too intertwined to risk stiffer sanctions.But few tread a finer line than Paolo Scaroni, chief executive of the Italian energy giant ENI. Despite his long dealings with Gazprom, Russia\u2019s chief supplier of natural gas to Europe, he is willing to risk rankling Moscow by trying to help Ukraine.The executive recently met in Kiev with the Ukrainian energy minister, Yuri Prodan, to discuss ways to supply more gas to the country from sources other than Gazprom as a way to relax the Russian stranglehold. Besides being Ukraine\u2019s chief source of natural gas, Russia sends gas through pipelines in Ukraine that supply about one-third of Europe\u2019s imports. ENI is the leading distributor of that Gazprom gas.In the short term, Mr. Scaroni says, ENI could send spare gas to Ukraine via routes through neighboring countries like Slovakia. On Sunday, Slovakia, a European Union member, yielded to pressure to permit such flows.\u201cIt will not be major quantities, but every cubic meter helps,\u201d Mr. Scaroni said in a telephone interview after returning to Italy from Kiev.Major Western oil companies like BP and Exxon Mobil have extensive exploration deals in Russia that they fear could be jeopardized if the United States and European Union impose stiffer sanctions on the Putin regime.But ENI, Europe\u2019s fourth-largest energy company, has focused its exploration and production on North and East Africa, and acts mainly as a middleman for Russian gas. And that business has become less profitable in recent years, as various market forces have pushed down the price of gas. That may be one reason ENI is willing to potentially incur Gazprom\u2019s anger by cutting side deals with Ukraine.Although Gazprom officials have sought to assure the European Union that the company will not cut off gas in response to the tensions over Ukraine, Mr. Scaroni warned that the situation was fragile.\u201cThis is by far the toughest time for European energy security that I have seen,\u201d said Mr. Scaroni. \u201cThis issue might stop the supply of Russian gas.\u201dUnder the Slovakian deal announced Sunday, the country plans to retool an old, unused pipeline to conduct so-called reverse flows, sending gas from west to east. Slovakia might be a possible route for ENI, which is studying the issue at the request of the Ukrainian government. The goal is to be able to ship gas to Ukraine at an annual rate of more than three billion cubic meters by the time the heating season begins in the autumn, increasing the flow to up to 10 billion cubic meters annually by next spring. Last year Ukraine imported nearly 30 billion cubic meters of gas, according to a recent report by the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies.\u201cEnabling reverse gas flows as foreseen in the agreement is an important step to increase security of gas supply in Ukraine,\u201d said Sabine Berger, a spokeswoman for G\u00fcnter Oettinger, the European Union energy commissioner. Ms. Berger added that the commission had helped negotiate the accord, which is to be signed on Monday.Mr. Scaroni, 67, whose tenure will end next month, is among the top energy executives advising European and American officials of the potential consequences to the energy market of applying much tougher sanctions on Russia.Part of his message is that, even though gas demand in Europe has been weak because of sluggish economies, imports from Russia actually rose last year by about 16 percent as other sources of supply including Norway and Algeria declined. Europe, he warned, is simply not prepared to do without gas from Russia.The European gas business was formerly a mundane set of transactions between monopoly suppliers like Gazprom and giant distributors like ENI that just passed the price on to customers.But with the gradual introduction of more competitive pricing in the European markets, the gas business has become much less attractive for ENI and other big gas middlemen. They are stuck with high-priced long-term contracts to a handful of suppliers like Gazprom and Sonatrach, the Algerian state-owned company, while their customers are able to secure gas at often lower spot market prices \u2014 assuming the gas is flowing.ENI only breaks even on its gas dealings with Gazprom. ENI\u2019s gas unit lost 660 million euros, or $913 million, in 2013.Even so, one of Mr. Scaroni\u2019s biggest worries now is ENI\u2019s deep engagement with Gazprom. It operates not only as a distributor but also as a partner on a planned new gas pipeline called South Stream that would run from Russia under the Black Sea, avoiding Ukraine to run through countries like Bulgaria and Hungary and ending in northern Italy.The pipeline would be a major new source of Russian gas for energy-hungry Europe. But European Union authorities have become deeply skeptical about the South Stream plan, seeing it as just another way of making Europe more dependent on Russian energy. They have shown far greater enthusiasm for plans to deliver gas along a so-called Southern Corridor pipeline from Azerbaijan in the Caspian region and could run through countries including Turkey, Albania, Greece and Italy.Mr. Scaroni worries that the portion of ENI\u2019s gas from Russia that passes through Ukraine might be severed at any moment through contract disputes or if fighting broke out. He also worries that ENI and other energy companies might be ordered by Europe and the United States to stop buying Russian gas as part of tougher sanctions.Given the balance of interests, tighter sanctions by Western governments might more likely aim to stem the technology that Russia needs to increase its future production, rather than to cut off gas supplies to Europe, said David L. Goldwyn, a special envoy and coordinator for international energy affairs from 2009 to 2011 at the United States Department of State.\u201cNo one seeks an outcome that would hurt Europe as much as Russia,\u201d he said.Tensions between Europe and Russia over energy have been mounting for years, partly because of previous standoffs between Kiev and Moscow that temporarily blocked supplies to the European Union. Those outages in 2006 and 2009 are a top reason that the European Union had already been trying to chip away at Europe\u2019s dependence on Russia even before the Crimea annexation.Despite those efforts, there are few signs that the mutual dependence they share will diminish anytime soon.One of the most acrimonious battles is between the bloc\u2019s antitrust authorities and Gazprom. That standoff began in 2011 when the European Commission carried out surprise raids on natural gas companies across Europe, including Gazprom affiliates, seeking evidence of blocking access to networks, charging excessive prices and raising barriers to diversification of supplies.E.U. officials said this month that the European Commission was still seeking a negotiated settlement with Gazprom while also preparing formal antitrust charges in case those negotiations fail.Energy executives say Europe is still far away from adopting a coherent set of policies that would ease dependence on Russian energy sources.For instance, European Union leaders have delayed decisions on lower carbon-emission targets for beyond 2030 that might help drive the development of energy alternatives to Russian gas. That is partly because powerful Eastern European countries like Poland argue that such clean-energy policies would impede their ability to reduce Russian dependence by mining more coal or developing their own shale gas resources.And this month, the European Commission issued rules aimed at reducing the subsidies that governments use to support the wind and solar industries, saying those technologies should prepare to compete on the market. Environmental groups have lambasted the move, calling it a shortsighted reaction that risks leaving the bloc more dependent on heavily polluting coal at a time when it is seeking alternatives to Russian gas.For Mr. Scaroni, the Ukraine crisis is a test of the European Union\u2019s ability to devise a coherent energy policy. \u201cThe E.U. cannot have its cake and eat it, too,\u201d he said. \u201cI just tell them that you cannot keep on shouting and being inconsistent between what you say and what you do.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the name of an oil company. It is Exxon Mobil, not Exxon Mobile.Stanley Reed reported from London and James Kanter from Brussels.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Under Russia, Life in Crimea Grows Chaotic", "Date": "2014-04-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySIMFEROPOL, Crimea \u2014 After Russia annexed Crimea practically overnight, the Russian bureaucrats handling passports and residence permits inhabited the building of their Ukrainian predecessors, where Roman Nikolayev now waits daily with a seemingly mundane question.His daughter and granddaughter were newly arrived from Ukraine when they suddenly found themselves in a different country, so he wonders if they can become legal residents. But he cannot get inside to ask because he is No. 4,475 on the waiting list for passports. At most, 200 people are admitted each day from the crowd churning around the tall, rusty iron gate.\u201cThey set up hotlines, but nobody ever answers,\u201d said Mr. Nikolayev, 54, a trim, retired transportation manager with a short salt-and-pepper beard.\u201cBefore we had a pretty well-organized country \u2014 life was smooth,\u201d he said, sighing. \u201cThen, within the space of two weeks, one country became another.\u201d He added, \u201cEto bardak,\u201d using the Russian for bordello and meaning, \u201cThis is a mess.\u201dOne month after the lightning annexation, residents of this Black Sea peninsula find themselves living not so much in a different state, Russia, as in a state of perpetual confusion. Declaring the change, they are finding, was far easier than actually carrying it out.The chaotic transition comes amid evolving tensions in nearby eastern Ukraine, where the possible outcomes include a Crimea-annexation replay.In Crimea now, few institutions function normally. Most banks are closed. So are land registration offices. Court cases have been postponed indefinitely. Food imports are haphazard. Some foreign companies, like McDonald\u2019s, have shut down.Other changes are more sinister. \u201cSelf-defense units,\u201d with no obvious official mandate, swoop down at train stations and other entry points for sudden inspections. Drug addicts, political activists, gays and even Ukrainian priests \u2014 all censured by either the government or the Russian Orthodox Church \u2014 are among the most obvious groups fearing life under a far less tolerant government.In fact, switching countries has brought disarray to virtually all aspects of life. Crimeans find themselves needing new things every day \u2014 driver\u2019s licenses and license plates, insurance and prescriptions, passports and school curriculums. The Russians who have flooded in seeking land deals and other opportunities have been equally frustrated by the logistical and bureaucratic roadblocks.\u201cThe radical reconstruction of everything is required, so these problems are multiplying,\u201d said Vladimir P. Kazarin, 66, a philology professor at Taurida National University. (The university\u2019s name, which derives from Greek history, is scheduled to be changed.) \u201cIt will take two or three years for all this chaos to be worked out, yet we have to keep on living.\u201dOn a deeper level, some Crimeans struggle with fundamental questions about their identity, a far more tangled process than merely changing passports.\u201cI cannot say to myself, \u2018O.K., now I will stop loving Ukraine and I will love Russia,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Natalia Ishchenko, another Taurida professor with roots in both countries. \u201cI feel like my heart is broken in two parts. It is really difficult psychologically.\u201dThe Crimean government dismisses any doubts or even complaints.\u201cNonsense!\u201d said Yelena Yurchenko, the minister for tourism and resorts and the daughter of a Soviet admiral who retired in Crimea. These \u201care small issues that can be resolved as they appear,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cIt might result in certain tensions for the lazy people who do not want to make progress.\u201dLegions of Russian officials have descended on Crimea to teach the local people how to become Russian. In tourism alone, Ms. Yurchenko said, Crimea needed advice about Russian law, marketing, health care and news media.\u201cCan you imagine how many people need to come to work here for just that one sector?\u201d she said in an interview, explaining why even her ministry could not help anyone find a hotel room in Simferopol, the Crimean capital. \u201cWe also have transportation, economy, construction, medicine, culture and many other things.\u201dOther changes in national identity elsewhere, like the \u201cvelvet divorce\u201d of the Czech Republic and Slovakia in 1993, happened with more advance planning. Crimeans feel as if they went through the entire reverse process in 1991, when Ukraine left the Soviet Union, which had transferred the peninsula to Ukraine from Russia in 1954. Confused? So are they.For Crimeans, every day overflows with uncertainty.Food imports, for example, have dwindled in the face of murky, slapdash rules. The Crimean authorities recently banned cheese and pork from Ukraine, then announced that full Russian border controls would be put in effect on Friday. Shoppers are suddenly finding favorite brands of ordinary items like yogurt unavailable.Citing logistical problems, McDonald\u2019s closed. Metro, a giant German supermarket chain, also shut down. Most multinational businesses want to avoid possible sanctions elsewhere for operating in Crimea.In Dzhankoy, about 55 miles north of this capital city, Edward A. Fyodorov, 37, has been selling ice cream since he was 9 years old. Those sales eventually led to a fleet of 20 refrigerated trucks. He used to import all manner of food from Ukraine, including frozen buns and salad fixings for McDonald\u2019s, plus various goods for Metro supermarkets and 300 smaller grocery stores.Business is off 90 percent, he said. Five to seven truckloads a day have diminished to about one a week. He has been looking for Russian suppliers, but products cost about 70 percent more and transportation issues are thorny.Crimea lacks a land border with Russia, about 350 miles away through Ukraine. The lone ferry crosses to Crimea from an obscure corner of the Caucasus. An expensive bridge promised by the Kremlin is years away.\u201cIt is impossible to make any plans or forecasts,\u201d said Mr. Fyodorov, voicing an almost universal lament. Even if he found work, he said, closed banks make payments impossible.Long lines snake outside the few Russian banks operating. (Some Crimeans waiting in line resorted to a Soviet-era tactic of volunteering to maintain epic lists \u2014 at one passport office the list stretched to more than 12,000 names.) President Vladimir V. Putin announced Thursday that he hoped to have Russian banks functioning normally in Crimea within a month.The Kremlin, which has announced plans to make Crimea a gambling mecca, set an official deadline of Jan. 1, 2015, for the transition. The initial cost allocated to \u201call Crimean programs\u201d this year will be $2.85 billion, Mr. Putin said, but given the promises the Kremlin has made regarding infrastructure and doubled pensions, among other things, the eventual annexation bill is expected to climb far beyond that.Prices are often quoted in both Ukrainian hryvnias and Russian rubles, but the exchange rate fluctuates constantly. Even the simplest transactions, like paying taxi fares, result in haggling by calculator.Land sales, despite surging demand from Russians wanting seaside dachas, have stalled because land registration offices are closed.They found a pine-covered lot, a third of an acre with a sea view, for $60,000. They agreed to buy it, but could not complete the deal without the land office, or find a bank to transfer the money.The next day the owner asked for $70,000. Mr. Nefeld went back to Moscow to get it in cash. When he returned on April 10, the landowner demanded $100,000.Russian laws leave some groups out in the cold. Russia bans methadone to treat heroin addiction, for example. As local supplies dwindle, the daily dosage for 200 patients at the clinic here has been halved.\u201cIt is our death,\u201d said Alexander, 40, declining to identify himself publicly as a recovering addict. Unaware that methadone was illegal in Russia, he voted for annexation.Crimeans are occasionally alarmed by armed men in uniforms without insignia who materialize at places like Simferopol\u2019s train station, inspecting luggage and occasionally arresting passengers. Various people detained in protests against the referendum a month ago have not resurfaced.When confronted, the uniformed men tell Crimeans that they are \u201cactivists from the people\u201d who are \u201cpreserving order.\u201dArchbishop Kliment of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, vilified by its Russian counterpart, said Russian priests with armed supporters had threatened to confiscate churches in at least two villages. His 16 priests sent their families and their most valuable icons to the Ukrainian mainland for protection, he said.Natalia Rudenko, the founding principal of the capital\u2019s one Ukrainian school, said city officials fired her shortly after a member of the self-defense forces visited, demanding to know why the school was still teaching Ukrainian and not flying the Russian flag. Ms. Yurchenko, the tourism minister, said the school could continue to teach Ukrainian, since the new Constitution protected the language, but it would need to add Russian classes.It is hard to tally the many branches of government not functioning.Court cases have been frozen because the judges do not know what law to apply. Essential procedures like DNA testing must now be done in Moscow instead of Kiev.One traffic officer confessed he had no idea what law to enforce \u2014 he was being sent to school two hours a day to learn Russian traffic laws.Lawyers, their previous education now irrelevant, plow through Russian legal textbooks wrestling with the unfamiliar terms. \u201cI won\u2019t be able to compete with young lawyers who come from Russia with diplomas in Russian law,\u201d said Olga Cherevkova, 25, who was previously pursuing a Ph.D. in Ukrainian health care law.She is weighing whether to abandon the land of her birth, of her identity.\u201cMaybe I should just pack my suitcase and move to Miami,\u201d she said, laughing, then caught herself. \u201cI am laughing, but it is not really a joke. I want to live in a free country. Still, for me as a lawyer, it is interesting, if a bit strange.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on April 22 about the upheaval on the Crimean Peninsula after it was taken over by Russia misstated, in some editions, the origin of the name of Taurida National University in Simferopol, Crimea. The name derives from Greek history, not from Crimean Tatar history.Nikolay Khalip contributed reporting.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Everyone\u2019s Talking About the Great Lime Shortage", "Date": "2014-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseWhat\u2019s going on? Because of a combination of bad weather, disease and supply-restricting behavior by Mexican drug cartels, the wholesale price of a case of limes has soared to about $100 from around $15, rendering what was once a bargain fruit a luxury item. The Latin grocery store near my house has raised its price to 69 cents each from eight-for-a-dollar, which Excel tells me is a 452 percent increase.Let\u2019s blame Janet Yellen.But while it\u2019s pretty clearly absurd to blame the Fed for the sharp rise in lime prices, that doesn\u2019t stop people from falling for the same convoluted logic whenever more economically significant commodities are involved, particularly oil and major food crops like corn.Whenever the price of those commodities spikes, you hear an outpouring of blame directed at central bankers. It happened in the summer of 2008, when gasoline and food prices were skyrocketing. It happened again in early 2011, when commentators were quick to blame the Fed\u2019s quantitative easing policies for a commodity price bump.Of course, the causes of those price rises were broader than the causes of the limeflation now afflicting the world: The rapid growth of China and other emerging markets created strong demand for commodities in 2008, and the Arab Spring a few years later created fears of future disruption to Middle East oil supplies.There was a more sophisticated and reasonable version of the same logic that made the rounds within central banks: It wasn\u2019t that easy money was the cause of rising commodity prices, but that as higher prices were rippling out into other goods, people were led to expect higher inflation, which can be self-fulfilling. And it is of course true that if prices for the full range of goods and services people buy are rising rapidly, it is a sign that the central bank is creating too much money and should raise interest rates. But one-off rises in commodity prices, whether it\u2019s something important to the economy like oil or more marginal like limes, aren\u2019t the same as broad-based inflation. Rather, they are usually individual markets adjusting to changes in supply and demand.But, according to transcripts of its policy meetings released this year, fear of the run-up in commodity prices kept the Fed from cutting interest rates in the late summer of 2008 when a financial crisis was spiraling out of control. It led the European Central Bank to undertake spectacularly ill-timed interest rate increase in both the summer of 2008 and the spring of 2011, as the central bankers fretted about commodity-driven inflation instead of the crises staring them in the face.Next time there is a sharp rise in the price of crude oil or corn or copper or all three, we would do well to ignore the catcalls aimed at central bankers and just ask: Is this really an outbreak of broad-based inflation? Or is this just a bigger, more economically consequential version of the Lime Crisis of 2014?Otherwise, the results for the economy will be awfully sour.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Economics Failed Us, in 297 Words", "Date": "2014-04-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRight Lesson, Wrong TimeMr. Sargent (who won the Nobel Prize for Economics in 2011 and who, to his credit, did not market his brief speech as a comprehensive guide to economics) offered University of California-Berkeley graduates 12 lessons focused on two concepts: Government action is costly, often costlier than it appears at first glance; and policy interventions can have unforeseen and unintended consequences.Mr. Sargent isn\u2019t wrong. In fact, most of what he said in 2007 is right. Incentives do matter. Debts do have to be repaid. Unintended consequences do arise. The problem is what he omitted. His speech did not explain that huge gaps in demand can emerge in recessions and make usually correct economic prescriptions all wrong.In fairness to Mr. Sargent, there was no demand gap in 2007, when he gave his talk. But as the crash that soon followed showed, a special case can quickly go from a footnote to the most important issue in economics \u2014 and remain the most important issue for a large number of years.You can boil most of Mr. Sargent\u2019s advice down to \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch.\u201d But for the last six years, a huge demand gap has meant that free lunches are everywhere, and we\u2019ve spent most of that time debating whether to eat them.When the job market is tight and there are about two job seekers for every job opening, you should heed Mr. Sargent\u2019s warning about safety nets: \u201cEveryone responds to incentives, including people you want to help. That is why social safety nets don\u2019t always end up working as intended.\u201d More extensive unemployment benefits create a trade-off: better living standards for the unemployed, but less employment.But when there are almost seven applicants for every opening, as at the depths of this recent downturn, it becomes much less important to incentivize people to work. Even if extended unemployment benefits push one job seeker to stay unemployed, that still leaves six people jostling to take that one available job. In that environment, cutting unemployment benefits does little to make it easier for employers to fill job openings and a lot to depress consumer demand, and therefore the overall economy.Mr. Sargent\u2019s advice that \u201cwhen a government spends, its citizens eventually pay, either today or tomorrow\u201d is a warning against deficit spending. But a big part of the usual cost of deficit spending is crowding out: When the government borrows money, it drives up interest rates and makes it harder for private firms to finance worthwhile investments.Today, there\u2019s no crowding out because private demand for capital is weak. Individuals, saddled with mortgages on homes that aren\u2019t worth what they used to be, aren\u2019t eager to borrow more money; they\u2019ve been trying to pay off their debts. Businesses don\u2019t want to expand because they see their customers are preoccupied with paying off debt instead of buying their products.In this environment, the government can borrow money and spend it on worthwhile infrastructure projects that create jobs and raise G.D.P. without displacing private economic activity.\u201cThere are trade-offs between equality and efficiency,\u201d Mr. Sargent warns. Sometimes, that\u2019s true. But for the last six years, it hasn\u2019t been true about unemployment benefits or deficit spending.The no-free-lunch instinct makes many people highly resistant to this line of thinking. They assume policies that alleviate poverty and stabilize the economy must have negative long-run effects that should temper our impulse to implement them. This has led to less growth than we could have had and more suffering than we needed.I, too, was overly mindful of warnings like Mr. Sargent\u2019s. But I\u2019m trying to remember the economy is still upside down and we should still be on the lookout for the free lunch.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Putin Rival Takes Message to East Ukraine", "Date": "2014-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Khodorkovsky, accompanied by a handful of leading Russian commentators, flew on Sunday to this tough mining city in eastern Ukraine to see whether the standoffs were as hard and dangerous as they seem from a distance, leaving the world and everyone here fearing a serious war.\u201cDonetsk,\u201d he concluded, \u201cis far from being as pro-Russian as it could be.\u201d In the same vein, he said after hosting a two-day meeting of Russian and Ukrainian intellectuals before traveling to Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city, and now here, Russians must reject Mr. Putin\u2019s propaganda that \u201cfascists\u201d have taken power in Ukraine, while Ukrainians must concede the blunders that fed that myth.For Mr. Khodorkovsky, even the separatists who declared the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic from the 11th floor of the regional administrative building they occupied this month, proved at least capable of dialogue. Their limited room for maneuver or discussion, he said, \u201cbore the stamp of Mr. Putin\u2019s bureaucracy.\u201dThings did not start out promisingly, though, as the separatists initially, and aggressively, turned Mr. Khodorkovsky away from their barricaded building: \u201cWe are against you,\u201d one man said bluntly. Eventually, the separatist leaders went to a luxury hotel in town for a 30-minute discussion that revealed the depths of emotion fueling the Russian-Ukrainian conflict.\u201cWe are not professional revolutionaries,\u201d said Denis Pushilin, the self-proclaimed leader of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cWe want to live better\u201d than in the past 20-plus years, he said, when corruption racked this region. He said ethnic Russians wanted to know that they could speak Russian and watch Russian television, while preserving their view of history as centered on the Soviet triumph over Nazis in World War II.Corruption, chaos and the loss of the certainty seemingly lent by the Soviet system, which in essence took responsibility for the lives of citizens in exchange for their unquestioning loyalty to Communist rule, are central to the dispute in Ukraine.At a meeting with civic society groups in a former factory converted into an arts center, Mr. Khodorkovsky noted that breaking with the kind of dependency nurtured by the Soviet authorities was a critical step in achieving the freedom and prosperity that both sides say they seek.Mr. Khodorkovsky, who was jailed on trumped up charges after he began to challenge Mr. Putin politically, emphasized the importance of standing up for one\u2019s beliefs. In an earlier visit to Kiev, and again these past days, he said he detected even in beleaguered Ukraine a freedom that was missing in an increasingly authoritarian, \u201ceven totalitarian,\u201d Russia.\u201cThe readiness to take responsibility for one\u2019s fate\u201d is vital, he told the civic society groups on Sunday. \u201cUkrainian society is ready to do that. But Russians say they want to delegate it Mr. Putin, or another leader.\u201dThe factory hall grew deeply quiet as Mr. Khodorkovsky continued, \u201cI won\u2019t teach this wonderful intellectual audience\u201d how to live. But, he added, \u201cafter taking a decision, you have to defend it with blood \u2014 God willing, not in the literal but the indirect sense.\u201dAs he spoke, word reached the gathering that separatists had taken control of a regional state television channel with the demand that it broadcast 24-hour Russian language news. It was a sign, if one was needed, that his quiet plea for dialogue had a long way to go to win over the militants.Mr. Khodorkovsky, who once cut a brash figure as the richest man in Russia, now lives in Switzerland, not daring to return to Russia, where he still faces the danger of fines in the hundreds of millions of dollars and even further court action. When he was released from jail, it was effectively on the promise of staying out of politics. While the Ukraine crisis was then unforeseen, even a modest effort like this one might seem like an unforgivable foray into the political theater to Mr. Putin.Mr. Khodorkovsky chided Ukrainian leaders for initially stripping the Russian language of its official status. The mistake was quickly corrected, he allowed, but it had still helped Mr. Putin construct a legend that Ukrainians had turned on Russia and were now ruled by fascists and latter-day supporters of Ukrainian nationalists who had collaborated with the Nazis in World War II.Even old friends of his in Russia had swallowed this Russian propaganda, Mr. Khodorkovsky said. After this visit, he said, one of the most important tasks of all Russians who participated is to say firmly, \u201cThere are no fascists.\u201d\u201cThese are the same Ukrainians we knew for decades, we lived in the same state, and then in separate states, but we met,\u201d he added. \u201cThere is no change,\u201d and everyone should work against Mr. Putin\u2019s effort to make the split appear irredeemable, he said.Asked about Western sanctions against Russia, which will probably be toughened on Monday, Mr. Khodorkovsky counseled against seeing any immediate effect. \u201cNo sanctions will work instantly on Russia,\u201d he said. For the next three to five years, he estimated, the troubled Russian economy would \u201cget worse, but not critical.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Slavery Is Not Like Carbon Emissions", "Date": "2014-04-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHard Bargains on ClimateMr. Hayes wants to be clear: He\u2019s not making a moral comparison here. He\u2019s talking about how an effective limit on carbon emissions would hugely diminish the value of an asset (fossil fuel reserves) held by a class of people likely to strongly resist such a policy.The only comparable historical policy example he sees is slavery, which dominated American political discourse for two generations. Slaveholders gave up their slave wealth only when they were defeated in a war. It\u2019s not a hopeful comparison.I think there\u2019s a reason for somewhat less despair than Mr. Hayes shows, because there are crucial political and economic differences between abolition and carbon limitations. In the case of slavery, slaveholders had an enormous economic interest in maintaining their property, while white abolitionists were mostly seeking moral improvement. Those who stood to gain most economically from abolition were slaves, who were excluded from the political process.An effective carbon limitation policy should bring large economic gains to people who are not in the business of fossil fuel extraction, in the form of reduced economic disruption due to climate change. While owners of fossil fuels have a strong economic impulse to extract, the rest of us should have a strong economic impulse to limit extraction \u2014 and we should be willing to buy off the resource owners, if necessary, to enforce those limits.But often, when someone holds an asset that causes a public policy problem, buyouts are the right approach. For example, until 2004, the federal government had a program of quotas and price supports designed to foster tobacco production. Since this was inconsistent with an overall policy agenda of reducing tobacco use, Congress repealed the program, and it bought the acquiescence of tobacco farmers with a stream of payments designed to make them whole for the lost income. This worked because the value of tobacco subsidies was small relative to the American economy.So one crucial question about the effort to limit carbon emissions \u2014 and thereby sharply reduce the value of unextracted fossil fuel resources \u2014 is to what extent we have the economic capacity to compensate the owners of those resources rather than simply expropriating them. Mr. Hayes throws out the figure that an effective carbon limitation policy would require the loss of $20 trillion in fossil fuel value. I can\u2019t vouch for the specific figure, but I strongly suspect he\u2019s right that the cost of carbon limitations to the owners of unextracted fossil fuels would be extremely large.But even an extremely large expense does not have to be insurmountable in comparison with gross world product of $87 trillion. Devoting 1 percent of global economic output to carbon buyouts would make it possible to complete Mr. Hayes\u2019 project by 2040.And Mr. Hayes\u2019s $20 trillion cost figure for carbon limits is a gross figure, not a net one. Averting climate change should increase the global output in the long run and therefore improve the capacity of governments to service their debts.Just because the politics of preventing climate change should work doesn\u2019t mean that they will. I have trouble imagining a less popular policy proposal than the United States borrowing a huge amount of money to pay Saudi Arabia not to extract oil \u2014 even if that policy actually would make Americans better off. Even when the beneficiary of buyout payments isn\u2019t a foreign government of questionable repute, the barriers would be huge. It would call for international cooperation and resisting the temptation to get a free ride on other countries\u2019 expenses.But reducing carbon emissions doesn\u2019t have to be an either/or choice between buyouts and expropriation of existing resources. Sometimes, one will be more politically feasible than the other, and an effective policy approach can use a blend of the two. In particular, we can take advantage of the fact that a required reduction in fossil fuel production would be partly offset by a rise in prices for those fossil fuels that do get extracted.Some policies, like carbon taxes, divert those price increases to the government. Others, like cap-and-trade schemes, can be designed to let the incumbent owners of mineral rights reap the benefits of higher prices. Proposals that give the value of the right to emit carbon to the existing carbon emitter may be a necessary and effective strategy to buy political support for carbon limits. These approaches look like a giveaway, but it\u2019s worth making the giveaway if that\u2019s what brings the benefits of stable temperatures.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stop Worrying and Enjoy Rising Wages", "Date": "2014-04-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byToday's EconomistLet \u2032em grow, Let \u2032em grow, Don\u2019t hold \u2032em back anymore!I\u2019m talking about wages. We\u2019re finally seeing a bit of wage growth, and there\u2019s even some evidence that it\u2019s occurring at the lower end of the job market, where it\u2019s needed the most.At a time like this, such trends lead to divergent concerns: Some of us worry that the Fed will act pre-emptively to shut them down and others worry that they won\u2019t.Here\u2019s a monetary Rorschach test for you: There\u2019s been a pretty clear reversal in the recent trend in hourly pay for blue-collar and non-managerial workers. I look at that data and say, \u201cGreat! It took almost five years, but some regular folks are finally poised to get a piece of the action.\u201dSomebody else looks at it and says: \u201cSpiraling inflation dead ahead. Quick, raise rates!\u201dThere are at least four reasons the inflation worriers are misguided.Second, as Jan Hatzius, Goldman Sachs chief economist, pointed out the other day: \u201cIf the relative labor market fortunes of more disadvantaged workers are indeed improving on a more sustained basis, this could mean that the U.S. labor market has a bit more \u2018room to grow\u2019 than one would estimate on the basis of macroeconomic factors alone.\u201dThe reason is that lower-paid workers face higher unemployment and lower labor force participation, so even those economists compelled to worry about wage growth\u2019s feeding into price growth have less to fear from this sector of the job market.With all that in mind, it seems absolutely warranted to allow wages to grow, just as the chilly Disney princess says (with apologies to readers without young children who won\u2019t get the reference).Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Found Art of Thank-You Notes", "Date": "2014-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCultural StudiesWhen Jimmy Fallon sits down to write his weekly thank-you notes on \u201cThe Tonight Show,\u201d he is both ribbing and breathing life into a custom many felt was headed the way of the dodo. \u201cThank you, cotton candy,\u201d Mr. Fallon scribbles on a correspondence card, \u201cfor making my grandmother\u2019s hair look delicious.\u201d Thank you, \u201cbowling, for giving me an excuse to drink with somebody else\u2019s shoes on.\u201d \u201cThank you, Chris Christie,\u201d he writes, \u201cfor going back for seconds.\u201dMr. Fallon\u2019s routine is a hoot, of course, a joke that points up the truth that the boring stuff your parents made you do never actually goes out of fashion and that also inadvertently supports recent scientific findings linking gratitude to increased optimism, stress reduction and a better night\u2019s sleep. Few who sit down to write a bread-and-butter note are likely to be aware that by doing so they are not only on trend but also on their way to becoming happier and more sociable people. Apparently, what Emily Post termed good manners (science prefers \u201cgratitude intervention\u201d) has all kinds of unexpected benefits. And as it happens, the handwritten gratitude intervention seems to be experiencing a moment of vogue. The personal and professional thank-you notes Cristiano Magni, a New York fashion publicist, sends routinely are written on weighty ecru Connor correspondence cards adorned with a rhinoceros embossed in gold. \u201cIt is so important, in a digital world, to have the dignity to sit down and write something in your own hand,\u201d Mr. Magni said one recent afternoon in a garment district showroom, where a collection of thank-you notes sent by editors and stylists was spread across his desk. Fashion was a business notoriously late to adapt to digital technology, and it remains one in which such seemingly anachronistic customs as the handwritten note hang on stubbornly. Anna Wintour is a stickler for them. So, to judge by Mr. Magni\u2019s collection, are editors at Lucky, Vanity Fair, Esquire and Harper\u2019s Bazaar. \u201cIt not only strengthens the bonds between people, in your personal life and in business,\u201d he said of the custom, \u201cit also rings an emotional chord.\u201dWhile researchers leave open the matter of which format is best for rendering thanks for small favors, courtesies, presents or a tuna casserole supper, there is a growing sense that the old, reliable handwritten note is making a comeback \u2014 and not just as a prop on \u201cTonight.\u201dFor Martin Nowak, director of Harvard\u2019s Program for Evolutionary Dynamics, thanking is a form of cooperative reciprocity with roots in primate behavior. For Paula Madden, a real estate developer in Portland, Ore., \u201cGood manners are the basis of civilization.\u201d This truth is not, alas, universally acknowledged, added Ms. Madden, who manages a portfolio of family-owned properties and also oversees Portland\u2019s Friday Evening Dancing Class for children, a social institution now in its 92nd year. \u201cAs you grow older, it becomes more important when someone recognizes the effort you have made on their behalf and reciprocates in the form of a written acknowledgment,\u201d she said.A text message just doesn\u2019t cut it, Ms. Madden said, for the simple reason that conveying emotion in digital formats is a lost cause. Somehow thickets of exclamation points, ALL CAPS shouts, loaded acronyms and chirpy emoticons cannot approach the freight of feeling conveyed on a scrap of paper with words scratched on it by hand. Why? \u201cThere are a lot of elements,\u201d William Miller, proprietor of the Printery in Oyster Bay, N.Y., said recently. For decades, the Printery has supplied custom writing paper to North Shore swells along with clients as discriminating as Ralph Lauren and Graydon Carter, the editor of Vanity Fair. \u201cEngraved stationery has a sculptural quality, shadow lines, artful arrangement of colors,\u201d Mr. Miller said. Despite the incursions of electronic media, he added, \u201cthe handwritten note is very much alive and well.\u201dMr. Carter writes his on correspondence cards whose weight and texture are selected for how ink flows across them from the fountain pens he prefers. \u201cGraydon is really particular,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cAs with Graydon, a lot of people use a correspondence card to say thank you in business, but in a way that has a social affectation. They want to re-emphasize the personal relationship.\u201dWhat they want, said Liz Quinn, the owner of Stationer on Sunrise in Palm Beach, Fla., is to draw a distinction between the tossed-off, compressed nature of electronic messages and a form of ritualized communication that gives material evidence \u201cthat the person really did appreciate something.\u201dText and email \u201cdon\u2019t mean anything anymore,\u201d Ms. Quinn said, adding with a laugh that her own smartphone, of course, accounted for 90 percent of her correspondence. Make that 100 percent in the case of most millennials and aughties. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely important to show your gratitude, because not everything is going to be given to you,\u201d Brooke Egerton-Warburton, a seventh grader on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side, said recently. \u201cBut gratitude comes in different forms.\u201dAt that, Ms. Egerton-Warburton\u2019s twin sister chimed in with a litany of alternatives. \u201cIt\u2019s, like, \u2018This is my phone, this is my email, this is my Instagram, this is my Twitter,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Avery Egerton-Warburton said. \u201cIf you want to say thank you, just send me a text.\u201d In 1960s Baltimore, when Catherine Kitz was growing up, stationery was an essential part of a social wardrobe. \u201cGrowing up in a black family, that was something we were raised to do, to send a thank-you note,\u201d Ms. Kitz, a museum administrator in Oakland, Calif., said. \u201cI saw people of all economic backgrounds and races sending them, and now I see people of all economic and racial backgrounds not sending them.\u201dDespite her best efforts to instill in her stepgrandchildren the importance of forging bonds of trust and dependence through ritualized thanksgiving, the handwritten thank-you note, Ms. Kitz noted, may be a generational lost cause. \u201cAfter a while I stopped trying,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m still I\u2019m hoping they\u2019ll figure it out at some point \u2014 in school, in college, when they get their first job.\u201dIn all likelihood, they will. \u201cInk on paper has been challenged on many fronts,\u201d said Patti Stracher, director of the National Stationery Show, expected to draw 800 exhibitors and 12,000 attendees to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in May. \u201cThank-you notes, however, are one of the areas that a poor economy or a social culture shift has little impact on.\u201dHeather Wiese, owner of Bell\u2019Invito, a luxury stationer in Dallas, said, \u201cIf you want to stand out, to be more polished, probably the easiest thing you can do is write that thank-you note.\u201d She added: \u201cSocial media, texting and email are all completely relevant. But if after I\u2019ve put my effort forward to interview a potential employee what I get is an email that looks exactly like 200 others, I may miss it.\u201d Where messages in an inbox look little different from spam, a tidy square in a mailbox crammed with bills commands attention. So does the vision of that other anachronism: penmanship.\u201cIf you are entertained by anyone in their home, that is such an honor it should be followed up by a note of thanks,\u201d said Kathryn Urban, a community volunteer in San Francisco. \u201cSometimes there are kind acts people have done. Sometimes in a note you can express something difficult to say in person,\u201d or else in an email or text. And sometimes you want to share the tactile, visual and olfactory pleasure provided by a thank-you card, whether a blind embossed engraved one or a Hallmark card bought at CVS. One of the first things Carroll Irene Gelderman, a Columbia University student from New Orleans, did when she was named the 2014 Queen of Carnival was to order new stationery. As custom dictates, Mardi Gras queens are typically showered with tribute by their courts, and Ms. Gelderman was no different. Before Fat Tuesday rolled round, she had already received over 600 individual gifts. The pearl white cards Ms. Gelderman chose for her thank-you notes are engraved in dove gray ink by Arzberger and bear her name engraved in Roman lettering at the top. The envelopes were lined with gray-and-white patterned paper, and a custom shade of ink slightly darker than the paper was ordered from Iroshizuku to fill her fountain pen. \u201cLike a lot of people in my generation, I might think, \u2018Oh, just send them a text,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Ms. Gelderman, who is 20. \u201cBut I actually enjoyed writing the notes because in the process of opening a note, feeling the paper, seeing the imperfection of the writing, reading the message in another person\u2019s voice, you actually feel like you have a piece of that person in your hand.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Spare the Advice", "Date": "2014-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAlmost from the birth of \u201cdevelopment\u201d as a concept in modern political economy, poverty has been regarded as a problem in search of technical solutions. The key, we\u2019re told, is finding the correct mixture of policies to promote agriculture, reform financial markets or improve health. With the right mix of prescriptions, results come down mostly to \u00adimplementation.The emphasis on technical solutions, from tariff regimes to industrial policy, has empowered experts, who have gradually come to constitute a formidable self-reinforcing constituency. Even when they disagree on the details, as often happens, they seem unanimous in their belief that what poor countries most desperately need is outside advice.In his bracingly iconoclastic \u201cThe Tyranny of Experts: Economists, Dictators, and the Forgotten Rights of the Poor,\u201d William Easterly weaves together a number of sophisticated arguments to explain why this is all wrong. Easterly, a New York University economist and author of \u201cThe White Man\u2019s Burden: Why the West\u2019s Efforts to Aid the Rest Have Done So Much Ill and So Little Good,\u201d has earned his skepticism the hard way. He frequently describes himself as a recovering expert, a sly reference to his career at the World Bank, which receives withering criticism throughout.The book ranges widely around the globe, far back in history and across academic disciplines. One moment, the author is expounding on the importance of the 12th-century Battle of Legnano, in northern Italy, a milestone on the road to individual rights. In the next, he\u2019s describing the causes of persistent poverty in Colombia, the powerfully enduring legacies of the Atlantic slave trade on West African societies, or the braided histories of European decolonization and the American civil rights movement.A book so full of learned digressions could feel disjointed. But Easterly\u2019s stories unfailingly reinforce a select number of crucial themes, the boldest being that the people of the so-called underdeveloped world have been systematically betrayed by the technocrats in charge of the global development agenda. \u201cThe technocratic approach ignores what this book will establish as the real cause of poverty \u2014 the unchecked power of the state against poor people without rights,\u201d he writes.\u201cThe Tyranny of Experts\u201d opens with an account of an outrage supposed to have taken place in rural Ohio in 2010, when 20,000 local farmers were dispossessed of their land at gunpoint, their homes and crops burned to make way for a commercial forestry. For the space of a page, the reader wonders if the story is true, and if so, why she\u2019s never heard of it. It\u2019s because the author changed the location for effect. The dispossession occurred in Uganda, which is ruled by Yoweri Museveni, an autocrat long promoted by the West. The forestry\u2019s funding came partly from the World Bank, which had recently published a major document on the role of government in development that, Easterly reports, characteristically offered little or no role to \u201cliberty, freedom, equality, rights or democracy.\u201d He explains the West\u2019s fondness for autocrats saying it comes from the misguided belief that they are best equipped to achieve results in the rough and chaotic conditions in poorer countries.Easterly\u2019s other major claim is that technocratic advisers attach little importance to the historical background of the countries they work on. He offers the example of the World Bank, in 1949, whipping up a 950-page development plan for Colombia in less than a year, in which recommendations weren\u2019t specific to that country. These advisers also ignore evidence saying the greatest benefits to a society come from the spontaneous, uncoordinated actions of mostly small actors whose talents are allowed to flourish, as opposed to top-down initiatives involving the state or outside donors.The author\u2019s persistent emphasis on liberty, and his touting of the \u201cInvisible Hand\u201d might tempt some readers to write him off as a doctrinaire conservative, an inclination that might be encouraged by Easterly\u2019s frequent citation of intellectual favorites of the right like Adam Smith and Friedrich Hayek. It\u2019s the odd conservative, however, who would read history like Easterly, who blames much of the failure of development as a Western movement, and a great deal of misery in Africa specifically on the twin legacies of imperialism and racism. He brandishes this claim of racism liberally but not gratuitously; his point being that paternalism and a belief in the incapacity of others is an unexamined foundation of development ideology. \u201cLocating the formative years of development between 1919 and 1949 highlights a critical point,\u201d Easterly writes: \u201cDevelopment ideas took shape before there was even the most minimal respect in the West for the rights of individuals in the Rest.\u201d Western racism, he asserts, spared no one, but in Africa it was at the very heart of the concept of development.He introduces us to \u201cLord Lugard, the longtime governor general of Nigeria, whose 1922 book \u2018The Dual Mandate\u2019 was the bible for British colonial officials in Africa\u201d and who \u201coffered a tidy if disturbing view into colonial attitudes: \u2018In character and temperament the typical African of this race-type is a happy, thriftless, excitable person, lacking in self-control, discipline and foresight.\u2019 \u201d \u201cIn short,\u201d Lugard concluded, \u201cwe are dealing with the child races of the world.\u201dAnd what of those conservative paragons? Adam Smith and Friedrich Hayek become much more generous of spirit in Easterly\u2019s reading than many of us will recall. \u201cSmith understood that not all problems could be solved by the Invisible Hand of the market,\u201d he writes, while Hayek comes across as a fierce proponent of individual liberty who favored a minimum income guaranteed by the state and attacked British Conservatives as \u00ad\u201cpaternalistic.\u201dEasterly concludes by addressing the question of whether autocrats perform better than democratic leaders. By this point, he has already skewered many current Western autocratic darlings, like Rwanda\u2019s Paul Kagame. Now he takes on China, the most promising role model of the autocracy camp, to point out that China has grown precisely because it has increased liberty since the totalitarianism of Mao Zedong. There are moments in this book when one can sense oneself in the presence of an opinionated and all-knowing expert. But I found myself returning to the introduction, to Easterly\u2019s acknowledgment of the humility and rigor true development work entails. \u201cThere is a fear of inaction and indifference on the tragic problems of global poverty,\u201d he writes. But \u201cit is critical to get the principles of action right before acting, and it is that task to which this book is devoted.\u201d THE TYRANNY OF EXPERTSEconomists, Dictators, and the Forgotten Rights of the PoorBy William Easterly394 pp. Basic Books. $29.99.Howard W.

{"Headline": "Following Orders in Rwanda", "Date": "2014-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorADA, Ohio \u2014 I met my client Pierre in a southern Rwandan prison in 1998. \u201cThe authorities ordered us to kill Tutsis,\u201d he explained. It was, he was sure, a defense that could lighten his sentence. He had pleaded guilty to killing about half a dozen Tutsis in Rwanda\u2019s genocide four years before. The new Tutsi-led government was now trying perpetrators. And I, a young survivor just back from exile, had been drafted to be his lawyer. \u201cBari badutegetse kwica abatutsi\u201d were his words in Kinyarwanda, our language. He assumed the judge would understand them as he did. Pierre was wrong. The judge eventually gave him a life sentence. But as I listened to him, I realized he had opened a door for me onto one of Rwanda\u2019s deepest mysteries: why so many ordinary people had followed orders to kill their neighbors. It struck me that Pierre probably would have killed me, too, had he found me hiding in bushes as I fled the murderous Hutu Interahamwe militias 20 years ago this month. The key to understanding him lay in a culture in which orders from above, even if evil, are followed because they are confused with the law itself. In Rwanda, neighbors did not kill neighbors in the first days of the three-month slaughter; that pattern developed only after officials decided that the presidential guards and Interahamwe were not killing fast enough. So the officials organized meetings and took to a hate-spewing radio station to call on citizens to kill fellow citizens; this edict then went down a chain of authority so thoroughly that intimate murder, and deep societal trauma, became common. One of the worst calamities I know of was in my own family: The Hutu husband of a Tutsi cousin of mine \u2014 presumably fearing for his own life \u2014 followed an order from armed militiamen to kill her in front of their children. The act was so unspeakable that when Tutsi rebels finally stopped the genocide, another cousin, seeking vengeance, killed the father in front of the same children. I cannot imagine what scars those now-grown children carry.As for myself, I was fortunate. I was able to flee the capital, Kigali, for Rwanda\u2019s western border, where I swam a mile or so in the middle of the night across the tip of Lake Kivu to the Democratic Republic of Congo. In 1998, I returned to help Rwanda rebuild. With fewer than 50 members of the bar there and 140,000 genocide suspects awaiting trial, I was required to defend clients like Pierre. As a Catholic taught by nuns, I had imagined Pierre as a literal devil, with horns, tail and red eyes. But when we met, he was clean, well shaved, with a normal human face and a strong sense that he was guiltless. It was hard to believe. I asked him what he meant by \u201cbari badutegetse kwica abatutsi.\u201d And he revealed Rwandan culture\u2019s tragic flaw. You can hear it in our maxims. \u201cIntero nyirurugo ateye, niyo wikiriza\u201d means \u201cthe tune the head of the household begins is what everyone in the house sings.\u201d \u201cUmwera uturutse ibukuru bucya wakwiriye hose\u201d means that orders from above spread quickly, in the form of rules. \u201cOrder\u201d and \u201claw\u201d translate the same: \u201citegeko.\u201d A \u201claw-giver,\u201d an \u201corder-giver\u201d and an \u201cauthority\u201d are each an \u201cumutegetsi.\u201d This culture of unquestioning deference existed before the genocide. Its role in 1994 has been noted before. What is less noticed is that it persists today \u2014 in less lethal form, but not without dangers for the future.To be sure, this time it is helping Rwanda pursue positive goals. Before 1994, Rwandans were told they were Hutus and Tutsis, mortal enemies. Today, official policy dictates that there are no Hutus or Tutsis; everyone is a Rwandan. Rwandans have memorized this slogan well; they repeat the mantra even in the remotest parts of the country. But its acceptance springs from the same vulnerability as the complicity in genocide did: the instinct to obey rather than to choose, when told how to think or act. Reconciliation has proceeded in similar fashion. Under the transitional justice system known as gacaca, introduced to speed up genocide trials and promote truthful confessions, forgiveness and reconciliation, a gacaca judge would ask a survivor if she really forgave the murderer of her children and she would say: \u201cThe government forgave them. What can I do? I also forgave him.\u201d Advocates of enforcing these reconciliatory attitudes say the strategy has helped the strong-handed government of President Paul Kagame improve security, build a dynamic economy, improve public health and reduce corruption. Sustaining these achievements is another matter. To do that, the government now must focus on changing the culture of obedience, for two reasons: so that the instinct to follow leaders blindly never again leaves evil unchallenged, and to nurture habits of individual thought that are essential to growth and freedom in any modern society. Rwandans need steps to create a true rule of law, rather than compliance: education that emphasizes critical thought, not obedience; reliance on strong legal and legislative institutions rather than strong personalities who give edicts from the top. The government must invite initiatives from the bottom, tolerate vigorous public debate and remain within the rule of law. Before 1994, officials often told the public that when the president says \u201cI wish\u201d or \u201cI recommend,\u201d he means \u201cI order.\u201d Low-level officials still do that, and they must stop. Rwandans have to learn it is all right to question their leaders, and mandatory to refuse to cooperate with evil.Nobody should ever tell some other lawyer, as Pierre told me, that killing Tutsis was within the law simply because someone in power ordered it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Marx Rises Again", "Date": "2014-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIN the season of resurrection, it\u2019s fitting that he\u2019s with us once again \u2014 bearded, prophetic, moralistic, promising to exalt the humble and cast down the mighty from their thrones.Yes, that\u2019s right: Karl Marx is back from the dead. Not on a Soviet-style scale, mercifully, and not with the kind of near-scriptural authority that many Marxists once invested in him. But Marxist ideas are having an intellectual moment, and attention must be paid.Piketty himself is a social democrat who abjures the Marxist label. But as his title suggests, he is out to rehabilitate and recast one of Marx\u2019s key ideas: that so-called \u201cfree markets,\u201d by their nature, tend to enrich the owners of capital at the expense of people who own less of it.This idea seemed to be disproved in the 20th century, by the emergence of a prosperous, non-revolutionary working class. But Piketty argues that those developments were transitory, made possible mostly by the massive destruction of inherited capital during the long era of world war.Piketty\u2019s dark vision relies, in part, on economic models I am unqualified to assess. But it also relies on straightforward analysis of recent trends in Western economies, and here a little doubt-raising is in order.Winship\u2019s point raises the possibility that even if Piketty\u2019s broad projections are correct, the future he envisions might be much more stable and sustainable than many on the left tend to assume. Even if the income and wealth distributions look more Victorian, that is, the 99 percent may still be doing well enough to be wary of any political movement that seems too radical, too utopian, too inclined to rock the boat.This possibility might help explain why the far left remains, for now, politically weak even as it enjoys a miniature intellectual renaissance. And it might hint at a reason that so much populist energy, in both the United States and Europe, has come from the right instead \u2014 from movements like the Tea Party, Britain\u2019s UKIP, France\u2019s National Front and others that incorporate some Piketty-esque arguments (attacks on crony capitalism; critiques of globalization) but foreground cultural anxieties instead.The taproot of agitation in 21st-century politics, this trend suggests, may indeed be a Marxian sense of everything solid melting into air. But what\u2019s felt to be evaporating could turn out to be cultural identity \u2014 family and faith, sovereignty and community \u2014 much more than economic security. Which is to say that while the Marxist revival is interesting enough, to become more relevant it needs to become a little more ... reactionary. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Growth Rose 7.4% in First Quarter, China Reports", "Date": "2014-04-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Confirming the concerns of investors and economists, the Chinese government announced on Wednesday morning that the country\u2019s inflation-adjusted economic output in the first quarter was up 7.4 percent from a year ago \u2014 and had risen much less than that, compared with the previous quarter.Beijing officials have set a growth target for the whole year of about 7.5 percent; unlike growth targets in previous years, this year\u2019s target has not been set as a floor, giving the government some political leeway if the final figure falls slightly short. But for the first quarter by itself, the annualized growth rate compared with that in the fourth quarter appears to have been less than 6 percent, economists said.Sheng Laiyun, a spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics, said the latest figures nonetheless represented an economy showing considerable strength.\u201cDespite the economic slowdown, China\u2019s economy is still growing at a medium to high speed,\u201d he said during a news conference in Beijing.Weak exports and a plunge in housing starts, down 27.2 percent from the first quarter of last year, were powerful brakes on growth in the first quarter. A credit squeeze has hurt many developers, as well as smaller exporters that struggle to borrow enough money to finance purchases of raw materials and sales of finished goods.Troubles in the housing market have also created broad nervousness about the sustainability of high home prices, with small, outlying apartments costing more than an entire decade\u2019s salary for a recent college graduate.But the service sector, which includes industries like hotels and restaurants and which has emerged as a big job creator in recent years, fared better than expected in the first quarter.Louis Kuijs, a China economist in the Hong Kong office of the Royal Bank of Scotland, said the service sector\u2019s resilience and recently announced government initiatives like an acceleration of railroad construction and redevelopment of shantytowns meant it was still possible for economic growth in all of 2014 to meet his forecast of 7.7 percent.Industrial production, which is not adjusted for inflation, was up 8.8 percent in March from a year ago, the government also announced on Wednesday morning. Retail sales climbed 12.2 percent in March.Both were weak figures by Chinese standards but suggested some improvement from January and February.Fixed-asset investment for the first three months of the year was 17.6 percent higher than for the first quarter of last year, the weakest year-to-date figure since November 2001, as the home building sector\u2019s troubles offset extensive construction of infrastructure.Much of the year-on-year growth in the Chinese economy reflected by the 7.4 percent growth figure released on Wednesday morning was the result of economic expansion that actually took place during the second, third and fourth quarters of last year. Although the United States and many other industrialized countries release annualized economic growth figures for each quarter compared with the previous quarter, China does not provide this statistic, preferring year-on-year figures that show less volatility.Private economists estimated that the annualized, quarter-on-quarter growth was between 5.2 and 5.7 percent, depending on what seasonal adjustment was used.Some private economists had expected year-on-year growth to be slightly weaker, at 7.3 percent. The Shanghai stock market was up 0.33 percent in the first hour and a half after the figures were released, while the Hong Kong market was up 0.74 percent.The year-on-year growth of 7.4 percent was the slowest since the third quarter of 2012, also 7.4 percent; the last time year-on-year growth was slower was in the third quarter of 2009, during the global financial crisis, when it was 6.6 percent.Even three or four years ago, growth of less than 8 percent would have alarmed Chinese officials. But the Chinese economy needs somewhat less growth to maintain nearly full employment these days, because the labor force has begun to shrink, Mr. Sheng said.The falling number of Chinese ages 16 to 55 reflects the increasingly strict enforcement of the \u201cone child\u201d policy through the 1990s and has produced surging blue-collar incomes that are helping to sustain growth in the services sector.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Putin's Czarist Folly", "Date": "2014-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorOxford, England \u2014 Russian school textbooks praise Peter the Great as an industrializer and cultural visionary who turned his country into a European power. Russia became feared but also respected by its neighbors, and Peter is the official czar-hero of Russian history.Vladimir V. Putin himself is much more like another czar, Nicholas I, who stumbled into military conflict with the British and French and rejected calls for the basic reforms needed to enable Russia to compete with the world powers of the day. Nicholas had a cramped perspective and arrogant personality. Always attentive to the armed forces and the secret services, he overlooked the broader necessity to modernize Russia\u2019s economy and society. His country paid dearly for this when his army was humbled in the Crimean War of 1853-56.Russian foreign policy under Mr. Putin displays an equally gross lack of foresight. On Ukraine, he made much of the threat to ethnic Russians from West Ukrainian \u201cfascists\u201d who were influencing political developments in Kiev. It is true that Ukraine\u2019s right-wing coalition known as the Right Sector includes some decidedly insalubrious extremists. But not every partisan who waged the war of independence against the Soviet Army in the 1950s was a fascist; and by seizing the Crimean peninsula, Mr. Putin has set up a classic temptation for Russian patriots to extend to the whole of Ukraine.One-eighth of the Crimean population, moreover, consists of Tatars, whom Joseph Stalin deported to Central Asia in 1944 and who were allowed to return to their native peninsula only in the late 1980s. They largely abstained from voting in the recent referendum on incorporation in the Russian Federation. Most are Muslims, and some of their young people could now become recruits for a jihad against Russian imperialism.By snatching 4.5 percent of Ukrainian territory, Mr. Putin has performed the unlikely feat of wrecking his own dream of forming a \u201cEurasian Union\u201d under Russia\u2019s leadership. He once planned to keep President Viktor F. Yanukovych as his puppet ruler in Kiev. Now Mr. Yanukovych is a refugee somewhere in Russia, and Ukraine\u2019s government is strengthening cooperation with the European Union.This is a disaster for Mr. Putin\u2019s foreign policy. Although he is concealing this from the public through his control of TV channels, he will not be able to fool all the people all of the time.His biggest miscalculation is about Russia itself. The emergency over Ukraine has jolted the Russian superrich to ship even more of their wealth to the West. Up to $70 billion has left the country this year alone.Mr. Putin prided himself on bringing stability after the tumultuous years of Boris N. Yeltsin\u2019s rule. Capital flight on this scale tells a different story. The World Bank is sounding the alarm about a halving of Russia\u2019s growth rate if Mr. Putin continues with his Ukrainian obsession.Just as worrisome for the Russian president should be the phenomenon of human flight. Hundreds of thousands of the brightest young Russians have packed their bags and left for Silicon Valley, New York and London. This has been happening since the collapse of Communism, but Mr. Putin has done nothing to arrest the trend.Young people leave out of exasperation with bully-boy administrators and violent entrepreneurs. They want to live in a meritocracy where talent alone is what counts. Their model is Google\u2019s Sergey Brin, not the seedy ministers and businessmen of Mr. Putin\u2019s court.For the expatriates to want to go back to Russia, things have to change \u2014 and this is the true test of Mr. Putin\u2019s effectiveness as a president. First elected in 2000, he has done little to clean up corruption. He spectacularly punished a handful of so-called oligarchs, only to redistribute their fortunes to political cronies. The rule of law is feebly enforced whenever the men of power see their interests at risk.Nor has Mr. Putin done enough to diversify and open up Russia\u2019s economy. For years \u2014 indeed, since Mikhail S. Gorbachev\u2019s perestroika period \u2014 Russian and foreign economists have highlighted the need for the country to move beyond its reliance on the petrochemical exports. Prime Minister Dmitri A. Medvedev has always understood this, but he lacked the authority to rectify the situation.Russia needs to pump out high-technology goods, not just oil and gas. And the rival power it ought to keep in sight is not to the west but to the south. Since the mid-1970s, China\u2019s rulers have prioritized the diversification of their economy. This would be the minimal requirement to ensure Russia\u2019s status as a Eurasian power. Instead, the Chinese are set to become a superpower while the Russians fall away.Moscow\u2019s opportunities to compete have always depended on cooperation with Western states with advanced technology. Mr. Putin\u2019s impulsive action in tiny Crimea has rendered this a distant prospect. He has lost his place at the Group of 8 industrialized countries.There was always skepticism about Mr. Putin\u2019s good intentions in Eastern Europe; now there is outright hostility. Even Germany\u2019s reliance on Russian gas imports has not stopped Chancellor Angela Merkel from rebuking Mr. Putin. The European Union is actively considering how to wean itself off dependency on Russian fuel.Mr. Putin started the year with a display of Russian \u201csoft power\u201d at the Sochi Winter Olympics, where the closing ceremony presented a country of stylish, inoffensive sport and culture. The very next day, he sent troops to Crimea. And now the World Bank suggests Russia may suffer economic recession by the end of the year.The signs are that Mr. Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov are starting to appreciate the implications of their self-inflicted geopolitical blunder. Mr. Lavrov has at least begun to talk to Secretary of State John Kerry.Western powers are not going to start a second Crimean war, but they have more opportunities to exert pressure on Russia than Mr. Putin imagined. He would do well to consider the precedent of Czar Nicholas I.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sign of Spring on Pay: Real Wage Growth", "Date": "2014-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJeff Dworkin, a Dallas builder, was surprised to find someone he didn\u2019t recognize inside a half-finished house this winter where crews were about to texture the home\u2019s drywall.And that\u2019s how Mr. Dworkin, the president of JLD Custom Homes, discovered that the chief of a rival subcontractor was there trying to steal his workers.\u201cHe was driving around and saw a rig, and he went inside to offer our guys more money,\u201d Mr. Dworkin said. \u201cThese guys know, even though they may not be well educated or even speak the language, that they can work for the next guy and make $150 a day instead of $100.\u201dEven as the unemployment rate moves slowly downward, wage growth remains sluggish nearly five years after the recovery officially began, and has become one of the economy\u2019s most conspicuous weak spots.But there are now signs that the labor market is starting to tighten enough that workers may finally get some real raises that significantly outpace inflation.\u201cI do think there are signs wage growth is picking up,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. Earlier this year, Mr. Zandi was pessimistic about any acceleration in wage gains before 2016, but now he predicts that last year\u2019s after-inflation growth of 0.8 percent will rise to 1 percent this year and 1.1 percent in 2015. \u201cI think we can say definitely the slowing in wage growth is over.\u201dThose gains are still modest, especially considering that median family incomes, adjusted for inflation, fell about 10 percent during and after the recession. So far, the typical worker is recovering only slowly from that loss. Over the last 12 months, nominal hourly wages are up a modest 2.1 percent, which works out to an after-inflation rate of about 1 percent.In the second half of the 1990s, when unemployment fell as low as 4 percent, competition for workers helped drive up real wages and salaries for the worker at the middle of the income ladder roughly 1.5 percent a year, the fastest sustained pace in decades. With the labor market so tight, wages for workers at the bottom of the income scale rose even faster, about 2 percent a year above the rate of inflation.But with the jobless rate now at 6.7 percent, the labor market is still not nearly as favorable to ordinary workers as it was at the end of the last century.The idea that wages are about to accelerate is far from unanimous among economists. Among those who believe the evidence is still lacking is Janet L. Yellen, the newly installed chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, who said at her first news conference after taking the helm that most measures of income growth had shown little movement. She said 3 to 4 percent nominal wage growth would be normal if inflation, now running barely over 1 percent on the Fed\u2019s crucial measure, rose to the central bank\u2019s target of 2 percent.Moreover, even as the economic cycle continues to advance, powerful underlying forces \u2014 including a relatively strong dollar that contributes to an outsourcing of jobs abroad \u2014 are helping to hold down pay increases.\u201cThe upward pressure on wages will be there, but I\u2019m not sure it will be fulfilled in a competitive worldwide market,\u201d said Bob Funk, chief executive of Express Employment Professionals in Oklahoma City, one of the nation\u2019s largest staffing firms. At Express, which places mostly light-industrial workers, the average hourly wage of its job finders rose only 7 cents in 2013, or less than 1 percent, to $11.41, he said.The March unemployment rate showed average hourly wages dropping a penny, to $24.30, after a 9 cent gain in February, but with hours worked increasing, total pay continued to gain ground.And there are signs of region-by-region, industry-by-industry wage moves percolating under the surface. In early March, the Fed\u2019s Beige Book, a survey of conditions in various regions around the nation, reported that a third of the businesses in the St. Louis Federal Reserve district reported that pay picked up in the last three months.It also cited multiple reports of labor shortages in construction, even though the building industry is still down 1.8 million jobs from 2007. Wages in home construction are up 5 percent in the last year. And some companies in the hottest regions of the economy are having to pay even more to attract capable workers.\u201cIn the last five months, the labor price went up 20 to 25 percent,\u201d said Daniel Esqueda, whose Wallco Drywall in Lewisville, Tex., has been losing workers to Texas\u2019s booming oil patch. \u201cIt\u2019s a nightmare right now.\u201dA nightmare to him, perhaps, but encouraging news for workers. And other regions with rapidly improving economies are reporting sharp movements in pay as well, especially if they are home to a hot sector like the technology industry.In Northern California, wages are beginning to soar, not just for software engineers but even for people employed in fast food and retailing. In San Mateo County, at the northern end of Silicon Valley, average wages rose 9.9 percent in the year ending Sept. 30, the most recent data available, and the fastest wage growth for a county in the nation, according to the Labor Department. San Francisco is close behind, ranking 10th of 335 counties tracked, with 4.8 percent wage growth.\u201cYou walk down University Avenue in Palo Alto and you see help-wanted signs in all the low-wage service shops,\u201d said Stephen Levy, director of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy. \u201cThat\u2019s the first sign people have moved on to better jobs.\u201dAcross the country, the number of metropolitan regions at or near the 5.5 percent unemployment rate \u2014 a signal that an area is moving closer to the full employment zone \u2014 is growing rapidly, said Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors outside Philadelphia.\u201cLabor supply is like housing or anything else: It\u2019s local,\u201d Mr. Naroff said.Madison, Wis., has 4.5 percent unemployment and the nation\u2019s second-fastest wage growth, Labor Department statistics show. Collier County, Fla., anchored by Naples, has the nation\u2019s third-highest wage growth, as rebounding housing and stock markets have pushed local unemployment down to 5.6 percent from 9.8 percent in the summer of 2012.And several cities in Texas and North Dakota, buoyed by the shale oil and gas drilling boom, reported raises well above the national trend in the third quarter of 2013, the most recent period for which detailed statistics are available.For all the encouraging signs in especially tight local markets, however, wages in the vast array of low-paying services generally remain modest. Don Fox, the chief executive of Fire House of America, a 750-store sandwich chain based in Jacksonville, Fla., says his franchisees in the Texas oil belt have had to pay $10 to $15 an hour to get workers. But at company-owned stores in North Florida, where unemployment is about 6 percent, there is not much wage pressure yet and he is able to get away with paying little more than the state minimum wage of $7.93 an hour, which went up 14 cents at the beginning of the year.But even there, he is feeling a greater need to make his jobs more appealing. This year, he offered health insurance to lower-ranking store workers, and twice as many people signed up as he expected.\u201cThat was a $4,000-a-year raise right there,\u201d Mr. Fox said.Signs of wage pressure concern some experts, who worry that it may lead to inflation. But many analysts, including the middle-of-the-road Mr. Zandi and Jared Bernstein, a left-leaning economist who served as an adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., dismiss the inflation threat, arguing that growing business investment to enhance productivity and expand sales will offset higher labor costs.One example is the Gap, which is raising the pay of its 65,000 lower-wage workers (out of its total of 90,000 in the United States) to $9 an hour this year and will increase it to $10 an hour in June 2015.The Gap acted partly because a shift to more business online made it essential to have higher-skilled and better-trained workers in its stores. The retailer\u2019s expansion into selling clothes online for customers to try on in the stores, said Bill Chandler, senior vice president of corporate affairs, means the company will rely on employees to encourage customers to buy accessories and other clothes when they pick up their orders.\u201cWe\u2019re not quantifying the cost,\u201d Mr. Chandler said, \u201cbut we\u2019re confident we can meet it while continuing to deliver results for our shareholders.\u201dIn the end, however, only a growing scarcity of qualified workers \u2014 not the generosity of employers \u2014 will lift pay more broadly.\u201cYou can always get workers,\u201d Mr. Naroff said. \u201cYou just have to pay them.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In French Premier\u2019s Blend of Socialism, Conservative and Centrist Notes", "Date": "2014-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 France\u2019s new prime minister introduced the country this week to his particular brand of Socialist Party politics: more centrist on social issues, more conservative economically and more combative than the man who appointed him, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.Mr. Valls will appear day in and day out before a nation struggling with an unemployment rate of more than 10 percent and concerns about its capacity to maintain its role on the world stage. And his first act was to deliver bad news \u2014 asking the left wing of his fractious party, and the public, to accept cuts to cherished services in the name of reducing the budget deficit.\u201cToo much suffering, not enough hope: Such is France\u2019s situation,\u201d Mr. Valls said on Tuesday in his first speech to the National Assembly.\u201cThe reality is there, and we must look at it without trembling,\u201d he said in a speech interrupted far more frequently by boos than by cheers. He promised that he would \u201ctell the truth to the French\u201d and added: \u201cTruth about the critical state of our country. Truth about the solutions that are needed. France is at a moment in its history when we must concentrate on the essential, and the essential is giving confidence back to the French in their future.\u201dDespite the mixed reception, he easily won a vote of confidence after the speech for the Hollande government\u2019s new slate of ministers.Mr. Valls \u2014 who, according to some reports, once tried unsuccessfully to persuade the Socialist Party to take the word socialist out of its name \u2014 has long endorsed a more centrist, free-market economic policy than many on the left who espouse a more centrally planned economy. Public spending accounts for 57 percent of France\u2019s gross domestic product, the second-highest level in Europe.His relative conservatism was clear from the approving editorials and columns published in right-leaning magazines and newspapers after he was named. Franz-Olivier Giesbert, editor of the weekly magazine Le Point, wrote, \u201cBy imposing Mr. Valls against a large part of his camp, the president is completing the transformation of the left.\u201dLe Figaro, a daily newspaper that often expresses the views of the French right, used its front-page editorial on Tuesday to urge Mr. Valls to \u201cstay himself\u201d in his new position and not \u201csuddenly dilute his convictions.\u201dThe choice of Mr. Valls suggested a calculation by Mr. Hollande, among others, that the country needed someone who could reassure the European Union that France is serious about meeting its financial obligations as a member of the bloc, while also projecting a dynamism at home that will appeal to voters.On Tuesday, Mr. Valls offered the most detailed summary yet of how the government intends to meet its promise to enact $69 billion in spending cuts by 2017. He called for $26 billion in cuts to the central government bureaucracy, $13.8 billion to the national health care system and $13.8 billion to local governments \u2014 an element at which many legislators on the right booed loudly, having just won control of a number of local governments. He did not specify how the remaining $15.4 billion in cuts would be made.But in deference to the left and to anxious workers, Mr. Valls also announced $7 billion in tax cuts for low-wage employees and renamed Mr. Hollande\u2019s \u201cresponsibility pact,\u201d aimed at encouraging businesses to create jobs by cutting employment costs, a \u201cresponsibility and solidarity pact,\u201d signaling that the government had not forgotten laborers in its effort to help business.At once an outsider and an insider, Mr. Valls, who emigrated from Spain and became a French citizen at 20, is an experienced politician. He started as a parliamentary aide and later became a spokesman for Lionel Jospin, who was prime minister at the time. Most recently, he was Mr. Hollande\u2019s communications director during the 2012 presidential campaign, and he has a well-tuned ear for how to handle difficult subjects.As interior minister, his voice and face became familiar to radio and television audiences, not least last fall, when problems involving the Roma made headlines. He gained infamy in some circles, and approbation in others, for saying: \u201cThe Roma should eventually return to Romania and Bulgaria. They have a way of life that is extremely different from ours.\u201dHis blunt language about the Roma, and to a lesser extent other immigrants, was less harsh than that of Mr. Hollande\u2019s predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy, a conservative who also served as interior minister. But Mr. Valls\u2019s stance put him at odds with his party\u2019s orthodoxy on the issue, one of the most emotional in French politics today.Mr. Valls has his own presidential ambitions: He ran in the Socialist primaries in 2011 in the hope of challenging Mr. Sarkozy, but lost to Mr. Hollande. He does not hesitate to use his outsider status as a way to show the depth of his allegiance to France and to remind voters that he is not quite the same as other French leaders, many of whom attended the country\u2019s most elite schools.Mr. Valls\u2019s father was an artist in Barcelona, his mother\u2019s family originally came from the Italian-speaking part of Switzerland and he attended a public university in Paris. His wife, Anne Gravoin, is a violinist. He was married previously and had four children with his first wife.Toward the end of his remarks on Tuesday, Mr. Valls gave an impassioned description of his feeling for his adopted country that also suggested long-held ambition. \u201cFrance has the same greatness it had when I saw it as a child,\u201d he said, listing the French luminaries who had inspired him, including Charles de Gaulle, the wartime leader who went on to establish the Fifth Republic and become its first president. \u201cAnd this is why I wanted to become a citizen and be prime minister of the government of France.\u201dScott Sayare contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Cubs of Wall Street", "Date": "2014-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byImagine you\u2019re a scientist in some sci-fi alternate universe, and you\u2019ve been charged with creating a boot camp that will reliably turn normal but ambitious people into broken sociopaths more or less willing to do anything. As chronicled in Kevin Roose\u2019s \u201cYoung Money,\u201d this is basically how the first two years of a Wall Street investment banker\u2019s life work. Roose found eight young aspirants who agreed to let him into their lives in exchange for anonymity, and he follows their trajectories as they move from college internships to grueling lives as Wall Street grunts. (One note of caution: In order to protect his sources\u2019 anonymity, Roose writes in a prologue that \u201cmany personal details have been altered or obscured, and a few events have been reordered chronologically or given minor tweaks to make them less recognizable to the people involved.\u201d That stuck with me as I read the book and had to wonder just what \u201cevents\u201d and \u201cpersonal details,\u201d which are the stuff of narrative, weren\u2019t actually accurate.)The first-year Wall Street analyst gig is a classic Faustian bargain. Glamorous recruiters show up on college campuses with promises of excitement, intellectual stimulation and money. They wine and dine recruits, barraging the most promising with solicitous emails, and the wooing works: 36 percent of the 2010 Princeton class who had full-time jobs at graduation went into finance. (In 2006, before the crisis, 46 percent did.) The head of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s career services tells Roose: \u201cTo come to Penn is to, at some point in your undergraduate years, ask yourself the question, \u2018Should I think about investment banking?\u2019 \u201dBut once the job starts the young analysts are treated like serfs: worked to exhaustion, berated, belittled, hazed and made to feel terrible about themselves. They play \u201cmisery poker,\u201d in which they try to one-up their colleagues with tales of preposterous last-minute assignments, dates canceled, family events missed. They ruin relationships and sometimes jeopardize their own selves; a first-\u00adgeneration striver named Arjun learns he has a rare disease and spends all of his time in treatment worrying he\u2019s losing out at work. That said, even Arjun has it better than a vast majority of American workers. Why, one might ask, in an economy in which 49 million Americans are poor and the median household income hovers around $51,000, should we care about the psychic plight of 23-year-olds making $90,000? Because these are the people who run our country, and the process by which their own empathetic faculties are destroyed is a key part of how this entire corrupt finance-state is maintained.The challenge of writing a book about Wall Street is that the canon is so well established. From \u201cThe Bonfire of the Vanities\u201d to \u201cLiar\u2019s Poker\u201d to \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street,\u201d we have turned its culture of cutthroat competition, testosterone, profanity, power and adrenaline into a cultural clich\u00e9. And while that image is a cartoon, a fair number of the broad caricatures and stereotypes the public holds about the place are basically true. To the extent Roose has something new to contribute, it\u2019s in concentrating not on the \u201cmasters of the universe\u201d but on the 23-year-olds who stay up all night prepping their PowerPoint slides. \u201cTheir offices are covered in moldy takeout containers and pit-stained undershirts,\u201d he writes. \u201cThey make pitch books for clients who will never read them, and get yelled at for improperly aligning cells in Excel, all in hopes of a year-end bonus number that won\u2019t make them want to jump in front of the 4 train. They are the young investment bankers of Wall Street, and they just want some sleep.\u201dIf most chronicles of Wall Street focus on the arrogance of its culture, \u201cYoung Money\u201d focuses on its insecurity. \u201cThey made a mistake hiring me,\u201d a young analyst named Chelsea tells Roose. \u201cI\u2019m the dumbest person here, I don\u2019t understand any of this.\u201d Of course, the whole point is that everyone feels that way.Wall Street is a finely engineered machine for producing self-doubt and envy. We get to see up close the never-ending chase after status and money that fills many of Roose\u2019s subjects with existential dread. You want to be in the hot, high-earning front office, and not the lame back office; then once you get a job in the front office, you want to land in the highest-status group in the front office and not some backwater; then you want to make sure your bonus is higher than the bonus of the guy sitting next to you; and then you want to be courted by the best private \u00adequity group \u2014 and on and on, an infinitely ascending StairMaster to spiritual exhaustion. In this context, the conscience atrophies. When asked about morality or ethics, Roose\u2019s subjects tell him that they\u2019re just trying not to mess up. But here\u2019s the thing: All of this was true 10 years ago. Roose tells readers early on that he undertook this project in order to explore how the crash changed Wall Street. But if the book feels somewhat unsatisfying in stretches, it\u2019s because the fundamental answer (and one he undersells, frankly) is that not so much has changed. The plummeting losses and dislocation of the crash reminded everyone on the Street of the terror that has always lurked just out of view. Jeremy, an analyst who toils under the capricious tyranny of his boss, Penelope, has come to realize that her cruelty is motivated by that terror. \u201cHe saw that after the financial crisis, Penelope, just like him, . . . just like everyone at Goldman Sachs, was concerned first and foremost about protecting herself.\u201d One third-year analyst explains what it feels like to watch round after round of layoffs. \u201cYou\u2019re working with this constant fear,\u201d he says. \u201cYou go to this bulletproof firm, it gives you a ton of options, and it\u2019s really self-validating. And then all of a sudden, you have no options, you\u2019re not getting paid nearly as much as you thought, and you might get fired.\u201d That fear is central to the ethos of Wall Street and, more important, to the vision Wall Street has for all of America, where every last worker is as insecure, disposable and terrified as the first-year analysts in Roose\u2019s book. Of course, a vast majority of the American work force lacks that preening sense of superiority that is the other half of Wall Street\u2019s ethos. One possible result of the crisis could have been to temper that hubris, but instead, as Roose shows, it has largely remained intact. The crisis has only intensified the terror. And that should terrify us all.

{"Headline": "Political Rifts Slow U.S. Effort on Climate Laws", "Date": "2014-04-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut aggressive efforts to tackle climate change have repeatedly collided with political reality in Washington, where some Republicans question the underlying science of global warming and lawmakers\u2019 ties to the fossil fuel industry have made them resistant to change. The rise of the Tea Party in recent years has also made a tax increase unlikely.This week\u2019s report makes clear, however, that the window is rapidly narrowing to forge new policies that will protect the globe from a future of serious food and water shortages, a drastic sea level rise, increased poverty and disease and other profound risks.\u201cWhat would be required is a nationwide carbon pricing policy,\u201d said Robert Stavins, director of Harvard\u2019s environmental economics program and a lead author of the report. \u201cAnd that would not be possible without action from Congress.\u201dDemocrats have twice pushed serious bills to force greenhouse gas polluters like coal-fired power plants and oil refiners to pay to pollute. Both of those bills \u2014 one by President Bill Clinton in 1993 and one by President Obama in 2010 \u2014 ultimately failed, contributing to heavy Democratic losses in midterm elections.Lawmakers who back such efforts, which represent a threat to the bottom lines of the fossil fuel industry, particularly coal, the nation\u2019s top source of carbon pollution, have been criticized by campaigns from Republicans, Tea Party-affiliated \u201csuper PACs\u201d like Americans for Prosperity, and the coal and oil industries.Many members of the Republican Party question the established science that carbon pollution contributes to climate change \u2014 and hundreds have also signed on to a pledge promising never to raise taxes.But there has not been a huge public outcry to endorse new climate change policy. Polls consistently show that while a majority of Americans accept that climate change is real, addressing it ranks at the bottom of voters\u2019 priorities.During this year\u2019s midterm election campaigns, Republicans have used carbon-control policies as a political weapon, calling Mr. Obama\u2019s E.P.A. rules a \u201cwar on coal.\u201d The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, who is running for re-election in the coal-heavy state of Kentucky, has vowed to use every legislative tactic available to block, repeal or delay those rules if Republicans win control of the Senate this fall.Within that context, many in the Republican establishment think that talking about climate change \u2014 and, particularly, any policy endorsing a tax on fossil fuels \u2014 would be political suicide for a Republican seeking to win the party\u2019s nomination in 2016.The United Nations report says that if the world\u2019s major economies do not enact steep, fast climate policies well before 2030, in order to cut total global emissions 40 to 70 percent by 2050, the prospects of avoiding a global atmospheric temperature increase of 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, the point past which scientists say the planet will be locked into a dangerous future, will be far more difficult and expensive.Ten countries are responsible for 70 percent of the world\u2019s total greenhouse gas pollution. While the report makes clear that all major economies must act, the actions of China and the United States, the top two carbon polluters, will be most crucial.The authors of the report say Mr. Obama\u2019s E.P.A. regulations represent a significant first step to cutting United States carbon pollution \u2014 but not enough to avert the worst effects of a warming world.The next president will have to both carry out Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change rules and quickly push through even more stringent pollution-cutting policies, according to the report\u2019s authors.\u201cWe need to increase the slope and the pace of the change,\u201d said David Victor, one of the report\u2019s authors and an expert on climate and energy policy at the University of California, San Diego. \u201cAccelerating what we\u2019re doing in the U.S. will be very important for the next administration.\u201dDespite the history of roadblocks to enacting climate change policy, some experts say they do see some potential for a legislative path to cut United States carbon pollution.One window could open if Congress takes up a comprehensive effort to overhaul the nation\u2019s corporate tax code, which could happen after the 2016 presidential election.Lawmakers from both parties have pushed tax reform \u2014 and in that context, there could be room for a grand bargain incorporating a new carbon tax, which Democrats want, paired with a cut in corporate or income taxes, which Republicans want. Prominent conservative economists, like Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who advised Senator John McCain\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign, and Gregory Mankiw, who advised Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 bid, have endorsed that proposal.Experts also note that a shift at the national level could come as more states enact climate change policies. Currently California and several Northeastern states, including New York, have enacted state-level programs to force carbon polluters to pay to pollute.Historically, California\u2019s environmental laws have served as a vanguard and model for national environmental policy. The push for state-level policies could rise, say experts, if there is a significant increase in extreme weather like droughts and flooding, which contribute to higher adaptation costs for state and local governments.This week\u2019s report said the impact of climate change was already being experienced, and it followed on earlier scientific reports that have noted that climate change was exacerbating drought in Texas, rapidly rising sea levels along the Atlantic coast and higher storm surges caused by hurricanes in states like Florida and Louisiana. Among the likely Republican contenders for the 2016 presidential nomination are Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas.Of course, some of those contenders, like Mr. Cruz, Mr. Jindal and Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, also hail from states where fossil fuel development is a key part of the economy \u2014 and have thus led the way in fighting carbon control policies.An earlier version of this article misstated which major economies need to enact climate policies well before 2030, according to the United Nations. The report refers to the world's major economies, not the nation's major economies.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why U.S. Growth Slowed to a Halt at the Start of the Year", "Date": "2014-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEverybody knew the first few months of 2014 would show weak growth readings, thanks partly to bad weather. But not too many people expected growth to be this weak \u2014 only an 0.1 percent rate of gross domestic product growth, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. The consensus of economists surveyed by Bloomberg was that that number would be 1.2 percent.Personal consumption, the biggest component of G.D.P., has been the mainstay of this expansion, growing steadily every quarter, driven by Americans\u2019 appetites for goods and services. Personal consumption has risen by at least a 1.5 percent annual rate for 17 straight quarters. It shows no signs of faltering.Business investment, meanwhile, contributed quite a lot to growth from 2011 to 2013, as companies increased their investments. Companies have been adding buildings, buying new equipment and acquiring new software packages strongly enough that such investment contributed 0.84 percentage points to growth in 2011, almost precisely the same as in 2012. The contribution shifted down to a third of a percentage point in 2013.In the first quarter of 2014, however, the corporate sector was a net negative for the economy, with investment in structures, equipment and intellectual property falling at a 2.1 percent annual rate, enough to subtract a quarter of a percentage point from overall G.D.P. That was surely in part caused by the harsh winter weather, but the basic trend is real: American business, once a major driver of the expansion, no longer is.On the positive side, the sharp declines in government spending seem to have ended; state and local governments have gotten out of austerity mode, and the sequestration policies to slash federal spending have been fully implemented. That means government is no longer a major drag \u2014 it subtracted 0.09 percentage points from overall growth in the first quarter, an improvement over the 0.68 percentage-point drag in 2011.Add it all up, and American consumers are chugging along and driving the recovery. But they need help from somewhere else \u2014 business investment, housing, government or the export sector \u2014 to make this expansion more robust.Advertisement"}

That is because, unlike a number of other opioids that are available in both short- and long-acting forms, there is no short-acting form of hydrocodone alone with which to initiate treatment, and there is nothing to indicate that hydrocodone is any more efficacious than these other drugs.If lawmakers are concerned that without such restrictions physicians will overprescribe it, then they should address the real problem that is leading to the well-documented misprescription of opioids: the inadequate education most physicians receive during medical school and postgraduate training on pain management, including the use of these and other analgesic medications. The writer is a doctor who specializes in pain management.\u00a0To the Editor:Evzio, the naloxone auto-injector device newly approved by the Food and Drug Administration for reversal of an opioid overdose, is a missed opportunity. Despite extremely limited public funding, community-based health organizations have distributed naloxone, an inexpensive, nontoxic medication not under patent protection, since the late 1990s to people likely to witness an overdose.These programs have been praised by federal agencies and medical societies for producing steep declines in overdose mortality in locations where they have been brought to scale.What community advocates have decidedly not been asking for is an expensive, prescription-based naloxone device. Rather, we need the National Institutes of Health and the F.D.A. to incentivize very low-cost, over-the-counter naloxone, something that is well within reach given available technology and the production cost of the medication.Evzio, which is likely to cost hundreds of dollars per dose if priced similarly to epinephrine auto-injectors, looks like a handout to the pharmaceutical industry that will have limited benefit for programs now reaching those most at risk of overdose.The writer is policy director of Vocal-NY, an advocacy group.\u00a0To the Editor:A report by the Institute of Medicine found that 100 million Americans are now living with chronic pain. That\u2019s a third of the country\u2019s population. Ten million of those have pain so severe that they are disabled by it. Pain costs the United States economy $635 billion a year in lost productivity and health care expenses.A vast majority of people who use opioids do so legally and safely. A subset uses these medications illegally. In fact, from 2010 to 2011, the number of Americans misusing and abusing opioid medications declined from 4.4 percent to 3.6 percent. In the debate over safe and effective pain medicines, context matters.\u00a0To the Editor:Every overdose is a case of untreated opioid addiction disease. Instead of waiting for loved ones to struggle through a \u201cnear death\u201d experience to be miraculously saved by a naloxone injection, we should focus on addressing the disease to avoid this harrowing experience in the first place.Here\u2019s our society\u2019s answer: First, let\u2019s get naloxone in the hands of emergency medical workers of all types \u2014 professionals, parents and friends \u2014 and make sure that Good Samaritan laws support risk-free reporting of overdoses to those emergency medical workers. Then let\u2019s harness our energy and attention toward educating patients, families and physicians about the proper treatment of this disease, including the use of F.D.A.-approved stabilizing medications like buprenorphine, methadone and naltrexone.Naloxone is one answer to reducing opioid overdose deaths. But it is not the answer to opioid addiction disease.The writer is an assistant clinical professor of medicine at Yale University School of Medicine and serves on the clinical advisory boards for Reckitt Benckiser and BioDelivery Sciences International, manufacturers of opioid addiction medicines.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Chinese Regulator to Conduct Stress Tests", "Date": "2014-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 China\u2019s banking regulator will conduct regional and national stress tests, the state-run Shanghai Securities News reported on Friday, reflecting growing concerns over credit risk.Chinese banks had a spike in bad loans last year, and the agency, the China Banking Regulatory Commission, sent guidelines sent to banks last month, saying the tests would be done \u201cin a timely manner.\u201dThe tests are intended \u201cto analyze the impact of unfavorable situations in individual banks and the banking system, and urge banking financial institutions to make emergency plans,\u201d the regulator said in its guidelines.The regulator\u2019s guidelines also urged banks to curb lending to local government financial vehicles and industries facing overcapacity, including property and steel-trading companies.The report did not provide details on how the stress tests would be conducted or whether the regulator would conduct tests of individual lenders or of the industry as a whole at the regional and national levels.\u201cBanks should study the risk situation in key regions, focus on certain industries and on important clients,\u201d the China Banking Regulatory Commission document said, according to the Shanghai Securities News. \u201cIn particular, it is necessary to tighten supervision and control of spillover of risk between businesses, on and off balance sheets, and between the banking and other systems.\u201dThe guidelines warned banks against disguising the true scale of their bad loans by offering distressed borrowers new loans to repay maturing ones.The regulator probably lacks the resources to conduct stress tests itself, said May Yan, who analyzes Chinese banks at Barclays Capital in Hong Kong. She expects the agency will continue to rely on banks to conduct their own tests.\u201cIt depends on the details and what exactly they test,\u201d Ms. Yan said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been testing on the property market for years, and the banks all come back and say even if property prices drop by 30 percent, it would have a very small impact on asset quality and earnings. But that\u2019s not necessarily true because there are second-order effects.\u201dIt was unclear to what extent the latest guidelines were a departure from previous practice. Commercial banks already have to submit stress test results to the regulator every quarter, bankers said.Industry observers say that unlike the stress tests that the United States Federal Reserve and European Central Bank conducted in the aftermath of the financial crisis, which were intended to restore investor confidence, the Chinese regulator is unlikely to publicly release results of its tests.Chinese banks\u2019 ratio of nonperforming loans rose to 1 percent at the end of December, the highest level in two years, the regulator reported in February. A corporate bond default last month and the near-collapse of two high-profile shadow-banking investment products this year were further evidence of growing financial strains afflicting the economy. The banks are dealing with the aftermath of the huge lending binge that policy makers unleashed to soften the effect of the global financial crisis in 2008.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "49 Percent of New Yorkers Approve of de Blasio\u2019s Performance, Poll Says ", "Date": "2014-04-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the survey, released Monday, underscores the gap between the soaring expectations Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, set coming into office and the day-to-day ability of a municipal official to combat the forces of social inequality, which the mayor has declared as the overarching aim of his administration.Fully half of respondents said they disapproved of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s efforts to address income inequality, and 52 percent said they were dissatisfied with his work on making it easier for New Yorkers to find affordable housing, another major priority for his mayoralty.It is early in Mr. de Blasio\u2019s tenure, and the mayor has emphasized since the night of his election that it would take time, perhaps even years, before the social progress he promised in his campaign would be translated from rhetoric into reality.Patience is not a typical New York virtue, but the poll showed that residents were generally willing to cut the new mayor some slack. Forty-nine percent of New Yorkers approved of his job performance, while 31 percent disapproved, figures roughly in line with those of New York\u2019s last two mayors during the early months of their first terms.By comparison, in Michael R. Bloomberg\u2019s last month as mayor, 53 percent of New Yorkers approved of his job performance, while 35 percent disapproved.The New York Times, NY1 and Siena College asked New York City residents to assess Mayor Bill de Blasio and how he has been dealing with issues that range from education to unemployment.Still, the new mayor is viewed as a more empathetic leader than his predecessor: Thirty percent of residents polled said Mr. de Blasio cared a lot about their problems and needs, a larger percentage than Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire, received when the question was asked at various times throughout his tenure.\u201cHe deals with problems and people in a different way than Bloomberg,\u201d Sheila Walker, 57, a Democrat who owns a pool-table repair business in Brooklyn, said in a follow-up interview.\u201cIf you had to talk to somebody,\u201d she said, \u201cyou\u2019d feel more comfortable talking to him than to Bloomberg.\u201dNew Yorkers are pleased with several of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s marquee initiatives: Nearly three-quarters of those polled said they approved of the mayor\u2019s initiatives to provide prekindergarten and to require employers to provide sick workers with paid days off.There is more skepticism about his ability to fulfill broader goals, like expanding employment and closing the gap between the rich and the poor.\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s his job to provide more jobs or if it\u2019s President Obama\u2019s job, but the economy is still so bad,\u201d said John Morales, 47, a Democrat from Staten Island who is unemployed. \u201cMore should be done to provide jobs.\u201dLoftier plans aside, Mr. de Blasio, an inexperienced manager, received good marks on his ability to keep the city clean and safe. A majority said they approved of the mayor\u2019s handling of the Police Department, and 62 percent said they approved of the city\u2019s performance in snow removal.The mayor did not score as well on charter schools, a topic that has bedeviled the new administration for weeks, with New Yorkers divided on how Mr. de Blasio has handled the issue \u2014 perhaps reflecting a multimillion-dollar ad campaign criticizing the mayor\u2019s policies by charter school advocates. And 59 percent of those surveyed said they opposed the mayor\u2019s plan to remove carriage horses from Central Park.Forty-nine percent of New Yorkers approved of Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s job performance, according to the poll.There is also a racial divide in how Mr. de Blasio has been perceived.More whites, 45 percent, disapproved of the mayor\u2019s job performance than the 38 percent who approved, compared with majorities of blacks and Hispanics who approved of how he was doing his job.And asked if it was a mistake to elect Mr. de Blasio, nearly a quarter of white residents said that it was, compared with 6 percent of blacks and 9 percent of Hispanics.Don Levy, director of the Siena College Research Institute, said Mr. de Blasio had earned a reservoir of trust in his first few months, but that he would still have to win over some skeptics. \u201cThey have to see more,\u201d Mr. Levy said. \u201cThree months is not enough for a majority of New Yorkers to say, \u2018I\u2019m confident with this mayor.\u2019\u00a0\u201dThe Times/NY1/Siena College poll surveyed 1,190 adults across all five boroughs of New York City from March 29 to April 3. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus three percentage points.For a mayor who prides himself on his left-leaning ideology, the survey suggested that many New Yorkers preferred pragmatism: Two-thirds of respondents said the mayor should compromise on some issues to achieve more, compared with a quarter who said he should stick with his positions fully even if it means less can be accomplished.Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a fellow Democrat who repeatedly outmaneuvered Mr. de Blasio during this year\u2019s budget negotiations in Albany, has a 64 percent job approval rating in the city, 15 points higher than the mayor\u2019s, the poll found.Despite those trouble spots, six of 10 residents said the jury was still out on Mr. de Blasio\u2019s administration. \u201cHe just came into office and we have to give him a chance,\u201d said Delrose Henry, 52, of Queens, who identified himself as a Democrat.In interviews, many respondents said they were eager to see where the mayor would go from here.\u201cI really think that it\u2019s too early to tell about what he is going to achieve,\u201d said Elizabeth Pozzi, 62, a Democrat who lives on Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side. \u201cHow much can you do in 100 days?\u201dMarina Stefan and Megan Thee-Brenan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "No Spring Break for the Unemployed", "Date": "2014-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialAs members of Congress enjoy their extended spring break, 2.3 million unemployed Americans have been left to worry about whether lawmakers will ever get around to renewing federal unemployment benefits, which expired at the end of 2013. Every week that Congress fails to act, another 70,000 jobless workers will find there is no longer a federal program to turn to. The delay is unusual as well as cruel. Since 1958, Congress has provided jobless benefits in tough economic times to help people who have been out of work for more than six months. Before now, no Congress ever let federal benefits expire with long-term joblessness as high and entrenched as it is today. House Republicans bear most of the blame. The Senate passed a bill in early April, albeit belatedly, to provide five months of benefits, including four retroactive payments for January through April and a month of benefits for May. The House leadership refused to schedule a vote on even that bare-bones relief. In today\u2019s poor labor market, long-term joblessness afflicts everyone: all age groups, all levels of education, every ethnic, racial and occupational category. But a big and underappreciated driver of the problem is the increase among groups generally spared from prolonged unemployment. The longer the delay in reinstating the benefits, the greater the harm to affected individuals and the broader economy. That\u2019s true, even if benefits are renewed retroactively. After months without help, many people will have fallen hopelessly behind on their rent or mortgage, leading to eviction or foreclosure. Monthly bills will be swollen by late fees and interest charges, causing a chunk of any payments to flow to banks and corporations rather than local businesses. Family harmony that a modicum of aid could have helped to sustain will have been strained by the damage long-term unemployment inflicts on health, marriages and children. Congress is off on a nice long break this month. When will the long-term unemployed catch a break? Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Justices Back Rule Limiting Coal Pollution", "Date": "2014-04-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLegal experts said the decision, written by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, signals that the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to use the Clean Air Act to fight global warming could withstand legal challenges.In June, the E.P.A. is expected to propose a sweeping new Clean Air Act regulation to cut emissions of carbon dioxide, the heat-trapping greenhouse gas that scientists say is the chief cause of climate change. Coal plants are the biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States.\u201cIt\u2019s a big win for the E.P.A., and not just because it has to do with this rule,\u201d said Jody Freeman, director of the environmental law program at Harvard. \u201cIt\u2019s the fact that it\u2019s setting the stage and creating momentum for what\u2019s to come.\u201d If the Supreme Court had decided against the Obama administration in Tuesday\u2019s decision, Ms. Freeman said, \u201cit would have been a shot across the bow to the E.P.A. as it takes the next steps\u201d toward putting out the climate change regulations.The Supreme Court decision is only the latest blow to coal. Also on Tuesday, a Federal District Court ordered the E.P.A. to propose by\u00a0Dec. 1\u00a0a new nationwide regulation to rein in smog pollution from coal-fired power plants and other major polluters. This rule would come on top of the regulation covering cross-state air pollution.The E.P.A. had been preparing to issue that regulation in 2011, but President Obama told the agency to delay it after his advisers warned that it could hurt his re-election chances in coal-reliant swing states like Ohio. \u201cToday\u2019s Supreme Court decision is a resounding victory for public health and a key component of E.P.A.\u2019s efforts to make sure all Americans have clean air to breathe,\u201d Gina McCarthy, the E.P.A. administrator, said in a statement. She added that \u201cthe court\u2019s finding also underscores the importance of basing the agency\u2019s efforts on strong legal foundations and sound science.\u201dIn its arguments before the court, the E.P.A. said the rules were necessary to protect the health and the environment of downwind states. East Coast states in particular are vulnerable to pollution blown by the prevailing west-to-east winds of the United States. The soot and smog produced by coal plants are linked to asthma, lung disease and premature death.In her decision, Justice Ginsburg noted that in reining in interstate pollution, regulators must account for the vagaries of the wind. \u201cSome pollutants stay within upwind states\u2019 borders, the wind carries others to downwind states, and some subset of that group drifts to states without air quality problems,\u201d she wrote, adding a biblical quotation from the Book of John: \u201cThe wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth.\u201dIn a dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, said the regulation was unwieldy and suggested it was Marxist. As written, the regulation will require upwind polluting states to cut pollution in relation to the amounts of pollution each state produces, but also as a proportion of how affordably a state can make the cuts. In other words, states that are able to more cost-effectively reduce pollution will be required to cut more of it.\u201cI fully acknowledge that the proportional-reduction approach will demand some complicated computations where one upwind state is linked to multiple downwind states and vice versa,\u201d Justice Scalia wrote.\u201cI am confident, however, that E.P.A.\u2019s skilled number-crunchers can adhere to the statute\u2019s quantitative (rather than efficiency) mandate by crafting quantitative solutions. Indeed, those calculations can be performed at the desk, whereas the \u2018from each according to its ability\u2019 approach requires the unwieldy field examination of many pollution-producing sources with many sorts of equipment,\u201d he said, paraphrasing Karl Marx.Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. recused himself from the case.The utilities and 15 states opposed to the regulations argued that the rules, as written by the Obama administration, gave the E.P.A. too much authority and placed an unfair economic burden on the polluting states.The decision will force coal plant owners to install costly \u201cscrubber\u201d technology to curb smokestack pollution of smog-forming chemicals. Many owners have said the regulation would be so expensive to carry out that they expected to shut down their oldest and dirtiest coal plants. Republicans in Congress denounced the decision.\u201cThis is just the latest blow to jobs and affordable energy,\u201d Representative Fred Upton, Republican of Michigan and the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and Representative Edward Whitfield, Republican of Kentucky, said in a statement. Both are from states that rely heavily on cheap coal-fired electricity.They added: \u201cThe administration\u2019s overreaching regulation will drive up energy costs and threaten jobs and electric reliability. We cannot allow E.P.A.\u2019s aggressive regulatory expansion to go unchecked. We will continue our oversight of the agency and our efforts to protect American families and workers from E.P.A.\u2019s onslaught of costly rules.\u201dIn 2011, the Obama administration issued the \u201cgood neighbor\u201d rule, which was to apply to 28 states east of Nebraska \u2014 half of the country \u2014 but the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia struck it down, ruling that the E.P.A. had not followed the Clean Air Act when it calculated how to assign responsibility for cross-state air pollution. The Supreme Court\u2019s ruling overturned that decision.Governors from East Coast states have for more than 15 years been subject to tougher air pollution requirements than other parts of the country.The East Coast governors have long criticized the Appalachian and Rust Belt states for their more lenient rules on pollution from coal plants, factories and tailpipes \u2014 allowing those state economies to profit from cheap energy while their smog and soot have been carried eastward by prevailing winds.An article on Wednesday about the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to uphold the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate smog from coal plants that drifts across state lines misstated the number of states affected. It is 28, not 27. The article also misidentified, in some copies, the source of a quotation by Karl Marx that Justice Antonin Scalia paraphrased in his dissent. It was in the \u201cCritique of the Gotha Programme\u201d \u2014 not \u201cThe Communist Manifesto\u201d \u2014 that Marx wrote, \u201cFrom each according to his ability, to each according to his need.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cities Advance Their Fight Against Rising Inequality", "Date": "2014-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 In January, Teresa Fuentes\u2019s employer told her she could work no more than 30 hours a week preparing burgers and passing out food at the drive-through for about $9.50 an hour.It was just the latest blow to her already-fragile household finances. Ms. Fuentes, 47, had missed work to take care of an eye infection for which she could not afford the prescription drops. She is struggling to take care of her two children, reliant on a local food bank, working two jobs and behind on her bills.\u201cIt\u2019s very stressful for me,\u201d Ms. Fuentes said. \u201cThings are just so tight.\u201dFor Ms. Fuentes and thousands of other workers like her, some relief may be on the way. The Seattle City Council is intensely debating a plan to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour from $9.32 \u2014 forging ahead on its plan to tackle income inequality as efforts in the nation\u2019s capital have languished.\u201cThe accumulation of 30 years of rising income inequality is finally having its impact,\u201d said Mayor Ed Murray, sitting in his glass-walled office overlooking Puget Sound. \u201cPeople can\u2019t afford to live a decent life.\u201dBut economists from across the political spectrum warn that the policy choices available to local governments might, at best, do little more than soften the blow from rising inequality.\u201cCities just don\u2019t have the tax and trade policy and tools to rein back inequality in a significant way,\u201d said Alan Berube, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C. \u201cThey can\u2019t really redistribute income in the way the federal government can, so they are reaching for the levers they have.\u201dNonetheless, the movement at the local level goes well beyond Seattle. In New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio, who campaigned on a platform of fighting inequality, has won support for expanding preschool education but has run into obstacles at the state level to tax the rich more to pay for programs aimed at the poor.Cities including Atlanta, Boston, San Francisco and Los Angeles are also considering proposals to tackle inequality, such as bolstering programs for public education, transportation, affordable housing and wages.In Seattle, as in many cities with a vibrant technology sector or a thriving financial industry, the increase in income inequality has been particularly sharp.In 1990, the average household in the top 10 percent of the income distribution in the Seattle area made about eight times as much as the average household in the bottom 10 percent earned. Now, it earns about 11 times as much. The earnings of the very richest households have diverged sharply from those in the middle, too.President Obama\u2019s proposal to increase the federal minimum wage to $10.10 from $7.25 is unlikely to pass through Congress, but several states have been tackling the issue on their own.Today, million-dollar condominiums are selling at a record pace downtown, Amazon is working on a gleaming new office featuring glass geodesic domes, and boutiques and high-end restaurants draw a well-heeled crowd. But high rents and stagnant wages are increasingly pushing out middle-class and low-income families like that of Ms. Fuentes, further worsening the city\u2019s inequality.Seattle\u2019s politicians \u2014 who generally range from left to far-left \u2014 said the result had been a less inclusive and less fair city. \u201cThere\u2019s been a forced exodus of low-wage workers,\u201d said Kshama Sawant, the City Council member who is leading the push for the $15 minimum wage. \u201cLife is very hard for a large majority of people, and there\u2019s a burning anger about these things.\u201dLocal politicians across the country have echoed that thought, and pushed for local governments to start where the federal government has stopped. \u201cPresident Obama is our greatest partner,\u201d said Mayor Betsy Hodges of Minneapolis after attending the State of the Union address in January. \u201cHe knows that given the gridlock in Congress, cities are where we can make progress on the goal of reducing inequality.\u201dIn Seattle, the fiercely contested $15 minimum wage is seen as only a first strike against income inequality in the city. \u201cThese trends won\u2019t change and inequality will grow,\u201d said Mr. Murray, the Seattle mayor, \u201cunless democratic institutions come in and correct them.\u201dBut local officials \u2014 and economists \u2014 said that the federal government would be better at alleviating some of the effects of income inequality than state or local governments, given its capacity to touch inequality\u2019s root causes, like globalization and technological change.\u201cMost localities are very restricted in the kinds of stuff they can do,\u201d said Edward Glaeser, an economist at Harvard, noting that cities generally have little or no control over the tax code and large benefit programs like Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare. It is those policies that have the biggest effect on inequality by far, he said.But while aggressive city policies will not accomplish what aggressive national policies would, they might at least have a muted effect, officials say.The most powerful policies for cities are most likely to be aimed at encouraging the middle class to remain there rather than moving to the suburbs, Mr. Glaeser said, by supporting more affordable housing, improving schools and expanding public transportation.\u201cThe places that have high inequality almost by definition have a small middle class,\u201d Mr. Berube of Brookings said. \u201cThere\u2019s this crater in the middle; they\u2019re trying to keep their cities affordable and livable for the middle class.\u201dFor Seattle, the proposal to lift the minimum income to $15 an hour is supported by more than half of city residents, but is facing stringent opposition by local businesses, some of which favor a more modest increase. City officials have promised a quick vote on the measure.\u201cWhen you jump to $15, you change the game substantially,\u201d said Richard Davis of the Washington Research Council, a local think tank. \u201cAutomation becomes a more attractive substitution than when you\u2019re making a more incremental increase.\u201d Businesses might move beyond the city limit, and inequality might even jump.But politicians like Ms. Sawant contend that local policies to raise wages and preserve a middle class are necessary to counteract the broad trend.\u201cAre families going to be able to work here?\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the question.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He is now working three jobs, driving a cab and picking up shifts at Lord & Taylor and Whole Foods.\u201cI\u2019m not in my basement, unshaven, unshowered, drinking a bottle of Scotch a day,\u201d Mr. Gorelick said. \u201cI\u2019m out there working these jobs, meeting people and trying to make something happen. But it is exhausting. It is stressful. It is difficult.\u201dFor people experiencing such long spells without appropriate work, it is a crisis. Often, it is also a conundrum: What should a worker who finds himself out of a job for six months or more do?\u201cThere is this very pressing issue,\u201d said Ofer Sharone, a sociologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, \u201cand there is this great gap in knowledge about what to do about it, both for policy makers and these individuals.\u201d Should long-term jobless workers seek out career counseling? Should they accept far lower salaries? Should politicians revamp training programs? To those questions, and to many others, there are too few answers.In Washington, the plight of the long-term jobless has largely faded from the policy conversation. At the moment, the federal government offers virtually no help to the 3.8 million Americans who have been out of work for more than six months. The maximum duration of unemployment insurance payments fell from as long as 73 weeks to 26 weeks in most states in January.A jobless aid bill is expected to win final approval from the Democrat-controlled Senate early next week, but it is not expected to pass the Republican-controlled House as currently constructed.Yet there is increasing evidence that a stronger recovery alone might not significantly aid the country\u2019s long-term jobless. Even before the latest monthly job figures are released on Friday, short-term unemployment has fallen to its prerecession level, but long-term unemployment remains more than twice as high as it was in 2007.In its inaugural study, the institute is using long-term unemployed workers, including Mr. Gorelick, as guinea pigs, comparing the outcomes for workers assigned career coaches to the outcomes of those not offered that form of help. \u201cThe idea is that in time, we should be able to say whether that intervention is effective, and we will have a lot of qualitative data about the lives of these workers as well,\u201d Mr. Sharone said.Intensive career counseling might help the long-term unemployed, Mr. Sharone and his colleagues figured. Coaches could help the long-term jobless optimize their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, refrain from flagging in their job searches, make new connections and beat common human resources screening techniques. And if career counseling does not reduce the jobless rate, that would be valuable to know too.The institute separated hundreds of volunteers into two groups, some assigned career coaches and some not. All agreed to complete weekly surveys about their experiences looking for work and their employment status.On a frigid winter evening, 18 of the participating career counselors \u2014 all of whom are working free \u2014 met in Mr. Sharone\u2019s basement to snack on cheese and crackers and share tips about how to best help the long-term jobless. \u201cHe really likes the accountability of coming to me on a regular basis,\u201d Nancy Dube, a human resources consultant, said of one of her clients. \u201cHe can\u2019t wait to come back! And I think it\u2019s helped motivate him in other elements of his job search.\u201dThe coaches reported that their clients generally had little luck in landing new jobs \u2014 just a half-dozen had managed to do so at that early point. But the coaches felt that they had helped to keep their clients\u2019 spirits up and their job searches positive, wide-ranging and intense.\u201cHe knew nothing about me and had no preconceived notions,\u201d Mr. Gorelick said. \u201cHe could look at my work and give me constructive comments in a very objective manner. I think that in and of itself is extremely valuable.\u201dMr. Gorelick, who was his family\u2019s primary breadwinner, has struggled to support his wife and children and cover their mortgage. He has fallen into credit card debt, wiped out his retirement accounts and even contemplated selling his house.\u201cI decided to set my ego aside,\u201d he said. \u201cSince my unemployment benefits have run out, I\u2019m just trying to make a little money with these part-time jobs. But, for perspective, if I combined my income from all of them, that would still be half of what my weekly unemployment benefits were.\u201dThe White House has long pushed for additional policies to aid the long-term jobless, including renewing emergency unemployment insurance payments. \u201cThis is a key reason no one should feel a steady-as-you-go recovery is good enough to not require more job-creating policies,\u201d said Gene Sperling, the recently departed director of the National Economic Council. \u201cThis form of unemployment has its own perverse dynamic, and public policy should be trying to prevent devastating, negative cycles that gain momentum if left alone.\u201d\u201cThere are models that work,\u201d he said. \u201cBut god, considering the magnitude of this problem, you worry that it is not enough.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Survey Finds Audit Flaws by the Big Accounting Firms", "Date": "2014-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Public company and bank audits conducted around the globe by units affiliated with the world\u2019s six largest accounting firms are persistently riddled with flaws, a group of international regulators have found.Leading up to the crisis, many publicly traded banks portrayed a rosy financial picture of their corporate books, only to suffer huge losses later on subprime mortgage securities in their portfolios.Critics have questioned why independent auditors responsible for reviewing the accuracy and quality of public company financial reporting failed to spot the problems sooner.\u201cThe high rate and severity of inspection deficiencies in critical aspects of the audit, and at some of the world\u2019s largest and systemically important financial institutions, is a wake-up call,\u201d said Lewis H. Ferguson, a board member of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, which polices auditors in the United States.\u201cMore must be done to improve the reliability of audit work performed globally on behalf of investors,\u201d he said.The findings discussed Thursday stem primarily from inspections conducted at firms affiliated with the six largest accounting firms. They include the Big Four \u2014 PricewaterhouseCoopers, KPMG, Deloitte and Ernst & Young \u2014 as well as BDO and Grant Thornton.The survey looked at inspection results for audits of public companies and large financial institutions considered \u201csystemically important\u201d to the global economy.With public company audits, regulators found problems related to auditing fair value measurements, internal control testing and procedures used to assess how financial statements are presented.The regulators also said that audits of systemically important financial firms often had deficiencies stemming from allowances for loan losses and loan impairments, and the auditing of investment valuation.Cindy Fornelli, executive director at the Center for Audit Quality, said on Thursday in reaction to the survey that her group\u2019s members recognized there was still \u201cwork to do.\u201dAt the same time, she noted that accounting reforms enacted in the United States in 2002 \u201chave led to improvements in audit quality, financial reporting, and internal controls over financial reporting.\u201dA spokesman for PricewaterhouseCoopers International said that the firm remained committed to improved audit quality, and that it would carefully study the report to see how it could best address the issues.Representatives of the other large accounting firms either did not respond to requests for comment or declined to comment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Thailand, Some Foresee a Coup by Legal Means", "Date": "2014-03-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBANGKOK \u2014 Five months of protests in Bangkok have snarled traffic, scared away tourists and deflated the Thai economy, but the thousands of protesters who have regularly descended onto the streets have failed to unseat the government or any of its top officials.That may change in the coming weeks, as focus shifts from the protesters\u2019 encampment in the heart of Bangkok to the courts and government agencies that have handed down a series of decisions favorable to the protest movement.Although nominally independent, a number of the judges and top officials in the agencies handling cases against Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra\u2019s government have had longstanding antagonistic relationships with Ms. Yingluck and her party.\u201cIt no longer makes sense to attempt to explain the current political situation in Thailand by relying on legal principles,\u201d Verapat Pariyawong, a lawyer and commentator, said in a Facebook posting. \u201cThe current situation is more or less a phenomenon of raw politics whereby the rule of law is conveniently stretched and stripped to fit a political goal.\u201dOn Monday, Ms. Yingluck appeared briefly before the National Anti-Corruption Commission, which is pursuing a case against her on the grounds that she did nothing to stop alleged corruption in a rice subsidy program. If the commission finds that there is a prima facie case, she will be suspended as prime minister, a decision that could come within weeks.Wicha Mahakhun, the member of the commission who is charged with handling the case, has sparred with Ms. Yingluck\u2019s party before. He was appointed by the military in 2007 to rewrite the Constitution after the overthrow of Ms. Yingluck\u2019s brother Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted as prime minister in a 2006 coup d'\u00e9tat.The new Constitution was intended to blunt the governing party\u2019s electoral power in part by making half of the Senate appointed by judges and the heads of agencies, instead of directly elected.\u201cWe all know elections are evil,\u201d Mr. Wicha said at the time, arguing that power must be transferred into the hands of judges rather than elected representatives, who he said had caused the country to \u201ccollapse.\u201d\u201cPeople, especially academics who want to see the Constitution lead to genuine democracy, are na\u00efve,\u201d he said.Three current judges of the Constitutional Court, which has repeatedly ruled against the government in recent months, were also members of the post-coup commission to rewrite the Constitution.This power struggle between Ms. Yingluck \u2014 whose Pheu Thai party retains strong support among voters in the hinterland \u2014 and judges and agencies in Bangkok that want to blunt what they see as a destructive populist movement that encroaches on their power has been a central undercurrent of the five months of political stalemate.The prospect that courts and agencies will remove Ms. Yingluck, and potentially her entire cabinet, from power is being described in Thailand as a judicial coup.Some protesters in recent months have pleaded for the army to step in \u2014 the military in Thailand has a long history of overthrowing governments \u2014 but analysts say the head of the army appears to be wary both of bloodshed and of foreign reaction to a coup.\u201cWe used to suspend democracy by military coup,\u201d Sodsri Satayathum, a former election commissioner and another member of the 2007 committee charged with drafting a constitution, said at a seminar earlier this month. \u201cMilitary coups do not work anymore,\u201d she said.Likhit Dhiravegin, a prominent academic and frequent commentator on television, said last week that an \u201corchestrated\u201d judicial coup was already underway.\u201cThis is a coup conducted inside the system by using regulations,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t deny it \u2014 everybody knows about it, inside and outside the country.\u201dTensions escalated late last year, when the governing party passed a constitutional amendment restoring the Senate as a fully elected body.The Constitutional Court struck down the change, ruling in November that making the Senate fully elected was an attempt to \u201coverthrow\u201d democracy, a decision that has been criticized by constitutional scholars.The Constitutional Court has also struck down an ambitious and costly infrastructure plan, partly because the judges ruled that high-speed trains, a major element of the plan, are not appropriate for Thailand. Critics say that is a judgment for legislators, not the courts.The activism of the courts has renewed a debate about double standards in Thai society. Government supporters point out that the leader of the protest movement, Suthep Thaugsuban, a former deputy prime minister, is wanted on murder charges for his role in a crackdown that left dozens of \u201cred shirts\u201d \u2014 supporters of Mr. Thaksin \u2014 dead in 2010. He has ignored numerous requests to appear in court.Government supporters also question the priorities of the National Anti-Corruption Commission. The rice subsidy case has swiftly been pursued when other cases that appear to be obvious examples of corruption have languished.In the case of the rice subsidy allegations, Ms. Yingluck said over the weekend that the proceedings appeared rushed.\u201cWe are wondering if we were treated as same as other persons holding political positions,\u201d she said.The National Anti-Corruption Commission sought to rebut that allegation Monday, saying that the investigation had been underway for nearly two years.Whether or not Ms. Yingluck was guilty of \u201cneglect of duty\u201d in the rice subsidy program, the case goes to the heart of the conflict between protesters and supporters of the governing party.The governing party defends the subsidy \u2014 the government buys rice from farmers at double the market price \u2014 as a way to lift rural incomes. But experts and even some prominent government supporters call it wasteful, very expensive and destructive to the country\u2019s rice industry.The government has accumulated debt totaling 695 billion baht, or roughly $21 billion, to finance the rice policy over the past two and a half years, according to a calculation by Nipon Poapongsakorn, a leading expert on the rice subsidy program. Some, but not nearly all, of the debt could be paid back by selling the government\u2019s estimated stockpile of around 15 million to 17 million tons of rice. But the government appears to be having difficulty selling rice at market prices, given questions over its quality and freshness.Relative to the size of their economies, the rice subsidies are costing Thailand four times more than the European Union\u2019s farm aid program: Thailand\u2019s rice subsidies cost the government at least 200 billion baht last year, equivalent to 1.7 percent of the country\u2019s total economic output. By comparison, Europe\u2019s Common Agricultural Policy, one of the world\u2019s most generous farm programs, cost the equivalent of less than half a percent of the European Union\u2019s economic output.Nattakorn Devakula, a television host who has been blistering in his criticism of the subsidy program, said the government \u201cneeds to be punished enough so that they realize that they cannot carry out the same rice scheme.\u201dBut he warned of a destructive backlash by government supporters if a so-called judicial coup is carried out.\u201cIt\u2019s not worth ruining democracy over this issue,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "From Pericles to Potami", "Date": "2014-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 A friend and colleague at my newspaper is leaving to run for the European Parliament on the ticket of Greece\u2019s main opposition party. The party, Syriza, has been leading in most polls in the run-up to the May 25 election, but there is no guarantee that my colleague will be elected. Yet, in his mid-50s, he is making the leap. There is nothing strange in this \u2014 as old hacks used to say, journalism is a great profession if you get out in time \u2014 but my colleague\u2019s decision reflects something significant: The economic crisis of the past four years is opening the way, after decades of stagnation, for radical change in Greek politics. New people \u2014 from business, sports, academia and various professions \u2014 are entering politics; new parties are pushing for a place in a field where for generations two parties and a handful of political dynasties controlled developments.There are serious issues to consider when a widely recognized journalist crosses into politics. Had his politics colored his views as a journalist? Did his journalism help open the way to a new career? In these elections, all parties are fielding a large number of novice politicians from across the social and professional spectrum as they try to gain credibility among voters made cynical by the crisis. Are they exploiting their \u201cbrand recognition\u201d rather than infusing their parties with new ideas? Beyond any window dressing, Greece\u2019s political system needs a radical overhaul, and this can occur only through the presence of talented people who have made their mark in other spheres. Participation is, after all, the cornerstone of democracy, during whose heady, turbulent early years in the fifth century B.C. \u2014 years of war, empire, magnificent architecture and the blossoming of the arts \u2014 the statesman Pericles stressed that every Athenian citizen had a duty to play a role in public affairs. \u201cWe are unique in that we consider any man who takes no part in these not just uninvolved but useless,\u201d he declared. In Roman times, however, the patron-client system made politics a profession and votes a commodity to be exchanged for favors.And since the founding of the modern Greek state nearly two centuries ago, Pericles\u2019s exhortation has been remembered only in speeches on national holidays. Politics has been dominated by a professional caste whose credibility depended on keeping voters happy. This led to rising demands by interest groups at the expense of the whole society. After the collapse of the military dictatorship in 1974, families that had been powerful before the junta returned to center stage in Greece\u2019s politics \u2014 while a few other powerful families played a leading role in the economy. Hardly anyone can miss the irony of the current government\u2019s being forced \u2014 under pressure from foreign creditors \u2014 to dismantle the system of permanent public-sector jobs that were the ultimate goal of voters and their patrons under the old political dispensation. The years of prosperity and easy credit after Greece joined the European Union had turbocharged the old system, allowing political parties to try to outdo one another with promises to the electorate, until this mentality bankrupted Greece. In those years of plenty, two big parties \u2014 the center-right New Democracy and the center-left Pasok \u2014 alternated in power. Together, they would routinely get about 80 percent of the vote. Borrowed prosperity, combined with the promise of power, allowed them to control any dissent within their ranks, forcing newcomers to either toe the line or join one of the smaller parties that had no hope of governing. The collapse of the country\u2019s finances, the international bailout and the harsh austerity that was imposed in 2010 discredited New Democracy and Pasok, and voters left in droves. The parties remain in power only because, after years of antagonism, they formed a coalition. But since the last national elections, in 2012, fringe parties across the political spectrum have picked up voters and vitality as Greeks sought alternatives. (After the 2009 elections, there were four parties in Parliament; in 2012, they became seven.) Potami (The River), founded only in late April by Stavros Theodorakis, another former journalist, is getting about 10 percent in opinion polls, making it the third largest party, after New Democracy and Syriza. \u201cEvery day, every night,\u201d Mr. Theodorakis wrote in his manifesto, people he meets ask him, \u201c\u2018What are we to do?\u2019 Everyone is at a dead end. Even those who had decided whom they would vote for, after a brief chat would ask themselves, \u2018Do we have an alternative?\u201d\u2019Even before people heard about Potami\u2019s pro-European Union, centrist policies, they were keen to give it a try \u2014 simply on the basis of its founder\u2019s likable television persona and a vague idea of what he thought. Mr. Theodorakis has been using social media to encourage citizens to get involved by suggesting candidates for the European Parliament, proposing policies and making small donations. (The party is based in an apartment in Athens and does not have offices around the country \u2014 unlike \u201ctraditional\u201d parties, hugely expensive political machines that need millions of euros to function.) The Internet allows citizens to once again play a role, in a sense re-establishing the direct relationship between citizens and government that was ancient Athens\u2019s achievement. No one seems to have answers to the problems that most countries face. How do we assure prosperity when it leads to debt? How do we impose austerity when this stokes the anger and despair that empower populist forces that can derail both the economy and democracy? How do we protect local production and jobs in a global economy? Political systems, ideologies and economic theories are all struggling or inadequate. Europe is changing. The crisis is breaking down old formations, leading to uncertainty and danger. But this ferment also opens the way for those who feel that now, through public service, they can be not only involved but useful.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Under Hoof, Foot and Tire", "Date": "2014-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreetscapesStone-block paving and a flagstone crosswalk at Steam Ship Row, Bowling Green, 1896.How about a real \u201cStreetscapes\u201d \u2014 not about buildings, but the streets themselves? The roadways of New York have long been the subject of turf battles among cars, horses, bikes and pedestrians. But the history of what they\u2019re fighting over is multilayered \u2014 literally. Stone Street, in Lower Manhattan, is the first known paved street in New York. References appear to paving there in the 17th century, when it was laid with real cobbles \u2014 small stones rounded by water. By the 19th century, city streets were a hodgepodge of materials. Macadam and gravel surfaces were an advance over raw earth, but tended to break down under heavy use, generated dust and were difficult to clean. Granite blocks were more easily cleaned, and politicians loved paving streets with them, which required the employment of armies of workers, a helpful situation at election time. In the 1850s, some streets accommodated horsecar lines, which had a stone-block strip between the rails for the horses to travel on. The rails interfered with crosstown traffic, increasing pressure to pave the entire street bed with blocks.Crosswalks were introduced with large flagstone paths laid at the intersections. These were not attempts to restrict pedestrians to any one part of the street, as we think of them now, but rather a convenience to help them cross without sinking up to their ankles in muck. Although block-paved streets were generally thought of as an improvement, The New York Times predicted in 1868 that \u201cthe humane tendencies of the age and its economies will soon succeed in expelling stone block pavements\u201d from the city. The blocks often came loose, and had a rough surface that trapped dirt and manure. Of this there was plenty, in 1870 well over half a million cartloads a year on New York streets. The Times came out in favor of wooden blocks, laid in squares with the end grain exposed, although naysayers pointed out that wood absorbed horse urine and could become slippery. It was sometimes possible to please different groups with different kinds of pavement. Jeremy Woodoff, a historic preservationist who works at the New York City Department of Design and Construction, has done extensive research on paving in New York. He says that the central part of Eastern Parkway, a pleasure drive for carriage traffic, had a macadam or gravel surface, but service roads had granite blocks to accommodate wagons and other heavy traffic. Asphalt paving was perceived as a dream material, smooth, easy to clean and quieter than block when it came to the clop-clop of hooves. It arrived after the Civil War, first from natural deposits in Trinidad, and later manufactured, which improved the quality and lowered the price. Asphalt quickly gained adherents, including trucking companies and bicyclists. (I was clipped in Dumbo last weekend by a lady who rode her bicycle on the sidewalk to avoid a section of block pavement. At least I assume she was a lady.) Health reformers concerned about infections and lung diseases spread by manure dust, also lobbied for asphalt, as it was easily cleaned.But asphalt had its detractors. Clay McShane has written widely on pavement and transit systems and in his book, \u201cDown the Asphalt Path: America Adopts the Automobile,\u201d recounts the story of a Brooklyn residential neighborhood that resisted the smooth new surface in the 1890s: It would mean \u201cthe lives of our children would be in constant danger from reckless riders and drivers.\u201d The residents had a point: Asphalt was an opening wedge for the automobile takeover of New York City streets, and its high speeds completely usurped what had been a public space for all kinds of activities. By the 1890s health reformers were upset about infections and lung diseases spread by the dried manure dust, and also lobbied for streets more easily cleaned. Cost was a factor: In 1898 The World reported that granite block cost $1.52 per square yard, while asphalt was $1.90 per square yard. By 1907 The Real Estate Record and Guide counted more than 400 miles of pavement in Manhattan, with asphalt on the inside track at 248 miles. There were also 90 miles of granite, along with macadam and wood block. Fragments of the old streets survive. At Broadway and Conway Street in Brooklyn \u2014 one of Mr. Woodoff\u2019s favorites \u2014 large, failing patches of asphalt reveal some rare flagstone crosswalks. The center of the intersection has a mesmerizing diagonal setting of granite blocks with a rich, polished appearance in a range of earth tones, like a display in a geology shop. Manhole covers and a rail line sunk into the surface complete the delicious tableau. Dumbo has quite a few granite-block streets, but many of the blocks are newly laid, and have the unfriendly but efficient surface of the original pavement, and none of the romance of the worn blocks that used to be common throughout the district. For this you must venture over to Adams Street, right next to the Manhattan Bridge. The worn, gemlike granite blocks rise and tumble around manhole covers and old rail lines, and peep out from underneath crumbling asphalt layers that once concealed them. Compared with areas that have been washed by the restorer\u2019s brush, it is like the difference between Muzak and a Chopin sonata. Email: streetscapes@nytimes.com Advertisement"}

Alavi, a sanctions law specialist at Akrivis, a Washington-based international law firm that has fielded numerous inquiries about doing business with Iran since the temporary accord took effect. Though the accord may have served as a \u201cteaser\u201d to Iran, he said in a telephone interview, foreign business interest has remained extremely limited.\u201cIs a bank in Germany going to revamp its compliance policies when the law could be changed and reverted in six months?\u201d he said. \u201cI think what we\u2019ve seen is that it\u2019s not created that breakthrough. Nobody is making that substantial step for increased economic ties between Iran and the rest of the world.\u201dScott M. Flicker, a partner at Paul Hastings, a Washington-based law firm that specializes in sanctions litigation, said the nature of the American sanctions in particular had dissuaded many businesses from bothering with Iran, even temporarily.What the Iranians and others are learning, Mr. Flicker said, is that \u201cat the end of the day, the real hammer is the U.S. financial system.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nobody who wants to touch an Iranian financial transaction unless they have a foursquare O.K.\u201d from the assets control office.In return, the West, which has never trusted Iran\u2019s claims of peaceful nuclear intent, eased some of the onerous sanctions imposed in recent years, including granting access, in staggered amounts, to $4.2 billion of the approximately $100 billion of Iranian money impounded in foreign banks. The sanctions relief also allowed deals in some industries, including petrochemicals and automaking, that had been in an economic malaise, caused partly by Iran\u2019s isolation.Under the temporary nuclear accord, all such work, including payments, must be completed by the July 20 deadline.But many sanctions law experts say the country is still basically hamstrung economically \u2014 excluded from the global financial networks that are a critical component of international business transactions.\u201cA lot of things don\u2019t happen because banks won\u2019t be bothered,\u201d Mr. Alavi said.Advocates of strong sanctions against Iran have argued that even the modest relief afforded by the six-month deal has been counterproductive, signaling what Iran perceives to be a breach in Western resolve.Some contend that Iran is openly defying the Obama administration\u2019s declaration that Iranian oil exports, under the temporary accord, are limited to about one million barrels a day.Data released on Friday by the International Energy Agency, a group of oil-importing countries including the United States, showed that Iran exported 1.65 million barrels a day in February, the highest in 20 months, and that March exports also exceeded one million barrels a day.The administration has contended that when averaged over six months, Iran\u2019s oil exports will be closer to one million barrels a day.\u201cThis enhances Iranian nuclear negotiating leverage and makes it more difficult to conclude a diplomatic deal that dismantles Iran\u2019s military-nuclear program and persuades Tehran to come clean on its past military-nuclear activities,\u201d he said.\u201cIn other words, there is one more meeting (May) in which no concrete news is O.K.,\u201d he said in an emailed analysis of the talks. \u201cAfter that, no news becomes worrisome.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fewer U.S. Graduates Opt for College After High School", "Date": "2014-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ChartsTHE proportion of new American high school graduates who go on to college \u2014 a figure that rose regularly for decades \u2014 now appears to be declining.Last October, just 65.9 percent of people who had graduated from high school the previous spring had enrolled in college, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said this week. That was down from 66.2 percent the previous year and was the lowest figure in a decade. The high point came in 2009, when 70.1 percent of new graduates had gone on to college.\u201cFalling college enrollment indicates that upward mobility may become more difficult for working-class and disadvantaged high school graduates,\u201d said Heidi Shierholz, an economist with the Economic Policy Institute in Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s another part of the long-term scarring process of the Great Recession that has been partly hidden.\u201d She said that might reflect poorer employment prospects for parents and students who would have worked their way through college a few years ago, and added that many parents in the past paid for college by refinancing mortgages, an alternative no longer available to many families.At the same time, there were some encouraging signs in the report, which is released annually. The bureau reported that 51 percent of the high school graduates who did not go on to college had jobs by October, and that 74 percent were in the labor force, meaning they either were employed or were looking for work. Those figures may not sound high, but they are up from the last couple of years, and may be an indication that the labor market has improved at least a little.On the other hand, only 43 percent of new high school dropouts were part of the labor force in October, a figure that was the lowest for the last 20 years, the period for which the figures are available. But there was an increase in the proportion of new high school dropouts who had jobs, to 31 percent from 24 percent in 2012, which could be another indication of an improving economy.The figures are volatile from year to year, partly because they come from the bureau\u2019s household survey, in which 60,000 households are asked each month about the employment status of all members of the household who are 16 years of age or older. Each October, additional questions are asked of the respondents to produce this report, which was not published until this week as the bureau sought to make sure it had made appropriate adjustments for revised population estimates.Most of those households have no one who recently left school, and as a result there can be large errors. The bureau said the estimated 65.9 percent figure for high school graduates who went on to college could be off by as much as 2.4 percentage points in either direction. The margins of error for the enrollment estimates of 68.4 percent for young women, and 63.5 percent for young men, were even larger.Still, there seems to be little doubt that the long-term trend of more and more high school graduates going to college has halted, if not reversed. As recently as 1976, the enrollment figure was below 50 percent. It rose to 69 percent by 2005, and since then has fluctuated. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Euro-Zone Fiscal Colonialism", "Date": "2014-04-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorLONDON \u2014 Last Tuesday, the European Parliament finally approved a mechanism for restructuring and closing down failed banks across the euro zone. But the system, which will not be established until 2015, is unworkably complex and leaves a veto power with national governments. Six years after the financial crisis began, Europe has still not resolved its banking mess.Despite the hoopla in bubbly financial markets, the crisis continues to inflict grave hardship. Zombie banks are still curbing credit to businesses in Southern Europe. Millions of people in sickly economies have lost their jobs or must scrape by on slashed wages, while they struggle with huge debts and pay higher taxes for worse public services. Many have lost that most precious commodity: hope for a brighter future.Social tensions within countries are multiplying, as are political frictions between them. Support for the European Union is at an all-time low. Extremist parties are set to advance in European Parliament elections next month.The primary cause of the crisis was the reckless lending of German and French banks (both directly and through local banks) to Spanish and Irish homeowners, Portuguese consumers and the Greek government. But by insisting that Greek, Irish, Portuguese and Spanish taxpayers pay in full for those banks\u2019 mistakes, Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s government and its handmaidens in Brussels have systematically privileged the interests of German and French banks over those of euro zone citizens.Germany, in particular, remains in denial about its banks\u2019 bad loans. Loath to cede control over its stricken banks, Berlin has used its clout to eviscerate the euro zone\u2019s banking union. Worse, the German government, together with the European Commission and the European Central Bank, wrongly blamed the euro zone crisis on fiscal profligacy across Southern Europe. This self-serving misdiagnosis has inflicted lasting economic and political damage.The massive austerity that Europe\u2019s leaders enforced has caused deep recessions and soaring unemployment, while perversely destabilizing public finances. In Greece, the economy has shrunk by a quarter and the incomes of the poor by one-third; six in 10 young people are unemployed. By some measures, this is a worse slump than Germany suffered in the 1930s. In my former post, as an economic adviser to the president of the European Commission, I argued against such measures, but to little avail. When European policy makers\u2019 mistakes sparked a bond-market panic that brought the euro zone to the brink of collapse, their response was still more austerity. Only in the summer of 2012 did the European Central Bank finally quell the panic.Thanks to the central bank\u2019s action and an easing of austerity, euro zone economies have stabilized. Berlin and Brussels claim \u2014 wrongly \u2014 that their handling of the crisis has been vindicated.The bungled decision to bail out German and French banks by lending to an insolvent Greece in May 2010, rather than writing down its debts, scarred the euro zone. It violated the legal basis on which the euro was formed: that a government in difficulty should not be bailed out by its peers.Because Ms. Merkel agreed to breach this rule, Germany\u2019s taxpayers feared that they were on the hook for Southern Europe\u2019s debts. Ms. Merkel therefore demanded greater control over other countries\u2019 budgetary decisions \u2014 and the European Commission was only too delighted to grab new powers. Countries that share a currency and an interest rate need greater fiscal flexibility, not less, but the commission now applies a fiscal straitjacket \u2014 including the right to demand that a government rewrite its budget before presenting it to parliament. This centralization of fiscal powers is not just economically dangerous; it is also politically poisonous. When voters in a member country have turfed out their government, as they have done at almost every election since the crisis, Olli Rehn, the commission\u2019s vice president and fiscal enforcer (currently on temporary leave), has popped up on television to insist that the incoming government stick to the old one\u2019s failed policies. That a remote, unelected and scarcely accountable official in Brussels should deny voters legitimate choices about tax and spending decisions is undemocratic and alienates people from the European Union.A crisis that could have united Europe in a joint effort to curb the mighty banks has instead divided the euro zone into creditor nations and debtor ones, with banks\u2019 bad loans becoming intergovernmental obligations. European Union institutions have become instruments for creditors to impose their will on debtors, subordinating Europe\u2019s southern \u201cperiphery\u201d to the northern \u201ccore\u201d in a quasi-colonial relationship. Berlin and Brussels now have a vested interest to entrench this system rather than cede power and admit to mistakes.To get out of this mess, the euro zone needs a change of policies and institutions. Banks need to be restructured and unbearable debts written down. More investment is needed, along with bold reforms to boost productivity.The \u201cno bailout\u201d rule should also be restored. Elected national governments must have much greater flexibility to tax and spend as they please, constrained by markets\u2019 willingness to lend to them and ultimately by the possibility of default. A mechanism for the orderly restructuring of sovereign debt should be established for that purpose.To avoid future panics, the European Central Bank\u2019s role as a lender of last resort to solvent governments should be enshrined. The mechanism for restructuring failed banks also needs to be properly independent.In the long term, a euro zone treasury accountable to both European and national legislators should be created, with limited tax-raising and borrowing powers. To persist with current policies and institutions will corrode support for the European Union and risks destroying it. We need a European Spring of economic and political renewal.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Unsettling Thing About Ellen", "Date": "2014-04-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe kitchen of the 1963 Buff & Hensman house in Beverly Hills that Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi bought in 2007. The purchase of the home was the beginning of a flurry of buying and selling that led one real estate blog to call Ms. DeGeneres a \u201cproperty hound.\u201d\u00a0Oh, to be Ellen DeGeneres\u2019s decorator. Or her architect. Or her real estate agent. Or even her movers. When the economy is still sputtering and the housing market hasn\u2019t fully recovered, these are boom jobs.In the last few years, the comedian and talk show host has been in home-renovation overdrive, buying and redoing more than half a dozen homes in Southern California. Built by renowned architects and filled with fine art and vintage Danish and French d\u00e9cor, many of the houses reveal a design sensibility that is more Architectural Digest than HGTV. Although Ms. DeGeneres can do low as well as high: This week she announced \u201cEllen\u2019s Design Challenge,\u201d a six-episode design show to air next year on that network in which contestants will compete to build furniture.\u00a0\u201cI somehow manage to find out what\u2019s on the market everywhere,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople come to me. I like looking whether I\u2019m buying or not. I love real estate.\u201dWaving away the notion that she is a calculating house flipper, Ms. DeGeneres added: \u201cI\u2019ve never bought to sell. I always say: \u2018This is it. I\u2019m never moving.\u2019 People laugh at me now.\u201d Hollywood is a town filled with boldface architecture buffs. Diane Keaton has bought and sold several historic properties, including a home designed by Wallace Neff and two built by Lloyd Wright. The actress Kelly Lynch is a well-known aficionado of midcentury design and owns homes by John Lautner and Richard Neutra. And Brad Pitt is so enamored of the craft he teamed up with Frank Gehry to build affordable housing in New Orleans and tried his hand at making furniture. But Ms. DeGeneres, 56, has taken her passion for architecture and design to another level. The homes she has purchased and renovated with her wife, the actress Portia de Rossi, 41, are wildly diverse in style, period and setting, and with each project her tastes have become more sophisticated, her ambitions grander. It was in 2007 that her real estate activity seemed to really kick into high gear. There was the house in Beverly Hills, built in 1963 by the celebrated firm Buff & Hensman for the actor Laurence Harvey. Ms. DeGeneres and Ms. de Rossi renovated the main structure and bought two adjoining properties, creating a three-acre compound with two guesthouses, an underground parking garage, a pool, a fitness center and a garden with a koi pond. That project was followed two years later by a 26-acre ranch in Thousand Oaks, Calif. Built in the 1920s for the actor William Powell, the estate had become a shabby equestrian facility; under Ms. DeGeneres\u2019s enthusiastic direction, the main house was redone, a yoga pavilion and tennis court were added, and the property\u2019s eight cabins were decorated in various styles, brimming with rare French fixtures or vintage Danish furniture. Then, in quick succession, she bought a pied-\u00e0-terre in Beverly Hills; a home in the ultrachic Trousdale Estates neighborhood that was designed by Hal Levitt and had been photographed by Steven Meisel for a Versace campaign; and a 1960s Malibu beach house owned by Mr. Pitt. Ms. DeGeneres no longer owns any of those homes. In some cases, she sold them soon after renovations were completed and a spread ran in Architectural Digest or another shelter magazine \u2014 the celebrity renovator\u2019s equivalent of a trophy pelt. In the case of the Malibu beach house, the scent of new carpet hadn\u2019t disappeared before Ms. DeGeneres relisted and sold the place, seven months after she bought it. Tommy Clements, a partner in Clements Design, a Los Angeles firm that has worked on several projects for Ms. DeGeneres, including the Hal Levitt house, said her serial house-jumping suggests not a restless spirit but a creative one. \u201cShe\u2019s constantly looking to be challenged,\u201d Mr. Clements said. \u201cShe\u2019s constantly looking for that creative process because it\u2019s something she enjoys doing.\u201d Jane Hallworth, another Los Angeles designer and gallery owner who has worked for the comedian, said Ms. DeGeneres enjoys getting creative people to work together. \u201cShe brings us in and has these different collaborations,\u201d Ms. Hallworth said. \u201cIn the end, each house gets better and better.\u201dMs. DeGeneres\u2019s latest home may be her crowning jewel. In January, she paid $40 million for the Brody House, built in 1949 for Sidney and Frances Brody, wealthy art collectors who commissioned a huge Matisse ceramic for the enclosed courtyard. Situated on two and a half acres in the lush Los Angeles neighborhood Holmby Hills, the house represents the coming together of a trifecta of legendary design talent: A. Quincy Jones, a noted midcentury architect whose reputation has soared in recent years; the celebrity interior designer William Haines; and the landscape architect Garrett Eckbo, who designed the grounds, with an expansive lawn and elegant coral trees that resemble massive bonsai plants. In the view of Linda Dishman, executive director of the Los Angeles Conservancy, the Brody House is one of the top five homes in the city. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing house,\u201d said Ms. Dishman, who toured its glass-walled bedrooms and living spaces before Ms. DeGeneres bought it. \u201cWhat makes it so amazing is the architecture \u2014 it\u2019s about volume and space \u2014 and the way it\u2019s sited on the lot,\u201d she said. \u201cYou see hills. You see the San Gabriel Mountains. You feel like you\u2019re in a very special place in Los Angeles.\u201dThe home\u2019s new owner couldn\u2019t agree more. \u201cThe light quality is incredible,\u201d Ms. DeGeneres said. \u201cEven in the hallways. Jones put in skylights so there are no dark rooms.\u201dShe added, \u201cWe feel like custodians to an important piece of architecture.\u201d Those who have worked with her on previous homes describe Ms. DeGeneres as someone who is curious and decisive, and always on the lookout for good design. Early on, she began collecting Latin American and African tribal art. More recently, she has acquired pieces by 20th-century French designers like Charlotte Perriand and Serge Mouille. Ray Azoulay, the owner of Obsolete, one of the many furniture and art galleries in Los Angeles where Ms. DeGeneres has shopped, said she often calls or comes in herself. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re getting a team of assistants,\u201d Mr. Azoulay said. \u201cAfter a while I thought: Aren\u2019t you busy? Don\u2019t you have shows you\u2019re doing?\u201d But unlike many celebrities, Ms. DeGeneres doesn\u2019t hire star decorators. She works with longtime associates and friends, or people those trusted advisers recommend. One of her frequent collaborators is Cliff Fong, a former fashion designer who runs the Los Angeles design studio Matt Blacke. \u201cI\u2019ve done about 15 homes for her,\u201d Mr. Fong said. Their partnership dates back to when Ms. DeGeneres was a stand-up comedian on tour and asked him to catsit: \u201cShe said, \u2018And while you\u2019re there, can you fix up the house?\u2019 I bought her a Hans Wegner chair, a Jean Prouv\u00e9 chair.\u201dMr. Fong remembered the way Ms. DeGeneres decorated one early home, a California bungalow off Mulholland Drive. \u201cThe d\u00e9cor was a mixture of earthy American antiques,\u201d Mr. Fong said. \u201cBut nothing mumsy or Colonial. More simple, beautiful, primitive forms.\u201dEarly on, Mr. Fong said, there was \u201ca little more reliance on my take on something.\u201d But after so many high-end renovations, Ms. DeGeneres now appears confident in her own tastes and abilities, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t remember the last time I took charge on a project.\u201d Ms. DeGeneres described her real-estate-and-renovating adventures over the last 25 years as \u201can education.\u201d Her interest in design started long before her show-business career. \u201cI think I wanted to be an interior designer when I was 13,\u201d she said. \u201cI remember one specific moment in this one house. Setting up my bedroom, wanting to do it in a certain way.\u201dHer family was lower middle class and moved often, always renting, though her parents would drive around her native Louisiana looking at homes. \u201cIt was a lot of Spanish homes, too,\u201d Ms. DeGeneres recalled. \u201cAs a kid you don\u2019t know finances. Later, I realized we could never have afforded them. And we were never going to own them.\u201dShe bought her first place \u2014 a Spanish-style home in West Hollywood, near the Fred Segal store \u2014 for $300,000 around 1986, adding a deck and French windows, and making other small improvements. \u201cIt was on such an amateur level,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I saw that something could be made better.\u201dNext, she moved to a home in Laurel Canyon, where she redid the landscaping, sold it for a profit two years later and, again, as she put it, \u201cscaled up.\u201d Eventually, she said: \u201cI learned that furniture is art; that if you spend money on a couch, it can look pretty, but it can also be made by an important designer. I started shopping in a different way, and redoing homes and recognizing what a great home was.\u201d Now her homes have museum-quality d\u00e9cor: a rare Jean Prouv\u00e9 lamp from one of the designer\u2019s African commissions; a Jean Roy\u00e8re polar bear sofa; a Mies van der Rohe daybed. On the walls is art by Cy Twombly, Ed Ruscha and Jean-Michel Basquiat. As several people noted, Ms. DeGeneres views her things with the critical eye of a seasoned decorator. \u201cI don\u2019t think she necessarily has a sentimental attachment to a piece of furniture,\u201d Mr. Fong said. \u201cIt\u2019s more if it suits the house.\u201dThe same could be said of her houses. What looks from the outside like impulsive address jumping is sometimes simply a practical response to what suits Ms. DeGeneres\u2019s lifestyle. The Buff & Hensman compound was ideal because Ms. de Rossi\u2019s family lived for a while in one of the guesthouses, Ms. DeGeneres said. But after a few years, the couple realized \u201cwe didn\u2019t need all those houses. It works for Ryan because he has a studio, meetings.\u201d (Ryan Seacrest bought the place two years ago for $37.5 million.)As for the Malibu beach house, the couple also owned the horse ranch at the same time \u2014 and \u201cI only ever have a weekend; that\u2019s all the free time I have,\u201d Ms. DeGeneres said. She also realized that while they might own a house perched on a cliff above the ocean, she and Ms. de Rossi couldn\u2019t walk along the beach without being hounded by paparazzi. \u201cI would just stare at it\u201d from the window, Ms. DeGeneres said, a metaphor for modern celebrity if there ever was one. They sold the beach house to a friend, and now visit instead. These days, Ms. DeGeneres\u2019s real estate portfolio (and her nesting energy) is concentrated on two main properties: a stone Italian farmhouse in Montecito, Calif., and the Brody House. The farmhouse, known as Saladino Villa after its previous owner, the interior designer John Saladino, is actually a 10,500-square-foot estate built in 1929 on 13 acres planted with eucalyptus, cypress and olive trees. Ms. DeGeneres and Ms. de Rossi bought the property last year for $26 million.Mr. Clements, the interior designer, said his firm is working with Ms. DeGeneres and the architect Howard Backen to build a guesthouse there \u2014 something \u201cmore contemporary in style, maybe incorporating steel-and-glass windows, mixed with corrugated metal.\u201dBefore Saladino Villa hit the market, Ms. DeGeneres said, she had visited and \u201cknew I wanted to live in it.\u201d She had a different first impression of the Brody House, in 2010, when it was available for the first time in 60 years after Ms. Brody\u2019s death. Ms. DeGeneres was \u201cblown away,\u201d but wary of the considerable work required.\u201cAs much as I love architecture,\u201d she said, \u201cI don\u2019t appreciate redoing the guts of a home. People ask why I don\u2019t build a home from scratch. I can\u2019t imagine anything more stressful.\u201dWhen the Brody House was available again last year, after extensive renovations, Ms. DeGeneres was ready to move, she said. But \u201cPortia wasn\u2019t sure it was right for us. Then she quickly changed her mind.\u201d The couple scooped up the property before it officially hit the market. The $40 million they paid may turn out to be a bargain, given the home\u2019s reputation and the soaring real estate values in the city\u2019s rarefied neighborhoods. If ever there was a house that could keep Ms. DeGeneres and Ms. de Rossi from moving again, this may be it. Ms. Hallworth, the designer and gallerist who was brought in to advise on the renovation, said she doesn\u2019t see how the couple could possibly scale up from here. \u201cIt seems like all of those other houses were steppingstones to the Brody House,\u201d she said. \u201cIn each one they acquired a few beautiful pieces, and now the Brody House has an unparalleled collection of furniture and art.\u201dAsked if she had finally arrived at a permanent home, Ms. DeGeneres responded affirmatively \u2014 as she has in the past. \u201cMy answer is yes,\u201d she said. \u201cI think there\u2019s nowhere to go from here. It\u2019s the best house I\u2019ve ever lived in.\u201d She added, perhaps rhetorically, \u201cWhere would I go?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stretching the Debt in Europe", "Date": "2014-04-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInside EuropePARIS \u2014 Call it the Great Stretch.Two years ago, Greece\u2019s debt crisis almost brought the euro zone crashing down.Now the country\u2019s European partners are preparing to ease Athens\u2019s debt burden not by writing off their loans but by extending maturities to 50 years from 30 and further cutting some interest rates, European Union officials say.Last week Greece made a successful, if artificially engineered, return to the long-term capital markets for the first time since its bailout in 2010, and just two years after imposing heavy losses on its private creditors.But with its economy shattered, the country is still a long way from being able to fund itself unassisted in the market. The International Monetary Fund says Greece is likely to need further financial help from the euro zone over the next two years.Last week, Greece sold 3 billion euros, or $4.2 billion, in five-year bonds at a yield of 4.95 percent. One reason the sale went so smoothly was that investors are widely anticipating official debt relief.\u201cThat has been quite substantially priced in, and the market is also expecting Greece to be quickly upgraded by the credit rating agencies,\u201d said Alessandro Giansanti, senior rate strategist at ING bank in Amsterdam.\u201cIn a second stage, the market is also expecting a reduction in principal on official debt\u201d and no write-down of private-sector debt in the coming years, he added.Whether such expectations are fully realized will become clear only later this year, when negotiations start with the euro zone and the I.M.F. on Greece\u2019s longer-term funding, and the end of its wrenching bailout program.But European Union leaders share an interest in helping Prime Minister Antonis Samaras\u2019s shaky coalition cling to office rather than seeing the leftist anti-bailout firebrand Alexis Tsipras sweep to power and demand a massive write-off of debts.North European creditor states strongly oppose outright debt forgiveness, which critics say would unfairly reward past Greek mismanagement. Parliaments and euro-skeptics might rebel or challenge any write-off in court.But extending the maturities and cutting the borrowing cost has already been done once \u2014 the loans were originally granted for five years at a punitive interest rate \u2014 and it is less politically explosive in Germany, the Netherlands and Finland.It is a government version of the \u201cextend and pretend\u201d behavior of private lenders, who keep bad loans on their books, hoping something will turn up, rather than writing down losses.\u201cThis kind of restructuring of official sector debt has already quietly been happening,\u201d said Elena Daly, principal at EM Consult, a sovereign debt consulting firm based in Paris. \u201cStretching out the official sector loans and reducing their interest rates opens a window for new private sector lending without fear of competing with existing official sector creditors when the time comes for repayment.\u201dA country\u2019s debt profile \u2014 the timeline of future repayment or refinancing obligations \u2014 is more important to investors than the absolute size of its debt.Asked what the European authorities planned to do about the mountains of official debt owed by Greece, Ireland and Portugal, a senior European Union policy maker replied with a riddle:Who was Britain\u2019s prime minister, he asked, when it paid off its World War II lend-lease debt to the United States? The answer is Tony Blair in 2006, more than 60 years after the war ended. Indeed, Britain still has some outstanding debt to Washington from World War I, a century after that conflict began.After two bailouts from the European Union and the I.M.F. worth a total of \u20ac240 billion and a \u201cvoluntary\u201d write-down of privately held bonds, Greece has a public debt equivalent to 175 percent of its national output, far beyond what the I.M.F. considers sustainable.Gross domestic product has slumped by 25 percent, wages and pensions have been cut sharply, and unemployment stands at nearly 27 percent, including more than half of all young people.With anemic growth just starting to return, there is scant prospect of reducing the debt to the targets set by international lenders of 124 percent of gross domestic product in 2020 and 110 percent in 2022. Interest payments swallow nearly 5 percent of Greece\u2019s G.D.P., twice as much as in France. Ireland and Portugal, which also received bailouts, are also paying between 4.5 percent and 5 percent of G.D.P. in debt service.Italy, which did not take a bailout but has the euro zone\u2019s highest debt ratio after Greece, at 132 percent, pays 5.3 percent of G.D.P. in interest payments \u2014 a huge burden.It would require improbable economic growth rates for many years to bring those debt numbers down substantially, forcing governments to run high primary budget surpluses before debt service that crowd out public investment. Trying to revive an economy while meeting that level of debt service is like accelerating with the brakes on.Once the European Union statistics office confirms in the coming weeks that Greece has achieved a primary budget surplus before debt service costs, the road to official debt relief should be open.Ironically, last week\u2019s dabble in the bond market may make it harder for Athens to win a debt write-off that would hasten its recovery. With foreign investors piling into the euro zone as a relative safe haven compared with emerging markets, the risk premium on weaker European countries\u2019 sovereign debt over benchmark German bonds has fallen almost to precrisis levels.German officials are already saying there is no urgent need for debt relief. As throughout the euro zone crisis, once the market heat is off, Berlin is reluctant to act.European Union officials say the Great Stretch may not be extended beyond Greece to Ireland, which has already returned to market funding, or Portugal, which is expected to exit its bailout program next month without requesting further official assistance.Yet it would make sense to grant the same terms to them, too, to speed their recovery and narrow Europe\u2019s politically dangerous north-south divide.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Factory Activity Picks Up as Economy Recovers From Severe Winter", "Date": "2014-04-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Factory activity rose in March, data released on Tuesday showed, with production posting its biggest increase since the recession ended, in the latest indication that the economy was regaining its footing after a brutal winter.An unusually cold and snowy winter weighed on economic activity early in the year and signs of a pickup should bolster hopes of a strong rebound in growth in the second quarter.\u201cWinter is over,\u201d said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. \u201cThe economy is looking more positive today and overall business conditions continue to show improvement.\u201dThe Institute for Supply Management said on Tuesday that its index of national factory activity rose to 53.7 last month, from a reading of 53.2 in February.Though the increase was below economists\u2019 consensus forecast for a 54.0 reading, March was the second month of gains. Readings above 50 indicate expansion in the sector, which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy.Factory activity was buoyed by a 7.7 percentage point rebound in the production index after it showed contraction in February. The increase was the largest since June 2009, just as the recession was ending.The forward-looking new orders index rose to 55.1, from 54.5 in February.There was also a surge in order backlogs and export orders. Fourteen of the 18 manufacturing industries reported growth.\u201cThe broad-based nature of the gains among industries underscores the extent of the rebound as the sector continues to dig itself out of the weather-induced slump earlier this year,\u201d said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities. \u201cIt offers an upbeat assessment on manufacturing.\u201dEven as the sector begins to break out of the cold spell, factory activity remains weaker than during the second half of last year. Warehouses are filled with huge stocks of unsold goods that accumulated in the second half of 2013, leaving businesses with little incentive to place large orders with manufacturers.The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s survey found a sharp drop in customers\u2019 inventories, though manufacturers\u2019 inventories were unchanged from February.A desire to reduce inventory and the harsh winter are expected to hold the economy to an annualized growth pace below 2 percent in the first quarter. That would be a step back from the fourth quarter\u2019s 2.6 percent rate.A separate factory indicator from the data firm Markit slipped in March, but stayed in positive territory, as ebbing overseas demand reduced orders.While manufacturing appears to be shaking off winter\u2019s chill, construction activity continued to be held back in February.The Commerce Department said construction spending edged up 0.1 percent after slipping 0.2 percent in January.Construction spending was restrained by a 0.8 percent drop in private residential construction projects, which was the largest fall since July.But a surge in spending on nonresidential construction, such as factories and power plants, lifted overall private outlays to their highest level since December 2008.\u201cGiven housing\u2019s recent disappointing numbers, this sector\u2019s cyclical turnaround comes at a good time,\u201d said Stephanie Karol, an economist at IHS Global Insight.\u201cReal construction spending should contract in the first quarter,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is an inauspicious beginning to 2014, but we expect conditions to improve later in the year.\u201dThe decline in private residential construction was led by a 1.1 percent drop in single-family home building.Public construction spending nudged up 0.1 percent in February, with a jump in federal outlays offsetting a fall in state and local government spending.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "From Boom to Rust, Lavish Projects Are Languishing in Brazil", "Date": "2014-04-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPAULISTANA, Brazil \u2014 Brazil plowed billions of dollars into building a railroad across arid backlands, only for the long-delayed project to fall prey to metal scavengers. Curvaceous new public buildings designed by the famed architect Oscar Niemeyer were abandoned right after being constructed. There was even an ill-fated U.F.O. museum built with federal funds. Its skeletal remains now sit like a lost ship among the weeds.As Brazil sprints to get ready for the World Cup in June, it has run up against a catalog of delays, some caused by deadly construction accidents at stadiums, and cost overruns. It is building bus and rail systems for spectators that will not be finished until long after the games are done.But the World Cup projects are just a part of a bigger national problem casting a pall over Brazil\u2019s grand ambitions: an array of lavish projects conceived when economic growth was surging that now stand abandoned, stalled or wildly over budget. The ventures were intended to help propel and symbolize Brazil\u2019s seemingly inexorable rise. But now that the country is wading through a post-boom hangover, they are exposing the nation\u2019s leaders to withering criticism, fueling claims of wasteful spending and incompetence while basic services for millions remain woeful. Some economists say the troubled projects reveal a crippling bureaucracy, irresponsible allocation of resources and bastions of corruption. Huge street protests have been aimed at costly new stadiums being built in cities like Manaus and Bras\u00edlia, whose paltry fan bases are almost sure to leave a sea of empty seats after the World Cup events are finished, adding to concerns that even more white elephants will emerge from the tournament. The growing list of troubled development projects includes a $3.4 billion network of concrete canals in the drought-plagued hinterland of northeast Brazil \u2014 which was supposed to be finished in 2010 \u2014 as well as dozens of new wind farms idled by a lack of transmission lines and unfinished luxury hotels blighting Rio de Janeiro\u2019s skyline.Economists surveyed by the nation\u2019s central bank see Brazil\u2019s economy growing just 1.63 percent this year, down from 7.5 percent in 2010, making 2014 the fourth straight year of slow growth. While an economic crisis here still seems like a remote possibility, investors have grown increasingly pessimistic. Standard & Poor\u2019s cut Brazil\u2019s credit rating last month, saying it expected slow growth to persist for several years.Making matters tougher for the government, it is an election year, with a poll last month showing support for President Dilma Rousseff\u2019s administration falling to 36 percent from 43 percent in November as sluggish economic conditions persist.Ms. Rousseff\u2019s supporters contend that the public spending has worked, helping to keep unemployment at historical lows and preventing what would have been a much worse economic slowdown had the government not pumped its considerable resources into infrastructure development.Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Ms. Rousseff\u2019s political mentor and predecessor as president, put many of the costly infrastructure projects into motion during his administration, from 2003 to 2010. In a recent interview, he acknowledged that some of the ventures were facing long delays. But he contended that before he came into office, Brazil had gone for decades without investing in public works projects, so the country essentially had to start from scratch.\u201cWe stayed for 20 years without making or developing any public infrastructure projects,\u201d Mr. da Silva said. \u201cWe had no projects in the drawer.\u201dFirst, they say, Brazil gives extraordinary influence to a web of state-controlled companies, banks and pension funds to invest in ill-advised projects. Then other bastions of the vast public bureaucracy cripple projects with audits and lawsuits.\u201cFor infrastructure projects which deserve state support and get it,\u201d Mr. Lazzarini continued, \u201cthere\u2019s the daunting task of dealing with the risks that the state itself creates.\u201dThe Transnordestina, a railroad begun in 2006 here in northeast Brazil, illustrates some of the pitfalls plaguing projects big and small. Scheduled to be finished in 2010 at a cost of about $1.8 billion, the railroad, designed to stretch more than 1,000 miles, is now expected to cost at least $3.2 billion, with most financing from state banks. Officials say it should be completed around 2016.But with work sites abandoned because of audits and other setbacks months ago in and around Paulistana, a town in Piau\u00ed, one of Brazil\u2019s poorest states, even that timeline seems optimistic. Long stretches where freight trains were already supposed to be running stand deserted. Wiry vaqueiros, or cowboys, herd cattle in the shadow of ghostly railroad bridges that tower 150 feet above parched valleys.\u201cThieves are pillaging metal from the work sites,\u201d said Adailton Vieira da Silva, 42, an electrician who labored with thousands of others before work halted last year. \u201cNow there are just these bridges left in the middle of nowhere.\u201dBrazil\u2019s transportation minister, C\u00e9sar Borges, expressed exasperation with the delays in finishing the railroad, which is needed to transport soybean harvests to port. He listed the bureaucracies that delay projects like the Transnordestina: the Federal Court of Accounts; the Office of the Comptroller General; an environmental protection agency; an institute protecting archaeological patrimony; agencies protecting the rights of indigenous peoples and descendants of escaped slaves; and the Public Ministry, a body of independent prosecutors.Still, Mr. Borges insisted, \u201cProjects get delayed in countries around the world, not just Brazil.\u201dMr. da Silva, who oversaw the start of work on the Transnordestina eight years ago, was frank about the role of his Workers Party, once the opposition in Brazil\u2019s National Congress, in creating such delays. \u201cWe created a machinery, an oversight machinery, that is the biggest oversight machinery in the world,\u201d he said, explaining how his party helped create a labyrinthine system of audits and environmental controls before he and Ms. Rousseff were elected.\u201cWhen you\u2019re in the opposition, you want to create difficulties for those that are in the administration,\u201d Mr. da Silva said. \u201cBut we forget that maybe one day we\u2019ll take office.\u201dThen there is the extraterrestrial museum in Varginha, a city in southeast Brazil where residents claimed to have seen an alien in 1996. Officials secured federal money to build the museum, but now all that remains of the unfinished project is the rusting carcass of what looks like a flying saucer.\u201cThat museum,\u201d said Roberto Macedo, an economist at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, \u201cis an insult to both extraterrestrials and the terrestrial beings like ourselves who foot the bill for yet another project failing to deliver.\u201d Taylor Barnes contributed reporting from Rio de Janeiro, and Rick Gladstone from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hungary\u2019s Central Bank Seizes Bold Strategies", "Date": "2014-04-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBUDAPEST \u2014 Few central bankers are as quotable as Gyorgy Matolcsy.There was the time Mr. Matolcsy, head of Hungary\u2019s central bank, said, \u201cHungarian tribes 1,500 years ago were well known for their three unique skills: brain surgery, hospitality and gastronomy.\u201d Or when, echoing the views of a Korean economist, he wrote that \u201cthe telegraph and the washing machine have made a real revolution in society,\u201d but \u201cthe Internet hasn\u2019t.\u201d Or when he proclaimed that the Hungarians and the Japanese are related because some of their babies have red dots on their backsides.His policies are equally unorthodox. But critics have assailed Mr. Matolcsy for his initiatives as central bank chief and economics minister, and wonder whether they will catch up to Hungary in the long run \u2014 and undermine the democratic ideals and free markets that are supposed to underpin the European Union.Some recent policy moves have recalled economic missteps that have come back to haunt other emerging markets. Confiscating private pension assets. Depreciating the currency. Imposing price controls in the banking and energy sectors. Weakening institutional checks and balances. Fostering a favored class of insiders and antagonizing foreign corporate interests.Mr. Matolcsy initially praised the book, and later disavowed it after it became a lightning rod. A Goldman representative declined to comment.As a central banker, Mr. Matolcsy has been best known for aggressively cutting rates, even after the forint fell to a two-year low against the euro in February. The latest rate cut, to 2.6 percent, a record low, came on March 25 and was the bank\u2019s 20th straight rate cut. This has helped make exports competitive. But it has put many people who borrowed before the global financial crisis in euros or Swiss francs, which were often available at cheaper rates, in an even deeper bind than they were already.Mr. Matolcsy, for his part, is not eager to make a case for his policies.Since taking over the central bank, he has curtailed interactions with the news media. Tourists cannot even step inside the lofty 109-year-old central bank building, an edifice in the late classical style adorned with commerce-themed limestone reliefs.\u201cVisitor center and museum closed,\u201d a security guard said on a recent visit. \u201cAll year.\u201dThe central bank would not make Mr. Matolcsy, or anyone else, available for an interview. But the Orban government did comment.Ferenc Kumin, a spokesman for the Orban administration, said, \u201cGrowth has rebounded in each and every economic sector in Hungary,\u201d adding that output grew by 1.2 percent last year and the unemployment rate was falling.\u201cEconomic growth and improved employment in turn result in higher incomes, which are expected to fuel household consumption in the future and, simultaneously, to improve the state\u2019s fiscal balance,\u201d he said.Indeed, Hungary\u2019s economy came out of recession last year, and the rating agency Standard & Poor\u2019s, which upgraded Hungary\u2019s outlook to stable last month, also raised its output growth forecast to an annual average of 1.8 percent through 2016. Still, Hungary has its challenges, like many other European Union members. Output is still below its 2008 peak and the country is suffering from the low inflation rates that are hampering growth across much of Europe. It has the highest amount of debt in Eastern Europe.And steps forward often come with an asterisk. Unemployment, at 8.6 percent, is below the euro zone average, but Hungary has lifted its numbers by counting temporary workers employed at below minimum wage, and by counting Hungarians living abroad. More than half of the people added to the employment rolls since 2010 fall into these categories, the government said.Gergely Tardos, an analyst at OTP Bank, Hungary\u2019s largest bank, said Mr. Matolcsy\u2019s \u201cgovernorship is seen as controversial,\u201d but said it would take years to judge him as a central banker. Critics, he said, have said Mr. Matolcsy \u201cdoes not embody the archetype of an independent and conservative central banker.\u201d\u201cHowever, until now his critics\u2019 fears have not come true and neither have the risks\u201d attached to many of his policies, he added.As economics minister, his policies tended to favor the wealthy. Fidesz introduced a flat tax, did away with income tax credits for the poor and increased consumption taxes.Zoltan Csefalvay, a senior official in the economics ministry, defended the state\u2019s approach.\u201cOur policy is not to punish those who are working hard,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom the first forint you earn you have to pay 16 percent. In Hungary it\u2019s important that everybody should pay.\u201dOthers see it differently.Andrea Gal, who lives in a woodland homeless encampment in a less august part of Budapest, said the government\u2019s new flat tax meant that her boyfriend, who does temporary work for the state, has to pay thousands of forints every month to the government, leaving them with only 50,000 forints a month, or about $221, to live on, along with whatever she can earn from collecting old beer cans.\u201cThat\u2019s enough for nothing,\u201d she said.She was sitting on her bed in a shack filled with smoke from a makeshift barrel stove; a handgun hung on a wall behind her, testifying to the danger of such a life. Trash was strewn in the woods all around, while her three dogs, Linda, Futyi and Kocos, napped after barking vigorously at a group of visitors.Data from Tarki, a Hungarian research and polling firm, shows that income inequality has risen since Fidesz came to power, after decreasing over the previous decade. But it is unclear how much is attributable to the financial crisis and how much to government policies like those instituted by Mr. Matolcsy.\u201cWe do have a hypothesis that the changes in the personal income tax system that Fidesz has introduced contribute to increasing inequality,\u201d said Marton Medgyesi, a senior researcher at Tarki. \u201cTheir new system is less progressive and broadly a flat tax system, and of course this benefits those with higher earnings because they have to pay lower taxes now than before.\u201dHungary is unlikely to change course. As Mr. Orban put it after the election, \u201cWe received a clear and unquestionable mandate to continue what we started.\u201dAnita Komuves contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In China, Dawn of a Gilded Age", "Date": "2014-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBeijing Auto ShowThere\u2019s a gold rush in China\u2019s automobile market, it would seem, judging by the huge array of new vehicles on display at Auto China 2014 in Beijing.The organizers promised that more than 1,000 new models \u2014 including over 100 world premieres \u2014 would be on display at the Beijing International Exhibition Center, where the show opened to the public Monday and runs through April 29.Not only is there gold to be mined from Chinese consumers, who bought more than 20 million vehicles last year, but gold is also to be found in the cars themselves. Wheels, paint, bumpers, grilles, trim and just about every touch point were likely to be finished in gold tones and accents. Automakers have latched onto the trend and met the demand. For example, Jeep introduced four design studies tailored to the public\u2019s tastes. Each offered ornate golden trim, door handles, pinstriping and other bits \u2014 garnishes not usually found on vehicles outfitted for off-road abuse.Ford unveiled a new Escort \u2014 elongated like a stretch limousine \u2014 and finished from bumper to bumper in a toasty golden brown. Among the more unusual vehicles in Beijing were modified Ford pickups and conversion vans. They were Fords, but presented by local customizers. \u201cWe don\u2019t sell pickups in China,\u201d Anderson Chan, a Ford spokesman said in an email. \u201cBut there is a car modification firm called Star Custom which showed modified Ford E-Series vans.\u201dThe trucks were tweaked to evince Humvee-style battlewagons, and the conversion vans were finished as if they had come from an \u201cA Team\u201d fever dream, with golden trim and solid wood running boards. Next to one of Star Customs\u2019 glittering offerings, even a gold-chain-festooned Mr. T might have seemed subtle.But perhaps Rolls-Royce topped them all, with its red and gold Pinnacle Travel Phantom, meant to evoke an era of lavish rail travel with an interior reminiscent of an Orient Express parlor car. Dashboard murals of inlaid wood depict a speeding steam train crossing a continental landscape.Volkswagen, the country\u2019s most popular brand with more than 3.2 million cars delivered last year, unveiled three important new models: a refreshed Touareg S.U.V.; a 395-horsepower Golf R 400 hatchback, the hottest Golf ever; and a sleek New Midsize Coupe concept. Although versions of the same cars will be sold worldwide, the models introduced here were finished in especially rococo fashion for the Chinese market.\u201cIndeed, bright colors and glossy materials \u2014 chrome, silver, gold \u2014 matter,\u201d Christian Buhlmann, a Volkswagen spokesman, said in an email. \u201cSeat materials are required to be softer than in other markets. But most relevant: Interior space. That is more important than engine size or power. Therefore we offer some vehicles like Tiguan, Passat, Audi A4 and A6 in long-wheelbase versions.\u201dHe added: \u201cFrom compact class to luxury full-size, sedans are the majority, but there is a tendency towards S.U.V.s. The one-child policy has many exceptions now; therefore there is demand for six or seven seats.\u201dIn addition, he noted, extra room is needed for grandparents, because many families travel with them riding in the rear seats.The importance of the China market to automakers cannot be overstated. \u201cRoughly 30 percent of VW\u2019s overall volume on a global basis comes from Chinese market sales,\u201d Mr. Buhlmann said. \u201cChina is our No. 1 market for both Phaeton and Touareg.\u201d He added: \u201cThe group is market leader in China; we run 17 plants in two joint ventures and expect to deliver 3.5 million vehicles this year.\u201dEven a small-volume luxury automaker such as Rolls-Royce already has 15 dealerships in China, with another eight in the planning stages.But the gold rush seems to be tapering off rapidly for China\u2019s domestic automakers. In 2010, the domestics accounted for more than 50 percent of sales. Through 2013, their market share fell to less than 40 percent. Among the concerns of prospective buyers were that domestic models fell short in quality, reliability, fuel economy, emissions and resale value compared with foreign brands.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Geopolitics, France and a Ship Order", "Date": "2014-04-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From EuropeST.-NAZAIRE, France \u2014 Here on the Atlantic Coast, workers at France\u2019s largest shipyard are closely following the standoff along Ukraine\u2019s border with Russia, nearly 2,200 miles to the east.\u201cOf course, it raises questions here,\u201d said Christophe Morel, a union delegate at the STX France shipyard, where two Mistral-class helicopter carriers are being built for the Russian Navy. The first, the Vladivostok, is due for delivery in just six months.The timing couldn\u2019t be worse. As workers were putting the finishing touches on the Vladivostok\u2019s giant gray hull at a dock here last week, NATO warplanes were buzzing the alliance\u2019s border with Ukraine in a show of force meant to deter any military intervention by Russia.When France signed the contract for 1.2 billion euros, or $1.6 billion, with Moscow in 2011, these kinds of war games were nowhere on the horizon. At the time, French officials hailed the deal, the biggest military sale to Russia by a NATO country, as a sign that Moscow should be considered a partner, not an enemy. Now it has become an awkward showcase of the European Union\u2019s vulnerability \u2014 even impotence \u2014 in the face of Russia\u2019s moves against Ukraine.It is also a reminder of how hard it is to shake the bonds of a globalized economy, particularly in a multinational industry like shipbuilding.For the 2,200 employees of STX France, a South Korean-owned company in which the French government holds a 33 percent stake, the Russian contract meant badly needed jobs at a critical time. \u201cIt helped us keep our heads above water,\u201d said Mr. Morel. But now, as the European Union continually reviews further sanctions against Russia, the Mistral contract keeps popping up like a bad penny. When one government minister suggested the contract might be suspended, he was met with a chilly reminder of the consequences from Moscow. Last month, the Defense Ministry put off any decision until October \u2014 when the Vladivostok is due to be handed over to the Russian Navy. By that time, work on the second ship, aptly named the Sevastopol after the naval base in Crimea, will be far along. People here keep a close watch for Russian sailors: A crew of about 400 is due to arrive next month, and a handful could be spotted in the town\u2019s center last week. For the approximately 300 STX workers now assigned to the Russian ships, these are signs that the Vladivostok, at least, is on track. \u201cThe main thing is to finish the ships,\u201d said Nathalie Durand- Prinborgne, who represents another union here. \u201cWhether the delivery is made is not our problem.\u201dIt would, however, become a problem for France, which would be obligated to come up with \u20ac1.2 billion in refunds and penalties. At a time when France is looking at painful budget cuts, that kind of money would be hard to find.This coastal town of 45,000 has been swept up by history before. In World War II, it was used as a German submarine base, which made it a target of brutal Allied bombing. When the war ended on May 8, 1945, a handful of German soldiers were still here, hiding out in an indestructible concrete bunker that remains standing to this day.In peacetime, the world\u2019s business is the lifeblood of the local economy. In the last decade, the St.-Nazaire yards have belonged successively to a French, Norwegian and now a South Korean company. Subcontractors represent as many as 20 different nationalities. Orders come from all over: Next in line is a cruise ship for Royal Caribbean Cruises, an American company, with plans for two more for an Italian-Swiss company.These colossal multistoried ships dwarf the Vladivostok, which, at about 650 feet, is regarded here as a \u201clittle boat,\u201d nothing more than a big ferry \u2014 without the cruise liners\u2019 luxury cabins, casinos and swimming pools. Its significance for France is, of course, much greater. But for workers here, what count above all are the jobs, not the politics. Naval construction has always been a globalized business.Advertisement"}

A terraced brick paver path leads from a circular driveway to a glass double front door protected by a portico.Inside the multilevel house, a contemporary wood and stainless-steel railing stretches across an entry gallery illuminated by clerestory windows and outfitted with custom-built nooks, a library and a powder room. The living room and family room are down two steps to one side of the entry, punctuated by three floor-to-ceiling fluted stone columns. The dining area is a few steps lower to the other side. A grayish beige granite floor runs throughout the six-bedroom home, which includes six full baths and one half bath. The granite is repeated on the kitchen countertops. The kitchen, to the back of the house, is outfitted with wood cabinetry, a center island with a raised breakfast bar and stainless-steel appliances, including a gas Viking range and a Sub-Zero refrigerator. Windows create a pass-through from the countertop to the patio. Sets of double-glass doors open from the kitchen, a gallery space and the family room to a terraced patio with a small round children\u2019s pool and a free-form main pool.A large red mural decorates the outside wall of a service bungalow, which could be converted to a cabana or pool house. There is also an outdoor shower. Curving concrete terrace steps and walls divide the pool area from a backyard lushly landscaped with fruit trees, flowers and art-filled pocket gardens. The half-dozen stone sculptures that resemble oversize buttons are negotiable, as is the furniture inside the home. Off the second-floor landing, the master bedroom suite has a balcony overlooking the pool and gardens, as well as his-and-hers office spaces, a sitting area and a large walk-in cedar closet. Its en-suite bath features twin white ceramic countertop vanities, a bidet and a tub/shower combination. Another doorway off the landing opens to a hallway leading to three family bedrooms, one en suite and two sharing a hall bath. A hallway off the kitchen leads to a temperature-controlled wine cellar that holds 600 bottles, a guest bedroom with an en-suite bath and a cedar-lined closet, a laundry room and, in what originally was the garage, a media room/children\u2019s playroom. A gated driveway to the right side of the house has room for five to six cars. Thirty minutes from San Juan, the Dorado Beach Ritz Carlton Reserve is an escape with a five-star resort hotel, seven communities including estate homes, villas, townhomes and apartments. Once a coconut and grapefruit plantation, Laurance S. Rockefeller opened a hotel on the site in 1958. The palm-fringed refuge with walking trails and three miles of sun-kissed Caribbean beaches attracted such luminaries as Elizabeth Taylor, Joan Crawford and presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy. These days, the amenities of the year-and-a-half old Ritz Carlton Reserve \u2014 including a beachfront restaurant, fitness center, a five-acre spa, swimming pools, a water park, and three golf courses \u2014 are accessible via golf cart. MARKET OVERVIEW\u201cThe high end of the market has and is rebounding,\u201d said Margaret Pena Juvelier, the broker-owner of Puerto Rico Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, which has the listing. \u201cPuerto Rico had been in a deep slump since the downturn of the economy\u201d when prices plummeted 35 to 50 percent, she said. But since a new tax law passed in 2012, Ms. Juvelier said she is \u201cseeing a lot more people coming to Puerto Rico and taking advantage\u201d of the tax incentive to buy homes. Gabriel Hernandez, an accountant and tax partner with BDO Puerto Rico, a business consulting group, said the new law provides \u201ca 100% exemption from income tax on interest, dividends and capital gains.\u201dLocal buyers, who had \u201cessentially disappeared,\u201d Ms. Juvelier said, realize \u201cthe market hit bottom and are coming in and buying at a very good price,\u201d buoyed by an improving economy and renewed confidence. In coveted luxury areas like Dorado Beach and the 485-acre St. Regis Bahia Beach Resort on the eastern end of the \u201cisle of enchantment,\u201d prices are higher than ever. New beachfront apartments at the Ritz Carlton Reserve range from $3 million to $7 million for a duplex penthouse. WHO BUYS IN PUERTO RICOBuyers are coming from across the United States, Ms. Juvelier said. Beyond buyers enticed by the new tax incentives, the rough winter in many parts of the United States spurred interest in Puerto Rico among second- and third-home buyers. Mr. Hernandez, the accountant, said the new tax law incentive already has brought in \u201ca diversified and dynamic group\u201d of new buyers. \u201cMost recent investments in the real estate sector have been driven by and/or for the new Puerto Rico residents.\u201d Under Puerto Rico tax rules, an individual must spend more than 183 days in Puerto Rico to be presumed a resident.

But he likened Springer\u2019s relations to David against the Goliath of Google, whom he went on to accuse of harboring illusions of world domination.Google controls so much data, becoming the global equivalent of what Deutsche Post once was to mail or Deutsche Telekom to making phone calls in Germany, which is why it is so important for the American giant to be transparent and fair, Mr. D\u00f6pfner wrote.Attacking what Mr. Schmidt had characterized as Google\u2019s willingness to forge a compromise with the European Commission over a four-year-old complaint about its practices, Mr. D\u00f6pfner starkly declared, \u201cThis is not a compromise.\u201d\u201cThis is the introduction,\u201d he continued, \u201csanctioned by an E.U. authority, of that kind of business practice which in less honorable circles is called extortion.\u201dGoogle declined to comment on the matter.The proposed solution to the European tussle with Google would still leave the American company in a position to discriminate against competitors in search results, Mr. D\u00f6pfner insisted. \u201cYou know very well,\u201d he told Mr. Schmidt, \u201cthat this would signify a long-term discrimination against and weakening of any kind of competition. And that Google would just extend its market dominance.\u201dTurning to the relevant European Union official, Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, the competition commissioner, Mr. D\u00f6pfner suggested that he should ask himself whether he wants virtually his last important decision before stepping down this autumn to be an act \u201cthat would go down in history as the nail in the coffin of Europe\u2019s already somewhat sclerotic Internet economy.\u201dInstead, he suggested, Brussels should recognize a historic opportunity to exert political influence over the digital future and at the same time lend the European Union \u201cwhat it in recent years has so painfully lacked, namely an emotional narrative.\u201dThe European Commission and a spokesman for Mr. Almunia said they had not seen the Springer text and had no immediate comment.Mr. Almunia has already reached a preliminary agreement with Google giving publishers a way to remove their content from Google News without facing penalties in search results.But that draft accord falls far short of publishers\u2019 demands, in part because Mr. Almunia declined to examine whether Google\u2019s use of their content represented a violation of intellectual property law. Mr. Almunia told the publishers that doing so would go beyond the limits of his duties as competition policy commissioner. The publishers reacted furiously in February, calling the accord \u201cfundamentally defective.\u201dIn his letter, Mr. D\u00f6pfner insisted that Europeans, at any rate, were changing the business equation for Google and other American digital giants because of wariness engendered by the disclosures that large amounts of data are collected by Internet concerns and could be scrutinized by United States intelligence.He concluded by asking Mr. Schmidt whether he wanted to wait for Google\u2019s monopoly to be broken, either by politicians or \u2014 if still possible \u2014 by consumers. \u201cLess is sometimes more,\u201d the German wrote. \u201cYou can triumph to the death.\u201dIn reply to written questions submitted through and returned from Springer\u2019s communications department, Mr. D\u00f6pfner said he had wanted to write not about Mr. Schmidt, but to him directly. \u201cWe are classic frenemies,\u201d he stated.\u201cI had always believed that Google had learned from the experiences of IBM, Microsoft and above all Rockefeller,\u201d he continued. \u201cI thought they would rein themselves in and not want everything in all fields in order to avoid certain debates about concentration and to head off the danger of being broken apart. Perhaps this debate will help to achieve a certain self-limitation. Everyone would benefit from that.\u201dHis attack appeared intended not just to address his bigger business and political questions but also to put the brakes on Google, particularly in Germany, a market that it has historically found more difficult to conquer than other European countries. At least in part, that is due to the post-Nazi, post-Communist legacy of privacy concerns that have also fueled anger here over American government snooping, including on Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s cellphone.Since entering the German market, Google has grappled with the country\u2019s suspicions over the reach of its services. For years, its \u201cgmail.com\u201d domain was in the hands of a company in Hamburg, and only after a long legal battle was Google able to secure the rights in 2012. Germany also became the first country to force Google to allow people to opt-out of having their homes shown in its Street View program, begun in 2010, following an intense backlash against the provider.Mr. D\u00f6pfner made a point of stressing diverse statements from Mr. Schmidt, the Google co-founder Larry Page and others in the past that he interpreted as hinting at a desire for world domination.Pointing to recent Google moves to build driverless cars, or monitor what citizens do in their own homes, or acquire knowledge of how to build drones, Mr. D\u00f6pfner taunted: \u201cForget Big Brother \u2014 Google Is Better!\u201dJames Kanter contributed reporting from Brussels and Melissa Eddy from Berlin.James Kanter contributed reporting from Brussels and Melissa Eddy from Berlin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Leaner and More Efficient, British Printers Push Forward in Digital Age ", "Date": "2014-04-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by8 PhotosPETERBOROUGH, England \u2014 At a media conference a few years ago, the editor of The Guardian newspaper, contemplating the future of print, recalled his paper\u2019s installation of its newest presses in 2005. \u201cI had a feeling in my bones that they might be the last,\u201d said the editor, Alan Rusbridger. The efforts of traditional print media executives to grope their way into the digital future have been well chronicled. But what about the executives even more tightly bound to the presses \u2014 the people who run big printing companies?Ask Roy Kingston, the 55-year-old chief operating officer of Wyndeham, a privately held company that is one of Britain\u2019s biggest printers and whose portfolio includes the British circulation of The Economist and Men\u2019s Health magazine. A player in the printing game for three decades, he has felt the digital onslaught. And so far, he has survived to tell the tale, even if not everyone in his industry has been so fortunate.\u201cThis boardroom is about the only thing that hasn\u2019t changed around here,\u201d he told a visitor, sitting at an antique conference table in the heart of Wyndeham\u2019s printing plant here. \u201cEverything else in this plant is different. All the equipment has been changed, and so have the people.\u201dIn many ways, printing itself has gone digital. Industrial-strength laser printers enable big printing plants to make quick and cost-effective small-batch runs on demand. Even Wyndeham\u2019s big offset machines \u2014 which print from lithographic plates created from digital files \u2014 are so highly automated that a crew of just a dozen or so can put them through their paces. \u201cThis is almost a peopleless business now,\u201d Mr. Kingston said as he walked through the huge but mostly deserted printing hall. \u201cAt one point we had 350 people in this plant. Now we have 114. But the amount of work has more than doubled.\u201dBack in the 1990s, Mr. Kingston said, the plant had three presses that could turn out about 20,000 copies of a 32-page publication in an hour. Now there are two machines that are capable of producing triple that amount.Driving the point home, Wyndeham\u2019s plant was about to print an issue of The Economist with a cover that read \u201cRise of the robots.\u201d\u201cPeople are losing their jobs and there is no way to spin that,\u201d Mr. Kingston said. \u201cNow you have to be lean, mean and clean to succeed in this business.\u201dIn 2001, the British printing industry had around 200,000 employees. There are now fewer than 125,000, according to data from the British Printing Industries Federation. Britain\u2019s printing industry, though large, is not the biggest worldwide. It is ranked fifth by revenue behind the United States, China, Japan and Germany. Yet its challenges and opportunities are emblematic. Sales by British printers have been in steady decline in the last 20 years, according to data from the government\u2019s Office for National Statistics, and there is no respite in sight. The industry\u2019s revenue is projected to shrink to about 10 billion pounds, or approximately $17 billion, by 2017, down from more than \u00a315 billion in the 1990s, according to Key Note, a market research company. The global printing industry, with estimated revenue of $880 billion last year, will continue to grow by about 2 percent a year until 2018, driven mainly by emerging market countries, in the view of Smithers Pira, another research company. China will probably overtake the United States as the world\u2019s biggest print market this year, Smithers Pira said, while India will slip ahead of Britain into the No. 5 spot by 2018. European printers have had an especially rough ride, given the region\u2019s sluggish economy. The gradual recovery has not translated into a pickup in Europe\u2019s print demand, and Smithers Pira said most of what has been lost will not be recovered.Some publications, including Maxim, a men\u2019s lifestyle magazine, and Accountancy Age, a trade periodical, have withdrawn from the British print market altogether, opting for online-only versions. Britain, with its heavily unionized work force, is also vulnerable to competition from elsewhere in Europe. \u201cThe Italians offer very high quality but also low price because of their low labor cost,\u201d said Robert G. Picard, a professor of media economics at the University of Oxford. \u201cAnd Germany and the Scandinavian countries have a very efficient printing industry, which takes away some of the price problems,\u201d he said. \u201cSo for things that are time-sensitive like magazines and have to be done in the region, the best deal might be outside of the U.K. \u2014 and you can have your products here overnight.\u201dBook publishers, who are not under the same time constraints as newspapers or magazines, are looking much farther east, with printing increasingly moving to Asia, where the labor costs are even lower.\u201cAll this leads to excess capacity and takes a huge amount of margin out of the printing companies,\u201d Mr. Picard said. If the industry\u2019s woes could be mapped out on a physical surface, the ExCeL exhibition center in London might serve that purpose. This year\u2019s Ipex, an international printing industry convention held at the ExCeL center in March, required only 30 percent of the exhibition space it needed in 2010, according to PrintWeek, an industry publication.Mr. Kingston of Wyndeham, who has attended Ipex since the 1980s, was struck by the change. \u201cAn exhibition that even four years ago would have taken you a day to get around, you can now do in just an hour,\u201d he said. \u201cYour coffee wouldn\u2019t even get cold.\u201dThe industry\u2019s survivors are holding on, in part by moving beyond print media publishing into packaging and labeling \u2014 parts of the physical world where a digital equivalent cannot easily follow. \u201cWe are all buying things in cardboard boxes or in tins that have some kind of label on them,\u201d Mr. Picard said, \u201cso the printing industry is really expanding its work in that area.\u201dMr. Kingston considers packaging \u201cthe biggest growth area of printing, without any shadow of a doubt.\u201d He cited a Swedish study of supermarket shoppers that found price was often secondary to labeling in people\u2019s purchasing decisions. \u201cMost people buy products they don\u2019t even know about, based on the packaging, based on the thing that is hanging in front of them,\u201d he said. Wyndeham, like other survivors, is no longer devoted solely to paper and ink. The company has developed a product it calls \u201cemagine,\u201d a form of production management software that media companies can use for print and online delivery. It has also set up a division to focus on online media applications, \u201cwhether it is on mobile, smartphones or iPads,\u201d said Paul Utting, chief executive of Wyndeham. Printers are also responding to the changing desires of advertisers, who have grown accustomed to tailoring their pitches to narrow niches thanks to online media. Digital printing \u2014 the professional version of desktop laser or inkjet printing \u2014 makes it feasible for retailers to print bespoke catalogs aimed at individual customers\u2019 buying preferences.The same applies to books and magazines, Mr. Kingston said. \u201cWe can now make a bespoke edition of any magazine; we can bind it in a different way and use special colors. We can personalize it and send it. There is much higher added value there.\u201dFor the April issue of the British film magazine Empire, for which Wyndeham printed the covers, the publisher wanted to celebrate the coming movie \u201cGodzilla\u201d by putting out a \u201cmegazine\u201d \u2014 nearly one-third larger than the usual issue \u2014 which it marketed as a collector\u2019s item. Thanks to its customization capabilities, Wyndeham could easily adapt. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Intel\u2019s Profit Slips, but Investors Are Still Turning Toward Tech\u2019s Staid Stalwarts", "Date": "2014-04-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor now, in technology stocks, it is nice to be a little old-fashioned.Shares in prominent companies like Amazon, Netflix and Twitter have endured significant sell-offs so far this year, leading to talk of problems in the technology industry. The most stark of these declines has been that of Twitter, which so far this year has lost 33 percent of its value.But while tech\u2019s Internet darlings have stumbled, a number of older tech giants, like Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft and Oracle, have so far this year outperformed market averages. Upon occasion, it seems, it is helpful to be late to the party. The older tech companies may have missed out on the growth in areas like social media, analysts say, and in many cases, they have resigned themselves to slower growth than in their own rah-rah days. But when the hot new thing cools down, that \u201cgood enough\u201d approach is good enough for many investors, too. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a minibubble in Internet companies, where people invest in companies with no discernible fundamentals and trade on the momentum of stocks going up, until they don\u2019t,\u201d said William H. Janeway, managing director and senior adviser at Warburg Pincus. \u201cInvestors have substantial money in tech, and a portion of that is in high-risk areas. Now they are going back to tried-and-true companies.\u201dThe company\u2019s stock was little changed before the earnings came out, then rose slightly in after-hours trading. A survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters had projected that Intel would earn 37 cents a share.So far this year, Intel shares are up about 3.1 percent (slightly higher in after-hours trading) compared with a fall of 3.4 percent in the tech-heavy Nasdaq stock exchange. \u201cThere has been a rotation of investors into old-school tech shares,\u201d said Doug Freedman, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. \u201cThe monsters are up, because they aren\u2019t dumping money on things that won\u2019t create revenue in the foreseeable future.\u201dMuch of the stock market\u2019s tech investment is still in shares of the older tech companies that are not directly associated with the Internet. Apple, which has a market value of $462 billion and is down 6.4 percent so far this year, still has the largest capitalization of any tech company. An exception is Google, ranked second, with a capitalization of nearly $361 billion.But Google is not so far from Microsoft, which despite years of slow growth remains worth $330 billion. And in the current sell-off of Internet companies, the two are moving closer together. So far this year, Google shares have lost about 3.5 percent of their value, while Microsoft has gained 7 percent.One reason that shares in the older companies have done better is that they were slow to react to areas like social media, analysts say. In many cases, they accepted that they would grow at slower rates and never saw a sharp increase in share price last year.For some longtime observers of the market, the split in technology shares is a sign of overall health and that investors are a little more discriminating than critics would believe.\u201cIt\u2019s not all over for tech or a broad-based bubble,\u201d Mr. Janeway added. \u201cThere are areas like mobile, cloud computing and e-commerce that will produce substantial opportunities.\u201dInside the big companies, it can be hard to let go of the high-growth dreams. Intel, which for two decades benefited from the global boom in personal computers, missed the shift to smartphones and tablets.Intel has even created a new division to focus on the so-called \u201cInternet of Things,\u201d the growing industrial use of sensors, communication chips and analysis of data stored in vast \u201cclouds\u201d of server computers. Intel\u2019s leadership also talked with analysts on Tuesday about new inroads into the tablet business, and increasing sales of chips for computer servers. The overall message was diversification of revenue. \u201cWhen you get to be greater than $50 billion in revenue, it\u2019s hard to grow 10 percent,\u201d Stacy J. Smith, Intel\u2019s chief financial officer, said in an interview. \u201cWe look at a lot of markets where we can get a half-billion dollars of growth.\u201d In particular, he said, Intel is counting on markets, like the Internet of things, that call for large, complex systems of chips and software.The company would do better to keep cutting, Mr. Freedman said. \u201cSince the dot-com boom, they were looking for 15 percent growth,\u201d he said. \u201cThey feel like they are at the limit of what they can spend, but it doesn\u2019t seem like they\u2019ve settled down to just growing with the economy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Saudi America\u2019: Mirage?", "Date": "2014-04-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt a time when Russia is saber-rattling and the Middle East is in turmoil, a welcome geopolitical trifecta could be in the making. The United States is poised to surpass Saudi Arabia and Russia as the world\u2019s top oil producer. Canada\u2019s oil sands have vaulted the country to energy superpower status. Mexico is embarking on a historic constitutional energy overhaul that its president promises will propel the country\u2019s economy.And there is no shortage of cheerleaders. \u201cThe North American production outlook is incredibly bright,\u201d said Jason Bordoff, a former senior energy adviser in President Obama\u2019s White House. \u201cEverything we see on the ground suggests reasons to be optimistic.\u201dPerhaps most important, the economics of oil and natural gas extraction on the continent are challenging: Deepwater Gulf of Mexico oil drilling, oil sands extraction and shale drilling are all expensive and require high petroleum prices that are far from assured. Most of the easy-to-drill oil is gone. But should North America produce too much oil too quickly, and exports surge from Iraq (which is already happening) and Iran (should talks with the West over its nuclear program succeed), global oil prices could soften considerably. There is also the possibility that the pace of shale drilling in places like Argentina, China and Russia, which have so far lagged North America, could take off, producing sizable new sources of oil and gas on the world market. As unlikely as it may seem, a price collapse, like the one that happened to domestically produced natural gas after 2008, is something every oil executive fears.History has a way of throwing surprises at the energy patch. After the Arab oil embargoes raised oil prices in the 1970s, few foresaw the sudden collapse of oil prices just a few years later that drove Mexico and parts of Texas into an economic tailspin. Just a decade ago, companies spent tens of billions of dollars on natural gas import terminals that turned out to be useless when an unexpected boom in shale drilling led to a glut of domestic gas. Now those terminals are being converted for export at a cost of many billions of dollars more.\u201cThere\u2019s reason for optimism,\u201d said Mark Finley, BP\u2019s general manager for global energy markets and United States economics, speaking of North America\u2019s oil and gas prospects, \u201cbut we cannot take it for granted.\u201dThe big wild card is Mexico, whose energy fortunes have been tied to the United States ever since the late 1970s, when the country discovered great riches offshore. Over the next couple of decades, United States refiners retooled to process heavy oil from Mexico and Venezuela, but over the last decade or so production in both countries has plummeted. In the case of Mexico, oil exports to the United States have declined from 1.7 million barrels a day in 2006 to one million barrels a day in recent months.The problem for Mexico is a sclerotic national oil company, Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos, commonly known as Pemex, which has had a monopoly on production and gasoline sales since the 1930s. Known more for corruption than expertise, the company has been forced for decades to hand over its revenue to the government while underinvesting in known oil and gas fields.President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto has proposed to end the monopoly by allowing foreign private oil companies to explore and produce in Mexico and share in the profits. Energy experts hope Mexico can finally exploit its riches in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico and in the oil- and gas-rich shale fields that cross from the United States border. Most experts say that the deepwater gulf offers the most promising results over the next five to 10 years, since international oil companies have so much experience drilling in waters adjacent to Mexican waters, and Mexican wells could be hooked up to gulf pipelines that already exist.The words coming out of Mexico are positive. \u201cMexican society wants change,\u201d Pemex\u2019s director general, Emilio Lozoya Austin, told energy executives in March at the IHS Energy Ceraweek conference in Houston. \u201cThere is room for any kind of company to come and invest.\u201dCiti Research estimated last year that Mexico could have 29 billion barrels of oil and gas reserves in the gulf, and an additional 13 billion barrels of recoverable oil shale reserves. Experts say production could increase by 25 percent by 2024 to nearly four million barrels a day, potentially vaulting Mexico to the fifth or sixth position among the biggest oil-producing countries.The United States would stand to be the big beneficiary from a Mexican bonanza, both in terms of having an extraordinary new resource on its border and from added trade with a richer neighboring partner. But foreign oil executives remain cautious.\u201cThe positive news in Mexico will help supplies in North America,\u201d Ryan Lance, the ConocoPhillips chief executive, told a recent Rice University energy conference. But he expressed uncertainty about how effectively Mexico would change its energy laws to attract foreign investment, asking, \u201cAre they going to put regulations in place that will make them competitive internationally?\u201d He did not answer his own question.Industry executives express many concerns. They wonder how thoroughly Pemex will share its rich trove of seismic data and whether they will have to take Pemex on as a partner on projects they would rather explore on their own or with other companies. They wonder if government regulators will enforce the new energy laws fairly and if the court system will fairly adjudicate disputes between oil companies, especially where Pemex is involved.\u201cYou can go ahead and draft all the regulations that you wish, but if those regulations are not enforced, they are totally worthless,\u201d said Jorge R. Pi\u00f1on, former president of Amoco Latin America. \u201cWe need rule of law, governance and transparency.\u201dThe rule of law has always been in short supply in Mexico, and American oil executives express concern about deploying money and manpower south of the border as long as there is so much drug gang violence.\u201cThey are making some promising signals,\u201d said Chris Faulkner, chief executive of Breitling Energy, an independent oil and gas producer, \u201cbut that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m rushing down there with an armored car.\u201dOnly a decade ago Canada\u2019s oil sands were little more than an afterthought in the energy world, with oil prices just beginning to drive high enough to make mining in the subarctic boreal forest economically viable. But while Mexico has been in decline as an oil producer in recent years, Canadian production has soared.The lack of transport has stranded the oil sands from markets, making the oil cheaper to buy than almost any other crude on the continent. That might not be a major problem if the oil sands were less expensive to produce, but they tend to be more expensive, whether mined or steamed out of the ground.\u201cIt\u2019s tough to make a buck,\u201d said Bill Maloney, executive vice president for North American exploration and production at Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, a major producer in Canada. \u201cWithout infrastructure, why should that change?\u201d Executives say that the \u201ceasy barrels\u201d have already been exploited and that more complex projects are driving up costs. There are shortages of skilled labor and competition for materials, problems made all the more complicated by the need to transport equipment and otherwise operate in a frigid sub-Arctic climate. Rising costs have already put a damper on development of natural gas export terminals in British Columbia.Christophe de Margerie, chief executive of Total, the French oil giant and a major oil sands producer, said that only seven years ago most oil sands projects could break even with an oil price of $65 to $70, but higher taxes, royalties, regulations and labor costs had driven the break-even price to $90 to $95 a barrel \u2014 just a few dollars lower than the current price.\u201cThe Alberta government increased taxes and royalties at the same time we were faced with this tremendous inflation in costs,\u201d Mr. Margerie said. \u201cAnd we told them, \u2019Careful, you are going to kill the beast even before it is alive.\u2019\u00a0\u201cThe United States has been the jewel of global petroleum in recent years, increasing its oil production by more than 50 percent since 2008, and most energy analysts say they believe the good fortunes are sustainable for at least another decade. Natural gas production has been so plentiful that the price of the commodity has plunged, giving consumers and manufacturing industries a financial break, while gas import terminals are being turned around to export. The country has already replaced almost all imports of high-quality African oil with the booming production of the Texas and North Dakota shale oil fields.But the department warns that while the imported share should drop to 25 percent in 2016, it will rise again, to about 32 percent in 2040, as domestic production from shale fields begins to decline in 2022. Some oil executives say that the government is not optimistic enough and that technological improvements will continue to allow their companies to increase production at a profit. But few think that is a sure thing, and they list a number of concerns, most of which appear to be improbable \u2014 but not impossible.One concern is that an oil glut could develop in the middle of the country that could depress prices so much it would be difficult for producers to justify sustaining production. Refineries on the Gulf of Mexico are not designed to process large quantities of \u201csweet\u201d lighter oil from the new shale fields, and the oil could be left stranded \u2014 unless Washington reverses the current ban on most domestic oil exports, or refineries find it profitable enough to retool their plants to refine lighter oil.Other concerns, outlined in a recent presentation by the consulting firm Wood Mackenzie, include the possibility of a global drop in oil prices; the failure of drilling technology to expand extraction from core shale areas to more marginal, peripheral parts of the fields; stiffer rail transport standards; and bans on hydraulic fracturing. The firm concluded that those risks were unlikely to undercut the United States boom, but oil executives still express some wariness. \u201cIf there is more aggressive regulation, a ban on trade,\u201d Mr. Finley, BP\u2019s analyst, cautioned, \u201cit\u2019s just important to recognize and appreciate the range of factors that have led to this boom and not take them for granted.\u201dBut the biggest concern is the oil price, which has a history of gyrating in unexpected ways. Just a couple of years after the natural gas drilling boom took off, the ensuing glut caused prices to drop so sharply from 2009 to 2012 that producers were forced to stop drilling in several shale fields until prices partly recovered this year.\u201cIndustry took the rig count down, production down and investment down,\u201d Mr. Maloney, the Statoil executive, recalled. \u201cSo why couldn\u2019t the same thing happen with oil?\u201dIndustry executives note that the typical oil shale well needs a price of roughly $50 a barrel to break even, given the expense of drilling horizontally and hydraulic fracturing. \u201cBankers don\u2019t want to see oil near $65,\u201d said Mr. Faulkner, the chief executive of Breitling Energy, an active shale driller in Oklahoma and Texas. \u201cCapital would dry up quickly like it did for gas.\u201dWhat makes shale drilling particularly challenging is that wells produce most of their oil and gas in the first years of production, requiring more and more drilling in lower-quality zones of the fields. \u201cIf W.T.I. prices come down hard,\u201d said Lawrence J. Goldstein, a director of the Energy Policy Research Foundation, referring to West Texas Intermediate, the American benchmark crude, \u201cinvestment will fall off, and you need constant investment for production just to stand still.\u201d He added: \u201cI am very optimistic, but only if we continue to invest.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amid Overhaul, Case Questions Agency\u2019s Foster Care", "Date": "2014-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Texas TribuneAs Texas Child Protective Services is working to streamline its foster care system, a lawsuit in federal court could force officials back to the drawing board, costing taxpayers millions of dollars. In 2011, Children\u2019s Rights Inc., a New York-based advocacy group, filed a suit targeting the state\u2019s long-term foster care system, a legal state known as permanent managing conservatorship. The group, which has successfully sued in more than a dozen states, said the Texas agency kept children in foster care for too long, violating their constitutional rights.\u201cThe situation is pretty dire, and it\u2019s not getting better,\u201d said Marcia Robinson Lowry, the executive director of Children\u2019s Rights. \u201cAlthough the tool we use is the court and the law, our goal is not to get a legal decision. Our goal is to change the system.\u201dBut John Specia, commissioner of the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services, the umbrella agency of the state Child Protective Services, said Children\u2019s Rights would have a difficult time proving its case.\u201cI don\u2019t think we benefit from being under a consent decree or a judgment, and I don\u2019t think we are violating children\u2019s constitutional rights,\u201d Mr. Specia said. \u201cThat is a very, very high standard.\u201dThe case is scheduled for trial on Dec. 1 in Corpus Christi before Janis Jack, a federal district judge. With no settlement talks in the works, state officials fear that if they lose, it would mean dealing with far more costly changes than the agency\u2019s current overhaul and being forced into court oversight. If that happens, Texas may be required to reduce workloads for caseworkers, long a problem. Today, some workers shoulder on average\u00a030 children\u2019s cases a month. The lawsuit also asks that the state be forced to have higher licensing and training standards \u2014 for both workers and foster care parents.The Child Welfare League of America, an industry advocacy group, has recommended a load of no more than a dozen cases per worker per month. \u201cIf the court grants the relief requested by Children\u2019s Rights, agency operations will be affected in a number of ways, depending on the order,\u201d the state agency said in response to questions for a state legislative review scheduled for this summer. The lawsuit said that many children in the Texas foster care system faced abuse and long waits before they were either adopted or returned to safer homes. \u201cThese children languish in state care even though as of August 2010, nearly three-quarters of children in the state\u2019s P.M.C. were legally free for adoption,\u201d the lawsuit said, referring to permanent managing conservatorship. Tiffany Gorman, 19, was once a member of the plaintiff class in the lawsuit but has since aged out of it. The suit covers a class that covers children currently in permanent managing conservatorship. Ms. Gorman was removed from her Amarillo home at age 11. She said that she was placed in 15 foster homes in her first month with Child Protective Services.\u201cMy mom was still kind of young and didn\u2019t know how to take care of me,\u201d she said.Because her mother would not give up her parental rights, Ms. Gorman, like many Texas foster care children, could not be adopted and remained in permanent managing conservatorship.Today she lives in Dallas, where she works as a welder and forklift operator.The Texas agency is one of the largest child welfare agencies in the country with a two-year $2.5 billion budget and about 8,000 employees. But like most child welfare agencies in other states, it has had its share of problems. A series of horrific child abuse cases on the agency\u2019s watch triggered a decade of reorganization, pilot programs and internal audits. Lawmakers and others have said they have seen improvement. \u201cThere are problems with C.P.S., but I remember what C.P.S. looked like 20 years ago,\u201d said Mr. Specia, a former family law judge from San Antonio, who 16 months ago was named to lead the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services. Since 2005, investigators in the field have been given laptops and cameras. And there is a current four-year effort to replace the agency\u2019s creaky record-keeping software. This year, for the first time, the agency has outside consultants looking at its operation. Also planned is an effort to privatize foster care. Although much of its money come from federal dollars, the agency budget remains stout. Its current two-year budget is nearly $800 million more than what was approved for 2006-07. Mr. Specia said improvements are still needed, but he added that there was no blanket violation of foster children\u2019s civil rights.But are all 28,000 in Texas\u2019 foster care system having their rights violated? That\u2019s not going to be easy to prove, he said.Other states sued by Children\u2019s Rights have been subject to decisions that led to a court-ordered monitor, new computer systems and mandated lower caseloads, which required the hiring of more workers.\u201cIn the 19 or so states Children\u2019s Rights sued before Texas, the average length of litigation exceeds 15 years,\u201d the agency said in its response to legislative review questions. \u201cOnly one state has exited its consent decree with Children\u2019s Rights in less than 10 years.\u201d But Mr. Specia said he did not think the change Children\u2019s Rights lawsuits bring was that drastic.\u201cI do not see the child welfare systems in those states where they have won, appreciably different than ours,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the states become hamstrung by becoming part of a consent decree\u201d that sets demands for states. Ms. Lowry has heard this criticism before.\u201cOften we have a very constructive relationship with the state agency,\u201d she said. \u201cMore than one commissioner has said to me, \u2018Thank goodness for this court order, I couldn\u2019t get the money I need, I couldn\u2019t get the political leverage I needed without the order.\u2019\u00a0\u201dMr. Specia says court-ordered reform could prove costly, at least \u201chundreds of millions\u201d of dollars to comply, should the state lose the case. The Texas agency is also facing new pressures stemming from a robust state economy. The oil boom here means rents are way up, taxing the salaries of caseworkers who make on average about $37,000, according to the agency. Despite the pressures, the agency under Mr. Specia\u2019s leadership has garnered less of the Legislature\u2019s scorn. His straightforward answers to lawmakers\u2019 questions and willingness to consider different approaches has earned him praise.\u201cI think you\u2019re doing a great job,\u201d State Representative Elliott Naishtat, Democrat of Austin, said in a House Human Services Committee hearing this month.tlangford@texastribune.org Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lull Prompts Question: What Are Taliban Up To?", "Date": "2014-04-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 Even as Afghanistan\u2019s unfolding presidential election has captured the capital\u2019s attention, two related questions have become increasingly urgent among security officials here: Where have the Taliban gone, and what are they waiting for?Some analysts speculate that the Taliban are biding their time until the runoff election in May or June, or are wary of a publicity backlash if they target civilians at all during the voting. Others wonder whether a leadership struggle and infighting have halted major operations. But there are more questions than answers on the issue, even for some commanders within the Taliban.\u201cWe are waiting on the command of the leadership,\u201d said a Taliban commander who goes by the name Sangaryaar and operates along the border of Kandahar and Helmand Provinces in the south. \u201cFor the moment we are on standby and have no reason to explain why.\u201dUnraveling the Taliban\u2019s intent has immediate urgency not just for security officials, but for whatever new Afghan government takes shape after the election. One of the first issues facing the new administration will be determining how to engage the Taliban \u2014 whether with force or diplomacy, or more likely with both \u2014 as American military forces carry out a withdrawal from Afghanistan by year\u2019s end.The withdrawal itself has complicated the effort to pin down the Taliban\u2019s tactics, according to frustrated Western officials.\u201cIt\u2019s the fundamental problem we have with fewer touch points in the field,\u201d said one Western military source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with lesser personal knowledge.\u201dThe source added: \u201cThere are a lot of data points, but they are all over the place \u2014 they don\u2019t point to one thing. And some of the things that are happening contradict each other.\u201dSome officials suggest that the Taliban have been less effective because Afghan security forces simply have been doing a better job, but that largely flies in the face of evidence from more remote areas where the militants remain the dominant force.Some analysts believe funding may play into the picture, as the war in Syria and a virulent insurgency in Iraq draw money once directed to insurgents here.Rumors of a conflict within the Taliban have also driven speculation that the militants may be grappling with whether to continue their violent campaign or pursue a more peaceful path. Mullah Abdul Qayum Zakir, the hard-line leader of the group\u2019s military council, recently resigned, a development the local news media attributed to the power struggle unfolding within the ranks.After reports emerged of his removal from office, the Taliban were quick to attribute his resignation to poor health, chiding the media for publishing \u201cambiguous interpretations for his resignation.\u201dBut the killings of nearly a half-dozen leaders, including the former Taliban minister of refugees, Mullah Abdul Raqeeb, as well as two shadow governors, have stirred the same speculation that there is dissent within the group\u2019s power structure.Some security experts in Kabul believe that the insurgents are waiting for a more opportune time to strike, perhaps during the runoff election, after having failed to disrupt the first round with any major attacks.Members of the Taliban reached by telephone, however, reject the idea that the group was thwarted in its goals. Some of the commanders said they were under specific orders not to attack civilians during the election, in part because such violence would probably do more to damage their public image than to disrupt the election.\u201cThe reason we did not stage major attacks across the country was that we wanted to avoid civilian casualties,\u201d said one Taliban commander in Kunar Province. \u201cMass casualties could harm our cause and would have been against our principles and claims.\u201dThat action, as much as anything, seems to have had an impact, at least in terms of perception.\u201cThe media have played such an important role over the last month or so in downplaying even some serious insurgent attacks,\u201d said Gen. Abdul Wase Milad, an Afghan Army brigade commander in Paktika Province. \u201cIn a psychological war, the media fights 30 percent of the battle.\u201dIn a show of gratitude after the election, the Defense Ministry handed out certificates of appreciation to at least 40 Afghan journalists for ignoring the Taliban\u2019s efforts. The spokesman for the National Directorate of Security, the country\u2019s intelligence agency, said the news media had a bigger impact on Election Day than security operations did.One Taliban commander agreed. \u201cWe carry out attacks on a daily basis,\u201d said the commander, Abdul Wahid, who operates in Kunar Province. \u201cThe reason you do not hear about it is that the media is not reporting it.\u201dIn any case, few Afghan and Western officials expect the Taliban to hold off on major attacks for long. And several independent assessments of the insurgency predict that their activities will only increase in the coming years after the troop withdrawal.In many provinces, the Taliban have spread themselves into remote areas and districts that the security forces cannot reach. With coalition forces largely sticking to their bases, the logic, those familiar with the tactics say, is for the Taliban to wait through the Western military pullout before moving to expand their territory without having to face coalition airstrikes.Behind the confusion about the Taliban\u2019s tactics is a deeper question about the insurgents\u2019 overall strategy. At issue is whether the Taliban\u2019s leadership truly believes it can take over the national government again by military force, or whether it is fighting more to achieve better leverage in a negotiated peace deal with the administration in Kabul \u2014 and, likely, for more recognition abroad.\u201cThey want to be recognized as a legitimate party. Why else do they call themselves the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan and not the Taliban movement?\u201d said Thomas Ruttig, a researcher with the Afghan Analysts Network. \u201cThey want power back, and then international recognition.\u201dBoth leading presidential candidates, Abdullah Abdullah and Ashraf Ghani, have vowed to keep the pressure on the Taliban while pursuing channels for a peace deal that for years has eluded the current Afghan president, Hamid Karzai.Less clear is how the Taliban will respond to the new president. While the militants have long derided Mr. Karzai as a puppet of the West, they have been studiously silent about the two leading candidates.With the lack of clarity and a persistent threat of terrorism, some fear that the violence will continue to justify a heavy focus on the military, to the detriment of other badly needed changes in the economy and in government.\u201cAs long as a new Afghan government fights a terrorism problem, it\u2019s a good excuse for not doing the reforms necessary in the Afghan system, whether political or economic,\u201d Mr. Ruttig said. He added, \u201cAnd the international community might continue funding them, even if on a lower level.\u201dNiamatullah Karyab contributed reporting from Asadabad, Afghanistan, and Taimoor Shah from Kandahar, Afghanistan.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Odd Hostility in the Americas", "Date": "2014-04-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAO PAULO, Brazil \u2014 Two vast countries in the same hemisphere, with the same can-do appetite for the future, populated by far-flung immigrants subsuming their differences into the same powerful sense of nationhood, with the same commitment to democratic governance and free enterprise, drawn to each other by the same mutual attraction among their peoples, find their relations at or close to an all-time low.There may be more perplexing international relationships in the world than the troubled one between the United States and Brazil, but there are not many. A natural friendship has fissured under unnatural strain. A perverse estrangement prevails.Brazil, a kind of tropical United States, finds it difficult to connect to Washington, and vice versa. The nation that might have been America\u2019s closest ally (even without a formal alliance) among the rising powers is now anything but. China, a more trusted interlocutor, has become Brazil\u2019s largest trading partner, with U.S.-Brazil ties consigned to a vacuum as Brazil prepares to host the World Cup this year and the Olympics in 2016.The immediate cause of the difficulties has been the fallout from the revelation that the National Security Agency had spied on the Brazilian president, Dilma Rousseff, and her subsequent cancellation of a planned state visit to Washington last October. Since then, relations between President Obama and the Brazilian leader have been frozen. Brazil wants an apology, which it will not get, or at least a significant American gesture, of which there is no sign. Unhappy with Brazil\u2019s political direction, the Obama administration is not on the verge of a bout of contrition.Prodded by Rousseff\u2019s left-of-center Workers\u2019 Party, Brazilian foreign policy has of late been as open-armed toward Venezuela and Cuba as it has been cool toward Washington. Following Venezuela\u2019s admission in 2012, Mercosur, the South American trading bloc dominated by Brazil, has turned into a sort of anti-Yankee talk shop (in contrast to the Pacific Alliance, another newer trading bloc of more buoyant economies whose members, including Chile and Peru, are pro-American).The 50th anniversary this year of the coup that brought military rule to Brazil, and led to the arrest of Rousseff, a leftist guerrilla fighter in her student days, has provided the occasion for more criticism of the United States, which was supportive of the army\u2019s intervention. The spying scandal has spurred the facile notion that nothing has changed, when in fact just about everything has.Brazil\u2019s rise, stalled for now with its economy in the fourth year of slow growth, might naturally have led to the end of the complexes that troubled its relations with Washington, as the Cold War\u2019s shadow receded. Instead, difficulties have intensified. Brazil recently decided to buy Swedish fighter jets, snubbing Boeing\u2019s F/A-18 Super Hornets. Ambitious plans for cooperation in defense, renewable energy and nuclear and space technologies are largely on hold.A high-level meeting here of the Aspen Strategy Group and Brazil\u2019s Center of Public Leadership was marked by broad agreement on the acuity of the problems but little sense that any improvement is imminent. Rousseff, whose popularity is falling, is fighting for re-election in October. Brazilians want change, opinion polls show, but neither of the two major opposition candidates has yet gained significant momentum. In this tense political atmosphere, Rousseff is not about to second-guess her rebuff to Obama last year; nor will she back down from her demand for an apology. Both steps contained a large measure of political calculation in the first place. They were cheered, whatever the long-term consequences.With its economy nearly stalled, its currency slipping, inflation on the rise, vast infrastructure projects and ambitious plans for the development of huge offshore oil deposits delayed and over-budget, Brazil would certainly benefit from greater cooperation with the United States. Caracas and Havana are not going to build the future of a great nation. Brazil should reverse its anti-Washington pivot. America, in turn, should make close ties with Brazil, its natural partner in the Southern Hemisphere, a strategic priority. At some point a gesture like a U.S. statement of support for Brazil becoming a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council (a Brazilian ambition) could be helpful and justified.The problem is that the current crisis in Brazilian-American relations never quite rises to the top of the strategic agenda. Neither president has close senior advisers pushing the issue or looking for creative solutions. This is understandable but regrettable. Such solutions are needed. They won\u2019t be found without a determined effort.Meanwhile the millions of Brazilians traveling north to buy apartments in Miami or shop in New York, and the many Americans drawn to the splendors of Brazil and finding in it a tropical version of their own land of immigration and promise, will push for people-to-people closeness against a backdrop of official alienation. With luck they will win in the end.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Health Enrollment Numbers Lift Democratic Hopes", "Date": "2014-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 After months of pummeling by Republicans and with a grim election season approaching, Democrats on Tuesday had a rare bright day. President Obama\u2019s announcement that the new health care plan had enrolled 7.1 million Americans coincided with the release by Representative Paul D. Ryan of a new Republican budget that proposes changes in Medicare and deep cuts in spending. It\u2019s far too early to say a political turnaround is at hand, but for the first time this election year, Democrats are evincing some confidence that they have at least stanched the bleeding.\u201cIt\u2019s changing. If you\u2019ve been around awhile, and I\u2019ve been around awhile, you can sense it,\u201d said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to turn away seven or 10 million people from insurance coverage \u2014 doesn\u2019t work anymore. And then comes Ryan. Thank you, thank you Congressman Paul Ryan, for reminding us what Republicans would do if they had control.\u201d\u201cEven though the Democrats are trying to take some victory lap, it\u2019s very short term,\u201d said Senator John Thune of South Dakota, chairman of the Senate Republican Conference. \u201cThe bad news continues. The hits keep coming.\u201dBut for the first time in a while, Democrats this week found themselves talking up a contrast between their agenda \u2014 protecting the newly insured, raising the minimum wage and renewing unemployment benefits \u2014 and a Republican plan that would cut health care and education spending deeply, and move Medicare toward private insurance.\u201cThe choice is very stark,\u201d Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader and Democrat of Nevada, said Wednesday on the Capitol steps, flanked by more than 30 Democratic senators in a campaign-style rally. \u201cThe American people are watching.\u201dAnd Republicans found themselves in a new position: on the defensive, justifying a budget that has already proven to be a political loser (\u201cWhat\u2019s the Democrats\u2019 plan?\u201d House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio asked Wednesday) and trying to explain what would happen to more than 10 million people who have signed up for insurance through the president\u2019s health care law via a private plan or Medicaid and would be left at sea with its repeal.\u201cThe president can go out there and tout all the people he\u2019s signed up, but how about the young man I talked to last week out in California whose premiums have doubled? His co-pay and deductibles tripled, and his wife\u2019s hours got cut to 29 hours,\u201d Mr. Boehner said. \u201cMy insurance premiums nearly doubled. My co-pays and deductibles tripled under Obamacare.\u201dFor Democrats, this spring at least should be a respite. With the closing on Tuesday of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s first open enrollment period, nothing much will happen to the law until after the election \u2014 when the next enrollment period begins and employer-mandated coverage begins. On the plus side, the president\u2019s announcement that 7.1 million Americans had signed up for private health policies through the law\u2019s exchange is likely to prove understated. Once totals are tabulated to include new Medicaid enrollees, people who signed up for new federally protected policies through private insurance brokers, and young adults who have stayed on their parents\u2019 policies because of the law, the figure is likely to be at least double that.Moreover, the Ryan budget, which was approved by the House Budget Committee on Wednesday night along party lines, will present the Democrats a chance to expand the political conversation beyond health care, to more Democrat-friendly subjects like Medicare, Social Security, education funding and health research. The tax-and-spending plan once again proposes to convert Medicare into a \u201cpremium support\u201d system in which older people would be given subsidies to purchase private insurance \u2014 a proposal that Democrats ran on successfully in 2012. It cuts Medicaid by $1.5 trillion over 10 years, food stamps by $125 billion, education programs by $145 billion \u2014 including Pell grants \u2014 and makes university students begin paying interest on student loans while still in college. Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster, forecast that 57 percent of the people who vote will be over 50 this November, compared with 43 percent in 2012.\u201cThe ability to drive our advantage on Medicare will be invaluable,\u201d she said.Republicans, for now, are not that worried. Their core voters remain more energized that the Democratic base, said Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster, and are likely to remain vehemently opposed to the health care law, regardless of the enrollment numbers.\u00a0\u201cThe health care law has always been characterized by stronger Republican opposition than Democratic support,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is possible that Democratic support for the law could increase, but fundamentally changing opinion of the law will be difficult in the short term.\u201dBut some Republican members of Congress are showing a newfound willingness to negotiate changes in the law rather than demand its repeal. \u201cThe law\u2019s real. It\u2019s there,\u201d said Representative Reid Ribble, Republican of Wisconsin and a signer of the letter. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing a recognition that the law\u2019s in place, and if our constituents are going to be penalized for it, the federal government ought to make it work.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "On a Trip That Avoids Beijing, Obama Keeps His Eye on China", "Date": "2014-04-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisKUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia \u2014 On every stop of his Asian journey in the past week, President Obama has spoken to two audiences: America\u2019s allies and China. The balancing act has become even trickier because of the sharp deterioration in America\u2019s relations with Russia.Perhaps no country has more to gain from a new Cold War than China, which has historically benefited from periods of conflict between the United States and Russia and, analysts say, could exploit these latest tensions to lean even harder on its neighbors in the region.As Mr. Obama has traveled from Japan to South Korea and, now, Malaysia, he has delivered a carefully calibrated message to reassure America\u2019s friends of its support while discouraging the Chinese from any thoughts of opening a second front on the Pacific Rim.\u201cWe\u2019re not interested in containing China,\u201d Mr. Obama said, even as he embarked on what some experts said could be portrayed as a \u201ccontainment tour,\u201d visiting four countries that worry about Chinese expansionism while skipping Beijing itself. \u201cWe\u2019re interested in China\u2019s peaceful rise and it being a responsible and powerful proponent of the rule of law,\u201d Mr. Obama insisted. But he added, \u201cIn that role, it has to abide by certain norms.\u201dThe president laid out a vivid case for why China should not mimic Russia\u2019s adventurism. The escalating sanctions against Russia for its threats to Ukraine, he said, will weaken an economy already challenged by its reliance on oil and gas.The portrait Mr. Obama painted of Russia was withering. Speaking in Tokyo, he said Russia \u201cneeds to diversify its economy, because the rest of the world is moving further and further off the fossil fuels that are the primary way that Russia is able to bankroll itself.\u201d By playing up Russia\u2019s weaknesses and predicting that they will worsen because of President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s aggression, Mr. Obama seemed to be saying to Chinese officials who might be contemplating closer ties with Moscow: Stick with a winning team. \u201cThe message is: \u2018Don\u2019t think that what Putin is doing in eastern Ukraine is so brilliant that you should be inspired by it. Don\u2019t think that this is a model that could work for you,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Jeffrey A. Bader, who was the senior China adviser on the National Security Council until 2011. Mr. Bader warned last week that a few poorly chosen phrases could turn Mr. Obama\u2019s trip into a containment tour. But he said the president had gotten the balance right in Japan and South Korea, robustly reaffirming America\u2019s support for its treaty allies while avoiding statements that would isolate or antagonize China.So far, China\u2019s reaction has been muted. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a perfunctory objection to Mr. Obama\u2019s assertion that the American security treaty with Japan obligates the United States to protect a clump of islands in the East China Sea that are administered by Japan but claimed by both Japan and China.But it has been silent since then, much as it abstained from the debates in the United Nations over Russia\u2019s actions in Crimea. China, some analysts said, is content not to pick a fight with the United States at a time when events, in Asia and elsewhere, seem to be going in its favor.Leaders in Japan and South Korea said they were reassured by Mr. Obama\u2019s words. But among experts in both countries, there was lingering uneasiness about the depth of American resolve.\u201cThe wording of his statements was O.K., but if you look at his demeanor and tone, he was very nuanced and trying not to get entangled in disputes with China,\u201d said Narushige Michishita, an expert on security policy at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo.Lee Geun, a professor of international studies at Seoul National University, said the situation in Ukraine raised inevitable questions. \u201cWhat if North Korea tries something, or what if China tries to do something with North Korea?\u201d he said. \u201cWould the U.S. come to South Korea\u2019s defense?\u201dAdministration officials say the United States is better placed in Asia than it has been for years. Malaysia, which once had an openly anti-American government, is now cautiously looking to work with the United States. Myanmar, after decades of isolation during which it became heavily dependent on China, is also eager to engage.But none of this will spare Mr. Obama from his balancing act. In Malaysia, where he arrived on Saturday, he will meet with government officials who have come under fierce criticism from the Chinese authorities for their handling of the search for the missing Malaysian airliner. Many of the passengers on the plane were Chinese. Malaysia has its own territorial disputes with China, in the South China Sea, on which it would welcome American support. Benjamin J. Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser, said Mr. Obama\u2019s position was that \u201cbig nations should not be able to coerce smaller nations.\u201dThat issue will be even more pointed in the Philippines, where Mr. Obama will travel on Monday. The country has been locked in an increasingly tense standoff with China over the Scarborough Shoal, a popular fishing ground now occupied by Chinese ships.The United States hopes to announce an agreement to expand access for American warships and planes to bases in the Philippines, giving the United States a visible military presence there for the first time since it relinquished the Subic Bay Naval Base in 1992. That would also send an unmistakable message to China, though last-minute legal issues in the Philippines have raised questions about whether the deal will be ready for the president to sign.At the time, the United States brushed aside China\u2019s requirement that planes identify themselves when flying into the zone, dispatching two B-52 bombers to prove its point. On Saturday, an administration official said, Air Force One filed only a routine flight plan. Except for a little turbulence, the plane passed through the area smoothly.Martin Fackler contributed reporting from Seoul, South Korea.Advertisement"}

The donor-centric system has simply gained another repository for its patrons\u2019 largess, and donors will continue to extract their quid pro quos in the form of more extreme candidates and more polarized politics.Despite his best efforts, Mr. Brooks cannot make a silk purse out of a sow\u2019s ear.To the Editor:Yes, it\u2019s probably true that we\u2019ll never get money out of politics. This is a capitalist economy, after all. And yes, if there\u2019s money coming into politics, it may be less pernicious to have that money come in through the national parties than through unaccountable independent committees.But it doesn\u2019t necessarily follow that the McCutcheon decision will have salutary effects. At its core, McCutcheon allows the rich (and only the rich) to buy more political influence, in a wider range of ways. This can only tip the playing field further away from the other 99 percent of the electorate.The new influence-buying options may be less pernicious than the old ones, but more influence-buying is still more influence-buying.If you think (as David Brooks apparently does) that the problem with American politics is too many political action committees and too few party bosses, then McCutcheon may be part of the solution. But if the problem is too much vote-buying and not enough vote-earning, then you\u2019ll just have to wait for another Supreme Court, because this one is too insulated or too intellectually dishonest to recognize the difference between the two.The writer is a professor of sociology at Brown University.To the Editor:David Brooks tells us that \u201cthere will always be money in politics; it\u2019s a pipe dream to think otherwise.\u201dThus the cheerleaders of the status quo remind us to be realistic, just as they did when movements began to emerge to challenge racism, sexism and homophobia.History\u2019s lesson: You never know what is realistic until you engage in sustained struggle for what is desirable and needed.A movement is emerging, led by the Network of Spiritual Progressives, to get \u201cmoney out of politics,\u201d and its focus is the Environmental and Social Responsibility Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. ESRA would mandate public funding for all state and national elections while banning all private money from individuals, corporations or any other source, require media to give free and equal time to major candidates, and require large corporations to prove a satisfactory history of environmental and social responsibility every five years to retain their corporate charter.Unrealistic, visionary, badly needed.To the Editor:While it was reform that ended the influence of the political parties, it was not campaign finance reform. It was the requirement that party candidates be selected by primary elections.In 1952, for example, powerful political parties paid little heed to primary results. While victories in the Republican primaries were fairly divided between Robert A. Taft and Dwight D. Eisenhower, Eisenhower was chosen as the Republican candidate. Likewise, Estes Kefauver won most of the Democratic primaries, but Adlai E. Stevenson was chosen as the Democratic candidate.After the disastrous Democratic convention of 1968, the Democrats instituted party reforms that strongly favored primaries, with a result that most states adopted this method of selecting convention delegates. These delegates no longer owed loyalty to the party; rather, they arrived committed to a particular candidate. Anyone with enough money could get into the game. No party dues required.Today\u2019s candidates are selected at private events by the wealthy with checkbooks.

{"Headline": "G.M. Chief Faces Ire of Senators in Hearing", "Date": "2014-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The questions came faster and harder at Mary T. Barra on Wednesday.After facing a House subcommittee investigating General Motors\u2019 ignition-switch recall a day earlier, G.M.\u2019s chief executive was bombarded with a more aggressive line of questioning by senators.As family members of victims looked on, senators repeatedly cut off Ms. Barra, scolded her over failing to have answers and zeroed in on G.M.\u2019s potential criminal liability for failing to fix defective ignition switches in millions of small cars for more than a decade.Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat and chairwoman of the subcommittee, wasted no time in going on the attack. G.M. had \u201ca culture of cover-up,\u201d she said in her opening remarks, dismissing Ms. Barra\u2019s contention that the company had changed its ways.Other senators flatly asserted that G.M., which is under investigation by the Justice Department, most likely broke the law by concealing information about a deadly safety defect.\u201cG.M. has a real exposure to criminal liability,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat from Connecticut and a former state attorney general. \u201cI think it is likely and appropriate that G.M. will face prosecution.\u201dMs. Barra, sitting alone for nearly two hours at a table with a phalanx of G.M. executives behind her, frequently could do little more than listen. For more than a decade, she often heard, G.M. failed to fix the defect that led to the recall of 2.6 million Chevrolet Cobalts and other small cars. The company has linked 13 deaths to the problem.In her opening statement, she was contrite and pledged to find out what accounted for the delay. She also reminded lawmakers that G.M. had hired Kenneth Feinberg, a specialist in compensation claims, to explore the possibility of paying damages to victims, even though it is shielded from liability from accidents that occurred before emerging from bankruptcy in July 2009. But once she had finished her statement, senators quickly confronted her, with a central line of questioning focusing on whether G.M.\u2019s failure to act for so long will result in criminal liability.Already, federal prosecutors are looking into whether G.M. knew about the defect and failed to fully disclose the problem in the bankruptcy filings, as well as what it disclosed to regulators. But despite Mr. Blumenthal\u2019s assertions, some criminal and corporate law experts predicted that it would be difficult to build a successful criminal case against G.M.\u201cYou have to realize how novel that is \u2014 the possible use of criminal liability because of safety violations,\u201d said John C. Coffee, a Columbia law professor who is a specialist in white-collar crime and director of the university\u2019s Center on Corporate Governance.There are several reasons for this, he said. First, in a vast corporate structure with numerous rank-and-file employees and midlevel managers simply doing their job, it\u2019s hard to pinpoint where responsibility lay.\u201cIt is rare that you can identify with the certainty that criminal law demands who made a decision to produce a dangerously unsafe product.\u201dAs far as a cover-up goes, unless prosecutors could prove a willful top-down conspiracy \u2014 with an \u201cunambiguous unequivocal act,\u201d like destroying documents \u2014 prosecution in that area is tough, too, he said.Ms. Barra tried to explain how various departments at G.M., like the legal and engineering divisions, failed to share information that could have resulted in an earlier recall, and possibly saved lives.\u201cWithin G.M. there were silos, where information was known in one part of the business at the legal team, but was not communicated to the engineers,\u201d Ms. Barra said.But when Ms. Barra, who took over as chief executive in January, said she had no knowledge of the events leading up the Cobalt recall in February, Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, attacked her for not knowing.\u201cSomething is very strange that such a top employee would know nothing,\u201d Ms. Boxer said.And when Ms. Barra tried to explain that G.M. had changed its ways and improved its internal communications, Ms. Boxer said that still did not excuse its past practices.\u201cYou say today, today,\u201d Ms. Boxer said, \u201cbut yesterday I did some things I\u2019m accountable for, too.\u201dToward the end of the hearing, Ms. Boxer seemed exasperated by Ms. Barra\u2019s answers.\u201cIf this is the new G.M. leadership, it\u2019s pretty lacking,\u201d she said.The senators on the Commerce subcommittee took advantage of documents produced by the House investigators on Tuesday, including records that show that a G.M., switch engineer, Raymond DeGiorgio, had approved a significant change in the part in 2006, but without a corresponding change in the part\u2019s identification number.In a deposition last year in the 2010 wrongful-death case of a Georgia woman killed in a Cobalt crash, Mr. DeGiorgio denied ever approving the change. Ms. McCaskill said that withholding records of a switch change from plaintiff lawyers was a criminal act, and said she possibly wanted to question G.M. lawyers at a future hearing.She also bore in on why Ms. Barra had yet to fire Mr. DeGiorgio and other officials involved in hiding ignition-switch problems.\u201cHas Mr. DeGiorgio been fired?\u201d she asked Ms. Barra.\u201cNo, he has not,\u201d replied Ms. Barra.\u201cFor the life of me I can\u2019t understand why he still has his job,\u201d Senator McCaskill said.After grilling Ms. Barra, members of the Senate subcommittee were easier on David J. Friedman, the acting director of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, questioning him for less than an hour.Mr. Friedman said that his agency was still struggling to understand the connection between faulty ignition switches and the failure of the air bags to deploy.\u201cTo be honest, it doesn\u2019t make sense to me,\u201d he said.Mr. Friedman, who came to the agency from an environmental group where he specialized in fuel economy and alternative fuels, also acknowledged that he did not know that his agency had the ability to use subpoena power to demand documents from automakers.Mr. Friedman told the panel that the agency had been paying close attention to legal action related to potential car safety defects.Ms. McCaskill asked Mr. Friedman if his agency had legal standing to demand from automakers the details of sealed and confidential lawsuits and legal settlements that could be connected to safety defects.Eventually, Mr. Friedman checked with his staff, sitting behind him, and said yes.\u201cIt worries me that you did not know,\u201d the senator said.\u201cIt worries me as well,\u201d Mr. Friedman said.Mr. Friedman said he favored higher penalties for failure to make required reports, and said that his agency would try to get the public to bring more complaints to the safety agency, which now receives about 45,000 a year.But the agency was not able to cull those reports to expose the ignition flaw, and several senators expressed concern over the agency\u2019s performance in spotting the trend.In the end, some legal experts said that there was only so much a regulatory body can do.Andrew Stern, a senior fellow at Columbia University\u2019s Richman Center for Business, Law and Public Policy, said that the solution did not lie with Congress, but with the Justice Department. \u201cNothing changes behavior better than a good criminal prosecution,\u201d he said. \u201cSomeone could impanel a grand jury tomorrow, and nothing would get the attention of the industry more than that.\u201dHilary Stout contributed reporting from New York.videovideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Health Care Spending\u2019s Recent Surge Stirs Unease", "Date": "2014-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 It\u2019s back. For years, because of structural changes in the health care delivery system and the deep economic downturn, the health care \u201ccost curve\u201d \u2014 as economists and policy makers call it \u2014 had bent. Health spending was growing no faster than spending on other goods or services, an anomaly in 50 years of government accounts. But perhaps no longer. A surge of insurance enrollment related to rising employment and President Obama\u2019s health care law has likely meant a surge of spending on health care, leaving policy experts wondering whether the government and private businesses can control spending as the economy gets stronger and millions more Americans gain coverage. \u201cFollowing several years of decline, 2013 was striking for the increased use by patients of all parts of the U.S. health care system,\u201d Murray Aitken, executive director of the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics, said in a statement.The news comes as President Obama promotes the success of the Affordable Care Act in covering more Americans at less cost than anticipated. \u201cUnder this law, real Medicare costs per person have nearly stopped growing,\u201d Mr. Obama said at a news conference on Thursday as he announced that eight million people had signed up for insurance coverage through the law\u2019s exchanges. \u201cThose savings add up to more money that families can spend at businesses, more money that businesses can spend hiring new workers,\u201d he said, adding that the government\u2019s budget scorekeeper \u201cnow says that the Affordable Care Act will be cheaper than recently projected.\u201dBut some health care experts and economists said that an expanded use of the health system might start to have the opposite effect. Americans feeling more economically confident might demand more procedures from doctors and hospitals. Insurers paying more money for those procedures might, in time, increase premiums, cutting into wage gains. The government might end up spending more on the health law than current projections imply. \u201cWe knew this was coming,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former head of the Congressional Budget Office and a prominent Republican economist, of rising spending because of the coverage expansion and improving economy. \u201cThe question now is whether we can hold spending down.\u201d Many other analysts said they had long expected health spending to increase. \u201cIf we are seeing an uptick, it\u2019s the beginning of the uptick,\u201d said Drew Altman, the president of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. \u201cWe\u2019ve expected to see a lagged effect, both when the economy declines and when it improves.\u201d The question is whether health spending might grow moderately, with a one-time bump from new Affordable Care Act enrollees, or whether it might surge, with potentially damaging consequences for the fiscal deficit and wages. Economists from both the right and left \u2014 including in the White House \u2014 have said that there is no greater threat to the government\u2019s budget than soaring health spending. Rising insurance premiums would increase the cost of the health law\u2019s expansion. More broadly, experts have warned that the excess growth of health costs could increase the country\u2019s debt and crowd out spending on all other priorities, including education, infrastructure, research and development and support for low-income families.The pace of health spending growth started falling in the mid-2000s and reached historical lows over the last five years. The recession counts for much or even most of the decline, economists think, as workers lost their jobs and their health coverage, and budget-conscious families chose to reduce their out-of-pocket spending. But at the same time, structural changes to how health care gets delivered and paid for \u2014 changes made by the government, insurers, doctors and hospitals \u2014 also helped hold spending down. Many insurers, for example, began charging much higher co-pays and deductibles, spurring their enrollees to use less care. Now, health experts said, two big trends are pushing health spending back up again. \u201cExpanded coverage is happening simultaneously with the petering out of the recession\u2019s dampening effect,\u201d said Charles Roehrig, the director of the Center for Sustainable Health Spending at the Altarum Institute. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard to demonstrate how much is due to expanded coverage, versus just the economy recovering.\u201d The data remains preliminary and has not yet provided a clear picture of why health spending is climbing \u2014 let alone how much it might climb, analysts warned. \u201cWe have a handful of data points,\u201d said David Cutler, a Harvard professor and former economic adviser to Mr. Obama. \u201cYou want a couple hundred, and we just don\u2019t have them \u2014 we can\u2019t delve deeper yet.\u201d Cognizant of the need to keep health spending per enrollee down, Democratic policy makers included a number of provisions in the health care law to encourage insurers to move away from fee-for-service medicine and to stamp out unnecessary costs. But critics \u2014 and even many supporters \u2014 of the law have repeatedly said it might not be enough. \u201cThis is a criticism I\u2019ve had of the A.C.A. going back years \u2014 this is not revisionist history,\u201d Mr. Holtz-Eakin said. \u201cI thought it was too heavy on the insurance expansion and too light on delivery-system reform. It has tons of projects and demonstrations. But the road to hell is paved with projects and demonstrations.\u201dJason Furman, the chairman of the White House\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, cautioned against reading too much into a small number of reports, pointing to a wealth of other data showing that premiums and the price growth of medical goods and services remained low.\u201cEven if only one-third of the slowdown is sustained,\u201d he said, \u201cwe will be spending $1,200 less per person on health care after a decade.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hiring Rises, but Number of Jobless Stays High", "Date": "2014-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEmployers are hiring at a more aggressive pace again after a winter cold snap, but the pace of job gains is only slowly making up for years of lost ground in the labor market. But that level is still far below what is needed to fully accommodate the millions of people who have joined the work force since then, or relieve the backlog of jobless workers anytime soon.Still, the addition of 192,000 jobs last month, all from private employers, represented an uptick from the anemic rate of job creation recorded at the turn of the year. That encouraged optimists, who foresee a slight strengthening as the wintry weather in many parts of the country in late 2013 and early 2014 yields to a more inviting spring.In addition, while the unemployment rate remained flat at 6.7 percent in March, an increase in the number of Americans looking for work also offered up some modest hope that better times could lie ahead in 2014. So too did an upward revision in the number of jobs that government statisticians estimate were added in January and February. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten back to where we were before the winter slowdown in terms of job creation \u2014 as well as where we expect to be going forward,\u201d said Dean Maki, chief United States economist at Barclays. \u201cThis gets us back on trend.\u201d Statistically speaking, the estimated rate of job creation in March was nearly identical to the average monthly gain of 183,000 jobs recorded over the last 12 months.The latest numbers are likely to be revised significantly as more information flows into the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Even so, they suggest that the economy is not achieving what economists call escape velocity, something that policy makers have long sought. Neither is it falling into the rut some pessimists feared was developing early in 2014.\u201cGrowth-wise, in terms of the economy and the labor market, we think 2014 will look a lot like 2013 and 2012 did,\u201d said Guy Berger, United States economist at RBS Securities. \u201cIn all likelihood, we will see average monthly job gains of a little north of 200,000 this year.\u201dWhile that pace of job creation would gradually bring the unemployment rate down, it would take until nearly the end of the decade before the labor market returned to the level of robustness that prevailed in the mid-2000s, let alone the 1990s. Experts with the Hamilton Project, a research group that is associated with the Brookings Institution in Washington, estimate that at the current rate it will take until early 2019 for the economy to accommodate new entrants into the work force and get back to where it was before the recession. While the Labor Department data showed that private payrolls in March stood at 116.09 million \u2014 compared with 115.98 million as the recession began in January 2008 \u2014 the size of the American work force has jumped by more than two million over the same period. Moreover, even as people joined the work force, millions of other Americans dropped out of it entirely in the last five years, having given up the search for work, and the question of just how many of them will ever return to full- or even part-time jobs is now being hotly debated in economic circles. The participation rate did edge up in March as more workers returned to the labor market amid increased openings, a central reason the unemployment rate remained flat even as a survey of households suggested that nearly half a million people found new jobs last month. The return of Americans to the job hunt not only underscores just how much slack remains in the economy but also means that the unemployment rate is unlikely to keep falling as sharply as it has in the last two years. That\u2019s because people who are again looking for work are counted as unemployed, while those who have given up and dropped out of the labor force are not.The plunge in the unemployment rate \u2014 to 6.7 percent, from 8.2 percent in March 2012 \u2014 has encouraged policy makers at the Federal Reserve to slowly begin easing back on their stimulus efforts. But even as that so-called tapering process is likely to continue for the remainder of 2014, stabilization of the unemployment rate between 6.5 and 7 percent would encourage the Fed to be in no hurry to begin raising short-term interest rates. The government conducts two separate surveys each month to come up with the jobs figures \u2014 the figures for job creation come from the poll of private firms and the public sector, while the household survey yields the unemployment rate and more granular data on the work force itself. While the two move in tandem over time, the household survey in March was especially encouraging, showing an increase of 503,000 in the labor force, including 476,000 who reported they had found jobs.On Wall Street, stocks initially traded higher after the Labor Department report, only to turn sharply lower in the afternoon with profit-taking in the highflying social media and biotech sectors. Hiring in March was paced by gains in construction, retail and professional services. Government employment over all remained flat, with federal and state governments shedding 11,000 jobs even as local governments added the same number. Over the last 12 months, total federal employment has fallen by 85,000.For nonsupervisory manufacturing workers, the length of the typical workweek rose to 42 hours, tying a postwar high and setting the pace for a slight gain in the workweek for workers in every sector. Across the economy, average hourly earnings in March were basically flat but the increase in hours meant slightly fatter paychecks over all. One especially strong sector in March was the broad professional and business services category, where employment rose by 57,000. Over the last two years, companies have added more than 1.2 million workers in this heavily white-collar category. At Hagie Manufacturing, a farm equipment maker in Clarion, Iowa, that hired 12 workers last month, most of the new positions were in areas like marketing and engineering, rather than on the production line. And those jobs are heavily sought after, according to the company\u2019s chief executive, Alan Hagie. In the last 12 months, the company has hired 83 workers, bringing its total work force to 488; the company received 2,800 r\u00e9sum\u00e9s for these openings.Similarly, hiring is also up sharply this year at Ernst & Young, the accounting giant. Most of those positions are going to college graduates and workers with specialized skills in fields like auditing as well as cloud computing and data analytics. Patterns like that explain why the unemployment rate among college graduates in March stood at 3.4 percent compared with 6.3 percent for high school graduates. Dan Black, director of recruiting in the Americas at Ernst & Young, said the firm expected to hire 12,700 professionals in the United States in fiscal 2014, up from 10,400 last year.\u201cI\u2019m not hearing about a slowdown,\u201d he said.

{"Headline": "How to Kill the Minimum Wage Movement", "Date": "2014-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn a visit to the capital a few weeks ago, I was struck by how politically inert the place was. Not just empty, lifeless, devoid of activity in the chambers where great politicians once roamed. Not just a do-nothing Congress living up to its pledge to do even less this year than last. Not just the usual government-by-corporate lobbyists. At the moment, Washington is a dead town.Not true of the other Washington, across the country. Seattle officials are trying to decide whether an entire city can raise its minimum wage to $15 an hour without killing a robust economy, the social service agencies, and the numerous immigrant and family businesses that pump new blood into old places.All the evidence shows that, yes, they can \u2014 but only if they do it right, and do it gradually over many years. If they rush into it, as the zealots favor, they could hurt the burgeoning raise-the-minimum-wage movement around the country and deprive Democrats of a great voter stimulant for the midterm elections.Government by sloganeering rarely works. Think: No New Taxes. Every elected Republican would sooner push Grandma over a cliff than break that vow. Yet, a minor tax increase on the rich last year is one big reason the federal budget gap now is far lower than the experts predicted. The deficit for March was the lowest since 2000.Now think: 15 Now. That\u2019s the slogan of a group of far-left activists who are pushing Seattle to force a 61 percent wage increase \u2014 yes, that\u2019s the kind of shock to the system it would be \u2014 on everyone next year but a select group of small businesses and nonprofits.If Seattle\u2019s publicly owned electric utility suddenly announced a 61 percent rate increase on every household, people would be marching in the streets. In recent months, a host of restaurateurs, servers, nonprofit groups \u2014 self-professed progressives all \u2014 have come out against the rush into a blanket $15 wage. In a state that already has the nation\u2019s highest minimum wage, at $9.32 an hour, these people favor giving the lowest workers a raise, just not the blunt application of the $15 figure.Immigrants would be the first to lose their jobs under such a mandate, and many family restaurants would be forced to close, Asian and Latino business owners wrote in a recent letter to Mayor Ed Murray of Seattle. \u201cAs small business owners within the immigrant community, we act as job, language and social training centers for many new immigrants,\u201d the group\u2019s letter stated. \u201cWe forgo our own pay to make payroll.\u201d One consequence of a $15 mandate could be the relocation of entire immigrant communities to neighboring cities.Without question, bottom-wage workers are long overdue for a raise. A majority of the country feels that way, poll after poll shows. In the 15 months since President Obama called for an increase of the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 an hour, seven states and the District of Columbia have bumped their minimum, and another eight states are likely to have ballot measures on the question.Think you can live on $7.25 an hour? Try it. In no single county in the United States can a person working 40 hours a week for the minimum afford the average one-bedroom apartment, according to a federal survey used to figure housing vouchers. Even in the poorest, most-broken rural areas, it takes more than the current minimum to make rent on that one-bedroom home. In San Mateo County, Calif., the most costly housing geography in America, it takes $29.83 an hour to afford that small apartment. In trendy Brooklyn it\u2019s $23.37. Seattle is $17.56.Seattle is a prosperous city, with the right environment for new companies and new ideas. But there is a big undercurrent of anger from those who aren\u2019t part of the ride. Boeing just forced its machinists to downsize their pensions, even as the company posted eye-popping profits. Walmart, with its stores at the city\u2019s edge, makes the rest of us subsidize their low-wage workers, through food stamps and the like. Nationwide, the average Walmart worker makes $8.81 an hour, according to one independent analysis. That\u2019s an insult.You can raise the minimum wage gradually \u2014 as Washington has long done, as has San Francisco, with its current $10.74 an hour, highest among the nation\u2019s big cities \u2014 without a lot of collateral damage. Studies of nine cities and 21 states that upped their minimum over the last decade found almost no effect on employment. Businesses had less turnover and higher worker productivity, while restaurant prices went up only 2 to 3 percent.But a $15 wage base is new territory. The Seattle mayor\u2019s advisory committee is still trying to reach a consensus. The issue will go before the City Council, or to voters in the fall.It sounds mushy, and never pleases shrill voices on the left or the right, but compromise is the essence of democratic rule. When some of the very workers who are supposed to benefit most by a $15 minimum wage \u2014 restaurant servers \u2014 or the nonprofits that espouse social justice call for a go-slow approach, it tells you that something more than bumper-sticker simplicity is needed. Seattle wants to be a model for the rest of the nation. It can be. Or the city could end up a cautionary tale, used in scare ads by the forces of regression.Advertisement"}

Law schools specifically should do more to provide need-based financial aid to students \u2014 rather than what most law schools have been doing in recent years, which is to shift toward financial aid based primarily on merit in order to influence their rankings. This has amounted to \u201cbuying\u201d students who have higher grades and test scores.Finally, the talk of a crisis often cites the decrease in law-school applications for each of the last three years. This overlooks the fact that the number of applications has fluctuated for decades. Many law schools have reduced the size of their classes, to be sure, but this is simply to balance supply and demand.Even if some law schools do not survive the current contraction \u2014 though none have yet gone out of business \u2014 that would not necessarily be a bad thing. After all, in so many other fields, we rely on market mechanisms to weed out the weakest competitors.Our chief concern is that the claims about a crisis in legal education will be the impetus for reforms that will do more harm than good.Some, including the Bar Association\u2019s task force, have suggested that states should reduce the level of undergraduate education required to take the bar exam. Yet the profession benefits enormously by having attorneys who have undergraduate degrees in other fields: This makes them more well rounded and better-educated citizens, as well as better lawyers. Many other countries have begun to recognize this, and nations like South Korea, Japan, China and Australia have recently shifted to the American model of requiring an undergraduate degree before law school.Another common suggestion \u2014 also made by President Obama \u2014 is to reduce law school to two years. This is a terrible idea.The profession needs law schools to produce lawyers who are better prepared to practice law, not less well trained. That would be impossible in two-thirds of the time. If law school were of just two years\u2019 duration, the first things to be cut would be clinical education and interdisciplinary courses, which are the best innovations since we went to law school in the 1970s.We agree that legal education could benefit from further innovation, but not in the ways many of the critics advocate. Law schools need to teach a greater diversity of subjects to improve legal judgment and decision-making. In this respect, law schools should emulate business, architecture and planning schools. These have adapted to new economic realities by emphasizing the teaching of leadership, corporate governance, new finance and negotiation skills.Law school faculties, in their teaching and their scholarship, must deal with the emerging problems of the 21st century. Law schools need to develop new courses to provide students with the expertise to deal with the crucial problems of our time in fields like banking law, national security, conflict resolution, food safety, Internet law and migration policy. There should be \u201cproblem-based\u201d seminars in fields such as public health, homelessness, environmental habitat regulation and world peace.None of this will be possible if law school is cut to two years. Sometimes, less is not more. And sometimes, the rhetoric of crisis leads to proposals that are far worse than the actual problems we face.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yellen Says Fed Is Determined to Improve the Labor Market", "Date": "2014-03-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHICAGO \u2014 Janet L. Yellen, the new Federal Reserve chairwoman, devoted more than an hour last week talking by telephone with three Chicago-area residents struggling to find jobs.On Monday, she made their stories the centerpiece of the first public speech in her new job, delivering a strong statement about her concern over unemployment, her conviction that the Fed has the power to help, and her determination to do so.\u201cIt is my hope,\u201d Ms. Yellen told a conference hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, \u201cthat the courageous and determined working people I have told you about today, and millions more, will get the chance they deserve to build better lives.\u201dThe speech offered a rebuttal to economists, including some Fed officials, who see evidence that the central bank is approaching the limits of its ability to improve labor market conditions. It also leaned against recent indications that Fed officials might be considering a faster retreat from their economic stimulus campaign.Ms. Yellen said that even now, almost five years after the official end of the Great Recession, it remains harder for Americans to find jobs than in the midst of a typical downturn. For those who are working, wages are rising more slowly than usual.\u201cThere remains no doubt that the economy and the job market are not back to normal health,\u201d Ms. Yellen said. \u201cThe recovery still feels like a recession to many Americans and it also looks that way in some economic statistics.\u201dShe said the Fed\u2019s commitment to economic stimulus remained \u201cstrong.\u201dMs. Yellen\u2019s speech also was a departure from the typically dry and abstract style of her predecessors and most of her colleagues. Fed officials rarely discuss individual experiences in their speeches, preferring to talk about trends and patterns.\u201cI have described the experiences of Dorine, Jermaine and Vicki because they tell us important things that the unemployment rate alone cannot,\u201d Ms. Yellen said. \u201cThey are a reminder that there are real people behind the statistics, struggling to get by and eager for the opportunity to build better lives.\u201dThe core of Ms. Yellen\u2019s speech was devoted to a central issue confronting Fed officials as they seek to calibrate their efforts to stimulate the economy. Employment dropped sharply during the recession and has barely recovered. The unemployment rate has fallen because it counts only people who are looking for work, and a lot of people have given up entirely.So the question is how much more monetary policy can do.There is always some \u201cnatural\u201d unemployment as people change jobs. Recessions can also increase \u201cstructural\u201d unemployment if people who lose jobs lack the skills to find new ones, and some economists see evidence that much of current unemployment falls in this category.But Ms. Yellen defended the use of continuing monetary stimulus, citing the \u201cslack\u201d in the economy or the portion of unemployment that can be fixed by stronger growth.Ms. Yellen said she saw layers of evidence supporting the conclusion that much of the current weakness in the job market was cyclical and fixable. The share of workers quitting jobs is unusually low, suggesting a paucity of better opportunities. The share of workers with part-time jobs is unusually high. And wages for all workers are rising very slowly, because an abundant supply of labor is limiting the pressure on employers to pay more.The most obvious evidence of slack is the unemployment rate, which at 6.7 percent in September still stood about two percentage points above its pre-recession low.Ms. Yellen on Monday related the story of Dorine Poole, who lost a job processing medical insurance claims during the recession. \u201cWhen employers started hiring again, two years of unemployment became a disqualification,\u201d she said. \u201cEven those needing her skills and experience preferred less qualified workers without a long spell of unemployment. That career, that part of Dorine\u2019s life, has ended.\u201dYet Ms. Yellen has rejected as \u201ctremendously premature\u201d the conclusion that the Fed should disregard long-term unemployment in adjusting its stimulus campaign. On Monday she said again that she did not see \u201cclear indications\u201d that long-term unemployment would, by itself, prevent people from finding new jobs. Indeed, she said she expected that as the economy improved, many people who had stopped looking for work would return to the labor market, and also find jobs.Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, reached a similar conclusion in an analysis last week. He wrote that recent studies of labor market slack, which predict that inflationary pressures will increase as short-term unemployment returns to normal levels, are based on historical patterns that no longer hold true.Mr. Hatzius also wrote that even if short-term unemployment were the relevant measure of inflationary pressures, the Fed still has a responsibility to maximize employment. \u201cIf anything, one could argue that Fed officials will want to put more weight on long-term unemployment than on short-term unemployment in gauging how close they are in meeting their employment goal, given the evidence that long-term unemployment leaves lasting scars on workers and families,\u201d he wrote.Ms. Yellen also sought to highlight the importance of education in improving job prospects. She began her Chicago trip Sunday night with a duck dinner cooked and served by students in the culinary arts program at the College of DuPage. The community college, west of Chicago, operates a training restaurant.She visited a second community college after her Monday speech, touring a manufacturing classroom at Richard J. Daley College in southwest Chicago, where she watched students flip switches and make giant machines hum.Ms. Yellen asked one recent graduate, Baker Gregory, how much he earned and then, impressed by the answer, whether jobs were available in his field.\u201cDepends on how the U.S. does,\u201d Mr. Gregory said.\u201cWell, we\u2019re doing our best,\u201d Ms. Yellen responded.She reiterated that thought after a round-table discussion with the students and with some of the local employers who hire workers from the community college.\u201cWe\u2019re going to try to make sure that we have a strong enough economy that firms like yours are going to keep on hiring people,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

They also fell in the West, but rose in the Northeast.Although sales of new homes are volatile month-on-month and account for less than 10 percent of the overall market, the drop last month confirmed that housing would again be a drag on gross domestic product in the first quarter.Sales of new homes are counted when contracts are signed. Last month\u2019s decline could still reflect some of the impact from the cold weather.In another report on Wednesday, the Mortgage Bankers Association said applications for home loans fell last week.While housing is struggling, other sectors of the economy, like manufacturing, are regaining momentum as the weather improves.In a separate report, Markit, the financial data company, said its preliminary manufacturing purchasing managers index for the United States was little changed in April.The survey\u2019s measure of output, however, hit its highest level since March 2011, while new orders increased.\u201cWith manufacturing acting as a good bellwether of the rest of the economy, the survey bodes well for further robust economic growth in the second quarter,\u201d said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Chairman of Tax Panel Won\u2019t Run This Year", "Date": "2014-03-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Representative Dave Camp, the Michigan Republican who is the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, announced Monday that he would not run for re-election. \u201cThis decision was reached after much consideration and discussion with my family,\u201d Mr. Camp, 60, said in a statement.\u201cServing in Congress is the great honor of my professional life,\u201d he said. \u201cI am deeply grateful to the people of the Fourth Congressional District for placing their trust in me. Over the years, their unwavering support has been a source of strength, purpose and inspiration.\u201dThe retirement of Mr. Camp, who was first elected to Congress in 1990 \u2014\u00a0the same class as the House speaker, John A. Boehner of Ohio \u2014 did not come as a surprise to many on Capitol Hill. His six-year term as the top Republican on the tax-writing committee ends this year, leaving an opening for Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the Republican Party\u2019s 2012 vice-presidential nominee, to replace him.Mr. Camp\u2019s tax overhaul efforts were dealt another blow last year when he lost his Senate negotiating partner, Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, who became the ambassador to China. Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, now leads the Finance Committee, and he has a long relationship with Mr. Ryan from their efforts to revamp Medicare. Under Mr. Camp\u2019s plan, the tax rate for about 99 percent of Americans would have been, at most, 25 percent, but the remaining 1 percent, whose income is above $450,000 or so, would also have been subject to a 10 percent tax surcharge on certain types of income. The surcharge would have affected salaried professionals like lawyers and accountants, while excluding those whose income comes from industries that produce goods, like manufacturing and farming.In his statement, Mr. Camp said he would continue to work hard to accomplish his goals before he officially left office. \u201cDuring the next nine months, I will redouble my efforts to grow our economy and expand opportunity for every American by fixing our broken tax code, permanently solving physician payments for seniors, strengthening the social safety net and finding new markets for U.S. goods and services,\u201d he said.Mr. Boehner said Mr. Camp was \u201ca leader in the fight to increase economic growth and help create more American jobs by reforming our tax code, pushing for more effective free trade agreements, and saving Social Security and Medicare for future generations.\u201dRepresentative Steve Israel of New York, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, saw Mr. Camp\u2019s retirement in more partisan terms: \u201cYet another senior Republican committee chairman is abandoning John Boehner and his toxic Republican Congress,\u201d Mr. Israel said in a statement.He joins three other members of the Michigan delegation \u2014 two Democrats, Senator Carl Levin and Representative John D.

{"Headline": "Poachers Attack Beloved Elders of California, Its Redwoods", "Date": "2014-04-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by10 PhotosREDWOOD NATIONAL AND STATE PARKS, Calif. \u2014 It was an unlikely crime scene: a steep trail used by bears leading to a still, ancient redwood grove. There, a rare old-growth coast redwood had been brutally hacked about 15 times by poachers, a chain saw massacre that had exposed the tree\u2019s deep red heartwood.While some burls are small and barnacle-like \u2014 perfect for souvenir salt-and-pepper shakers \u2014 others weigh hundreds of pounds and can fetch hundreds or thousands of dollars per slab.The poachers, known locally as the \u201cmidnight burlers,\u201d are motivated by a sluggish local economy and expensive methamphetamine habits, park officials say, and they have been targeting ever-bigger burls and using increasingly brazen tactics. Last year, a redwood estimated to be 400 years old was felled by thieves who wanted access to a 500-pound burl 60 feet up. It was the first time an entire tree was cut down for a burl, said Brett A. Silver, the state park\u2019s supervising ranger.The burl was so massive that the thieves wound up dragging it behind their vehicle, leaving a trail of skid marks. The trail led rangers two and a half miles to the Redwood Highway \u2014 U.S. 101. They found the burl stashed beneath an overpass for safekeeping.\u201cHow many do we have that we haven\u2019t found?\u201d Mr. Silver said of the poached trees. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a property crime. It\u2019s a legacy, like hacking up a church.\u201dOld-growth coast redwoods are among the earth\u2019s most tenacious organisms, some living 2,000 years or more. Removing a burl cuts into a tree\u2019s living cambium layer, which can weaken it and make it vulnerable to insects and disease. Although scientists are not entirely sure how burls are formed or why, they do consider them to be marvels of biodiversity: Giant burls perched like penthouses above the canopy are habitats for mollusks, salamanders and other creatures. \u201cIt\u2019s as if you took a chunk of the forest floor and suspended it into the air,\u201d said Stephen C. Sillett, a professor at Humboldt State University, in Arcata just south of here, who specializes in the ecology of the redwood forest.Park officials liken the crimes to killing elephants for ivory. The most recent episode, discovered in February, involved 21 burls cut from four trees in the park\u2019s northernmost reaches. The park is managed cooperatively by the National Park Service and the California Department of Parks and Recreation; investigations of illegal activities are handled by about 12 law enforcement rangers, approximately one per 11,000 acres.These days, a tight grain of paranoia runs through places like Orick (population 357), which is near the park\u2019s southern entrance and proudly markets itself as a \u201cburlwood capital.\u201d Park investigators have been among the shoppers at establishments like Burl Bill\u2019s that sell redwood gifts \u2014 clocks, bears, bees and unfinished slabs \u2014 for $500 to $700 apiece. \u201cEverything here has been dead for hundreds of years,\u201d said Burl Bill, who declined to give his real name.Orick \u2014 barely hanging on, with only 11 students in its school \u2014 used to be a timber town, but it went into a steep economic decline when its sawmill closed in 2009. Burl poaching, said Joshua Oquist, 27, who grew up in Orick, is \u201ca sad way to earn a living, but there is no industry here.\u201dBecause poaching tends to occur at night off established trails, catching a thief in action is rare, said Paul Gallegos, the Humboldt County district attorney. Quantifying the value of thieves\u2019 spoils is also difficult \u2014 and important, Mr. Gallegos said, as the value \u201ccan distinguish a felony from a misdemeanor.\u201d Local culture plays a role in the thefts as well. \u201cPeople still feel they have a right to extract from the forest to make a living,\u201d Mr. Gallegos said. \u201cBut parks are a state and national resource. These trees belong to the people of the United States of America, so they are in fact stealing from them.\u201dDealers like Landon Buck, 32, who runs what may be the country\u2019s largest operation, redwoodburl.com, said there were legitimate means of acquiring the wood, including through private lands cleared for new development and salvage permits from lumber companies. Mr. Buck \u2014 who looks every bit the burl dealer, with his wool cap and even woollier beard \u2014 bought half a million pounds of redwood burls last year and is a presence on eBay. His vast warehouse in Arcata is filled with specialty woods and works by master carvers. \u201cHey,\u201d he said, glancing around. \u201cWould I risk all this to buy a truckload of burl from some tweaker?\u201dBut there is a strong global demand. Gary Goby, founder of Goby Walnut and Western Hardwoods in Portland, Ore., said that a local buyer might sell a burl to a veneer mill overseas \u2014 perhaps one of many in China \u2014 where it will be sliced into thin layers that bring out the wood\u2019s elegant whorls. \u201cFinding a remote buyer over the Internet is easy, unfortunately,\u201d he said. But it is difficult to put a price tag on a stately and ancient tree. Hiking through moist ferns to a ravaged redwood the other day, Jeff Denny, the state park\u2019s redwood coast sector supervisor, observed that the titans in his midst had survived lightning, fire, high winds and other natural disasters, but poachers with chain saws were something else entirely. Consumers need to be aware of a burl\u2019s source, he said, and \u201cask the tough question: Where does it come from?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Twin Shocks Shake Foundation of German Power ", "Date": "2014-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMemo From BerlinBERLIN \u2014 If there are two qualities prized by modern Germans, they surely are Ruhe (peace and quiet) and Ordnung (order).So the past few months have been profoundly unsettling. First, the United States \u2014 the very power that helped Germany to its feet after 1945 and instilled democracy in the ruins of Hitler\u2019s Reich \u2014 was found to be a less than transparent ally. The National Security Agency, riding roughshod over concepts of privacy and individual freedom treasured by Germans, had collected huge amounts of electronic data from ordinary citizens and had even spied on the chancellor, Angela Merkel.That shocking news \u2014 \u201csnooping among friends, that just doesn\u2019t work,\u201d as Ms. Merkel put it \u2014 is still reverberating through the political elite and most recently spurred Parliament to appoint a committee to look into the case.Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor lionized by many here for having exposed the extent of American intelligence operations, may even testify by video link from his temporary exile in Moscow.Even as anti-Americanism surged, however, the Germans faced a second, more profound shock: The crisis over Ukraine proved that Russia, the giant to the east that Germans know so well from centuries of doing business and waging war, was no longer playing by what Berlin considered the established rules of the 21st century.By replacing the currency of modern diplomacy \u2014 global cooperation, a wariness about using force, a shared trust and belief in agreements \u2014 with the swift, forced annexation of Crimea, Russia threatened the very foundation of Germany\u2019s modern power.As mighty as its economy \u2014 the largest in Europe \u2014 may be, Germany does not, unlike the United States, Britain and France (or Russia, for that matter), have the military clout of a conventional power.\u201cIf push comes to shove,\u201d Ulrich Speck wrote in the weekly newspaper Die Zeit, Britain and France \u201ccould defend themselves. Germany could not.\u201d\u201cGermany needs a world order in which basic principles are respected by all key players,\u201d he added. \u201cThe attack on Ukraine is an attack on the very order that underpins Germany\u2019s freedom, security and prosperity.\u201dAt the same time, hours of more conventional diplomacy in Geneva produced the first agreement between Russia and Ukraine since protesters drove Ukraine\u2019s pro-Russian president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, from power in February.Germans\u2019 relief was audible. Finally, said Sabine Rau, a prominent commentator on the country\u2019s most watched state television channel, Mr. Putin was being rational and was ready to talk.The foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who has traveled and talked ceaselessly since the Ukraine crisis erupted, weighed in from an Easter vacation in northern Italy to caution that the Geneva talks were just \u201ca first step, and many others must now follow.\u201dBut, he emphasized, diplomacy at last had a chance. Germany was back on familiar terrain \u2014 represented in Geneva, notably, not by its own diplomat but by Catherine Ashton, the foreign policy chief of the 28-nation European Union, a partnership so often gently mocked in Washington, but hallowed in Berlin as the real, if cumbersome, governing body of Europe.As Mr. Steinmeier acknowledged, if violence in Ukraine did not subside, the pressure on the West to impose much tougher sanctions on Russia would rise.But behind the scenes, diplomats say, there is a wariness to act, perhaps because of strong German business ties to Russia \u2014 but also because of popular ambivalence.While Mr. Putin, a former K.G.B. officer in Dresden, is unpopular here \u2014 65 percent of Germans view him as dangerous, according to a survey conducted this week by the Allensbach Institute \u2014 68 percent view Russia as a world power, up from 38 percent when Russia intervened in Georgia in 2008.Detailed questioning of 1,006 people polled by telephone on March 31 and April 1 showed that those from the former East Germany \u2014 but also young, educated Germans in the west \u2014 supported negotiation over sanctions, and were inclined to think Germany should steer clear of the whole imbroglio in Ukraine.Nonetheless, the twin shocks from Washington and Moscow to the German political elite are tangible, and will leave a trace.Subsequent reaction suggested that ruhe and ordnung were perhaps too firmly embedded in German political culture. People want to live, he said, in \u201ca giant Switzerland.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Note to Republicans: Channel Jack Kemp", "Date": "2014-04-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWHEN Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, delivered a speech last month outlining proposals for economic growth, his sponsor was the Jack F. Kemp Foundation, a Beltway organization set up in memory of the Republican politician who died in 2009 and has recently been cited as a hero by some of the party\u2019s most prominent figures. Senator Rubio is one outspoken admirer. Another is Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, who worked at Mr. Kemp\u2019s think tank, Empower America, in the 1990s, and has said that Mr. Kemp was one of his principal mentors. Perhaps the most surprising Kemp acolyte, given his anti-establishment persona, is Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky. Mr. Paul has updated Kemp\u2019s most famous idea, \u201curban enterprise zones,\u201d which were intended to entice businesses into struggling inner cities. When Mr. Paul was drawing up his own plan last year, his office got in touch with James Kemp, who heads the foundation named for his father. \u201cI went over and talked to a couple of staffers and looked at the agenda,\u201d Mr. Kemp recalled last week. The result was the \u201ceconomic freedom zones\u201d Mr. Paul unveiled in Detroit in December.It might seem a curious moment for a Jack Kemp revival. Many remember him as an evangelist for supply-side economics and its drastic tax cutting \u2014 exactly the approach some Republicans say needs to be replaced with a fresh agenda that grapples with joblessness and stagnant wages. But there was another side to Kemp, a self-described \u201cbleeding-heart conservative\u201d who preached the gospel of upward mobility, economic opportunity, cultural diversity and racial justice. This Kemp personified the big-tent Republicanism that has gone into hibernation in the Obama years and that some Republicans think is crucial to the party\u2019s success in the 2016 presidential election, when voters will want to hear a more positive message.It is one thing, of course, to emphasize reaching beyond the Republican base, and quite another to connect with other voters, which Kemp was successful in doing. \u201cI watched him interact in poor communities with so clearly a love of people, and a fierce idea of equality,\u201d said Senator Cory A. Booker of New Jersey, a Democratic prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Kemp\u2019s, in an interview last week, recalling how Kemp\u2019s \u201ccompassion, engagement and comfort\u201d shone through when he talked to African-Americans and Latinos. That ease was partly the consequence of Kemp\u2019s years as a professional quarterback \u2014 the tense fourth-quarter huddles and locker-room camaraderie, not to mention his role as one of the few white leaders of a boycott of the American Football League\u2019s All-Star game in 1965, when it was scheduled in New Orleans, a segregated city at the time. Those experiences gave Kemp a street-level credibility rare for politicians in either party, though Mr. Ryan, for one, has been visiting inner cities, accompanied by Bob Woodson, a civil rights activist who worked closely with Kemp. \u201cIt was a brilliant idea,\u201d Mr. Booker said, one that gave a boost to Newark long before Mr. Booker became mayor, and afterward, too. \u201cIt created at least 20,000 jobs, and there was a multiplier effect of financial benefits,\u201d Mr. Booker said. (President Obama has introduced his own version, \u201cPromise Zones.\u201d)Kemp was just as active when he was secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development under the first President Bush.\u201cHe was ahead of his time by pushing an upward mobility agenda for the poor,\u201d said Cesar Conda, a longtime Kemp ally who is now Mr. Rubio\u2019s chief of staff, citing Kemp\u2019s support for \u201ctenant management for public housing and reducing the payroll tax.\u201dBut do such ideas, and the robust government required to fulfill them, square with a Republican Party whose potent Tea Party faction is committed to fiscal austerity and budget cutting? \u201cThat\u2019s a good question,\u201d Mr. Conda said. Following up by email, he suggested this answer: \u201cKemp despised government dependency and redistribution of wealth. In this respect, he would be in perfect tune with the Tea Party.\u201d Mr. Paul seemed to echo this sentiment when he said Mr. Kemp \u201cstood for the idea that the American dream was within every American\u2019s reach, but pro-growth policies are necessary to get the government out of the way.\u201dIn fact, Kemp often advocated a strong federal government and continued to do so after he left active politics.During the subprime mortgage crisis, for example, he called for a loosening of bankruptcy laws to protect \u201cthe estimated 2.2 million families in danger of losing their homes\u201d and then teamed up with Henry G. Cisneros, the housing secretary under Bill Clinton, to urge congressional action against \u201cpredatory and discriminatory lending practices which have had a direct and significant impact on African-American and Latino homeowners and neighborhoods.\u201dThis put Kemp at odds with the Tea Party movement, whose first protests were inspired by President Obama\u2019s attempts to help homeowners in just the way Kemp had advocated. However attractive Kemp\u2019s inclusive conservatism may be in theory, it remains alien to many who now form the Republican base. Some of Kemp\u2019s ideological heirs have already discovered this. In 1990, when he was HUD secretary, the ardently pro-immigrant Kemp threatened to withhold federal funding from the city of Costa Mesa, Calif., unless it repealed laws barring social services for undocumented immigrants.Last summer, Mr. Rubio helped draft the Senate immigration reform bill. Unlike Kemp, he was loudly denounced by conservatives, some of whom still distrust him. If Kemp \u201cwere still alive he\u2019d have an important role,\u201d Mr. Rubio said when I spoke with him in Washington two weeks ago. \u201cI think he\u2019d be the senior statesman of the reform movement. People would be looking to him as a stamp of approval on a lot of these ideas and we\u2019d be relying on him as a communicator.\u201dThe question is whether Republicans are ready to listen.A writer at large for The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Unemployment Claims Decline to Nearly a 7-Year Low", "Date": "2014-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits tumbled last week to the lowest level in nearly seven years, strengthening views of faster job growth.The report on jobless claims on Thursday was the latest sign of economic momentum after an unusually cold winter slowed activity.\u201cThe return of warmer temperatures has brought with it better data,\u201d said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors. \u201cThere are a number of signs that progress in the jobs market could be accelerating, a positive sign for the broad economy as well.\u201d Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 32,000 to a seasonally adjusted 300,000 for last week, the Labor Department said. That was the lowest level since May 2007, before the 2007-9 recession.The report joined other indicators, including automobile sales and employment data, in suggesting that the economy ended the first quarter on surer footing, positioning it for faster growth in the second quarter.First-quarter economic growth is expected to have slowed sharply from the fourth quarter\u2019s annual 2.6 percent pace, largely because of the harsh weather and businesses placing fewer orders with manufacturers while working off huge stockpiles accumulated in the second half of 2013.\u201cThe rate of involuntary job losses slowed in early April, which suggests we could have a further pickup in job growth in April,\u201d said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics. \u201cWe think that the unemployment rate could fall faster than the Federal Reserve expects over the next year.\u201dJob growth averaged 195,000 a month in February and March, with the unemployment rate holding at 6.7 percent, nearly a five-year low, in that period.Still, the recent job market upturn is unlikely to cause the Federal Reserve to rush to start raising interest rates when it winds down its monthly bond-buying program this year.The Fed slashed overnight interest rates to a record low of zero to 0.25 percent in December 2008 and pledged to keep them low while nursing the economy back to health.Minutes of its March 18-19 policy meeting, published on Wednesday, suggested that officials were not eager to start tightening monetary policy.A second report on Thursday from the Labor Department showed that import prices increased 0.6 percent last month after rising 0.9 percent in February.The increase exceeded economists\u2019 expectations for a 0.2 percent gain and was driven by food prices, which recorded their largest advance in three years. Otherwise, there was little sign of a broader pickup in imported inflation.\u201cThe U.S. can\u2019t import any inflation,\u201d said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. \u201cIf this is on the Fed\u2019s inflation dashboard, there are no inflationary pressures to speak of coming in from overseas.\u201dLast month, imported food prices jumped 3.7 percent, the biggest increase since March 2011, after falling 0.7 percent in February. Prices for imported fuel rose 1.2 percent last month, slowing from a 5.3 percent surge in February.Without food and fuel, import prices rose 0.2 percent after slipping 0.1 percent in February.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hey, Big Thinker", "Date": "2014-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCultural StudiesIt is unclear how many people have actually read Thomas Piketty\u2019s treatise \u201cCapital in the Twenty-First Century\u201d \u2014 577 pages of text and graphs plus 78 pages of notes and, for added clarity, an appendage called \u201cContents in Detail.\u201d\u201cWe have six printings on the way,\u201d the book\u2019s publicist said \u2014 two each in the United States, England and India. Meanwhile, Mr. Piketty, fresh from a triumphant visit to Washington (where he met with members the Obama administration) was in New York, being shuttled from MSNBC to NPR. One devoted fan had even set up a Twitter feed, consisting of images of Mr. Piketty, boyishly handsome at 42, and inviting the verdict \u201chot or not.\u201d All of which is to say that however original Mr. Piketty\u2019s economic argument may be, he is the newest version of a familiar, if not exactly common specimen: the overnight intellectual sensation whose stardom reflects the fashions and feelings of the moment.A month ago only economists and policy wonks had heard of him. Today, he is filling a void \u2014 not to mention op-ed columns. His ruthless dissection of free-market injustice took root 15 years ago in the subsoil of tax archives and mathematical formulas. But it has blossomed anew on the couches of TV talk-show hosts and in glossy magazine spreads. Well, at least Mr. Piketty has. His book, and its discussion of, say, \u201cThe Ups and Downs of Ricardian Equivalence,\u201d could prove as daunting to most readers as Mr. Lasch\u2019s analysis of \u201cthe banality of pseudo self-awareness\u201d or Mr. Bloom\u2019s charting of the path that led \u201cFrom Socrates\u2019 Apology to Heidegger\u2019s Rektoratsrede.\u201dNot that it really matters. He has already joined the rare company of the ultraserious big thinker whose big idea truly commands the public stage. Without having the benefit of Mr. Piketty\u2019s giant data-mining operation, one can only speculate as to how often these rare birds appear. But a decent guess is two or three per decade. Why so few? Because it\u2019s not enough just to have a grand thesis \u2014 or, at the very least, a provocative new argument. The intellectual superstar or rock star not only captures the zeitgeist but must also in some way personify it. As Ms. Sontag worked through the long history of outlaw art, she made herself, and her reactions, part of the story. \u201cI am strongly drawn to Camp, and almost as strongly offended by it,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThat is why I want to talk about it, and why I can.\u201d That she talked about it in the pages of Partisan Review, a bastion of somber high seriousness, compounded the allure. So did Ms. Sontag\u2019s dramatic good looks and sleek black-clad figure. Eventually she would impersonate herself in Woody Allen\u2019s \u201cZelig\u201d and pose for Annie Leibovitz. To this day, no intellectual has so elegantly played the role she actually lived. If Ms. Sontag meshed with the buoyant \u201960s, so the curmudgeonly Mr. Lasch gratified the self-absorbed, wound-licking 1970s. The same lost souls who gathered in the suburban revival tents of consciousness-raising and encounter groups, or who absorbed the preachments of self-help and self-actualization gurus, were secretly looking for punishment. Published during the last weary lap of Jimmy Carter\u2019s presidency (the oil shortage and stagflation, the hostage crisis in Iran), it impressed even Mr. Carter, who invited Mr. Lasch to dine at the White House. Mr. Carter\u2019s \u201cmalaise\u201d speech drew on Mr. Lasch\u2019s cultural critique \u2014 and in places echoed it.Mr. Lasch, to give him credit, didn\u2019t choose his celebrity. It was thrust upon him. And when the fad for his book ended, he happily retreated to his perch at the University of Rochester and wrote books, some of them better books than the one that made him famous. A more ambiguous case was that of Allan Bloom, who became the flamboyant philosopher-king of the Reagan-era culture wars and personified the decade\u2019s strange blend of moralism and excess. Fittingly, he taught at the University of Chicago, the intellectual citadel of the Reagan years, and so gave much of the public its first glimpse of the Hyde Park intellectual: the synthesizing worldview, the liturgy drawn from the Great Books. When Mr. Bloom asserted that Margaret Mead \u201cand others who found America too narrow\u201d were \u201cactively hostile to the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution,\u201d it didn\u2019t sound like a smear (even if it was), but rather like a learned assessment.To some extent, Mr. Bloom was the faculty-club version of Gordon Gekko in Oliver Stone\u2019s \u201cWall Street\u201d (released the same year as \u201cThe Closing of the American Mind\u201d). Both were sermonizers who lived like libertines. The title character in Saul Bellow\u2019s 2000 novel \u201cRavelstein,\u201d who was closely modeled on Mr. Bloom, splurges on Armani suits and Cuban cigars.So, too, his utopian thesis \u2014 that the collapse of Soviet communism ended a century of ideological conflict and sealed the \u201cunabashed victory of economic and political liberalism\u201d \u2014 reflected the hopes created by the \u201cpeace dividend\u201d in the 1990s. The century seemed to be concluding on a high note, and Mr. Fukuyama spread the gospel of triumph.The 21st century has been less welcoming to big thinkers. The Internet and social media favor the bite-size thought over the grand thesis, the sharp insight over the belles-lettristic narrative. Gifted thinkers, like the political scientist Robert Putnam and the psychologist Daniel Kahneman, are better known through the writings of popularizers than through their own work. It has been the age of idea-savvy journalists (Malcolm Gladwell, Michael Lewis) rather than of scholars and intellectuals.Ms. Power, too, was a figure matched with her moment, which demanded action rather than passive witness. She helped found the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy at the Harvard University Kennedy School of Government and then entered government. She is now, of course, the American ambassador to the United Nations. Thanks to her flowing red mane, she has also become catnip for fashion photographers.And what of Mr. Piketty? The ingredients of superstardom are all there. His big argument, made in surprisingly digestible prose, that \u201cthe rich get richer\u201d is no mere throwaway line in the have-nots\u2019 lyric of resentment but an iron law of the free-market system. His warning of calamitous \u201cdrift toward oligarchy\u201d comes at a time when income inequality has begun to dominate public discussion and when the \u201cwar on poverty,\u201d now 50 years old, has brought back memories of an activist government unafraid to address grave social ills. If Mr. Piketty\u2019s forthrightness suits the moment, so does his appetite for data. In the age of the cool-geek statistical wizardry of Ezra Klein and Nate Silver, Mr. Piketty has outdone them all, with his 15 years of research covering 30 countries (and counting). At the same time, his decision to spare readers the details of mathematical \u201cmodeling\u201d (he directs readers to a website) shows a savvy awareness of 21st-century attention spans.Will Mr. Piketty achieve longstanding star status like Ms. Sontag and Ms. Power? Or will he retreat back to his scholarly lair like Mr. Lasch and Mr. Fukuyama? It will be up to Mr. Piketty, but also to the public. Tastes are fickle, and even big thinkers can go out of fashion.SAM TANENHAUS, a writer at large at The Times, was editor of The New York Times Book Review from 2004 to 2013. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Losing Ground in the Amazon", "Date": "2014-04-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialA global forest mapping system developed by a team of scientists from the University of Maryland, Google and the United States government is now able to pinpoint exactly where and at what rate deforestation is occurring around the world. The results are alarming. The world is losing the equivalent of 50 soccer fields of forest every minute. In Brazil \u2014 home to 60 percent of the Amazon rain forest and a major component of the planet\u2019s climate system \u2014 the rate of deforestation jumped 28 percent during 2012-13. Environmentalists say a 2012 change in Brazil\u2019s regulations governing forest conservation is partly responsible. Brazil had been making good progress. From a high of 10,588 square miles in 2004, deforestation dropped to 1,797 square miles in 2011; the number of metric tons of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere dropped as well, from 1.1 billion metric tons in 2004 to 298 million metric tons in 2011. These successes resulted from aggressive enforcement of the country\u2019s 1965 Forest Code, and a 2006 soy moratorium, a voluntary pledge brokered by the Brazilian government, agribusiness and environmental groups to prevent trade in soybeans cultivated on deforested land. Soybeans aren\u2019t the only cause of deforestation in Brazil, but they are a major factor. Brazil is now the world\u2019s second-largest producer of soybeans after the United States. Soybeans have been a boon to Brazil\u2019s economy, and global demand is growing. Under intense pressure from agricultural interests, Brazil\u2019s Chamber of Deputies approved legislation in July 2012 that rolled back many provisions of the 1965 Forest Code, reduced the amount of reserve areas in the Amazon and gave amnesty to past violators. To her credit, Brazil\u2019s president, Dilma Rousseff, thwarted some of the most damaging provisions of the new legislation, but the rate of deforestation still rose.The soy moratorium has been extended until the end of 2014, by which time Brazil plans to have in place new mechanisms to monitor soybean cultivation on deforested land. These mechanisms must be backed by credible enforcement. And developed countries need to do more to help Brazil, Indonesia and other nations whose forests are at risk protect a resource in which everyone has a stake. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "March Retail Sales Surged, Bolstering Hopes", "Date": "2014-04-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Retail sales recorded their largest gain in one and a half years in March, in a decisive sign the economy is bouncing back from its weather-induced slowdown.The upbeat report released on Monday was the latest to indicate growth would most likely accelerate in the second quarter after an unusually cold and snowy winter hobbled spending early in the year.\u201cIt shows there is an underlying current of strength in the economy despite the drag from the severe winter weather,\u201d said Robert Dye, chief economist at Comerica Bank.The report, released by the Commerce Department, said retail sales increased 1.1 percent last month, the biggest gain since September 2012, with receipts rising in nearly all categories.The increase in February was raised to 0.7 percent from a previously reported 0.3 percent. Economists had expected retail sales, which account for a third of consumer spending, to advance only 0.8 percent last month.The retail sales figures, when combined with recent employment data, suggest the economy found some momentum at the end of the first quarter. Job growth averaged 195,000 a month in February and March, an improvement over the previous two months, and first-time applications for unemployment benefits in early April fell back to their prerecession level.These signals have bolstered hopes that growth this year will be the fastest since the 2007-9 recession.\u201cThis is not a fragile economy,\u201d said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. \u201cThe linchpin of economic growth \u2014 the consumer \u2014 is back, and with the consumer\u2019s help, growth will be even faster in 2014.\u201d A separate report on Monday showed that business inventories rose a little less than expected as sales rebounded, suggesting a slow pace of restocking could have affected economic growth in the first quarter.The Commerce Department said inventories increased 0.4 percent in February after rising by the same margin in January.Economists polled by Reuters had expected inventories to rise 0.5 percent in February.Inventories are a critical component of changes in the gross domestic product. Retail inventories, excluding autos, which go into the calculation of gross domestic product, rose just 0.2 percent. That followed a 0.6 percent rise in January. Motor vehicle inventories fell for a second straight month.Businesses accumulated too much inventory in the second half of last year and are placing fewer orders with manufacturers as they work through the pile of unsold goods.That has left the inventory-to-sales ratio at its highest level since September 2009. But with consumers showing an appetite to spend because of improving household wealth, businesses should be able to reduce their bloated stocks.First-quarter growth estimates now range as low as a 0.5 percent annual pace. Many economists, however, expect growth at a rate of about 3 percent in the second quarter and through the rest of the year.Core retail sales, which strip out automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services and correspond most closely to the consumer spending component of the government\u2019s report on the gross domestic product, increased 0.8 percent in March.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "European Finance Ministers Approve New Loans for Greece", "Date": "2014-04-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 Euro zone finance ministers, meeting in Athens under tight security on Tuesday, approved the release of 8.3 billion euros in rescue loans to Greece, pointing to signs that the country is emerging from its economic crisis.\u201cIt has been an arduous process, but now we have a positive outcome,\u201d Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister and head of the Eurogroup of finance ministers, said at a news conference in Athens announcing loans worth $11.5 billion.In light of recent street demonstrations by Greeks protesting the belt-tightening measures that have been necessary to keep the bailout money flowing, security in Athens was stepped up for the event. The police banned demonstrations in much of the city center, and helicopters circled the site where foreign dignitaries were gathered.The talks focused on the progress of Greece\u2019s economic overhaul and the enduring problem of unemployment that plagues much of the euro zone. The agenda also included the continued efforts to form a more unified banking system in Europe, a possible package of financial assistance to Ukraine and the political context in France after the ruling Socialists\u2019 big losses in local elections over the weekend.As for Greece, Mr. Dijsselbloem said a seven-month review by the country\u2019s international lenders \u2014 the troika consisting of the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund \u2014 \u201ccan now be closed\u201d after the Greek Parliament\u2019s approval of economic overhauls on Monday.The provisions included contentious measures lifting barriers to competition and a new framework for the recapitalization of Greek banks. The troika\u2019s review was the longest \u2014 and Greek officials said it was the toughest \u2014 since Athens signed its first loan agreement with the lenders in the spring of 2010.But Greek officials and representatives of the lenders said efforts to overhaul the economy had yielded the first indications of a return to growth in Greece after six of years of grinding recession that has hammered living standards and pushed unemployment to a record level of nearly 28 percent. Officials in Athens are eager to begin talks on lightening the huge debt burden, considering that Greece is on track to post a budget surplus this year before debt repayments. It forecasts that this primary surplus will come in at \u20ac2.4 billion for 2013.Eurogroup officials said a date for the beginning of those talks would be set, assuming the European Union\u2019s statistics service, Eurostat, confirms the Greek forecast this month. Athens is also planning a return to the capital markets, a move that the European monetary and economic affairs commissioner, Olli Rehn, said Tuesday could happen \u201cat some point in the relatively near future.\u201dEurogroup officials would not comment on speculation about the possible need for a third bailout for Greece, should the country not be able to cover its funding needs on its own. Mr. Dijsselbloem said he shared the Greek government\u2019s \u201cambition\u201d to avoid such an eventuality but added, \u201cIt\u2019s too early to say.\u201dLater in the day the Greek finance minister, Yannis Stournaras, said that Athens planned to make a \u201csmall\u201d issue of three- or five-year bonds in the first half of this year.Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the summit meeting, Mr. Stournaras, who has coordinated the tough negotiation with foreign auditors, stressed that Athens was focused on putting into effect reforms tied to rescue loans. He said the measures Greece must enforce had already been agreed to, suggesting that no more were in the works.\u201cThanks to the sacrifices of the Greek people,\u201d he said, \u201cwe have the luxury to be able to discuss economic growth rather than fiscal adjustment.\u201dThe disbursement of the international loans, which is to be made in three allotments in coming months, will depend on Greece\u2019s enforcing the agreed-to measures, Mr. Dijsselbloem said. A first installment, of \u20ac6.3 billion, is to be made at the end of April, with slices worth \u20ac1 billion each expected in June and July. Together with \u20ac3.4 billion the International Monetary Fund is expected to approve separately, the money will enable Greece to pay down some \u20ac9 billion in bonds maturing in May and secure the country\u2019s solvency.The president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, was at the summit meeting and praised Greece for its efforts, noting that the country \u201chas suffered greatly but is now starting to see the first benefits of the program.\u201d But he stressed that the fiscal adjustment achieved so far \u201cmust not unravel.\u201dAsked at a news conference to comment on a separate topic in the euro zone \u2014 the potential risks of worrisomely low inflation \u2014 Mr. Draghi declined to discuss it. \u201cCome back on Thursday in Frankfurt,\u201d he responded, referring to a scheduled E.C.B. meeting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Three Expensive Milliseconds", "Date": "2014-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThink about it. You may or may not buy Mr. Lewis\u2019s depiction of the high-frequency types as villains and those trying to thwart them as heroes. (If you ask me, there are no good guys in this story.) But either way, spending hundreds of millions of dollars to save three milliseconds looks like a huge waste. And that\u2019s part of a much broader picture, in which society is devoting an ever-growing share of its resources to financial wheeling and dealing, while getting little or nothing in return.Mr. Philippon starts with the familiar observation that finance has grown much faster than the economy as a whole. Specifically, the share of G.D.P. accruing to bankers, traders, and so on has nearly doubled since 1980, when we started dismantling the system of financial regulation created as a response to the Great Depression.What are we getting in return for all that money? Not much, as far as anyone can tell. Mr. Philippon shows that the financial industry has grown much faster than either the flow of savings it channels or the assets it manages. Defenders of modern finance like to argue that it does the economy a great service by allocating capital to its most productive uses \u2014 but that\u2019s a hard argument to sustain after a decade in which Wall Street\u2019s crowning achievement involved directing hundreds of billions of dollars into subprime mortgages.But if our supersized financial sector isn\u2019t making us either safer or more productive, what is it doing? One answer is that it\u2019s playing small investors for suckers, causing them to waste huge sums in a vain effort to beat the market. Don\u2019t take my word for it \u2014 that\u2019s what the president of the American Finance Association declared in 2008. Another answer is that a lot of money is going to speculative activities that are privately profitable but socially unproductive.In short, we\u2019re giving huge sums to the financial industry while receiving little or nothing \u2014 maybe less than nothing \u2014 in return. Mr. Philippon puts the waste at 2 percent of G.D.P. Yet even that figure, I\u2019d argue, understates the true cost of our bloated financial industry. For there is a clear correlation between the rise of modern finance and America\u2019s return to Gilded Age levels of inequality.So never mind the debate about exactly how much damage high-frequency trading does. It\u2019s the whole financial industry, not just that piece, that\u2019s undermining our economy and our society.Advertisement"}

Yellen, eased investor concerns about an earlier-than-expected increase in short-term interest rates.This was the fifth straight quarterly rise for both the S.&P. 500 and the Nasdaq composite index, though it was the smallest three-month advance for both since the fourth quarter of 2012. Both the Dow Jones industrial average and the S.&P. 500 rose for a second straight month in March.The gains were broad on Monday, with nine of the S.&P. 500\u2019s 10 sector indexes rising for the day. About 73 percent of stocks traded on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq closed higher.The S.&P. materials sector index was the best performer, jumping 2.1 percent, while the S.&P. utility sector index advanced 1.3 percent.Technology and financial shares, which along with materials are tied to the pace of economic growth, also outperformed for the day. Micron Technology climbed $1.75, or 8 percent, to $23.66, ranking as the S.&P. 500\u2019s top percentage gainer. Oracle rose $1.34, or 3.4 percent, to $40.91.In her first public speech since becoming the Fed\u2019s chairwoman two months ago, Ms. Yellen said that the central bank\u2019s \u201cextraordinary\u201d commitment to stimulating the economy would be needed for some time to come.Earlier in March, Ms. Yellen raised concerns by saying that the period between the end of the Fed\u2019s bond-buying program and the first rate increase from the central bank could be six months, a faster timeline than many had anticipated.\u201cWhat Yellen did today was to alleviate that confusion and provide more clarity,\u201d said Joseph Tanious, global market strategist at J.P.

The Dow rose 0.8 percent for the month, but fell 0.7 percent in the quarter. The Nasdaq fell 2.5 percent for March, but rose 0.5 percent in the quarter.Biotechnology stocks stayed in focus following recent volatility when investors took profits in the high-flying sector. The Nasdaq biotechnology index jumped 3 percent, following a 7 percent drop last week, in what was the index\u2019s fifth consecutive weekly decline.Among some of the more active biotech stocks, Vertex Pharmaceuticals climbed $2.92, or 4.3 percent, to $70.72, and Biogen jumped $11.75, or 4 percent, to $305.87.In economic news, the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s Chicago business barometer dropped to 55.9 in March, its lowest level since August, and down from 59.8 in February. Economists\u2019 median forecast in a Reuters poll was for a reading of 59.0.Among the stocks on the move, the American-listed shares of Prana Biotechnology of Australia plunged $7.06, or 71.6 percent, to $2.80 after the company said its experimental drug to treat Alzheimer\u2019s disease failed to meet the main goal of a midstage study in patients with a mild form of the condition.UTi Worldwide dropped 67 cents, or 6 percent, to $10.59, after the supply-chain management company reported a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss, hurt by weak demand for airfreight as customers chose cheaper modes of shipping.In the bond market, interest rates were stable.

Cuomo\u2019s call to consider building a casino resort in New York to help him revive an upstate economy wracked by unemployment and declining opportunities.But with applicants required to post a $1 million application fee for one of the four available licenses by Wednesday night, Caesars Entertainment has entered the contest, with plans for an entertainment complex worth more than $750 million, about 50 miles north of Midtown Manhattan.Caesars, which operates 53 casinos worldwide, including four in Atlantic City, is proposing a hotel and casino complex with shops, restaurants and an entertainment hall on a 120-acre parcel in the town of Woodbury, N.Y., near the New York Thruway and a Metro-North Railroad train station.The site, in Orange County, is a short distance from Woodbury Common Premium Outlets, a mall that attracts more than 11 million visitors a year, and offers critical highway and public transit connections to New York City and millions of potential customers.\u201cIt\u2019ll be an integrated resort,\u201d Jan Jones Blackhurst, an executive vice president at Caesars, said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about creating an entertainment venue where gaming is a piece but not the only piece.\u201dMs. Blackhurst is still working out the details of the proposal, since the company signed a letter of intent with the developer who controls the property, David Flaum, just three days ago. Mr. Flaum would lease the property to Caesars and participate in developing the complex.Caesars, which submitted its $1 million application fee on Tuesday, is one of at least four companies vying for a casino license in Orange County. A total of 16 groups are expected to compete for the four licenses.The casinos will be allowed in three regions: the Catskills and the Hudson Valley, which includes Orange, Sullivan and Ulster Counties; the Saratoga-Albany region; and a narrow strip in western New York, running from Binghamton north to the Canadian border.Mr. Flaum and James D. Featherstonhaugh, who owns a racetrack and slot parlor in Saratoga Springs, are submitting proposals for casinos in the Albany area. Three other proposals are expected in western New York. But nowhere is the competition as intense as in the Catskills.Mr. Cuomo, who led the effort to expand gambling in the state as a way to generate jobs, economic development and tax revenue, had sought to entice Las Vegas casino operators to compete for a New York license and legitimize his initiative.Las Vegas Sands, MGM and Boyd Gaming all hired New York consultants to explore the idea, but only Caesars was interested in an upstate casino.\u201cMost of the national casino companies want to be where the money is \u2014 downstate,\u201d said John Sabini, the former chairman of the State Racing and Wagering Board, and a casino in Orange County would put Caesars in proximity to the biggest prize for gambling operators: densely populated New York City.But casino developers in Sullivan and Ulster Counties, where local officials have long hoped that gambling would revive their flagging economies, are dismayed by the idea of casinos on their southern flank.They say an Orange County casino would take business away from existing slot parlors in Monticello in Sullivan County and in Yonkers and Queens, while undermining chances to build a full-scale casino in their counties, which are roughly 90 miles from New York City. Charles Jacobs, senior vice president of the Cordish companies, which is proposing a $750 million casino-resort in Orange County, near Woodbury, seems to agree. Last week, he told local officials that building a casino in the Catskills was a \u201crecipe for disaster,\u201d according to The Times Herald-Record in Middletown, N.Y.He said Orange County\u2019s proximity to New York City would trump any potential casinos in Ulster or Sullivan Counties.But State Senator John J. Bonacic, a Republican who represents the Catskills, said the casino legislation was meant to create jobs and economic activity at the north end of the region, not in more prosperous Orange County.State tax revenues from gambling would also decline if there is an Orange County casino, said Emanuel R. Pearlman, chairman of Empire Resorts, which operates the racetrack and slot parlor in Monticello and, together with EPR Properties, is proposing to build a $750 million casino-resort in Monticello. \u201cA casino in Orange County would dramatically dilute revenue to the state,\u201d Mr. Pearlman said. \u201cIt won\u2019t add to state revenues like a casino in Sullivan or Ulster counties.The state\u2019s newly inaugurated Gaming Commission and its siting board will determine this fall who will get the licenses. All the applicants are required to show they would be able to open their casinos in 2016, and demonstrate local support for their projects.That timeline could prove difficult for projects in Orange County that do not already have environmental approvals. Mark A. Izeman, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, has said he is prepared to battle in court against any casino project that could do harm in the Catskills.The Orange County executive, Steven M. Neuhaus, has embraced the notion of a casino setting down roots in the county. But not everyone agrees.\u201cThere certainly is a mixed feeling on the street out there,\u201d John Burke, supervisor for the town of Woodbury, said. \u201cThere are those who would enjoy it, mainly because of the tax revenues.\u201cBut there may be just as many people who say, \u2018I didn\u2019t move here to have a casino in my backyard.' \u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated part of the name of the organization that Mark A. Izeman, a lawyer, is associated with. It is the Natural Resources Defense Council, not the National Resources Defense Council.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Census Survey Revisions Mask Health Law Effects", "Date": "2014-04-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Census Bureau, the authoritative source of health insurance data for more than three decades, is changing its annual survey so thoroughly that it will be difficult to measure the effects of President Obama\u2019s health care law in the next report, due this fall, census officials said.The changes are intended to improve the accuracy of the survey, being conducted this month in interviews with tens of thousands of households around the country. But the new questions are so different that the findings will not be comparable, the officials said. An internal Census Bureau document said that the new questionnaire included a \u201ctotal revision to health insurance questions\u201d and, in a test last year, produced lower estimates of the uninsured. Thus, officials said, it will be difficult to say how much of any change is attributable to the Affordable Care Act and how much to the use of a new survey instrument.\u201cWe are expecting much lower numbers just because of the questions and how they are asked,\u201d said Brett J. O\u2019Hara, chief of the health statistics branch at the Census Bureau.With the new questions, \u201cit is likely that the Census Bureau will decide that there is a break in series for the health insurance estimates,\u201d says another agency document describing the changes. This \u201cbreak in trend\u201d will complicate efforts to trace the impact of the Affordable Care Act, it said.A major goal of the law is to increase the number of people with health insurance. The White House reported that 7.5 million people signed up for private health plans on the new insurance exchanges and that enrollment in Medicaid increased by three million since October. But the administration has been unable to say how many of the people gaining coverage were previously uninsured or had policies canceled, so the net increase in coverage is unclear.Tara McGuinness, a White House spokeswoman, said the changes in the questionnaire would \u201cmake it easier to measure the impact of the Affordable Care Act because it will be possible to compare data from 2013 and 2014.\u201d But officials said that the data for this year would not ordinarily be available until September 2015, and that the data for 2013 and 2014 would not be directly comparable with the long series of data for prior years.Census officials and researchers have long expressed concerns about the old version of insurance questions in the Current Population Survey, and for more than a decade the agency has been trying to make it more accurate.The questionnaire traditionally used by the Census Bureau provides an \u201cinflated estimate of the uninsured\u201d and is prone to \u201cmeasurement errors,\u201d said a working paper by statisticians and demographers at the agency. In the test last year, the percentage of people without health insurance was 10.6 percent when interviewers used the new questionnaire, compared with 12.5 percent using the old version. Researchers said that they had found a similar pattern in the data for different age, race and ethnic groups.In addition, \u201cthe percentage of people with private coverage was statistically higher\u201d when the bureau tested the new questionnaire, the working paper said. For reasons that are not clear, people were less likely to respond when interviewers used the new questionnaire. Another Census Bureau paper said \u201cit is coincidental and unfortunate timing\u201d that the survey was overhauled just before major provisions of the health care law took effect. \u201cIdeally,\u201d it said, \u201cthe redesign would have had at least a few years to gather base line and trend data.\u201dThe old questionnaire asked consumers if they had various types of coverage at any time in the prior year. The new survey asks if they have insurance at the time of the interview \u2014 in February, March or April \u2014 then uses follow-up questions to find out when that coverage began and what months it was in effect. Using this technique, census officials believe they will be able to reconstruct the history of coverage month by month over a period of about 15 months.However, Mr. O\u2019Hara of the Census Bureau said the agency was not planning to release coverage data from early this year in its next report. Agency officials want to assess the reliability of the monthly data, being collected this year for the first time. The White House is always looking for evidence to show the benefits of the health law, which is an issue in many of this year\u2019s midterm elections. The Department of Health and Human Services and the White House Council of Economic Advisers requested several of the new questions, and the White House Office of Management and Budget approved the new questionnaire. But the decision to make fundamental changes in the survey was driven by technical experts at the Census Bureau, and members of Congress have not focused on it or suggested political motives. The new survey was conceived, in part, to reduce a kind of bias or confusion in the old survey. When asked about their insurance arrangements in the prior year, people tended to give answers about their coverage at the time of the interview \u2014 forgetting, for example, if they had Medicaid for a few months early in the prior year.People are continually moving on and off Medicaid rolls. The number of people who say in surveys that they have Medicaid coverage is almost always lower than the enrollment figures reported by federal and state agencies that administer the program.The new survey asks people if they have coverage through an exchange, if it has premiums and if the premiums are subsidized.Census Bureau research in Massachusetts found that consumers \u201cinevitably conflate Medicaid and the subsidized exchange.\u201d And many people with subsidized private insurance, purchased on the exchange, said they were receiving coverage from the government or the state.Such perceptions are understandable. \u201cExchange coverage is a hybrid, partly private and partly government,\u201d said Joanne Pascale, a Census Bureau researcher who helped develop the new questionnaire.Kathleen Thiede Call, a professor at the University of Minnesota who was consulted by the Census Bureau, said: \u201cI am excited about the redesign of the survey. For the first time, we will be able to look at monthly changes in coverage over a 14- or 15-month period.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Ms. Bratusek said earlier at the party congress that she could not lead the government if she lost the vote. \u201cWithout the support within my own party, I can no longer be the prime minister,\u201d she said.Mr. Jankovic, 61, appealed to Ms. Bratusek after the party vote on Saturday to remain as prime minister. Ms. Bratusek\u2019s three coalition partners in the four-party center-left government have said they will drop out of the cabinet if Mr. Jankovic, the subject of a corruption investigation, becomes the party leader. If the government collapses in a confidence vote in Parliament, elections are likely to follow as early as June.Ms. Bratusek, 44, a former Finance Ministry official, took office in March last year after the previous center-right government fell over allegations of corruption and the slow pace of reforms. Her government has reduced public spending and started to heal ailing banks to avoid a European Union bailout.Bad bank loans are at the center of crisis in Slovenia, once considered a model for Eastern and Central European nations trying to make the transition from a centralized economy to a free-market system. Slovenia became a member of the European Union in 2004, 13 years after it declared independence from Yugoslavia.Mr. Jankovic, 61, has denied corruption charges leveled against him by an antigraft watchdog group.The Civic List, a junior partner in the coalition government, urged immediate talks on the early election date.Mr. Jankovic, a wealthy businessman, founded Positive Slovenia in 2011. Although the party won the most votes in the parliamentary elections that year, he was unable to form a coalition government after the vote. He stepped down from the party leadership in 2013 to allow his successor, Ms. Bratusek, to form the new government.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Italy\u2019s Mob Extends Reach in Europe", "Date": "2014-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 The small businesses were sprinkled throughout the Italian capital: One restaurant was only a few blocks from the Senate. A cafe was at the edge of the upscale diplomatic district, while a gelato shop was near the Pantheon. There was even a hotel not far from the hilltop statue of Giuseppe Garibaldi, the hero of Italy\u2019s unification.The crackdown in Rome exposed just a small corner of what officials describe as a mob economy that has rapidly expanded across Europe. In an era of austerity, with Italy awash in debt and struggling to recover, organized crime groups are sitting on mountains of cash. They have taken advantage of the economic crisis to accelerate their infiltration of legitimate businesses outside their southern Italian strongholds and now control commercial interests in Rome and Milan, as well as in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Scotland, Spain and beyond.\u201cFor the last 20 years, they have a lot of liquidity,\u201d said Michele Prestipino, the prosecutor who oversaw the recent crackdown and seizures in Rome. \u201cThis is a problem today. They have too much money. They can\u2019t invest it all. It is the opposite of what happens to regular entrepreneurs.\u201dExperts say Europe must introduce tough organized crime laws, like those that already exist in Italy, and expand law enforcement efforts. Some say the same focus that is applied to fighting terrorism should be applied to confronting organized crime. Besides Italian mob groups, experts say, other criminal organizations, including ones from Albania, China and Russia, are also moving into legal business sectors in Europe.\u201cDemocracies underestimate the fight against the Mafia,\u201d said Giuseppe Lumia, a senator and member of Italy\u2019s Anti-Mafia Commission. \u201cMafias have become global. They do business, and do money laundering, between countries. But the anti-Mafia agencies are national and local.\u201dThe richest organized crime family is believed to be the \u2019Ndrangheta, (pronounced n-DRANG-gay-tah) a group from the Calabria region that now controls much of Europe\u2019s cocaine trade. Analysts say the \u2019Ndrangheta is active in Britain, France, Germany, Spain and Switzerland. The other two main organizations are the Camorra, the clans based in the Naples area, which are especially powerful in southern Spain; and the Cosa Nostra, the Sicilian mob families depicted in \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d which are active across Europe.In their home regions, Italy\u2019s organized crime groups often operate as shadow states, infiltrating local politics while controlling territory through intimidation and violence. Analysts say this local dominance explains why the organizations are heavily involved in sectors such as construction, mining, waste management and transportation, where their political influence allows them to steer government contracts to their favored firms.In northern Italy and in other European countries, mob groups operate far less conspicuously, analysts say, especially since they lack the same level of political or territorial influence. But a report presented recently to European Union officials concluded that mob tentacles were nearly everywhere: hotels, nightclubs, real estate, gambling, construction, retail gasoline sales, wholesaling of clothing and jewelry, food processing, health care, renewable energy and more.\u201cThey have specific preferences for certain sectors,\u201d said Michele Riccardi, a researcher at Transcrime, the research institute in Milan that compiled the report presented to the European Union. \u201cThese are the sectors that seem more vulnerable and the regulations are looser.\u201dItaly has Europe\u2019s toughest anti-mob statutes, which is one reason many organized crime families have pushed into other European countries. Germany has become an especially prominent case.Italian migrants began pouring into Germany in the 1950s, including many from Calabria, home of the \u2019Ndrangheta. When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, analysts say wiretaps detected a mob boss in Italy ordering a lieutenant to get into East Germany immediately and \u201cbuy everything.\u201dThe magazine cited a confidential overview by the Federal Criminal Police Office that criticized the German government for failing to detect the assets of organized crime groups. The overview found that Italian crime groups had earned about \u20ac123 million, roughly $170 million, in Germany during the past decade, yet prosecutors had confiscated just \u20ac8 million, or about $11 million, from them.The police report found that while the Cosa Nostra had infiltrated the construction sector, the Camorra was peddling counterfeit consumer goods and the \u2019Ndrangheta was selling adulterated olive oil and other foodstuffs. Mobsters controlled at least 300 pizzerias in Germany, it said, and were using these businesses to enter the legitimate economy.While Germany and other European Union countries once denied the existence of a problem, awareness has begun to rise. In February, the Italian and German authorities carried out a joint operation against the Cosa Nostra and arrested more than a dozen suspects in both countries who are accused of stealing millions of euros in European Union farm subsidies. This month, the Italian and French police collaborated in the arrest of a Camorra boss in Nice, France.Two years ago, the European Union set up an anti-Mafia commission, while Europol recognized in 2011 that it had an \u201cintelligence gap\u201d about mob activities. It commissioned a broad survey, released last year, which noted that mob groups were particularly threatening in legal business sectors because they \u201ccan afford to operate \u2018at a loss,\u2019 creating in the long run a situation of quasi-monopoly that undermines the basic principles of free market.\u201dEven within Italy, however, many people continue to regard organized crime as a southern problem. When the writer Roberto Saviano, known for his work exposing the activities of organized crime groups, used a 2010 television program to speak out about mob infiltration in the north, the Milan-based newspaper Il Giornale responded with an online petition drive against him titled, \u201cDear Saviano, the North is not Mafioso.\u201d\u201cCriminal organizations are all in Rome and up north,\u201d Mr. Saviano said in a recent interview. \u201cIn the south, their presence is like a military presence. In Rome and the north, it is economic presence.\u201dMob groups have long been a quiet presence in Rome, with shopkeepers complaining of having to pay extortion money, known as pizzo, but the recent crackdown showed how organized crime groups are now directly investing in city businesses. Among the 23 restaurants and pizzerias seized in January was Pizza Ciro, part of one of the most popular pizza chains in the city.\u201cIt has nothing to do with cash being in the register at the end of the day,\u201d said Enrico Fontana, director of Libera, an umbrella group of anti-mob associations around Italy. \u201cIt is for money laundering.\u201dMr. Prestipino, the prosecutor, agreed that money laundering was important but added that the crime bosses are also looking for ways to create channels of access to political leaders. He said no politician can meet directly with a mob boss, but by investing in businesses, organized crime groups can cultivate a network of white-collar entrepreneurs in Rome who can deal openly with politicians and civil servants.\u201cIt is a system that has all advantages,\u201d Mr. Prestipino said. \u201cThe businessman gets the economic advantages. The Mafioso doesn\u2019t have to come to Rome. And the politician doesn\u2019t have to get his hands dirty.\u201dGaia Pianigiani contributed reporting from Rome, and Victor Homola from Berlin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "European Parliament Approves Laws on Banking Overhaul", "Date": "2014-04-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 After countless late-night meetings and political skirmishes, the European Union on Tuesday put in place the final pieces of a landmark plan for managing a banking system whose troubles have done so much to dent the bloc\u2019s economy.The creation of structures that officials have grandly dubbed a \u201cbanking union\u201d is one of the biggest steps toward European financial integration since the introduction of the euro more than a decade ago. The negotiations pitted prosperous northern countries like Germany and Finland against France and struggling southern countries like Greece over the issue of how much liability to share for bank failures.\u201cThe E.U. has lived up to its commitments,\u201d said Michel Barnier, the bloc\u2019s commissioner for financial affairs, who originally proposed the three chunks of legislation passed on Tuesday.But even as the union establishes new structures for assessing the health of banks and for rescuing some, and shuttering others that cannot be salvaged \u2014 even introducing an element of burden sharing \u2014 critics say the plan still is checkered with uncertainties and weaknesses.Lawmakers meeting at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, for their last plenary session before May elections, overwhelmingly approved the package, which is subject to final approval by the bloc\u2019s Council of Ministers. That is seen as a formality because representatives from the governments have already given their consent to harmonizing the patchwork of banking laws in Europe.The other main law, a regulation for a single-resolution mechanism, establishes a board to ensure that the owners and creditors of major lenders in the euro zone pay first in cases of failure. That regulation would also establish a common fund of 55 billion euros, or $76 billion, to be built up over eight years, financed by all euro zone banks to help cover the costs of closing banks.Lawmakers also approved without a formal vote a law confirming a guarantee on deposits up to \u20ac100,000. It requires countries for the first time to partly fund the system in advance and it gives depositors access to their money more quickly in the event of a failure.The idea here is that the central bank would do a better job than national supervisors of nipping financial problems in the bud so that governments would not need to resort to bank bailouts that destabilize the euro and penalize taxpayers. Yet experts foresee some possible teething problems.\u201cThe central thing for the success of banking union is that the E.C.B. makes a strong impression as the single supervisor during the first year and a half of operations,\u201d said Guntram B. Wolff, the director of Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. \u201cThe E.C.B. could inevitably make mistakes by, for example, misreading a number because it has very little experience with a huge task.\u201dYet the biggest test will likely be a political one, Mr. Wolff said. \u201cThe E.C.B. must be as tough with a bank in Germany as with a bank in Greece,\u201d he said. \u201cUltimately, does the E.C.B. have the political clout?\u201dThe votes came more than five years after the problems in the American housing market, and the discovery of a big hole in Greece\u2019s finances, set loose a wider banking crisis that led countries including Britain and Spain to use public money to bail out their troubled lenders.In one case, in Cyprus, the authorities were initially prepared to trim depositors\u2019 savings to bail out banks before an outcry by Cypriots and European legislators forced a change of tactics.\u201cWe are finally doing it now,\u201d Hannes Swoboda, the president of the Socialists and Democrats group in the European Parliament, said at a news conference. \u201cLate, but we are doing it.\u201dEven so, it is unclear how much the new laws will keep taxpayers out of the firing line the next time there is a full-blown bank crisis.Some critics contend the new system depends too heavily on allowing losses to fall on creditors who may be connected to institutions that underpin the stability of other parts of the banking system. Their concern is that, in times of crisis, the authorities could shy away from applying the rules penalizing or \u201cbailing in\u201d creditors, out of fear of creating a domino effect, again opening the path to relying on another solution that involves public money.That, he said, made an overhaul of the structure of the largest banks in the European Union another priority. \u201cSeparating large banks\u2019 trading activities from deposit taking would lead to smaller, simpler banks and so reduce the domino effect,\u201d he said.The European Union also still needs to devise ways to \u201cstop incentivizing banks to load up on sovereign debt\u201d as the only real way to break the so-called doom loop, or link between the solvency of governments and banks, he said.The banking industry broadly welcomed the laws. \u201cHaving the same rules for banks in all E.U. member states creates much-needed clarity and makes processes more effective, said Guido Ravoet, the chief executive of the European Banking Federation, an industry body in Brussels.It remains unclear whether the legislation would ever enable European banks to be wound down over the course of a weekend \u2014 a stated aim of European officials \u2014 as \u201cthe decision-making process is still rather complicated,\u201d according to Reinhard Cluse, chief European economist at UBS in London. Authorities might find that they \u201cneed to go back to the drawing board\u201d on that part of the process, he said.For Mr. Wolff of Bruegel, the sizable amounts of money that banks will have to pay toward their own rescue under the bank recovery and resolution directive, combined with the steps under separate legislation toward establishing a shared pot of \u20ac55 billion contributed by banks, offer far greater assurances of stability than during the recent past.Even so, he warned that the lack of an ultimate financial backstop that might be needed for a large-scale bank failure remained another key weakness of the legislation.\u201cIn a systemic crisis the F.D.I.C. has a credit line with the U.S. Treasury, and that\u2019s something we still don\u2019t have,\u201d said Mr. Wolff, citing a backstop federal insurance system in America. \u201cThe bail-in is supposed to be automatic, but there still could be exceptions and recourse to using public money sooner than you think.\u201dJenny Anderson contributed reporting from London, and David Jolly from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Recovery for Whom?", "Date": "2014-04-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe official line is clear: The worst is over, and recovery has given way to expansion.But that\u2019s not the whole story. Economic gains so far have mostly benefited those at the top of the income and wealth ladder. Worse, future growth is likely to be lopsided, because the foundation for broad prosperity is arguably the weakest it has been since World War II. Take, for example, Americans age 25 to 34, the leading edge of the so-called millennials, the generation born in the 1980s and 1990s. They are worse off than Gen Xers (born from the mid-1960s to the late-1970s) were at that age and the baby boomers before them by nearly every economic measure \u2014 employment, income, student loan indebtedness, mobility, homeownership and other hallmarks of \u201chousehold formation,\u201d like moving out on their own, getting married and having children. This group had the bad luck of entering the work force in the depressed and slow-growth years that started when the recession hit in 2007. Instead of spending the crucial early years of their work lives laying the groundwork for a solid economic future, many of them have struggled with unemployment and underemployment, and many have fallen so far behind where they would hope to be that recovering lost ground may well be impossible. According to the latest census data, nearly 16 percent of those in their mid-20s to mid-30s were in poverty in 2012, compared with just above 10 percent of Gen Xers in 2000 and baby boomers in 1980. Nearly 14 percent of that age group were living with their parents in 2013, a higher percentage than in previous generations. And of those living at home, 43 percent (2.5 million people) would be counted as being in poverty if they were on their own. Only 38 percent of those who were on their own were homeowners, compared with 46 percent from this age group who were on their own in 2000. The median household income of this age group \u2014 $51,381 in 2012 \u2014 is nearly $8,000 less than the median for the same age group in 2000 and virtually unchanged from 1980, adjusted for inflation. The older millennials are also less likely to move; in 2013, only 20 percent of people in their mid-20s to mid-30s had relocated recently, compared with 27 percent who were the same age in 2000 and 26 percent in 1980. These patterns should not come as a shock. Evidence and experience from before the recession show that starting one\u2019s work life in a poor economy can translate into lower earnings and less career attainment over a lifetime. What is shocking is that despite the known danger and despite the prolonged bad economy, more government resources have not been used to prevent and reverse such a huge waste of human capital. Instead, public resources for job creation and even for unemployment benefits have been too little and too late, if available at all. Another shocker is that those in the 25-to-34 age group are the best educated cohort in American history, with more than a third having a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher. Education is important. But clearly, education alone does not create jobs and opportunities that lead to prosperity. For that, a fair and functional economy is needed \u2014 one in which the government plays a robust role, alongside consumers and businesses, to promote full employment and to ensure a just distribution of gains. Americans who began their careers in the teeth of the recession are not the only ones bearing economic scars. Younger millennials are not appreciably better off than their older peers, though they have not yet lost as much ground. At the other end of the spectrum, many older Americans who lost jobs and assets in the recession also face an uncertain future. Certain sectors of the economy, especially the financial markets, are indeed turning a corner. But true prosperity is impossible when the productive potential of young adults is being squandered.

Two-way investment is restricted to licensed institutions and subject to comparatively tiny quotas.The preparatory work to introduce the new pilot trading program is expected to take about six months, officials said. The cumulative, combined trading flows will be capped at an aggregate 550 billion renminbi. The quotas may be adjusted in the future, the regulators said.The program, called the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect, \u201cwill not only help strengthen the two securities markets, but will also have long-term and strategic significance,\u201d John Tsang, Hong Kong\u2019s financial secretary, said in a statement. \u201cI am pleased to see that Hong Kong plays an important role in the two-way opening up of the mainland\u2019s capital market to the world.\u201dIn the summer of 2007, senior Hong Kong government officials announced a plan, referred to as the \u201cthrough train,\u201d that would allow mainland Chinese investors to directly buy shares listed in Hong Kong. That announcement sent the local Hang Seng index soaring, gaining more than 50 percent over a two-month period ending in October 2007 to peak at a high of over 31,000 points.But the through train never left the station. Hong Kong stocks plunged and, unlike shares in the United States and other major markets, have not come close to matching their pre-crisis highs. Investors are hoping this time around is different.\u201cThe landmark agreement gives global investors greater access to China\u2019s extraordinary growth story and allows Chinese savers to diversify their holdings,\u201d said Peter Wong, the deputy chairman and chief executive of HSBC\u2019s Hong Kong unit. \u201cThis is further confirmation of China\u2019s commitment to financial reform, and reaffirms Hong Kong\u2019s role as the fulcrum of China\u2019s broader economic integration with the global economy.\u201dOpening up China\u2019s financial markets to the world is a central goal of the package of overhauls announced by President Xi Jinping after a major plenum meeting of Communist Party leaders in November. Beyond allowing greater access to China\u2019s stock markets, other proposals include easing the state\u2019s heavy-handed control of bank deposit rates, currency exchange rates and the banking sector.It appeared on Thursday that significant details of the stock trading program remain to be worked out.For example, the announcement by the two regulators said the proposal would enable \u201cmainland investors to directly participate in the Hong Kong stock market using RMB,\u201d using the abbreviation for renminbi, the Chinese currency.But Hong Kong trading is carried out using the Hong Kong dollar, which is pegged to the dollar and \u2014 unlike the renminbi \u2014 is a freely convertible currency. Almost no Hong Kong stocks trade in renminbi.Two notable exceptions are Hui Xian Real Estate Investment Trust, controlled by the billionaire Li Ka-shing, and Hopewell Highway Infrastructure, a toll-road operator that maintains a dual-currency listing. At the same time, the regulators said that shares in more than 200 Hong Kong companies would be open to mainland investment under the program. That appeared to imply that either mainland investors would be allowed to freely convert their renminbi into hard currency, or that the Hong Kong companies targeted for investment would need to conduct a secondary offering of renminbi-denominated shares.Regarding the division of trading quotas, the two regulators said that \u201csouthbound\u201d investment from the mainland to Hong Kong would be capped at 10.5 billion renminbi a day, while \u201cnorthbound\u201d investment from Hong Kong to China would be capped at 13 billion renminbi, both monitored on a \u201creal time\u201d basis.Securities regulation and the legal system vary considerably between Hong Kong and mainland China, and the regulators said they would work together on a framework that would \u201crespond to all misconduct in either or both markets on a timely basis.\u201dMarkets welcomed Thursday\u2019s news. The Hang Seng index closed 1.51 percent higher, while the Shanghai composite index gained 1.38 percent for the day.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Obama Claims Victory in Push for Insurance", "Date": "2014-04-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama declared victory Tuesday in the government\u2019s aggressive push to enroll seven million people in private health insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act, even as his senior aides braced for an escalated political battle over the law ahead of the fall\u2019s crucial midterm elections.The milestone may be more significant politically than for what it says about the law\u2019s potential impact on the American health system, which remains unclear. But officials said it was unlikely to have much of an impact on public perception of the law, and the announcement did little to deflect immediate criticism from its Republican opponents. In an afternoon Rose Garden ceremony, Mr. Obama announced that a late surge of customers to HealthCare.gov before Monday\u2019s deadline had pushed insurance signups to 7.1 million, slightly more than the administration\u2019s original goal. The achievement was somewhat remarkable considering the bureaucratic and technical nightmare that surrounded the website\u2019s debut last October. \u201cArmageddon has not arrived,\u201d the president said to an audience of White House staff members and supporters who greeted the announcement with an extended standing ovation. \u201cInstead, this law is helping millions of Americans, and in the coming years it will help millions more.\u201dWith the end of open enrollment, the administration must now turn its attention to a handful of practical questions that may have as much impact on the law\u2019s success as the number of people who sign up. These include whether consumers continue to pay their share of monthly premiums, whether they have access to the doctors and hospitals they need and whether insurance companies will be required to raise premiums.The administration must also look ahead to the next open enrollment season. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that enrollment in the exchanges will grow to 13 million in 2015 and 22 million in 2016.Several of the most ardent critics of the health care law expressed doubt about the official tally of sign-ups, noting that the White House had not released information about how many people who signed up had paid their initial premiums.The critics also noted that an unknown number of people who signed up at HealthCare.gov had previously been insured under plans that were canceled. White House officials said they did not yet have a tally of that category. Politically speaking, officials said that they did not expect the hardened opinions about the health care law to change in the near future, and that Democratic candidates around the country must be prepared to wage a fierce battle in the months ahead centered on convincing Americans that Republicans want to take insurance away from millions of people. \u201cThose who run against it, who run on repeal and offer nothing in return but the old status quo, the status quo ante, you know, are, I think, going to have some explaining to do to those millions of Americans who now have the security of affordable health insurance,\u201d said Jay Carney, the White House press secretary.Congressional Democrats were heartened by the announcement of the signups for the new law, particularly after being embarrassed and disappointed by the failure of the website last fall. The health care milestone also provided what they saw as a sharp political contrast with the conservative fiscal blueprint issued Tuesday by Representative Paul D. Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican who leads the House Budget Committee and proposed new cuts in social spending.But Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, said she did not think the health care law would be the decisive issue in this year\u2019s midterm elections, regardless of the intensity of the attacks leveled by Republicans.\u201cI never said that we would run on it,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said in an interview. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t why we passed it. But we are not running away from it.\u201d In the end, she said, \u201celections are always about jobs and the economy.\u201dIn his remarks on Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Obama proclaimed himself mystified by the continuing assault on the law, and said the enrollment figures should finally put an end to the repeated attempts by Republicans to repeal it.\u201cIt\u2019s helping people from coast to coast, all of which makes the lengths to which critics have gone to scare people or undermine the law or try to repeal the law without offering any plausible alternative so hard to understand,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to admit, I don\u2019t get it. Why are folks working so hard for people not to have health insurance?\u201dAs if on cue, Mr. Obama\u2019s Republican adversaries dismissed the day\u2019s news as irrelevant and vowed to continue their campaign against the health law. Speaker John A. Boehner said in a statement that his members would keep trying to repeal a law that he said was wreaking \u201chavoc on American families, small businesses and our economy.\u201d Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate minority leader, called the health care law \u201ca catastrophe for the country\u201d and said he doubted the validity of the enrollment numbers.Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, accused Mr. Obama of taking a \u201cpremature victory lap.\u201d Americans for Prosperity, a conservative advocacy group, said Tuesday that it was buying $540,000 of television time for an advertisement assailing Senator Mark Pryor, Democrat of Arkansas, for his support of the health care law.\u201cThe American people are tired of this constant angst, this constant crisis,\u201d a truck driver identified as Jerry says in the commercial. Jerry says his insurance policy has been canceled, and he concludes: \u201cSenator Mark Pryor voted for Obamacare. Tell Senator Pryor Obamacare hurts Arkansas families.\u201dThe 7.1 million people who the president said signed up for health insurance by midnight did not count those people who tried but were unable for technical reasons to complete applications. Those people may be able to receive a limited amount of extra time, officials said last week. People who go without health insurance in coming months may be subject to tax penalties. The next open enrollment period starts Nov. 15 and is scheduled to end on Feb. 15, 2015. Families USA, a liberal-leaning advocacy group, said the administration should allow two additional months, through April 15, 2015, for people who learn at tax time next year that they must pay penalties for being uninsured in 2014. The penalties are due with income taxes on April 15, 2015.Carl Hulse contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Israel Appears to Raise New Peace Talks Issue With U.S.", "Date": "2014-04-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 Days after suspending American-brokered Middle East peace talks because of a reconciliation pact reached between the Palestine Liberation Organization and its rival Hamas, the Islamic militant group, Israel on Monday raised a new source of potential tension with the United States over Washington\u2019s approach to the unity government planned by the Palestinians.Israel has stated that it will not resume negotiations with any Palestinian government that is supported by Hamas, even if that government is made up of political independents and apolitical technocratic figures who meet international conditions for acceptance. An Israeli official said on Monday that Israel had in the past received \u201ca specific commitment from the American administration\u201d backing that position \u2014 a claim that appeared to be at odds with some more recent signals from Washington.A senior State Department official said Monday that the administration was \u201cnot going to reveal the details of private conversations.\u201dThe Israeli official, who was speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the subject\u2019s diplomatic delicacy, said that the commitment had been given to Israel during President Obama\u2019s first term in office and that it had been restated since his re-election. The official would not specify whether the commitment had been given in writing or by the president himself.But he insisted that the Obama administration had backed Israel\u2019s position against negotiating or dealing with such a unity government unless Hamas accepted the principles laid down by world powers after the Islamic group won Palestinian elections in 2006: to recognize Israel\u2019s right to exist, to renounce all violence and to accept all previous signed agreements.Hamas continues to refuse those conditions. Taher al-Nounou, an adviser to Ismail Haniya, the group\u2019s prime minister in Gaza, reiterated on Sunday that Hamas would not recognize Israel.In the absence of such recognition, Washington, like Israel, has classified Hamas as a terrorist group and forbids direct dealings with it.In an initial reaction last week, Jen Psaki, a State Department spokeswoman, called the Palestinian move \u201cdisappointing\u201d and the timing \u201ctroubling,\u201d coming days before the April 29 expiration date for the American-brokered peace talks that have been a focus of Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s tenure, and as the negotiators worked feverishly on a formula to try to extend them.Ms. Psaki said that \u201cany Palestinian government must unambiguously and explicitly commit to nonviolence, recognition of the state of Israel, and acceptance of previous agreements and obligations between the parties,\u201d without making any mention of Hamas. She added, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see how Israel can be expected to negotiate with a government that does not believe in its right to exist.\u201dLater, when asked whether the demand was for Hamas to change its long-held positions, Ms. Psaki said that if President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority \u201cwere to continue to pursue reconciliation, Hamas would need to abide by these principles in order to be a part of the government.\u201d\u201cSo if it\u2019s a unified government, yes, they would need to abide by these principles,\u201d she said. But her statement did not appear to address Israel\u2019s concerns about a unity government in which Hamas did not play a direct part.The reconciliation deal is meant to heal a political and geographical rift between President Abbas, whose administration is based in the West Bank, and Hamas, which has controlled Gaza since 2007. Mr. Abbas, who is also the leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization and the mainstream Fatah party that dominates it, has reached several unity accords with Hamas in recent years, including plans for a transitional unity government and elections, but the agreements never succeeded.This latest deal, which appeared to have more substance, took Israelis and officials in Washington by surprise. There is no certainty that it will turn out to be any different from the failed accords that preceded it, possibly contributing to the cloudiness in the American position.\u201cThe odds are against the formation of this technocratic government,\u201d one American official said recently, speaking on the condition of anonymity. \u201cWe have seen this movie four times before.\u201dThe Israeli government suspended the American-brokered peace talks with the Palestinians a day after the unity pact was announced. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said, \u201cWhoever chooses the terrorism of Hamas does not want peace.\u201dDore Gold, a senior adviser to Mr. Netanyahu and a former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations, reiterated that Israel would not deal with a Palestinian unity government so long as Hamas did not accept the international principles.\u201cWe are not overwhelmed by a group of gentlemen wearing suits while in the back room the real control is with Fatah and Hamas,\u201d Mr. Gold said in a recent interview. \u201cThe technocrats will be under the clear direction of the two movements,\u201d he added.Saeb Erekat, the chief negotiator for the P.L.O., said in an interview on Monday that throughout the negotiations the Israelis constantly asked the Palestinians how they would deal with Gaza. Mr. Erekat said he told the Israelis: \u201cYou are right. We should have one authority, one gun and one rule of law. So in accordance with Abbas\u2019s program we go forward with reconciliation. Then they say no, you have chosen Hamas and not peace.\u201dIsrael\u2019s decision to suspend the negotiations, Mr. Erekat said, was \u201cthe most shortsighted decision\u201d Israel could have taken.Although Israel\u2019s negotiating partner has been the P.L.O. and not the government of the Palestinian Authority, Naftali Bennett, Israel\u2019s minister of economy and leader of the right-wing Jewish Home party, described such distinctions as \u201cintellectual somersaults.\u201d\u201cAbbas is the president of the Palestinian Authority,\" he told reporters in Jerusalem on Sunday. \u201cThe world recognizes him as such. Now the government will include Hamas, and we will not speak to it.\u201dHe added: \u201cThis is precisely the point where we expect the world to show more clarity and to do the right thing. Asking us to negotiate with a government backed by Hamas is like asking the United States to negotiate with a government backed by Al Qaeda, even if that government said it recognized the United States. Would anyone ever consider that?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Fire TV, Amazon Seeks a Beachhead in the Living Room", "Date": "2014-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmazon is a retailer that makes and sells entertainment. On Wednesday, it took a big step toward a future in which shopping and video are tightly linked, perhaps even inseparable.If Amazon has its way \u2014 and it did not become one of the country\u2019s most valuable companies by drifting with the current \u2014 even watching home movies of your sister\u2019s adorable children or a friend\u2019s crazy cat will become marketing opportunities.The company began selling a device Wednesday that lets consumers watch Amazon\u2019s extensive video library as well as play a wide array of games on their television sets.\u201cAmazon has a vested interest in making sure it is present at every moment of possible consumption, which is all the time,\u201d said James McQuivey, an analyst with Forrester Research. \u201cIt wants to get into that television screen and start to build a relationship.\u201dAmazon Fire TV is part of a multibillion-dollar effort by Amazon to move from selling goods produced by others, which is traditionally a low-margin business, to presiding over the entire process of creation and consumption. Physical formats such as books, CDs and DVDs are disappearing, replaced by downloads and streaming.In books, Amazon has largely made this transition. It makes e-readers and tablets and then sells the content for them. Some writers produce their books exclusively for Amazon, happily living in the digital equivalent of a company town.Video is much more competitive. Netflix, which began by renting the same DVDs that Amazon was selling, is the leader both in streaming video and creating original shows to feature on it.\u201cStreaming is the long-term future of video,\u201d said William V. Power, an analyst for Robert W. Baird & Company. \u201cAmazon needs to capitalize on that. The prize is controlling much of the living room and a big piece of the economy.\u201dFire TV, which arrives after years of explicit rumors and intense speculation, costs $99. In addition to content from Amazon\u2019s own studios, it offers programming the retailer licenses for an estimated 20 million Amazon Prime subscribers. Those customers pay as much as $99 a year for a membership that includes videos and shipping.Other Fire content will come from established players like Hulu and Netflix. Yet another source will be homemade films. With a separate $40 controller, Fire TV can also be used to play games, including a version of the extremely popular Minecraft.\u201cWe\u2019re missionaries about inventing and simplifying on behalf of customers,\u201d Peter Larsen, an Amazon vice president, said at a Manhattan news conference held to announce the device.Mr. Larsen, speaking on a stage outfitted to look like a living room, said devices from competitors, which include Roku, Google and Apple, have three problems: It is too hard to search for content, performance is slow and unreliable, and the content is a closed system. He noted that Apple TV users could not get the full Amazon Prime experience.Among the improvements and enhancements promoted for Fire TV: a voice search function that allows users to say a name like George Clooney or a genre like horror and see results instantly pop up, and a prediction feature that knows what you want and queues it up.Amazon is leveraging its position as a retailer to expand into new fields, something it has become very good at. \u201cBecause we\u2019re selling millions\u201d of set-top boxes already, \u201cwe hear what\u2019s working and we hear what\u2019s not working,\u201d Mr. Larsen said. Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder and chief executive, was not present at the news conference.Dave Limp, another Amazon executive, dismissed all the new and old companies that will be duking it out with Amazon in the consumer\u2019s living room.\u201cWe don\u2019t go at it from the perspective of who you\u2019re going to compete against,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t think of this as a sporting event where there has to be one winner.\u201dSince set-top boxes give consumers an incentive to cut the cable cord, Fire TV also puts Amazon in the sights of Comcast, the country\u2019s dominant cable system.Consultants are already laying their bets.\u201cThe likely winners are Apple and Amazon, both of which offer entire ecosystems, are excellent at merchandising content and are capable of subsidizing prices and making up the revenue elsewhere,\u201d said Bill Rosenblatt, president of GiantSteps Media Technology Strategies. \u201cThe likely losers are Google, which has a poor track record in entertainment devices and is not very good at merchandising content, and Roku, which has no ecosystem or synergies with other devices or services.\u201dFor all the lure of new devices like Google Glass, Americans still spend four hours a day watching television. The dream of securing that audience has fired up many a tech magnate. Microsoft, Google, Yahoo and Intel all have tried, with mixed results. No one has done for TVs what Steven P. Jobs did for computers, portable music players and cellphones.TV was on Mr. Jobs\u2019s to-do list. \u201cI\u2019d like to create an integrated television set that is completely easy to use,\u201d he told his biographer, Walter Isaacson. \u201cI finally cracked it.\u201d But then he died, and Apple fans have waited. Apple TV, a set-top box, is the leader in the field, but until recently Apple referred to it as a \u201chobby.\u201dIn Amazon\u2019s vision, the television becomes a supercharged home-shopping ecosystem, no matter what happens to be on.\u201cImagine,\u201d Mr. McQuivey said, \u201cI\u2019m watching a Jason Bourne movie. He\u2019s on the run through Europe. The movie pauses and lets you move into an interactive game with Bourne. Or maybe he goes through Vienna, and you always wanted to go there, so here\u2019s how you could plan a trip or at least buy a book about it. Amazon will know who to offer these deals to because those people are already in front of it at that moment.\u201dThis was not something Amazon talked about much at the news conference, but Amazon is also not a company that gives away its secrets.One small clue to the company\u2019s ultimate plans: Amazon is promoting an app for its box from a start-up called Magisto. It offers free automatic video-editing software that can reduce the three-hour movie you shot about your cat to something far snappier. The company says it has tens of millions of users, a small percentage of whom choose to make their films public.Magisto has the potential to be a sort of YouTube for Amazon customers.\u201cWe see a real opportunity to use television as a tool for personal storytelling and personal communications, as opposed to just broadcast communications,\u201d said Reid Genauer, chief marketing officer of Magisto.He said he had no idea how Amazon would generate revenue from Magisto\u2019s app but speculated that the metadata in each video could be automatically analyzed in the same way Google automatically scans Gmail messages and then advertises against them.\u201cIn the same way that I write, \u2018I\u2019m coming to see you in England,\u2019 and then I see airfare ads,\u201d Mr. Genauer said, \u201cyou could see how someone could use metadata in video to sell products. If I watch a lot of kitty videos, you would sell me kitty products.\u201dAn article on Thursday about Amazon\u2019s new set-top box to stream video, games and other entertainment to customers\u2019 television sets misstated part of the company\u2019s content offerings.

{"Headline": "Obama\u2019s High-Profile Tour of Asia Hits Speed Bumps", "Date": "2014-04-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byQuick HistoryA week in which President Obama had intended to add force to his strategic pivot to the East instead marked some pivotal setbacks to his foreign agenda. The president\u2019s long-delayed trip to Asia failed to yield a trade deal with Japan and ran up against a new threat from North Korea, while both the Middle East peace process and a tentative agreement on Ukraine foundered in acrimony.It was tempting to seek a unifying theory for the limitations on President Obama\u2019s ability to impose a Pax Americana on an unruly world, but the less satisfying reality was that disparate geopolitical shifts around the world were similar only in their stubborn resistance to the threats and blandishments of the solo superpower.The purpose of the high-profile tour was to highlight the economic, security and democratic components of the \u201crebalancing to Asia\u201d of America\u2019s attentions, and to do so without unduly alarming China. To ensure that Mr. Obama knew his journey was being closely monitored from Beijing, the official Chinese news agency Xinhua fired a scathing shot across his bow on Wednesday, the day he arrived in Japan.The agency upbraided the United States for seeking to \u201ccage the rapidly developing Asian giant\u201d and continued, \u201cWhile the outer layer of Washington\u2019s logic indicates an adaptable and farsighted global colossus, the inner layer betrays a sclerotic and myopic superpower trapped by recent history in a confrontational mind-set and blinded by outmoded realism to China\u2019s peaceful orientation.\u201dIt seemed a curious way to demonstrate \u201cpeaceful orientation,\u201d and was probably intended more for domestic audiences in anticipation of Mr. Obama\u2019s taking the side of Japan and the Philippines in disputes over islands and waters in the East China Sea and the South China Sea. That Mr. Obama did, but cautiously. While declaring that the United States was obligated by treaty to protect Japan, he also stressed that it did not \u201ctake a position on final sovereignty.\u201d The visit to Tokyo included a state dinner with Emperor Akihito at the Imperial Palace and Tokyo\u2019s most exclusive sushi at the storied Sukiyabashi Jiro restaurant with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who quoted Mr. Obama as saying it was \u201cthe best sushi I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d But the president\u2019s hope to announce a trade agreement in Tokyo ran up against the resistance of Japan\u2019s farmers to opening markets to imported rice, beef, poultry and pork. Mr. Obama then moved on to a different set of problems in South Korea. First among them was the continuing trauma and grief over the sinking of a ferry filled with high school students, many of whom ended up among the 300 dead or missing. Then there were signs that North Korea was preparing for another nuclear test, escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula and challenging Washington\u2019s strategy of \u201cstrategic patience\u201d with the young and increasingly ruthless North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un. Malaysia and the Philippines will round out the trip.Middle East Plan CollapsesAs Mr. Obama was en route to Asia, the beleaguered Israeli-Palestinian peace process on which Secretary of State John Kerry had expended so much effort and reputation came apart. The immediate precursor was the announcement, evidently anticipated by neither Mr. Kerry nor the Israelis, that the leaders of the Fatah government in the West Bank had joined hands with their bitter rivals in Hamas, who run Gaza.That gave Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, just what he needed to pull the plug on a process he had never countenanced to begin with, and to pin the blame on the Palestinians. \u201cWhoever chooses the terrorism of Hamas does not want peace,\u201d he proclaimed.Mr. Kerry was keenly disappointed at the collapse of his signature project, especially as the Palestinian reconciliation came only days before the April 29 expiration date of the American-brokered talks. The Palestinian move was \u201cdisappointing,\u201d his spokeswoman said, and the timing \u201ctroubling.\u201dWhat compelled President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority to make peace with Hamas at this time \u2014 the third such attempt since Fatah and Hamas bitterly parted ways in 2007 \u2014 was not entirely clear. Mr. Abbas insisted that there was \u201cno contradiction at all\u201d between reconciliation and negotiation, and Palestinian spokesmen argued that a Palestinian leadership speaking for both the West Bank and Gaza was a better partner for peacemaking than one that represented only the West Bank.Mr. Abbas, 79, was facing a domestic backlash over the negotiations and apparently believed that joining with Hamas to prepare for long-overdue Palestinian elections was more fruitful than continuing with futile talks. This month, he formally applied to join 15 United Nations conventions in retaliation for Israel\u2019s failure to release some Palestinian prisoners it had pledged to free.Hamas has been increasingly isolated since Egypt has taken to frequently closing Gaza\u2019s only gateway to the world. The question now was whether Hamas was prepared to formally accede to Fatah\u2019s recognition of the state of Israel, which would be a major shift of position; and if it was not, what that meant for Fatah\u2019s and the Palestine Liberation Organization\u2019s commitments.More Sanctions for Russia?And then there was the tinderbox of Ukraine. A meeting of the foreign ministers of Russia, Ukraine, the United States and the European Union in Geneva on April 17 had provided a glimmer of hope that the tense confrontation over southeastern Ukraine would subside. But no sooner was the agreement signed than each side accused the other of violating it.Ukrainian authorities in Kiev ordered \u201cantiterrorist operations\u201d to clear administrative, police and security buildings in several cities occupied by pro-Russian secessionists, but after a few skirmishes the operations were called off. That did not deter Sergei K. Shoigu, the Russian defense minister, from declaring that Russia needed to stop \u201cthis military machine\u201d and ordering military exercises by the huge force massed on Ukraine\u2019s border.In Washington, Mr. Kerry warned Russia that it faced additional sanctions if it failed to abide by the Geneva agreement to free the occupied buildings. Mr. Kerry made the most explicit accusation of Russian interference to date, saying that American intelligence services had concluded that Russian agents \u201cwere playing an active role in destabilizing eastern Ukraine with personnel, weapons, operational planning and coordination.\u201dPresident Vladimir V. Putin has scoffed at sanctions, but the crisis is taking a toll on Russia\u2019s weak economy. On Friday, Standard & Poor\u2019s cut Russia\u2019s credit rating to one notch above \u201cjunk,\u201d citing capital flight that it put at $51 billion in the first three months of 2014.Russia\u2019s gross domestic product grew by only 1.3 percent last year, and S.&P. said that if the Ukraine crisis persisted, growth could fall to \u201cwell below 1 percent.\u201d Ostracism, Mr. Putin is finding, can bite.Serge Schmemann is a member of the editorial board of The New York Times.

Some legislators get elected talking about what they would spend on programs and services like education, health care, highways or water. Some get elected talking about smaller government \u2014 about curbing taxes and reducing fees. It is not entirely a partisan split, and there is rarely a clean line between the product-sensitive legislators and the price-sensitive ones.In 2011, lawmakers came to Austin and found a fiscal mess. They made some cuts, like more than $5 billion in public education spending. And they reached for a familiar bag of financial tricks, like delaying payments from one fiscal year to the next, that helped balance the books without deeper cuts to existing programs.Two years later, they came back to find plenty of money. They undid their accounting magic, setting the books straight and moving payments into the proper budget years. They restored education financing and other cuts. They had enough money, in other words, to put the budget back on its pre-2011 course.In 2015, assuming the current financial forecasts are correct and the economy keeps churning along, Texas lawmakers will again have plenty of money. This time, however, they will not have the list of obligations they faced in 2013, so they will not have to restore cuts or unwind their temporary financial ploys.These are the times that try the nerves of the budget folks. Writing a state budget when money is tight can be less stressful \u2014 at least for the authors \u2014 than writing one when money is abundant.The most experienced people at next year\u2019s budget hearings might be in the audience, not in the big leather chairs reserved for committee members. Experience will not necessarily carry the arguments, but at least the supplicants can start fresh, testing their persuasive abilities on lawmakers who have not already heard their stories several times.Last year\u2019s legislative session revealed some willingness to spend money on infrastructure. Lawmakers put a bond issue on the ballot \u2014 it passed in November \u2014 that raises money for water projects. One to raise money for highways, also approved by the Legislature last year, will be on the ballot next November.More money is needed for both, if you go by the reports from various engineers and policy wonks. It costs more than $4 billion a year to keep the state\u2019s transportation network from degrading \u2014 the price tag for making sure things do not get worse. Pending litigation over public school spending could produce judicial demands for higher spending there. Water got some money, but not enough. And hordes of voters have demonstrated their interest in lower taxes and fees.Choosing favorites is never easy, but \u201cno\u201d is easier to swallow when money is tight.rramsey@texastribune.org Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rivals for New York Casino Licenses Must Pay Millions to Play", "Date": "2014-03-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt will cost $1 million to even apply for a license.The license itself will cost up to $70 million. And New York State will most likely require that each of the winning developer-operators spend hundreds of millions of dollars to build one of the shimmering casino resorts upstate that officials hope will attract tens of thousands of customers and transform the local economies.In short, it will take a fortune just to open the doors of a full-scale casino in New York, according to the application issued on Monday by the State Gaming Commission. As many as 20 contestants \u2014 including Hard Rock, Penn National, Empire Resorts, the Flaum family real estate company, the Mashantucket Pequot tribe and the Stockbridge-Munsee Indians \u2014 have said in recent months that they will compete for at least one of the casino licenses.But the daunting financial requirements, starting with the nonrefundable $1 million application fee due no later than June 30, will almost certainly winnow the list. The most intense competition is shaping up in the Catskills, the region closest to New York City and its dense mix of residents and tourists who might be attracted to gambling.Still, there are several operators already contending for a license in a more sparsely populated region in western New York, running from Binghamton north to the Canadian border.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to locate where there\u2019s a real market,\u201d said Gordon Medenica, director of the New York State Lottery from 2007 to 2012. \u201cThis field-of-dreams strategy is out of date.\u201dGambling has proliferated in the Northeast to the point where some analysts say that the market is saturated, with casinos or slot machine parlors in Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island, and more to come in Massachusetts.In New York there are now five Indian casinos upstate and electronic slot machine parlors at nine racetracks. But Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who led the effort to legalize casino gambling, is hoping that full-scale casino resorts will transform depressed upstate regions with jobs, tax revenues and tourists.The newly created State Gaming Commission and its location board will assess the applications for a license based primarily on how much economic development a project would generate. But it will also take into account local impact and the project\u2019s employment plan. Applicants will also have to demonstrate local support for their casino project.\u201cThis marks the beginning of the bidding process for long-anticipated gaming facilities to benefit upstate New York,\u201d said Paul Francis, a member of the location board. The location board indicated on Monday that it would set a minimum required investment for proposed projects in each of the three regions in contention \u2014 the Catskills, western New York and the Saratoga-Albany area \u2014 after a bidders\u2019 conference in April.At least five rivals have been working for years on $500 million proposals in Sullivan and Ulster Counties, in the northern Catskills, where the economy has been weak since the collapse in the 1970s of the old borscht belt resorts and bungalow colonies. But in recent weeks, several casino developers have proposed sites in the southern Catskills, specifically Orange County, which is only 50 miles from Manhattan. That has caused the Sullivan and Ulster County contestants concern that they will be unable to obtain financing for their projects. The slot parlor operator at the racetrack in Yonkers is also concerned that a full-scale casino in Orange County would undermine the slot parlor\u2019s viability.According to the casino application issued on Monday, a license in Orange or Dutchess County would cost a minimum of $70 million, and a license in the northern Catskills would go for a minimum of $35 million. But if no license is awarded in Orange or Dutchess, a license elsewhere in the Catskills would cost $50 million. Depending on the location, a license in western New York would cost from $20 million to $50 million. A license in the area between Saratoga and Albany would cost a minimum of $50 million.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Casinos in the Exurbs", "Date": "2014-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialGov. Andrew Cuomo has championed adding casinos in New York as a way to revive the upstate economy. There are plenty of concerns about whether giant casinos would actually bring well-paid jobs and sustained economic vitality to desolate areas. However, voters approved a constitutional amendment last year to allow seven casino complexes; a companion bill allowed four to be built over the next few years in upstate counties, but not in New York City or on Long Island.The members of the New York Gaming Facility Location Board should respond to the concerns of the communities affected. Many residents of Saratoga Springs, for example, have fought against building a casino in their area, which has racetracks. These operations should be placed only in communities that want them and are ready to tolerate the problems they cause. That certainly should not include areas closest to New York City.

{"Headline": "Fed Recognized Change in Unemployment Goal Could Be Misunderstood", "Date": "2014-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJanet L. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s new chairwoman, convened a secret meeting in early March to discuss the shift, the Fed disclosed on Wednesday. Two weeks later, at their regularly scheduled policy-making session, officials voted to replace a specific focus on a target for unemployment with a longer list of less specific objectives. Officials fretted that the decision would be misunderstood, but they concluded the change was necessary and the moment opportune.The account, released after a standard three-week delay, reinforces other efforts by Fed officials to play down the significance of the March shift. And investors, at first flustered by the change and Ms. Yellen\u2019s initial explanation, appear to have accepted the Fed\u2019s assurances. Interest rates that rose immediately after the March announcement continued to retrace those changes Wednesday; the stock market also took off after the minutes were released at 2 p.m.The Fed is dialing back its stimulus campaign as it gains confidence in the strength of the economic recovery. At the March meeting, it reduced its monthly bond purchases by $10 billion, to $55 billion, and indicated that it planned to continue cutting back at the same pace, ending the purchases this fall. It also replaced its previous guidance on short-term interest rates \u2014 that it would keep rates near zero well past the time that the unemployment rate, 6.7 percent in March, fell below 6.5 percent \u2014 with a vaguer commitment to a particular jobless threshold and an explicit reminder of its stated goal of pushing inflation higher so that it is close to its goal of a sustained 2 percent annual pace.The account said most officials on the Federal Open Market Committee were increasingly optimistic about the growth of the economy, viewing weakness in recent months as a result of bad weather. Officials regard the new guidance as a less powerful but more accurate description of their plans, which will be highly influenced by how the economy actually performs in coming months.\u201cAs the Fed becomes more convinced of the economic acceleration this spring and thereafter, the committee\u2019s forward guidance has become decidedly less Odyssean,\u201d Michael Dolega, a TD Bank economist, wrote Wednesday. \u201cThe F.O.M.C. appears far less willing to publicly commit to a future action or tie itself to the mast.\u201dIan Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the policy consensus concealed the fragmented internal debate about other critical questions. \u201cBeyond the broad agreement to continue tapering the pace of asset purchases and the dropping of the 6.5 percent threshold,\u201d he wrote in an email Wednesday, \u201ccommittee members disagree on just about everything else.\u201dOfficials disagree, for example, about the extent of slack in the labor market, a debate that continued at the March meeting. While Ms. Yellen and her allies see evidence that the supply of workers remains much larger than the demand for their services, a few Fed officials \u2014 and a number of prominent economists outside the Fed \u2014 say the labor market is nearing a new equilibrium, implying the Fed should wind down its stimulus campaign more quickly or risk higher inflation.Charles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and one of Ms. Yellen\u2019s main allies, said in an interview on Wednesday that he was frustrated by the persistence of concerns about inflation at a time when the immediate problem is a lack of inflation.\u201cI\u2019m not quite sure why we would want to raise interest rates with 1 percent inflation no matter what the unemployment rate is,\u201d Mr. Evans said.Officials also disagree about the health of financial markets. Some officials see growing risks to financial stability, including a downward trend in risk premiums, while a majority continues to see those risks as modest and secondary.Fed officials expressed satisfaction in the weeks before the March meeting that investors seemed to share their expectations about the evolution of monetary policy, including a view that the Fed was most likely to start raising interest rates in the second half of 2015, assuming that growth fulfilled their expectations.In the account, some officials worried the change in guidance would disrupt that mutual understanding. The pressure to move had also eased somewhat. The unemployment rate, which fell steadily last year, has flattened out in recent months. Labor force participation increased in March, and if that trend continues, it may be some time before unemployment falls below the 6.5 percent threshold.According to the account, they hoped to set the issue at rest by appending a single sentence to the end of the longest policy statement the Fed has ever issued: \u201cThe change in the committee\u2019s guidance does not indicate any change in the committee\u2019s policy intentions as set forth in its recent statements,\u201d it said.Still, Fed officials were aware that their own policy forecasts were likely to increase the confusion, as their combined predictions showed a modest increase in the likelihood that the Fed would start to raise rates in the first half of 2015. Ms. Yellen then appeared to reinforce that shift at her inaugural news conference, an impression that she and other Fed officials have since sought to dispel.The Fed also has sought to shape investor expectations in recent months by emphasizing that it intends to raise interest rates slowly, as it did during its most recent tightening cycle. Beginning in 2004, it raised its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage point at 17 consecutive policy meetings.Some experts have since argued that the Fed moved too slowly, and that changes in monetary policy often need to be sharp rather than gradual. That view gained traction among Fed officials immediately after the 2007-8 financial crisis, when it seemed that it might be necessary to unwind the Fed\u2019s stimulus campaign quickly to keep inflation under control. But the pendulum has swung back to the slow-and-steady approach, reflecting the Fed\u2019s assessment that the weakness of the economy remains its primary concern.\u201cJust a few years ago, many forecasters \u2014 in and out of the Federal Reserve \u2014 were projecting growth rates at an annualized rate of 4 percent or greater for at least a year. That expectation raised the question of whether a reasonably rapid tightening in monetary policy might at some point be needed,\u201d Daniel K. Tarullo, a member of the Fed\u2019s board, said in a Wednesday evening speech to an economic conference. Given the sluggish pace of growth, he continued, \u201cit seems less likely that we will experience a growth spurt in the next couple of years that would engender concerns about rapid wage pressures and changes in inflation expectations.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Harming Franchisees", "Date": "2014-04-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetterTo the Editor:Research continues to show that raising the minimum wage will result in fewer jobs, reduced hours for workers and slower economic growth. The proposed bill indicates that some policy makers do not understand the franchise business model.Franchisees are local small-business owners, operating under national or regional brands. For the many franchise businesses that are labor-intensive and already operate on thin profit margins, this legislation could be the difference between continuing to operate and going out of business \u2014 between maintaining employees or shedding more jobs.Raising the cost of labor on these entrepreneurs will only make it harder for them to grow their businesses, while simultaneously reducing the opportunities for the employees this policy is seemingly intended to help.Legislation such as this would set a dangerous precedent that franchisers are joint employers with their franchisees. Small-business owners should be able to determine the most competitive starting wage and subsequent raises for their employees within their industry and local economy.The nonpartisan Tax Foundation just announced that New York is no longer the worst state in America for business. It is unfortunate that some well-intentioned but uninformed lawmakers in Albany are already threatening to win the race back to the bottom.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ukraine Says That Militants Won the East", "Date": "2014-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKIEV, Ukraine \u2014 It is by now a well-established pattern. Armed, masked men in their 20s to 40s storm a public building of high symbolic value in a city somewhere in eastern Ukraine, evict anyone still there, seize weapons and ammunition, throw up barricades and proclaim themselves the rulers of a \u201cpeople\u2019s republic.\u201d It is not clear who is in charge or how the militias are organized.Through such tactics, a few thousand pro-Russian militants have seized buildings in about a dozen cities, effectively establishing control over much of an industrial region of about 6.5 million nestled against the Russian border.Day by day, in the areas surrounding the cities of Donetsk and Luhansk, pro-Russian forces have defied all efforts by the central government to re-establish its authority, and on Wednesday, Ukraine\u2019s acting president conceded what had long been obvious: The government\u2019s police and security officials had lost control.\u201cInactivity, helplessness and even criminal betrayal\u201d plague the security forces, the acting leader, Oleksandr V. Turchynov, told a meeting of regional governors in Kiev. \u201cIt is hard to accept but it\u2019s the truth. The majority of law enforcers in the east are incapable of performing their duties.\u201dWith Mr. Turchynov\u2019s acknowledgment that a significant chunk of the country had slipped from the government\u2019s grasp, the long-simmering conflict in Ukraine seemed to enter a new and more dangerous phase. Whether that amounts to the lasting dismemberment of Ukraine or hands control of the east to Russia and its president, Vladimir V. Putin, were among the many questions left unanswered after Mr. Turchynov delivered his stark assessment.Whatever the long-term effects, the militants\u2019 seizure of symbolic buildings in cities throughout the country\u2019s southeast is serving what analysts in Russia and the West say is Mr. Putin\u2019s short-term goal of so disrupting normal life there that the pro-Russian separatists\u2019 plans for a May 11 vote on autonomy from Kiev could trump Ukraine\u2019s plans to hold a presidential election two weeks later.While Russia denies any role in stirring the unrest, Secretary of State John Kerry and others have flatly accused the Kremlin of sending operatives to the region to organize, equip and direct the Ukrainians who make up the pro-Russian militias.The presence of 40,000 Russian troops just over the border is also contributing to the instability, particularly as Russia has warned repeatedly that it will intervene in Ukraine if the safety of the ethnic Russians there is threatened, a sweeping claim that could justify an incursion at almost any time.\u201cUntil May 25,\u201d when the presidential vote is scheduled, \u201cis unfortunately still a lot of time,\u201d said Olga Aivazovska, a co-founder of Opora, an independent election monitoring and polling group. Whether a vote will take place \u2014 and how valid it could be if parts of the east do not take part \u2014 \u201cis a big puzzle,\u201d she said.But none of that is expected to deter the militants. Since April 6, they have been smashing their way into local offices and hastily erecting barricades outside, wearing uniforms without insignias. The latest to fall was Horlivka, where on Wednesday armed men appeared at the City Council building and began checking the documents of anyone entering.In Donetsk, a tough mining city, the militants say they will conduct a referendum on May 11, and other cities under separatist control are expected to follow suit. Gunmen in Luhansk seized control of that city\u2019s administration on Tuesday and declared their intent to join in.To date, however, there are no voting offices, nor have any ballots been distributed. They have not even decided what question they want to put before voters.Nevertheless, the buildings now seized could serve the effort. A sample ballot reported in the Russian news media suggested voters would be asked whether they support a declaration of independence for the \u201cpeople\u2019s republic.\u201d There was no mention of joining Russia.Although Russian is widely spoken in the east, which abuts Russia, credible opinion polls suggest that at most 20 percent of citizens want to join their giant neighbor, Ms. Aivazovska said.For Mr. Putin, the disruption ensures that Ukraine cannot firmly join the West by becoming a member of NATO or the European Union. That would comport with his strategy in Georgia and Moldova, where Russian troops occupy small sections of the country, with Moscow leaving the status of the enclaves up in the air, neither leaving nor claiming them as Russian territory.After five months of violence and revolution, Ms. Aivazovska said, nerves are jangled. \u201cYou go to bed at night not knowing whether you will wake up in a different country,\u201d she added, echoing almost word for word a leading writer, Oksana Zabuzhko, interviewed two days earlier.In some ways, the situation seems no more certain for Mr. Putin. As leaders in Serbia and Croatia discovered during the Balkan wars in the 1990s, once guns, money and a little importance are doled out to locals charged with unsettling their territory, the militants can slip from their supporters\u2019 grasp.In Slovyansk, the eastern Ukrainian town where the armed men are most firmly in control, local militia leaders say they now hold about 40 people, including seven Europeans in a German-led military observer mission captured last Friday. They were paraded before cameras Sunday, much as scores of United Nations peacekeepers captured by Bosnian Serbs in 1995 were filmed chained to bridges.Mr. Putin, who values relations with Germany, where he was once a K.G.B. officer, hinted early Wednesday that the observers could be freed. The self-appointed mayor of Slovyansk responded via the website of Bild, Germany\u2019s top-selling newspaper: \u201cWe have had no contact with Moscow yet, and here we don\u2019t obey Putin but the People\u2019s Republic of Donetsk.\u201dOn top of nerves, Ukraine\u2019s economy is worryingly frail. The board of the International Monetary Fund voted Wednesday to approve $17 billion in loans for Ukraine, with conditions that will undoubtedly be felt as hardships by ordinary Ukrainians. Igor Burakovsky, head of the Institute for Economic Research and Policy Consulting, said on Wednesday that Ukraine\u2019s foreign debt amounts to $73.2 billion. This includes several billion dollars \u2014 the exact amount is fiercely disputed \u2014 owed for deliveries of Russian natural gas on which Ukraine depends each winter, and which passes through its territory to European clients of the Russian gas concern Gazprom.Unlike some of the militants now strutting Ukraine\u2019s east, or other friends of Mr. Putin, the head of Gazprom, Alexei Miller, was not sanctioned this week by the United States or the 28-nation European Union, where at least 10 former Soviet bloc countries depend wholly or largely on Russian gas for heat and power.Much is being rethought in Europe after Mr. Putin\u2019s annexation of Crimea and continuing intervention in Ukraine. This week, Slovakia undertook to supply Ukraine with some natural gas.For writers, said Ms. Zabuzhko, the events of the last five months have pushed on her and fellow authors the duty of serving as a secular moral authority in the absence of credible politicians. \u201cI have a new profession,\u201d she said, \u201cfor which I was not applying.\u201d Ukrainians, she added, \u201care searching for stability and hope \u2014 they want a glimpse of hope.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the timing of the Ukrainian military\u2019s push toward Slovyansk with a column of 21 armored vehicles. It took place two weeks ago, not last week.Alison Smale reported from Kiev, and Andrew Roth from Donetsk, Ukraine. C. J.

He was forced to leave his sunny Athens apartment, sell his BMW convertible and move in with his elderly mother. Soon, he found himself in a place he had never dreamed he would be: in line at a soup kitchen.\u201cI used to be sought after,\u201d said Mr. Polychronopoulos, 49. \u201cBut there is no place for me in society anymore.\u201d\u201cThere is a silent crisis in which a growing number of people are being left behind,\u201d said Jens Bastian, an economist who was a member of the European Commission\u2019s task force for Greece until this year. \u201cPeople who one or two years ago thought the financial crisis was something that happened only to others are themselves out of a job, or increasingly pushed to the margins.\u201dPoliticians prefer to cite the positive. When Greece\u2019s finance minister last week lauded news that the country had passed economic muster by international creditors to receive its next allotment of bailout money, he praised his fellow citizens.\u201cThanks to the sacrifices of the Greek people,\u201d said Yannis Stournaras, the finance minister, \u201cwe have the luxury to be able to discuss economic growth rather than fiscal adjustment.\u201dGreece even plans to resume selling bonds soon, possibly this week, for the first time since it became the epicenter of the European debt crisis in 2010 and required the first of two bailouts. The government announced last month that Greece had achieved a primary surplus \u2014 a surplus not counting debt payments \u2014 as a result of bailout-imposed austerity.But many Greeks, like Mr. Polychronopoulos, who are still struggling might call it too soon to declare victory.The governments of Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain are also forecasting accelerating recoveries, unleashing a wave of optimism among international investors, who have flocked to buy their debt.But despite such signs of recovery, \u201cgrowth in and of itself will not solve the human and social problems that have been rising,\u201d said Isabelle Maquet-Engsted, deputy head of social analysis at the European Commission, the administrative arm of the European Union. \u201cWe now have to deal with the fact that many people have been affected very seriously, and it will be difficult to put them back on track.\u201dPeople without jobs who have been seeking work for more than a year account for more than half of the unemployed in Greece, Ireland and Italy.Among them was Mr. Polychronopoulos, an energetic man who said he slumped into depression the longer he went without a job. As a consultant, he had spent a 25-year career building marketing and sales networks for several Greek companies, earning about \u20ac6,000, or $8,231, a month at the peak of his career, a salary that afforded him vacations on the Greek islands and a cozy apartment in central Athens.But when his consulting position suddenly ended four years ago, his self-employed status made him ineligible for benefits. Money ran low, and soon he and his mother were barely able to afford living expenses, including food.And when jobs are created, many are low-paid, temporary contracts \u2014 replacing permanent positions, which labor laws often require to come with expensive benefits and protections that employers are reluctant to assume. According to Eurostat, the official statistics agency, more than half of new jobs in the European Union last year were temporary positions that often did not pay a living wage.When he began, in 2012, he trolled produce markets and asked vendors to donate potatoes, tomatoes and other food toward a giant cooking pot he would set up in the middle of the sidewalk.Now, with a group of volunteers, he serves about 130 rations a day \u2014 including to Greeks who, like himself, used to live well but slid into the social margins. He himself scrapes by on the donated food he receives and cooks for others.\u201cPeople can fall from grace,\u201d Mr. Polychronopoulos said one weekday as he stirred a caldron in a square near the Acropolis. \u201cThey need a gesture of solidarity.\u201dHe pointed to the crowd who had gathered for a meal, including a neatly dressed teacher carrying a briefcase, whose salary had been slashed to such an extent that he and his family were on the verge of being evicted.\u201cThe real crisis won\u2019t be over anytime soon,\u201d Mr. Polychronopoulos said. \"The most important thing is for people who have been affected to maintain their dignity.\u201dAn earlier version of this article gave an incorrect name for a communal kitchen that distributes meals in Athens.

But even as commentators welcomed the new crack in the glass ceiling, they also underscored that no woman had been nominated to become chief executive, where the effective power and remuneration lie.Since his meteoric rise to national prominence as the leader of the Democratic Party in February, and then prime minister, Mr. Renzi has actively promoted women. Under his watch, the party\u2019s 13-member secretariat became predominantly female; eight of the 16 ministers in Mr. Renzi\u2019s cabinet are women; and last week Mr. Renzi appointed women to lead his party\u2019s ticket in the main districts for the European Parliament elections next month.The companies, which are publicly traded, are owned in whole or in part by the Ministry of Economy and Finances. The nominees will be up for votes by shareholders at annual meetings scheduled for May.Anticipation had been high for weeks over which candidates would be named to some of Italy\u2019s most powerful posts, including positions at the defense group Finmeccanica.

Other Italian news media heralded a \u201cPink Revolution,\u201d while the left-leaning Manifesto newspaper more dryly described the nominees as \u201cRenzi\u2019s Angels.\u201dMs. Marcegaglia, who was the first woman to lead Italy\u2019s main business lobby, Confindustria, and Ms. Todini have been prominent in their family businesses, while Ms. Grieco is president of the information technology group Olivetti. Ms. Todini currently sits on the board of the state broadcaster RAI.The nominations are a further move toward gender equality in a country that has the third lowest employment rates for women in Europe \u2014 47 percent, well below the European average \u2014 and where many women stop working when they have children. Experts have pointed out that Italy offers little support \u2014 in terms of day care and other services \u2014 to working mothers.Mr. Renzi said Monday evening that he was \u201cparticularly satisfied\u201d by the \u201cstrong female presence\u201d in the public sector that his government had promoted through the nominations.Susanna Camusso, the first woman to lead Italy\u2019s largest trade union, CGIL, wryly noted that to counter protests about exorbitant wages at state controlled companies, the government had capped the salaries of the board chiefs, also known as presidents in Italy, at 238,000 euros, or $329,000.\u201cCoincidentally, the presidents are women,\u201d said Ms. Camusso, the news agency Ansa reported. The government did not cap the salaries of chief executives.The nominations were mandated by a contentious law that came into effect in August 2012, under which at least 20 percent of board seats in all Italian companies must be held by women.With the second renewal, women must fill 30 percent of all board seats, putting Italy at the forefront of most other European countries. Executives at state companies are nominated every three years.\u201cI think his merit is that he went beyond what the law states,\u201d and nominated women to key posts rather than just the boards, said Lella Golfo, a former center-right lawmaker. Ms. Golfo spearheaded the heated parliamentary battle that led to the approval of the law, which has already raised the percentage of women in boardrooms from under 5 percent in 2010 to around 18 percent last year, a change she described as an \u201cepochal revolution.\u201dPaola Profeta, a professor at Bocconi University in Milan, said \u201cthe process of selection has become more meritocratic,\u201d with managers culled from a broader field \u201crather than from the closed circle\u201d that used to dominate the managerial class.Mr. Renzi said that the choices were made on merit and that two employment placement firms assisted an ad hoc nomination committee in coming up with candidates.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russia Raises Some Salaries and Pensions for Crimeans", "Date": "2014-03-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Moving quickly to envelop Crimea in the Russian bureaucracy and economy, the Kremlin said Monday that it had nearly doubled pensions paid to retirees on the peninsula, raising them to the average levels paid in Russia.To reinforce the message from Moscow, Russia\u2019s prime minister, Dmitri A. Medvedev, traveled to the region\u2019s capital to hold a meeting with members of the cabinet and local officials.In what American officials interpreted as an encouraging sign on Monday that Russia would not invade other regions of Ukraine, the German government released a statement saying Mr. Putin told Chancellor Angela Merkel in a telephone call that he had ordered a partial withdrawal of Russian troops massed on Ukraine\u2019s eastern border, a source of great tension with Western governments in recent weeks.The German statement characterized the troop movement as described by Mr. Putin as \u201cthe partial withdrawal of Russian troops ordered from the eastern border of Ukraine.\u201dThere was no direct confirmation from Russian officials. The Kremlin\u2019s statement describing the same telephone conversation made no mention of any troop withdrawals. It said only that the leaders \u201cdiscussed various aspects of the situation in Ukraine, including the possibility for international involvement in restoring stability\u201d and that the pair had also talked about constitutional overhaul in Ukraine and another troubled region of Eastern Europe, the separatist Transnistria region of Moldova.The Ministry of Defense posted a statement online saying one mechanized battalion, a unit that would typically consist of about 500 men, had completed exercises in the Rostov region, which borders Ukraine, and was returning to base elsewhere in Russia.The troops had simply completed their exercises, the statement said, without clarifying whether this relatively modest troop movement signaled any broader pullback from the Ukrainian border.American officials, who estimate the Russians have deployed 40,000 to 50,000 troops near the Ukrainian border, reacted positively to the apparent pullback, whatever its size.\u201cIf reports that Russia is removing some troops from the border region are accurate, it would be a welcome preliminary step,\u201d said Jen Psaki, a State Department spokeswoman. \u201cWe would urge Russia to accelerate this process. We also continue to urge Russia to engage in a dialogue with the government in Kiev to de-escalate the situation, while respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.\u201dMr. Medvedev said Crimea would become a special economic zone with tax breaks for businesses that invest in the region.Russia\u2019s retirement benefits are not high by the standards of developed countries but are higher than those in Ukraine, a condition that has proved one appeal of the annexation for residents of the peninsula, which includes many Soviet military veterans.The average monthly pension in Russia in 2013 was about 10,000 rubles, according to the RIA state news agency, or $285 at the current exchange rate. In comparison, the average pension in Ukraine in December was $160. Raising retirement benefits on the peninsula is sure to prove popular, though its cost compared with the size of Russia\u2019s budget is only modest. About a third of Crimea\u2019s two million people are retirees; Russia, excluding the newly annexed region, has a population of 143 million. At a recent cabinet meeting, Mr. Medvedev said increasing pensions to Russian levels would cost about $1 billion this year.Michael R. Gordon contributed reporting from Jerusalem.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Delays Final Call on Keystone XL Pipeline", "Date": "2014-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The State Department will delay its decision on construction of the Keystone XL pipeline until it has a clearer idea of how legal challenges to the pipeline\u2019s route through Nebraska will be settled, State Department officials said Friday.Both supporters and opponents of the pipeline criticized the delay as a political ploy aimed at punting the final call on the divisive project until after the midterm elections in November.The 1,700-mile pipeline, which would carry crude oil from the Alberta oil sands in Canada to Gulf Coast refineries, has emerged as an issue in the battle for control of the Senate. Vulnerable Democratic incumbents from oil-rich states, like Senators Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana, who is chairwoman of the Senate Energy Committee, and Mark Begich of Alaska, have urged President Obama to approve the pipeline.But approving the pipeline before the election could staunch the flow of money from liberal donors and fund-raisers who oppose the project, like Tom Steyer, a California billionaire. Mr. Steyer, who has personally asked Mr. Obama to reject the pipeline, is positioned to play a major role in influencing the midterms: He has pledged to spend $100 million to support candidates who back strong policies to fight climate change.Delaying the pipeline decision until after the election could help Democrats on both sides of the issue. Supporters could court voters by calling for its approval, while liberals who oppose the pipeline could still enjoy financial support from donors like Mr. Steyer.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing politics trumping policy making,\u201d said Cindy Schild, a senior manager at the American Petroleum Institute, which represents oil companies\u2019 interests in Washington.\u201cHere\u2019s the single greatest shovel-ready project in America \u2014 one that could create thousands of jobs right away \u2014 but the president simply isn\u2019t interested,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cApparently radical activists carry more weight than Americans desperate to get back on the job.\u201dHe said sarcastically that \u201cthe El Ni\u00f1o scheduled for later this spring be pushed back to after the midterms.\u201dMr. Steyer said he was cheered by the delay. \u201cThe State Department and president are going to take the time to do the review that\u2019s necessary,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThe fact that they want to do a more specific and thorough analysis is good news.\u201dThe pipeline has been under review at the State Department since 2008 and became a political issue during the 2012 presidential campaign.Activists say its construction could devastate the environment, but several State Department reviews have concluded that the pipeline would be safe. In January, the State Department released an 11-volume environmental impact statement concluding that the pipeline was unlikely to significantly increase the rate of carbon pollution in the atmosphere. Even if the pipeline was canceled, it said, the oil sands crude was likely to be extracted and brought to market by other means, such as rail, and then processed and burned. That analysis kicked off a 90-day review process, during which Secretary of State John Kerry, who must determine whether the project is in the national interest, sought comment from eight other agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency and the Departments of Commerce, Defense and Homeland Security. If any of those agencies disagrees with Mr. Kerry\u2019s assessment, the final decision will go to Mr. Obama.That interagency review was to be completed in two weeks, but Friday\u2019s decision indefinitely delays that deadline. State Department officials said Friday that the review process could not be completed until the agencies were more certain about the fate of the pipeline\u2019s route through Nebraska.In February, a Nebraska district court blocked the governor\u2019s decision to allow the pipeline to pass through the state. The decision has been appealed to the State Supreme Court, and a ruling there is unlikely to come before the end of the year.\u201cThe Nebraska Supreme Court decision could lead to changes in the pipeline route, and it\u2019s important to have that information and better understand that route, because it could have implications for environmental, socioeconomic and cultural impacts of the pipeline,\u201d a State Department official said Friday in a conference call with reporters that was conducted on the condition that the official not be named.The official added, \u201cOur goal is to do this as expeditiously as possible in a way that suits the national interest.\u201dA new Nebraska route could be plotted if TransCanada, the company seeking to build the pipeline, submits a new permit application to the state, but that process could take months or even years. \u201cWe are extremely disappointed and frustrated with yet another delay,\u201d Russ Girling, the president and chief executive of TransCanada, said in a statement. \u201cAfter more than 2,000 days, five exhaustive environmental reviews and over 17,000 pages of scientific data, Keystone XL continues to languish.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Suicide and Politics Mix in India", "Date": "2014-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAs politicians scramble for India\u2019s 815 million votes in the most expensive and closely contested general election in the nation\u2019s history, an unexpected protest is rumbling from what was once one of the country\u2019s most placid voter blocs: its farmers.The protest is inflamed by rising attention to the shocking suicide rate on India\u2019s hardscrabble farms. Since 1995, more than 290,000 farmers have killed themselves. Though that figure, compiled by the National Crime Records Bureau, is sketchy at best, perceptions are what counts in politics. And that perception, along with the reality that most of these suicides are borne of desperation wrought by decades of official corruption, crushing debt and cruel neglect, is being coupled with a revolutionary change in election law. For the first time, angry farmers can reject all the politicians clamoring for the vote and mark their ballots \u201cNone of the Above.\u201dKishor Tiwari, the grandson of a farm security guard in the Vidarbha region of Maharashtra state, is one of many advocates who say the so-called NOTA ruling will give people new political clout. His organization, the Vidarbha People\u2019s Protest Forum, monitors suicides and fights for financial support for the families of the dead. He says government aid to beleaguered farmers is always promised but is often stolen, or simply not delivered. But now voters will no longer have to make a choice between bad or worse, or lose their voice by staying at home. Politicians, he says, \u201cthink we respond to campaigning. No. We respond to action.\u201dHe says the high suicide rate is the direct product of deep poverty aggravated by the government\u2019s risky economic policies and bureaucratic apathy. Moreover, he thinks such deaths are purposely underreported.Assertions that the suicide rate among the country\u2019s agricultural workers is nearly three times the national average are widely believed in India, but precise figures are difficult to come by. (Health workers, social scientists and statisticians point out that the issue is extremely complex.) The World Health Organization estimates that roughly 170,000 Indians in all walks of life commit suicide every year; the Indian government put the figure at about 135,000 in 2010. That is misleading, not least because suicide is a crime in India, and as such falls under the purview of the National Crime Records Bureau. The social stigma it brings, and the risk that it may mean a loss of government compensation, feeds a family\u2019s reluctance to report such deaths. Moreover, many suicides occur among agricultural workers who are not officially categorized as farmers. \u201cThere is likely to be a serious underestimation of suicides,\u201d Professor K. Nagaraj, an economist at the Asian College of Journalism wrote in a 2008 report. \u201cThe most important problem is the way a farmer is defined at the ground level \u2014 as someone who has a title to land. This is likely, for instance, to leave out tenant farmers, and, particularly, women farmers.\u201d These factors, according to Mr. Nagaraj, amount to a \u201cconspiracy of silence.\u201dOther studies raise more ambiguity. \u201cSuicide Mortality in India,\u201d a report by eight Indian doctors and public health professionals published in the British medical journal Lancet in 2012, estimates that there were 187,000 such deaths in India in 2010: 115,000 men and 72,000 women. But the authors added, \u201cAlthough most suicide deaths occur in rural areas, our findings do not suggest that suicide is any more prevalent in agricultural workers (including farmers) than it is in any other profession.\u201dWhether or not perception exceeds reality, there is no denying that India\u2019s farmers have taken a battering in recent years. The global competition that came with the liberalization of the Indian economy in 1991 has cut into earnings. Costs soared when genetically modified seeds produced by foreign agricultural-products companies flooded Indian markets in the late 1990s. Most traditional farmers are now forced to borrow, often from private moneylenders at exorbitant interest rates.Though it\u2019s little wonder that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh\u2019s Indian National Congress has lost ground among farmers, other candidates are doing no better. Narendra Modi of the Bharatiya Janata Party swooped into Vidarbha last month with a promise to declare the recent weather-ravaged farm conditions a \u201cnational calamity.\u201d Another of the main prime ministerial candidates \u2014 Arvind Kejriwal of the Aam Aadmi Party \u2014 has also made the kind of last-minute campaign promises that farmers have heard before.Faced with such an unpopular roster, thousands of farmers and their families gathered on March 15 at Bhimkund village in Vidarbha, where a farmer named Kiran Kolvate led the protest. \u201cAll political parties across the spectrum have totally ignored the plight of half a million farmers,\u201d she declared, urging the crowd to vote \u201cNone of the Above.\u201dThat rallying cry is spreading. On April 7, the day India began five weeks of voting, people from 25 farming villages in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh declared that they too would mark their ballots NOTA. On April 11, the Indian International Youth Organization placed an advertisement on YouTube in which a young woman responds to her grandmother\u2019s accusations of political apathy by saying she plans to press NOTA, and a voiceover declares that a protest vote sends a strong message, while refusing to vote solves nothing.In choosing \u201cNone of the Above,\u201d many farmers are demanding that India\u2019s leaders take action to end the misery undermining one of the key sectors of the economy. They can do this by making good on the unfulfilled promises of the past two decades: debt relief, fair market prices, better infrastructure, reasonable subsidies and aid for destitute families. The struggle to bring prosperity to India\u2019s farmers is far from over. But those who are tempted to give in to despair would be wise to remember the words of one of their own, the son of a farmer from a village in Tamil Nadu who became the first in his family to graduate from university and become a lawyer.In handing down the Supreme Court ruling last September that put NOTA on the ballot, that lawyer, now India\u2019s chief justice, P. Sathasivam, wrote: \u201cGradually, there will be a systemic change and the [political] parties will be forced to accept the will of the people and field candidates who are known for their integrity.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Bravo Came to Charleston", "Date": "2014-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHARLESTON, S.C. \u2014 For the last few years Charleston has been getting the sort of high praise it has not seen since before Reconstruction.Finally, it seemed, Charleston was getting its long-deserved due as an international capital of refined culture and distinctive taste after shaking the degradations of the Civil War, Hurricane Hugo and Borat \u2014 the \u201cDa Ali G Show\u201d character who blew through the society circuit here with an indelible display of lasciviousness several years ago.Then, Bravo came to town.More specifically, its reality show \u201cSouthern Charm.\u201d The network billed it as a peek into the \u201cnotoriously closed society of Charleston\u201d starring \u201ca group of the city\u2019s most charismatic gentlemen and their Southern belle equals.\u201dThe actual show, which made its debut in March and has its finale Monday night, with an average audience of roughly 1.1 million viewers, has drawn a different description locally.\u201cA pop culture smear on the Holy City,\u201d Charles W. Waring III, the publisher of the small and civic-minded newspaper The Charleston Mercury, called it in an interview, channeling the prevailing view of many longtime Charlestonians.The series, a showcase for a higher-end display of \u201cJersey Shore\u201d-style debauchery, is so reviled in certain quarters that it has spawned Hate Watch sessions here and wherever displaced Charlestonians gather. Some, including Charleston\u2019s longtime mayor, Joseph P. Riley Jr., refuse to watch it altogether, though he says he receives reports. Friends and relatives of would-be cast members have virtually threatened to disown them \u2014 that is, when not haranguing them with that most basic question, \u201cWhy?\u201dBravo does not get what all the fuss is about. \u201cEveryone in this cast loves Charleston,\u201d said Kathleen French, the Bravo senior vice president for current production. \u201cThey love their town.\u201d But it is not their love of the city that is being questioned; it is what they do on national television in their beloved city that is.Try: The 51-year-old former state treasurer Thomas Ravenel (who was forced from office in 2007 after a cocaine-related felony conviction) drunkenly beds a woman 29 years his junior in a one-night stand that turns into something more only after a pregnancy scare (the 21-year-old \u2014 a Calhoun, no less \u2014 proceeds to sleep with another cast member and have an apparent intimate encounter with yet a third); a 45-year-old bachelor, Whitney Sudler-Smith, informs his mother he may soon depart the large, historic house he shares with her for his own \u201cstabbin\u2019 cabin,\u201d better suited to his amorous adventures. This happens only after mom mildly complains about the late night \u201ctrail of women\u201d he brings through (\u201cJust as long as they walk upright I\u2019d be happy,\u201d she explains). In one precious moment, the cast member Jenna King likens a string hanging from a pair of jeans shorts she is trying on to that of a certain feminine hygiene product.Throughout, the cast members relay that this is just how people are in this town. At times they curse so much that the television bleeps like a car alarm.\u201cIt is not at all what we expect of our children,\u201d said Martha Whaley Adams Cornwell, a local artist and civic leader whose Charleston roots date to well before the Revolutionary War. She was sitting in the garden her mother made famous in the memoir \u201cMrs. Whaley and her Charleston Garden.\u201d Her mother, now deceased, also started the junior Cotillion dancing school, a social fixture where even now \u201cgirls wear gloves\u201d and \u201care taught to look into an adult\u2019s eyes\u201d along with their male dance partners, she said.Whatever behavior the \u201cSouthern Charm\u201d cast members may advertise, \u201cthe schools here are developing character as well as teaching,\u201d Ms. Cornwell said. She agreed to an interview at the request of Mayor Riley, who correctly predicted she would second his testimony that Charleston\u2019s reputation for gentility will survive even this perceived affront by Bravo.The carefully polished images of many great American cities have had to endure the muddy footprints of reality-show exhibitionistas (\u201cThe Real Housewives of Atlanta,\u201d \u201cThe Real Housewives of Miami\u201d and the Kardashians, wherever they may clack about in their strappy black heels). But not every metropolis has the reputation to uphold that Charleston does. It has held the \u201cMost Mannerly City in America,\u201d designation for nearly two decades.Mr. Riley said his primary concern was that the program was showcasing \u201cthe polar opposite\u201d of the civic spirit driving the renaissance here. \u201cDecadence didn\u2019t build Rome; it destroyed it,\u201d Mr. Riley declared during an interview in his grand City Hall office. \u201cYou build a great city and a robust economy by having people who wake up early in the morning with a clear head and a clear conscience and get to work and try to help each other.\u201dThe show was the conception of Mr. Sudler-Smith, 45. A Virginia native living in Los Angeles, he came to know Charleston after his mother, Patricia Altschul, bought an estate here. Fresh off his ambivalently received 2010 documentary \u201cUltrasuede: In Search of Halston,\u201d about the fashion designer, he immediately saw his opening for a show that would \u201cdeconstruct the myths of the old South but do it in a very funny assertive way.\u201d His inspiration was Mr. Ravenel \u2014 an outrageous sort who says one should have the right to do cocaine in the privacy of his own home even as he professes to be running for the Senate. Mr. Ravenel is precisely the kind of unrestrained character a reality show needs to thrive.Negative local buzz began building long before the show made its premiere, starting when Mr. Ravenel and Mr. Sudler-Smith invaded the sanctity of the Carolina Yacht Club with a camera last year. Mr. Ravenel, a member, said they were there only for a drink. Nonetheless, an argument ensued and, Mr. Ravenel confirmed in an interview, he was briefly suspended.\u201cIt is particularly egregious the idea that some believe it might be somehow acceptable to expose your friends and neighbors to potential global ridicule,\u201d Mr. Waring wrote at the time in The Mercury. \u201cThe Borat sting still smarts from several years ago.\u201dCasting \u201cSouthern Charm\u201d became a challenge. When a test reel of the show leaked on the website FitsNews, the family of at least one potential participant of true Charleston provenance, Thomas R. Bennett, successfully pressured him to drop out.\u201cMy sister screamed at me,\u201d said Mr. Bennett, a real estate agent whose family has been here since the 1690s. \u201cShe just said, \u2018You\u2019d have to leave town.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIn an interview by phone \u2014 Bravo would not have it otherwise \u2014 Mr. Ravenel said his family also pressured him to drop out. The Ravenels are one of the city\u2019s oldest families. His father, the former congressman Arthur Ravenel Jr., is so beloved that a major bridge here is named after him. \u201cThere are those mostly from old families \u2014 of which I\u2019m a part \u2014 that, you know, the whole idea that someone would air their dirty laundry in public is unacceptable,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will always be those types of people.\u201dHe compared his critics with the \u201cGone With the Wind\u201d character Ashley Wilkes, an equivocating Confederate officer whose Old World sense of etiquette becomes a broken compass after the war. \u201cI\u2019m not going to sit around and listen to what Ashley and his ilk are saying about me.\u201dThe show has produced at least one positive outcome \u2014 a baby, from the coupling of Mr. Ravenel and his now 22-year-old paramour, Kathryn Calhoun Dennis. No wedding date has been announced.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Time for Transition in Algeria", "Date": "2014-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe landslide re-election of Algeria\u2019s 77-year-old president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, last Thursday to a fourth term comes as no surprise. Despite reports that many younger Algerian voters stayed home, as well as accusations from the political opposition of election fraud, the official tally gave Mr. Bouteflika an incredible 81.5 percent of the vote. Mr. Bouteflika is in such fragile health following a stroke last year that he did not participate in three weeks of campaigning, and he cast his vote from a wheelchair. It is past time for Algeria to move toward a more open society and a more diverse economy. Mr. Bouteflika and his government, led by a small group of army generals and intelligence officials, many of whom are also in their 70s, enjoy support among older Algerians who credit them with ending a civil war during the 1990s that claimed up to 200,000 lives. Still, there is discontent among Algerians under the age of 45, who make up four-fifths of the country\u2019s 37 million people. Youth unemployment has steadily increased in recent years in Algeria\u2019s overly oil-dependent economy, and riots and demonstrations have increased as well. For years, the Algerian government has managed to keep its grip on power and a lid on social upheaval by a combination of political repression and generous social handouts financed by the country\u2019s oil wealth. A 2001 decree bans all demonstrations in Algiers, the capital, and the authorities are quick to crack down on public political gatherings elsewhere. Basic freedoms of association, peaceful assembly, collective bargaining and movement into and out of Algeria are severely restricted. According to Human Rights Watch, on the eve of the election, police detained and beat members of the new movement Barakat! (\u201cEnough!\u201d in Arabic), whose members opposed a fourth term, as they headed toward a peaceful protest at Algiers University. This strong-arm strategy cannot be sustained against a changing population. The decree banning demonstrations in Algiers should be repealed. Without legitimate means of dissent and the protection of basic rights, violent uprisings will only increase, threatening Algeria\u2019s stability and that of the entire, already volatile, region.

{"Headline": "Formula One\u2019s New-Age Hybrids Find Their Footing", "Date": "2014-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMotorsportsLewis Hamilton, the 29-year-old Englishman who won it, called it \u201ca racer\u2019s race,\u201d perhaps the best ever of his 24 victories, and by the measure of how many others in the sport described it, that was no boast.For many who follow Formula One, the Bahrain Grand Prix last weekend was the best in a decade, more spectacular for being staged at\u00a0night under floodlights. Comparisons have been drawn with some of the great duels in the history of grand prix racing, evoking Nuvolari, Fangio, Clark and Senna in their prime.In the desert setting, the Silver Arrows of Mercedes-Benz, driven by Hamilton and Nico Rosberg of Germany, drove wheel-to-wheel to the checkered flag, swapping the lead back and forth and finishing barely a second apart to give Mercedes its second 1-2 finish in grand prix racing since it re-entered the series in 2010. The team\u2019s 1-2 finish a week earlier in Maylasia was its first such result since Fangio\u2019s heyday in 1955.\u201cTwinvincible!\u201d Mercedes shouted from full-page ads in British newspapers\u00a0on Monday. The success in Bahrain, after opening the season with victories in Australia and Malaysia, seemed to have satisfied executives in Stuttgart that Formula One was doing for the company what was intended when it re-entered the series\u00a0as a factory team five seasons ago: building on success in the highest-technology form of motorsport\u00a0to lend a\u00a0contemporary edge to a traditionally stolid image.The heroics of the Mercedes drivers were replicated throughout the field, with passing and repassing lap after lap. It was as if Formula One had determined, at last, to mock those who have dismissed it in recent years as a stage for tedious lights-to-flag processions. Some might say that grand prix racing had never been in more desperate need of a showcase event.The immediate challenge in Bahrain was to continue demonstrating the viability of the new hybrid power units that made their debut this year. In place of the 750-horsepower naturally aspirated V8 engines that were used in recent years, the 2014 power units combine\u00a01.6-liter turbocharged V6 engines with two generator units that harvest energy from the braking and engine\u2019s exhaust to provide an electrically powered boost of up to 30 percent of the piston engine\u2019s output. The total horsepower is close to what was available from last year\u2019s V8s.Highly complex and costing millions to develop, the new hybrid powertrains are the sport\u2019s response to demands by major manufacturers \u2014 Mercedes and Renault, already competing, and Honda, pledged to return in 2015 \u2014 for engine technologies that are relevant to production cars and to the efficiency mandates that guide them. The new rules also impose a fuel limit that represents about a 35 percent reduction from the consumption of the V8 era.Though wary of the seeming oxymoron \u2014 mating flat-out, pinnacle-of-the-sport racing to a culture that prizes low-carbon technologies \u2014 Formula One\u00a0has crossed a Rubicon of sorts.But, until Bahrain at least, the compact had proved highly vexed,\u00a0and possibly doomed. Preseason testing featured such a rash of breakdowns, with teams like the Renault-powered Red Bulls barely able to complete a handful of laps at a stretch, that disaster seemed inevitable. Concerns arose that only a handful of cars would reach the finish at the race in Melbourne last month, and that the racing would assume the nature of an economy run.Major figures in the sport were in open rebellion, with Ferrari\u2019s chairman, Luca di Montezemolo, warning of a new era of \u201ctaxi cab driving.\u201d He was joined by Bernie Ecclestone, the sport\u2019s commercial rights holder, in predicting \u201cboring\u201d races that would further alienate a global TV audience, estimated by Formula One\u2019s own figures at about 450 million, that shrunk by at least 20 percent in the last years of the old engine formula.Sebastian Vettel, the Formula One champion for the Red Bull team for the past four years, joined a chorus of contempt for the new engines and their subdued exhaust noise. With a low-pitched growl and a turbo\u2019s whistle, the hybrid powertrains lack the adrenaline punch of the screaming 18,000-r.p.m. V8s.The situation is worse when cast in the context of Formula One\u2019s other woes. A sport where top teams can spend the best part of $500 million a year to field a two-car team over 19 races \u2014 the ballpark figure for Ferrari and Mercedes, with others like McLaren and Red Bull not far behind \u2014 was always at risk of becoming an anomaly in an era of economic malaise.Teams fielding at least half of the 22 cars that start each race have been teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, and efforts to persuade the wealthier teams to forgo their advantage by accepting budget caps have failed. Some second-tier teams have been unable to pay their drivers, and others have resorted to fielding only drivers, some unproven in Formula One, who can bring big sponsorship deals.Compounding this, Ecclestone faces trial on fraud, bribery and embezzlement charges relating to the series\u2019 2006 change of ownership maneuvered to keep him in charge. The trial is scheduled for\u00a0later this month.\u00a0And then there was Bahrain. Ahead of the race, much attention was focused on a meeting that brought together Ecclestone, di Montezemolo and Jean Todt, the former Ferrari team manager who is now president of the sport\u2019s regulatory authority, the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l\u2019Automobile, and a prime mover behind the move to hybrid power. Their discussions were quickly widened to include Niki Lauda of Mercedes, Christian Horner of Red Bull and Ron Dennis of McLaren.What transpired was an impasse between the haves \u2014 in this case, Mercedes, and the teams that use its engines \u2014 and the have-nots. With Ferrari and Red Bull trailing in the new-era races, the paddock talk was of a private deal that would use Todt\u2019s powers to cut race distances, ease fuel limits and approve changes to the Pirelli tires to even out the racing.\u00a0\u201cTo have drivers who save fuel and tires, this is not Formula One,\u201d di Montezemolo declared on arrival in Bahrain. But Lauda and Dennis took a stand in favor of sticking with the rules as they are, at least for the 2014 season.What followed on the track was more than a matter of compelling racing. The speeds seemed to quash any argument about taxi cab driving. The fastest straight-line speed of 204 m.p.h., by the Mercedes-powered Force India car of Sergio Perez, was 9 m.p.h. hour faster than the best of last year\u2019s V8s.Pointedly, Ecclestone and di Montezemolo left the track for their executive jets before the race ended, taking with them a solitary concession: that Todt\u2019s officials would work with the teams to seek ways of changing the V6\u2019s exhaust systems to generate more of the noise that many see as essential to spectator appeal. The aim is get\u00a0the engineering done in time for tests after the Spanish Grand Prix on\u00a0May 11.\u201cI think the noise matters,\u201d said Lauda, who was a three-time Formula One champion with Ferrari and McLaren and had the task of persuading Mercedes to stick with its program in the years when its cars were frequently uncompetitive.While speaking with an indulgent tone on\u00a0the issue of engine noise, Lauda managed to convey\u00a0the sense that nothing now was likely to deny Mercedes the\u00a0Formula One championship or cut the advantage that rivals said gives the team an advantage of as much as two seconds a lap.\u00a0\u201cIt gets in our head that the more noise you get the quicker you go,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an emotional thing.\u201dAn article last Sunday about the unexpectedly competitive Formula One racing season misstated the timing of notable results by Mercedes-Benz. While its drivers finished first and second at the Bahrain Grand Prix, it was not their first 1-2 finish since 1955. A week earlier, the team took first and second in Malaysia.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Degrees of Influence Peddling in China and U.S.", "Date": "2014-04-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt Intersection of Wealth and PowerTo understand how money and politics intertwine in the world\u2019s two largest economies, look no further than two important articles in The Times in the last few days.There is no accusation that Mr. Bush, now a presidential contender, did anything illegal, or for that matter, that Mr. Zhou did. But that\u2019s actually the point: The circumstances surrounding the two show the differences \u2014 and perhaps more surprising, the similarities \u2014 between how influence is peddled in two very different countries.In every modern society, the people who hold the levers of state power control the deployment of vast riches; every decision about a change in the tax code or the issuance of oil drilling licenses is worth billions to someone. The potential beneficiaries of those policies have every incentive in the world to try to influence the decisions.One could imagine a society in which all political leaders are some sort of philosopher kings, temperamentally disposed to have no use for money themselves, and thus immune from temptations. I am aware of no society on earth actually ruled that way. We\u2019ve seen nations with all sorts of methods of selecting their leaders: elected American politicians, Communist party apparatchiks in the former Soviet Union, top cardinals in the Catholic church who run the Vatican. And in the real world, whatever the details of the system of governance, the people who have the ambition and drive to end up in top leadership positions also want some degree of wealth and the comforts it can provide.Influence peddling is the mechanism by which those hoping to sway politicians ultimately reward those politicians. Whether it is ethical or unethical, legal or illegal, depends on what particular compromises a given country has come to accept.China has had a system in which the understanding is that legal authorities will take a don\u2019t-ask-don\u2019t-tell approach to family members of high political officials making vast sums. The prosecution of Mr. Zhou\u2019s family is a frontal assault on that understanding of what is official corruption.In the United States, the basic compact has been this: If you take financial benefits from a private interest that seeks to influence policy while in office, it is probably illegal. It\u2019s the same if a close family member does it. Just ask the former Virginia governor Bob McDonnell and his wife, Maureen, now under indictment for taking gifts while in office.Or, in the case of Jeb Bush, you can get paid money by Lehman Brothers to be an adviser. His exact duties in that role have not been publicly disclosed, but when the firm was in trouble in 2008, he was sent to meet with the Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim Hel\u00fa to see if he might invest in Lehman (he didn\u2019t).Using connections like that feels awfully similar to the arrangements that have been widespread in China, in which companies enlist the families of politicians to try to ensure favorable treatment by the government.The influence games are different in Washington and Beijing, of course. And not all corruption is created equal; it matters whether a particular variety of official corruption drags down a country\u2019s economy. At the worst extreme, a country where public officials at all levels demand constant bribes as a matter of course will not be a very hospitable environment for business.Former American officials can make millions from their political ties, but billions is unthinkable. And the United States has institutions that at least pull the more egregious financial conflicts facing politicians into the open. There are mandatory disclosures for lobbyists and corporate donors to campaigns. We have a free press that receives Pulitzers for exposing official corruption, rather than censorship and arrests. And for American prosecutors, winning an official corruption case is a way toward career advancement rather than career purgatory.Chinese leaders aren\u2019t, it would seem, ready for most of those steps yet. But the prosecution of Mr. Zhou\u2019s family is a sign that the country is heading toward a new definition of just what sort of soft corruption China\u2019s government \u2014 and its people \u2014 will live with.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Uneasy Inheritance of India\u2019s Political Dynasty", "Date": "2014-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW DELHI \u2014 On a visit to the rural constituency that has sent him or his relatives to Parliament for decades, Rahul Gandhi, the scion of India\u2019s most powerful political dynasty, was asked a simple question: Can you name five party workers from the area?The question, asked in a pre-election review meeting two years ago by a party worker unhappy with Mr. Gandhi\u2019s attitude toward politics, led Mr. Gandhi to shrug and admit that he could not name anyone, said a flabbergasted Shakeel Ahmad, 60, a second-generation Indian National Congress party leader in the politically vital state of Uttar Pradesh who was at the meeting.Mr. Gandhi has represented the area since 2004, \u201cand he does not know a single name?\u201d Mr. Ahmad asked. Politics is the Gandhi family\u2019s business. The clan has produced three prime ministers, including India\u2019s first, Jawaharlal Nehru. Mr. Gandhi, long groomed for high office, seems to have inherited few of the political skills for which his forebears were renowned, Mr. Ahmad said.\u201cCan you teach a fish to swim?\u201d he asked.Mr. Gandhi appears poised to preside over the most devastating defeat in the history of the Congress party, which has governed India for much of the past six decades. Analysts who have watched Mr. Gandhi struggle against a vast political tide as well as his own seeming ambivalence find themselves comparing him to characters in works by Shakespeare and Vyasa, the great Hindu sage.\u201cIt is a tragic drama just like \u2018Hamlet,'\u201d said Inder Malhotra, a political columnist. \u201cIt is the end of a dynasty because this fellow cannot make up his mind. He can\u2019t even decide whether to be clean-shaven or have a beard.\u201dMr. Gandhi, 43, was for years India\u2019s absentee crown prince, a member of Parliament who rarely spoke in public, disappeared from public view for long stretches and had a reputation for partying. He was expected to replace Manmohan Singh as prime minister, but his own ennui and poor political skills led to repeated delays in his elevation, said Sanjaya Baru, a former media adviser to Mr. Singh, echoing the comments of many others.In a recent memoir, Mr. Baru said that Mr. Singh ultimately failed as a prime minister because he allowed himself to be viewed as a seat warmer for Mr. Gandhi, even though Mr. Gandhi played almost no role in the government.\u201cI was at the center of power for four and a half years, and Rahul was a no-show,\u201d Mr. Baru said in an interview. \u201cHe was not a presence.\u201dThen last year, Mr. Gandhi became the vice president and official prime ministerial candidate of the Congress party. His mother, Sonia Gandhi, has said at rallies that she offered up her son to the nation\u2019s service.16 PhotosBut Mr. Gandhi has appeared reluctant to embrace political life. He refused to call himself a candidate for prime minister, and when pressed he suggested that the reason was the assassinations of his father and grandmother.Those sympathetic to Mr. Gandhi say that he will not be unhappy if his party loses the election. Rasheed Kidwai, who wrote a biography of Sonia Gandhi, said that Mr. Gandhi believed that his own father, Rajiv, became prime minister too early in life and made terrible mistakes as a result.\u201cFrom Rahul\u2019s point of view, he is not in a great deal of hurry to become prime minister,\u201d Mr. Kidwai said. \u201cI think in the back of his mind, the example of his father is always there.\u201dThe Gandhi family\u2019s latest decade-long reign atop India\u2019s government was bound to create some anti-incumbency feelings, Mr. Gandhi said in another television interview. But the governing coalition also gave voters plenty of other reasons to want change, including a sputtering economy, a host of corruption scandals, and a weak prime minister.Congress party insiders said in interviews that to win, the party needed to tar the opposition as an unacceptable and even dangerous alternative.With Mr. Modi as the principal opponent, this strategy should have been fairly easy to execute, they said. Mr. Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat, a state in western India, when more than 1,000 people died in riots in 2002, and he has been linked through a top aide to murders of Muslims by a police assassination squad.But Mr. Gandhi has until recently shied away from mounting a frontal attack on Mr. Modi\u2019s record. He scolded Congress party leaders when they criticized Mr. Modi too sharply, and in an interview he avoided discussing the 2002 riots despite being prompted several times.Leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party can scarcely believe their good fortune.In recent days, with most of the nation\u2019s voting already completed, Mr. Gandhi and his mother changed tack and finally started attacking Mr. Modi directly. But many analysts say the change has come far too late.Despite the disorder in the Congress party, few are ready to write the Gandhi family\u2019s political obituary. Indian politics are difficult to predict, and polls are often wrong. The Gandhis have long relied on votes from India\u2019s vast numbers of rural poor, and some believe that those voters \u2014 especially the women \u2014 will still turn out in force for them. At a recent rally in Mr. Gandhi\u2019s constituency, Amethi, a huge share of those gathered to shower him and his sister, Priyanka Vadra, with rose petals were women, which is unusual in northern Indian political gatherings.And in a culture in which many politicians serve into their 80s, Mr. Gandhi has decades to reinvent himself.\u201cIndian politics is like an unending cricket match,\u201d said Shekhar Gupta, the editor in chief of The Indian Express. \u201cThere are always new innings.\u201dSuhasini Raj contributed reporting from Amethi, India.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Artists and Spectators, Not So Far Apart", "Date": "2014-04-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMusic ReviewWith temperatures reaching 90 degrees, concertgoers created their own shade on the sun-baked festival grounds.\u00a0Ty Segall performed a blend of psychedelic and folk rock early in Day 2 of this year\u2019s Coachella festival in Indio, Calif.But who were the fans? One is a young man who bangs his body around to show you that he has been to the gym, or that he has a basically competitive attitude. He has grown simpler over the history of the festival. He wears black sunglasses, sleeveless shirt or none at all, backward baseball cap or headband, a water-pack on his back. He is a flat, hardy example of power and privilege. He seems to have no history. If style is something specific to a time or place that pleases the eye and the mind, he has no style. His time is running out. (Don\u2019t blame him. Blame globalism, the major banks, professional sports.) The other is a young woman who has by contrast grown more complicated: flowing summer dresses and floppy hats, fringes on everything, studded ankle boots and cutout sandals, fussy little bags with gold buckles, Navajo prints, mystical and skeptical, a cross between Laurel Canyon 1972 and Upper East Side 1986. An old-school cultural typologist, one looking for myth and cultural meaning, might say: This type looks more flexible, curious and specific to the region; she is meticulous and in some vague way historical, aware of the past, at least as, like, a thing. This is the type on which to base a culture and an economy. The bros continue to pack into the mainstream electronic dance-music shows in the gigantic Sahara tent, a space whose sound and culture hasn\u2019t changed much in the last seven years or so. (This year\u2019s Sahara slate included Zedd, Martin Garrix and Alesso.) But everywhere else in greater numbers, the young women redeem the festival. It is for, about, and in many cases by, them. People cheered while Martin Garrix performed at the Sahara stage at Coachella. The festival opened on Friday with performances by scores of artists of several genres on six stages.And then there were women who drew a more severe or high-concept line between performer and audience: Solange Knowles, dance-instructing and practicing high-register vocal chops on optimistic \u201980s R&B; the Nigerian-Lebanese D.J. Nicole Moudaber, playing a hypnotic, strictly minimal, bass-heavy set at the Yuma tent, this festival\u2019s successful approximation of an indoor club. Further, there were men making music that has manageable scale and texture and sensitivity, music that for whatever reason, women tend to like: Andre 3000 of the reunited Outkast; Pharrell Williams; Blood Orange, built around the funk scholar Dev Hynes; and Future Islands, basically built around the singer Samuel T. Herring. Mr. Williams reads this crowd perfectly: His music goes right down the middle between the two Coachella types, with tight, bouncing, aerated rhythm, and falsettos for days. (His dance records, unlike the music in the Sahara tent, have a clean design sense.) Before he lost his voice, in an hourlong set of songs under his own name or that he produced \u2014 what\u2019s the difference, really? \u2014 he called in his chits, bringing onstage Busta Rhymes (for \u201cPass the Courvoisier, Part II\u201d), Gwen Stefani (for \u201cHollaback Girl\u201d), Nelly, Snoop Dogg and Diplo. Outkast presented a more complicated situation. The hip-hop duo from Atlanta, Big Boi and Andre 3000, hasn\u2019t produced anything new since 2006, and hasn\u2019t had to. Its run of work, bridging urban and rural, Southern hip-hop and future-pop, old sexism and high ethics, suggested so much complexity and possibility that one can feel it did its job thoroughly. But lucrative reunion tours are clearly hard to turn down. As part of their state-set conceit, they were literally in a box: a cube covered with sheer fabric. Big Boi seemed comfortable; Andre 3000, whose fast rapping and Southern cadences were undiminished, did not, and turned his back to the audience for stretches. But only rarely does a band philosophically reinvent itself for a tour, which is what the Swedish electronic group the Knife did on Friday. For the tour behind its recent album \u201cShaking the Habitual,\u201d it hasn\u2019t created a spectacle around its primary singer, Karin Dreijer Andersson. It has become a leaderless troupe of women, for the most part, dancing in pastel-colored suits and playing invented instruments, mostly percussive, chanting metaphors and dreams which finally cohere into songs, and moving in joyous patterns. (When Ms. Andersson served as featured singer, she stood toward the back of the stage.) They were dancers and singers and musicians, not one thing more than any other; they were performers, privileging the performance over the song, and they were challenging the limitations of what a music-festival gig can be.slide showAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Keystone Pipeline May Be Big, but This Is Bigger", "Date": "2014-04-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 THE Keystone XL pipeline is a great political symbol. The proposed 1,700-mile pipeline, which would carry 830,000 barrels daily of carbon-heavy crude from Canada\u2019s Alberta oil sands to Gulf Coast refineries, has galvanized environmental activists, who call it a litmus test for President Obama\u2019s commitment to fighting climate change. It is a political weapon against Mr. Obama for Republicans, who call it a symbol of job creation and energy security. It has motivated liberal donors, led by the California billionaire Tom Steyer, who has personally urged Mr. Obama to reject the pipeline.On Friday, in what was widely viewed as an acknowledgment of just how potent the politics of Keystone have become, the State Department announced that it would delay the decision on the pipeline for several months, almost certainly until after the midterm elections.The move was seen as a political punt that would allow pro-Keystone Democratic senators from oil states to court voters by calling for construction of the pipeline, while still keeping Mr. Steyer\u2019s money in the campaign.But when it comes to the pipeline\u2019s true impact on global warming, energy and climate change experts \u2014 including former Obama administration officials \u2014 say Keystone\u2019s political symbolism vastly outweighs its policy substance.Protesters rallying with plastic pipelines around the White House draw television spotlights. But the real climate policy work is being done four blocks away, where a squadron of Environmental Protection Agency lawyers is shaping regulations to cut emissions from coal-fired power plants \u2014 the nation\u2019s largest source of carbon pollution \u2014 while at meetings in Beijing and Brussels, State Department officials are slogging through negotiations to get other countries to agree to similar cuts.Experts say that Mr. Obama\u2019s eventual decision on the pipeline will have a marginal impact on global warming emissions, while those dull-sounding E.P.A. rules and treaty talks will determine his enviromental legacy.Within that context, \u201cthe Keystone pipeline is a rounding error,\u201d said Kevin Book, the founder of ClearView Energy Partners, an energy analysis firm.Experts say that to make a serious dent in American carbon emissions, Mr. Obama\u2019s administration would have to enact policies that would force the two most polluting sectors of the nation\u2019s economy \u2014 cars and coal plants \u2014 to slash their emissions. Mr. Obama has already signed a United Nations accord pledging that the United States will cut its greenhouse gas emissions 17 percent from 2005 levels by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050; there is simply no way to hit those targets, experts say, other than by going after cars and coal. And he then would have to make the case to other nations that the United States had taken action \u2014 and that they must, too.The agency is now drafting a regulation, expected in June, to slash pollution from existing coal-fired power plants. Details aren\u2019t yet available, but experts estimate that it will cut an average of 200 million to 500 million tons of carbon emissions annually within a decade. And the E.P.A. estimated that regulations on building and appliance efficiency have cut or prevented the annual emission of 350 million tons of carbon.In billions of metric tons, 2011. The worldwide total was about 32.6 billion metric tons.That means the combined impact of the current and forthcoming E.P.A. regulations could lead to cuts of over one billion tons of emissions annually.That\u2019s an order of magnitude more than the 18.7 million tons of carbon that would be added by burning the tar sands oil \u2014 and it\u2019s likely that that oil will be brought to market regardless of whether the Keystone is built. That was the finding of a State Department environmental impact study on the project released in January.Some nongovernmental analysts question that report, saying that if Mr. Obama rejected the pipeline it would at least slow production of the oil. But experts say that even if that is true, it just doesn\u2019t matter much.\u201cRather than focus on a single piece of infrastructure whose climate change impact is quite limited, as the State Department found, we should focus on the steps the administration can take that would significantly reduce emissions, and by far the biggest is the use of the Clean Air Act to regulate power plant emissions,\u201d Jason Bordoff, a former Obama administration official, wrote by email. Until 2013 he was senior director for energy and climate change on the National Security Council staff; he now directs Columbia University\u2019s Center on Global Energy Policy.Michael Levi, director of the energy security and climate change program at the Council on Foreign Relations, said that \u201cwith regulations on power plants and cars and trucks, you\u2019re making a change that is likely to stick; with Keystone, you\u2019re not.\u201dSecretary of State John Kerry is working aggressively on a 2015 global climate change treaty in which the world\u2019s other major carbon polluters \u2014 particularly China and India \u2014 would also commit to cuts. And it is domestic actions on coal plants and cars, rather than Keystone, that will give negotiators the leverage they need to extract those pledges.\u201cThe regulations on vehicles and power plants \u2014 that\u2019s going be the centerpiece of what the U.S. can take to the next round of diplomatic talks,\u201d said Adele Morris, an energy and climate change policy expert at the Brookings Institution. David Goldwyn, an analyst who ran the Bureau of Energy Resources under former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, commented: \u201cBy comparison, the decision on Keystone is irrelevant or insignificant. It\u2019s a drop in the bucket.\u201dBut the E.P.A. regulations come with a host of complications. They will be denounced before midterm elections this year and meet a wave of challenges. Republicans and the coal industry have attacked them as \u201cjob-killing\u201d and a \u201cwar on coal,\u201d and intend to challenge them in Congress and the courts. The rules could lead to closures of many of the nation\u2019s 600 or so coal plants and imperil the livelihoods of the nation\u2019s 78,000 coal miners.And although the regulations are most likely to have a far greater environmental impact than a decision on the Keystone, they haven\u2019t served to fire up the environmentalist base. The problem with the regulations and global talks is that they\u2019re slow-moving and difficult to understand \u2014 they don\u2019t come with a tangible physical symbol and a decision directly from the president. In other words, they\u2019re not very good politics.That\u2019s why, say environmental advocates and donors, their focus on Keystone matters. They can use Keystone to fire up the environmentally minded voters \u2014 and to open donor wallets.\u201cTheoretically, the impact of these regulations is huge,\u201d said Betsy Taylor, president of Breakthrough Strategies and Solutions, a Democratic consulting firm that works with political donors interested in climate change.\u201cBut in practice, there\u2019s a lot of indications that these things will end up with loopholes,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s got to play out at the state level. What\u2019s really compelling about Keystone is that it\u2019s up or down.\u201dMr. Steyer, the former hedge fund manager who is largely behind putting Keystone on the political map, also founded a \u201csuper PAC,\u201d NextGen Climate, which has spent millions of dollars opposing the pipeline, including television and digital ads targeting politicians who support it.Mr. Steyer put it this way in an email: \u201cThe Keystone XL pipeline is a line in the sand that signifies whether our country has the courage, the commitment and the capacity to be a global leader in addressing the challenge of climate change before it\u2019s too late.\u201dAn article and an accompanying chart on April 22 comparing the projected Keystone XL pipeline with other sources of carbon emissions referred imprecisely to projected emissions from tar-sands oil moving through the pipeline. Producing and burning that oil would emit 18.7 million more metric tons annually than would conventional oil, or far less than 1 percent of United States emissions, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The tar-sands oil would not emit 18.7 million tons total, but about 150 million tons, or less than 3 percent of United States emissions.Advertisement"}

He was 73.The cause was cancer, his wife, Xiao Yu, said. Working in a succession of research institutes, Mr. Chen, a top government adviser, pushed reforms to rebuild China and open it to wider trade. One controversial step he endorsed was ending rural communes and a policy of returning Chinese to family farms.\u201cHe was a bridge to new ideas,\u201d said Wang Juntao, who as a student activist met Mr. Chen in 1979 and renewed their friendship in exile in the United States.\u201cChen Yizi believed that there was an opportunity to influence the Communist Party when it was at a time of uncertainty about its direction,\u201d Mr. Wang said. \u201cBehind the scenes, he was very influential in bringing new people and thinking into the system.\u201dBut Mr. Chen\u2019s fortunes changed when the student-led protests erupted across China in 1989. Communist Party hard-liners were outraged and pressed for a tough response. Moderate leaders, led by Mr. Zhao, favored a more conciliatory approach. Deng Xiaoping, the nation\u2019s top leader, backed the hard-liners, and Mr. Zhao was shunted aside. Mr. Chen sought to rally intellectuals and party moderates to support the students, while also seeking to defuse the crisis.On the morning of June 4, 1989, after soldiers had moved through Beijing overnight and shot at crowds resisting their advance to Tiananmen Square, Mr. Chen resigned from the party to protest the crackdown. He became a fugitive and escaped to Hong Kong, then to France and finally to the United States, where he continued to advocate for democratic change in China.For a time, he lived in Princeton, N.J., where he took part in the Princeton China Initiative, which included other exiles and studied China\u2019s economic and political conditions.\u201cEven when he was in exile abroad, his main energies and work were still concerned about reforming China,\u201d said Wu Renhua, a participant in the Tiananmen Square protests who also left Beijing after 1989 and settled in Los Angeles. \u201cChen Yizi was one of those who underwent a quite clear change after he left China, and people listened to him because he knew how the system worked from the inside.\u201d Mr. Chen was born in Sichuan Province, in southwest China, in 1940, the son of a hydroengineer. He won a place at Peking University and studied physics and Chinese. In 1965 he was condemned as a \u201ccounterrevolutionary revisionist\u201d for submitting a letter to party leaders in which he challenged blind obedience to Mao Zedong. Like millions of other urban youth, he was sent to labor in the countryside, an experience that exposed him to the harsh poverty of a great majority of rural people. After he returned to Beijing in 1979, he worked his way up as an adviser on rural policy before he was named to head the Institute for Economic Structural Reform. Besides his wife, Mr. Chen is survived by a daughter, Wu Sheng, from an earlier marriage.Advertisement"}

The first casualties lie in fresh graves.But will it?Yet the reasons for Mr. Putin to refrain from further military adventurism make a longer, more tangled list: the cost of a huge occupation force and the responsibility for the welfare of millions more people; the effect of new, more severe Western sanctions on an already weak economy; the possibility of significant Russian casualties caused by an insurgency in eastern Ukraine; a new, implacably anti-Russian western section of Ukraine; and likely pariah status internationally.On balance, the negatives would seem to outweigh the positives, analysts said.\u201cMilitary intervention from Putin\u2019s point of view is Plan B,\u201d Mark Galeotti, a New York University professor and expert on Russia\u2019s security forces currently doing research here, said recently. \u201cIt is not off the table, but it is not the ideal outcome.\u201dMr. Putin would rather feed the insurrection from afar, analysts said, never quite allowing the calm that would give Ukraine the opening needed to join the European Union, or worse, NATO. It is a tactic Russia has used successfully in previous attempts by former Soviet republics to shift westward.However, any conversation or briefing paper about Russia\u2019s next moves begins with a broad caveat. Few expected that Mr. Putin would seize Crimea in a matter of weeks.There are signs that Russia seems poised to invade.Significant Russian military assets, including intercontinental ballistic missiles, Navy ship gears, and jet and helicopter engines, are produced in eastern Ukraine. Vladislav Zubok, a Russian Cold War expert teaching at the London School of Economics who has been researching the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, said senior Soviet officials were panicked at the prospect of losing both Crimea and Ukraine\u2019s industrial heartland. So the current crisis has deep roots.But nothing is that straightforward.Perhaps a more significant precedent, Professor Zubok said, are the high-profile military maneuvers, without an invasion, long recommended by the K.G.B. to destabilize restive neighbors. Russia deployed that tactic in Berlin in 1958, and in Poland during the 1980-81 Solidarity uprisings, for example. If Moscow is following that strategy now, no invasion is imminent, he said.The main factor arguing against invasion is the risk to Russia\u2019s prosperity, which Mr. Putin restored.\u201cPutin will have to explain why he is risking war and sanctions and how he will improve the lot of seven million people there,\u201d Professor Zubok said. \u201cHow to do that and still maintain the standard of living of all Russians? He would really be saying: \u2018Guys, it is all for the Russian motherland now. It is time to tighten your belts.\u2019\u00a0\u201dThe economic fallout from Crimea has already shoved Russia toward recession, with capital flight and skittish foreign investors. Russia\u2019s credit rating was cut Friday by Standard & Poor\u2019s to just one notch above \u201cjunk\u201d status, pushing up the cost of much-needed loans abroad.Mr. Putin and his closest advisers and allies have brushed off the Western travel and banking sanctions imposed on them after the seizing of Crimea. But the threat of a major economic blockade, sanctions against entire sectors of the economy that would probably be set off by a Ukraine invasion, are another matter.\u201cThe scenario is like what happened to Iran,\u201d said Igor Korotchenko, a member of a civilian board that advises the Russian military and the editor in chief of National Defense Magazine. \u201cThe Russian Federation is not interested in bringing troops into eastern Ukraine.\u201dBeyond economics, the specter of Slavs killing Slavs would soon sour the Russian public on any invasion. Although the Ukrainian Army is weak, it numbers 70,000, and the country has a history of partisans\u2019 attacking invaders. Mr. Korotchenko said Russians would probably embrace military intervention only if the army was dispatched as a peacekeeping force should the Ukrainian military cause mass casualties.And the locals could also prove hostile. In eastern Ukraine, regional polls have found that at most one-third of the population, depending on the city, supports joining Russia.In Crimea, Russian soldiers were greeted warmly, and needed to hold only the Isthmus of Perekop, three miles wide, to sever Crimea from Ukraine. In eastern Ukraine, if the 40,000 Russian troops now estimated to be camped along the border crossed over, they would probably be attacked. Russia would also be responsible for a flood of refugees.\u201cYou cannot occupy this region only with these small green men,\u201d said Alexander M. Golts, an independent Russian military analyst, referring to the anonymous soldiers in Crimea whom Mr. Putin later admitted were elite Russian soldiers. \u201cSo you beat those poor Ukrainians. What then? You will have to establish a new border. You will not need 40,000 troops, you will need 140,000.\u201dUltimately, analysts said, it is much more advantageous \u2014 and far cheaper \u2014 for Russia to manipulate a low-grade mutiny with occasional flare-ups.That will achieve the goal Mr. Putin wants: keeping Ukraine just destabilized enough that it remains an unattractive partner to the European Union or NATO. Russia played out the same script before in Georgia and Moldova.\u201cIt would be a tank-free invasion,\u201d said Cliff Kupchan, an analyst at the Eurasia Group in Washington. \u201cThat is his long game. I think he will try that before he invades.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pfizer\u2019s Move Poses Challenge. Here\u2019s a Solution.", "Date": "2014-04-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTax PolicyThis is what strange behavior our corporate tax policy produces: The pharmaceutical company Pfizer has offered $100 billion to buy AstraZeneca, a British competitor, and avoiding taxes has a lot to do with it.By buying a British company, Pfizer will be able to become a British company, and thereby avoid American corporate tax liability on its non-United States income. Pfizer currently pays an effective corporate tax rate of 27 percent; Britain\u2019s corporate income tax rate is just 21 percent and about to fall to 20.It\u2019s counterintuitive, but Congress could avoid this problem by abolishing the tax on corporations\u2019 profits and much more aggressively taxing their American shareholders \u2014 who are unlikely to flee to London along with Pfizer\u2019s incorporation documents.Taxing multinational corporate profits is a mess because it\u2019s hard to do right. If Apple develops the iPhone in California, has a subcontractor manufacture it in China out of parts made in Korea and elsewhere, and then sells it in Europe through a unit in Ireland, how do we decide how much of the profit from sales should be booked where?Corporations exploit tax codes to hold their tax bills down, moving profits to the places where tax rates are lowest. Companies whose income derives from intellectual property, which can be located everywhere and nowhere, especially take advantage.But with corporate profits, the tax man gets two bites at the apple. Profits are taxed at the corporate level and again for shareholders as dividends or capital gains.Currently in the United States, corporate income is taxed twice. First at the corporate level at a rate up to 35 percent, but often much less in practice after smart tax lawyers do their work. Shareholders are then taxed on dividends at a rate of up to 23.8 percent, compared to a top rate of 43.4 percent on ordinary personal income. (Both figures include the 3.8 percent Medicare tax). Capital gains also get the preferential rate. They are taxed when the asset is sold, and in some cases not at all when a shareholder bequeaths his holdings at death.Mr. Viard and Mr. Toder would collect no tax at the corporate level, and then tax shareholder income at ordinary rates and on an \u201caccrual\u201d basis: If your stock holding went up in value by $5,000 this year, you would pay tax on $5,000 of income, regardless of whether you sold the stock, at the rate of up to 43.4 percent. (Only highly liquid investments, such as publicly traded stocks, would be taxed this way, on the assumption that shareholders could liquidate a portion of their shares to pay a tax bill, and losses could be deducted against gains.) Dividends would also be taxed at ordinary income tax rates.There are several advantages to this approach, beyond the greater ease of finding the income you intend to tax. It would eliminate a wide variety of distortions: Shareholders would no longer be discouraged from realizing gains; corporate debt would no longer be taxed more lightly than corporate equity, removing an incentive for corporations to take on more debt; companies would no longer be encouraged to hoard profits instead of paying out taxable dividends.This system could be made much more progressive than a system that relies on corporate taxation. Some fraction of the burden of the corporate income tax (about 20 percent, in the estimation of the Tax Policy Center) is actually borne by workers in the form of lower wages; the economic burden of shareholder-level taxation would be expected to fall substantially on shareholders.And unlike corporate tax, the individual tax can be applied at rates adjusted for the income of the shareholder. Corporate profits \u2014 in the form of dividends and stock price appreciation \u2014 would be taxed lightlyfor lower-income shareholders and the rich could still be taxed at high rates.There would be some challenges with the Viard-Toder proposal. The biggest is that it could reduce tax revenue. They estimate their plan would bring in about $168 billion a year; the current corporate income tax raises about $357 billion a year, though it fluctuates widely with the country\u2019s economic health.An offsetting tax increase would be needed, with all the political problems that entails. Since repealing the corporate tax would disproportionately benefit the wealthy, Mr. Viard and Mr. Toder propose curtailing various income tax preferences that mostly benefit high-income households, such as deductions for state and local tax paid and mortgage interest.A problem with that pay-for approach (aside from the interest groups it would inflame) is it would mostly hit the merely affluent, not the extremely wealthy, who would benefit most from lower corporate taxes, and who have seen the sharpest income gains over the last 40 years. Mr. Viard and Mr. Toder don\u2019t propose it, but there is a simple way to shift the pay-for burden toward the very highest earners: Raise their marginal income tax rates substantially above 43.4 percent. (What would Republicans get out of the deal? Repeal of the corporate income tax, of course.)Most corporate tax reform discussions in Washington focus around smaller bore issues: cutting the tax rate a few points in exchange for eliminating a few tax preferences. But as the economy becomes increasingly globalized and corporate profits increasingly derive from difficult-to-value intellectual property, efficiently collecting corporate income tax is only going to get harder.For all the political challenges they pose, bolder proposals like Viard-Toder are going to have to become part of the discussion over time \u2013 including because such changes would make it useless for Pfizer to pflee.An earlier version of this article did not include the Medicare tax in computing the top United States income tax rate. The top rate is 43.4 percent when that tax is included. Also, a name of a Times reporter was misspelled; it is David Gelles, not Gilles. Advertisement"}

It is supposed to adjust payments to meet an overall spending target tied to economic growth.The gap can be seen in the accompanying chart.

Apart from the cost growth of a given treatment, the number of treatments and the intensity of those treatments have also grown over time. You can see the total growth in spending per patient, combining all these factors in the top line. Many analysts point to the growth in volume and treatment intensity as evidence that the fee-for-service nature of Medicare\u2019s payment system \u2014 so that doing more procedures increases costs without necessarily providing better care \u2014 is deeply flawed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In a Test of Wills With China, U.S. Sticks Up for Japan", "Date": "2014-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 On his first trip to China as the secretary of defense, Chuck Hagel is finding himself in the middle of a spat that would not be out of place in \u201cMean Girls,\u201d a movie about social cliques in high school.For the first time, China will host the Western Pacific Naval Symposium, a meeting every two years of countries that border the Pacific Ocean. The W.P.N.S., as it is known in naval circles, counts among its members the United States, Australia, Chile, Canada and a number of Asian countries, including China and Japan.Often at such meetings, the host country organizes an international fleet review, at which the visiting countries can parade their ships and show off some fancy hardware. It can be an eye-popping display of war ships, destroyers and guided-missile cruisers. In 2008, when South Korea hosted the symposium, the United States sent the aircraft carrier George Washington, the guided missile cruiser Cowpens and the destroyer John S. McCain to take part.For this year\u2019s fleet review, China, which is hosting the event in Qingdao, invited all the countries in the symposium to take part \u2014 except Japan.\u201cIt is so totally high school,\u201d a senior American defense official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the issue publicly. \u201cWe were, like, \u2018Really? You\u2019re going to do that?\u2019 \u201dSo on the eve of Mr. Hagel\u2019s trip, which includes a visit to Qingdao, Pentagon officials announced that if Japan could not take part in the review, then neither would the United States. The United States will attend the meeting, the Pentagon said, but no American ships will sail in the fleet review.\u201cAs of this moment, there is no intent to send a U.S. ship to participate,\u201d a Pentagon official said in a carefully worded statement. \u201cW.P.N.S. is an important multilateral venue that promotes collaboration among navies in an inclusive, cooperative and constructive forum.\u201dJapan refused to recognize China\u2019s claim, and the United States has been defying China ever since by sending military planes into the zone unannounced.In February, Capt. James Fanell, the director of intelligence and information operations with the United States Pacific Fleet, said that China was training its forces to be capable of carrying out a \u201cshort, sharp\u201d war with Japan in the East China Sea. Other American officials noted with increasing concern the buildup of China\u2019s military and what they called a lack of transparency among its leaders.Into all this arrives Mr. Hagel, who will touch down first in Qingdao, the headquarters of one of China\u2019s three naval fleets. Mr. Hagel will visit the People\u2019s Liberation Army\u2019s aircraft carrier, the first foreign visitor that China has allowed aboard, a United States defense official said. Qingdao is the same place that the Chinese showed to Mr. Hagel\u2019s predecessor, Leon E. Panetta, two years ago. Now China is showing the Americans its aircraft carrier, which is a step beyond the tour that Mr. Panetta received in 2012. But one thing has not changed; as was the case with the Panetta trip, reporters traveling with Mr. Hagel will not be permitted on the tour and will go instead to a local beer brewing factory.During a news conference on Sunday with Japan\u2019s minister of defense, Itsunori Onodera, Mr. Hagel sounded exasperated with China. \u201cI will be talking with the Chinese about its respect for their neighbors,\u201d he said, as he chided China and urged the country to use its \u201cgreat power\u201d in a responsible way. \u201cYou cannot go around the world and redefine boundaries and violate territorial integrity and the sovereignty of nations by force, coercion or intimidation, whether it\u2019s in small islands in the Pacific or in large nations in Europe,\u201d he said.Pentagon officials said Mr. Hagel had no official plans to raise the fleet review issue during his talks with officials in China, but they allowed that the issue might come up anyway.In Tokyo, the American decision to shun the fleet review in solidarity with Japan was greeted warmly, as analysts said it could help allay growing concerns by Japan about whether the United States had the stomach to stand with Tokyo to face China\u2019s rising military might.\u201cThis is a very positive step toward addressing Japanese concerns,\u201d said Narushige Michishita, the director of security and international studies at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Japan. \u201cThe decision is being seen here as a signal from the U.S. that its deterrence still has credibility.\u201dBut \u201cthis sort of tit-for-tat shows how the U.S. is being drawn into the escalating row over history that China and Japan have been engaging in,\u201d said Andrew Oros, a specialist on East Asia and an associate professor of political science at Washington College in Maryland. \u201cIt may seem irrelevant, but it exposes how surface-level issues illustrate serious underlying problems between the two largest economies in Asia, and the second- and third-largest economies in the world.\u201dMartin Fackler contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "By Its Own Yardstick, the Fed Is Falling Short", "Date": "2014-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMonetary PolicyThe Federal Reserve is failing to meet its basic responsibilities.The central bank is charged by Congress to do two things. It is supposed to keep inflation at a moderate rate while also maximizing employment. Almost five years have passed since the end of the Great Recession, and the Fed has made little progress on either count.The share of American adults with jobs fell sharply during the recession, and has since recovered only a small part of that lost ground. The unemployment rate has fallen, but primarily because the jobless stopped looking for work.Inflation, meanwhile, remains well below the Fed\u2019s target of 2 percent.Unemployment is an obvious problem. Low inflation, by contrast, may seem like a good thing. But economic research suggests that inflation is best in moderation. Rising prices give the Fed more power to stimulate the economy because inflation functions as a tax on saving, encouraging investment. Inflation is also a lubricant, making it easier for less profitable employers to reduce costs by withholding wage increases rather than imposing outright cuts. Workers whose wages keep pace with inflation can pay fixed debts more easily.Any less inflation and central bankers risk deflation, when prices and wages drop, and that may be the only thing they fear more than inflation.\u201cAdding more and more stimulus either through asset purchases or even trying to put even stronger forward guidance does create more risks about getting policy right on the exit,\u201d John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, told Bloomberg News recently.Mr. Williams added that the Fed was \u201cexactly on the right track.\u201dThat seems unlikely. Calibrating policy exactly is an impossibly high standard, to judge by the Fed\u2019s past performance, and that history also tells us that the Fed has tended to be wrong in the same way. It has repeatedly underestimated how much it must do to drive down unemployment.In the coming years, we\u2019ll learn whether the Fed has failed again.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oligarchs and Money", "Date": "2014-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the I.M.F. evidently doesn\u2019t feel able to say outright what its analysis clearly implies. Instead, the report resorts to euphemisms that preserve deniability: the analysis \u201ccould have implications for the appropriate monetary policy framework.\u201dSo what makes the obvious unsayable? In a direct sense, what we\u2019re seeing is the power of conventional wisdom. But conventional wisdom doesn\u2019t come from nowhere, and I\u2019m increasingly convinced that our failure to deal with high unemployment has a lot to do with class interests.First, let\u2019s talk about the case for higher inflation.Many people understand that a falling price level is a bad thing; nobody wants to turn into Japan, which has struggled with deflation since the 1990s. What\u2019s less understood is that there isn\u2019t a red line at zero: an economy with 0.5 percent inflation is going to have many of the same problems as an economy with 0.5 percent deflation. That\u2019s why the I.M.F. warned that \u201clowflation\u201d is putting Europe at risk of Japanese-style stagnation, even though literal deflation hasn\u2019t happened (yet).Moderate inflation turns out to serve several useful purposes. It\u2019s good for debtors \u2014 and therefore good for the economy as a whole when an overhang of debt is holding back growth and job creation. It encourages people to spend rather than sit on cash \u2014 again, a good thing in a depressed economy. And it can serve as a kind of economic lubricant, making it easier to adjust wages and prices in the face of shifting demand. Furthermore, as the latest I.M.F. report shows, there\u2019s strong evidence that changes in the global economy are increasing the tendency of investors to hoard cash rather than put funds to work, thereby increasing the risk of liquidity traps unless the inflation target is raised. But the report never dares to say this outright.So why is the obvious unsayable? One answer is that serious people like to prove their seriousness by calling for tough choices and sacrifice (by other people, of course). They hate being told about answers that don\u2019t involve more suffering.Now, I don\u2019t think that class interest is all-powerful. Good arguments and good policies sometimes prevail even if they hurt the 0.1 percent \u2014 otherwise we would never have gotten health reform. But we do need to make clear what\u2019s going on, and realize that in monetary policy as in so much else, what\u2019s good for oligarchs isn\u2019t good for America. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rent Too High? Move to Singapore", "Date": "2014-04-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s the EconomyAnyone in the market for a luxury apartment in Hong Kong, London or Washington toward the end of last year was in luck. The rents on prime flats were sagging a bit. Billionaires could lock in leases on pieds-\u00e0-terre at a slight discount. You might suppose that those savings would trickle down to regular working Joes, but no \u2014 middle-market rents in those cities continued their apparently inexorable upward march.The developed world\u2019s wealthiest cities are facing housing crises so acute that not only low-income workers, but also the middle and creative classes, find them increasingly difficult places to afford. Redfin, the real estate website, recently found that there was not a single home on the market in San Francisco that would be affordable on a teacher\u2019s salary. And that was just for buyers; in many cities, renting is even more expensive.The rules of the market say that in this situation, people should simply opt to live someplace cheaper. But in today\u2019s economy, that\u2019s not so simple. Detroit has very cheap housing, but unfortunately, all of it is in Detroit. Alternately, more desirable cities could build more housing to satisfy demand, but new developments don\u2019t tend to have that effect.Luxury towers are sprouting up, adding density to unlikely places, from the Brooklyn waterfront to San Francisco\u2019s Mid-Market district. But adding inventory to the high end does nothing to help the middle \u2014 one of the many irritating peculiarities of the 21st-century boomtown housing market. Building new apartments can actually push rents higher, and amenities for the masses, like transportation and parks, may have the effect of pricing them out. Everyone wants to live in these places, so no one can afford to. What\u2019s a global city to do?The Singapore solution required drastic action of a sort that most other places could not countenance: In the early 1960s, the government started building big, uniform apartment buildings, then pushed workers to move out of overcrowded shophouses and huts. Some herded their livestock along to their new flats. And at first, many residents were afraid of the higher floors.Today, cities that want to actually solve their housing problems will have to stomach similar forms of psychic dislocation, not necessarily for those being housed, but for those with strong ideas about what their city should look and feel like. Many of the things that we cherish most about urban living are the very things that make housing more expensive. San Francisco, certainly one of the world\u2019s loveliest cities, has restrictions that keep much of residential construction under 40 feet. And even in New York, no stranger to height, the high-rises to be built on the site of the old Domino Sugar refinery in Williamsburg have prompted teeth-gnashing from the guardians of the \u201curban fabric.\u201dNew York\u2019s new mayor, Bill de Blasio, who promised, on the campaign trail, to build more than 100,000 affordable apartments, seems to have an inkling of what will be required. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a willingness to use height and density to the maximum feasible extent,\u201d he has said. \u201cI don\u2019t have a hang-up about it.\u201dBut then, lots of people think they know what to do to fix housing: Stick it to the landlord with rent controls. Require developers to set aside low-cost units. Build more subsidized housing. Distribute more rent vouchers or, as San Francisco has recently done, funnel taxes and fees into a housing trust fund. For those with more faith in market forces, there is always the loosening of zoning regulations, in imitation of sprawling Houston \u2014 which is indisputably cheap, so long as you don\u2019t factor in the cost of driving.Yet many of these solutions are dwarfed by the sheer size of the problem. London alone needs, by one count, 800,000 new units by 2021 to meet both pent-up and new demand. Sydney, where the median rent on a two-bedroom apartment is now $2,600 a month, aspires to build more than half a million units by 2031, a goal for which it would have to double its normal pace of construction. New York needs more than 300,000 units by 2030. By contrast, inclusionary zoning, a celebrated policy solution that requires developers to set aside units for working and low-income families, has created a measly 2,800 affordable apartments in New York since 2005. It\u2019s not clear we have the fortitude to deal with these shortages head-on.And housing policy can be very tricky to get right. \u201cSuccess is going to be in the eye of the beholder,\u201d says Eric Belsky, the managing director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard. \u201cIf success means building more homes at greater densities, you\u2019ll end up with some neighbors not happy, and if you target everything at low incomes, the middle class will feel left out.\u201dThere are other complications as well, Belsky says. Economic forces relentlessly push back against the best intentions of political leaders. Let\u2019s say you take a crummy neighborhood, and you build a really nice affordable housing complex in the middle of it. You\u2019ve just made everything around the complex more desirable, and thus more expensive. You\u2019ve lowered some people\u2019s rent, but raised everybody else\u2019s (perhaps even making the waiting list to get into the new complex even longer). Or let\u2019s say you want poor people to be able to live in mixed-income neighborhoods, so you subsidize their rent. If there are too many vouchers and not enough apartments, Belsky says, you have just raised everybody\u2019s rent again.It seems the only solution would be to level all of, say, North Brooklyn and put up monolithic prefab tower blocks. But New Yorkers don\u2019t want to live in Singapore. They want historic brownstones, landmark warehouses and waterfront views. The difficulty of deciding where and what to build means that cities with a shortfall of hundreds of thousands of apartments often have only the vaguest plans for how to meet the deficit.But unshackling the private sector may not be a complete solution, either. Many housing advocates, even conservative ones, insist that the free market will never provide housing that low-income families can afford, because apartments are simply too expensive to build nowadays. Some form of subsidy is needed, they say. But the size of a subsidy that actually covered the demand would be immense. The Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington figured out that giving all low-income families vouchers large enough to make their rents affordable would require federal rent supports, now at $62 billion a year, to more than double.Shaila Dewan is an economics reporter for The Times.Advertisement"}

Executives at the state-controlled company boasted that it could even outstrip Apple as the world\u2019s most valuable publicly traded company. Political leaders here said Brazil was on the cusp of energy independence.Now Petrobras is coming to symbolize something else entirely: the disarray afflicting Brazil\u2019s sluggish economy and the reassessment of growth prospects in emerging markets around the world.Instead of surging, Petrobras\u2019s oil production has stagnated, heightening Brazil\u2019s reliance on imported oil. Petrobras finds itself mired in corruption investigations and claims of managerial incompetence. And its debt load is exploding: Petrobras now ranks as the world\u2019s most indebted company, dependent, more or less, on United States mutual funds to finance its ambitious investment plans.\u201cThe decline of Petrobras has been stunning, swift and painful,\u201d said F\u00e1bio Fuzetti, a partner at Antares Capital Management, a S\u00e3o Paulo investment firm. \u201cThis is the energy company that served as the model for others in developing countries,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s the example of precisely what not to do.\u201dDespite these problems, executives at Petrobras point out that the company still has clear strengths. The company, which remains profitable over all despite mounting losses from importing fuel, is a pioneer in deep-sea exploration. And Petrobras commands coveted assets around the world, including oil and gas reserves of about 13 billion barrels.In a statement, a spokeswoman for Petrobas said that debt levels had climbed as the company invests in offshore oil and expanding refining capacity. \u201cWe\u2019ll have an inflection point in our debt starting in 2015, when revenue generation will surpass investment, initiating a trajectory of debt reduction,\u201d said Paula Almada, the spokeswoman.Pointing to the tension building over Petrobras\u2019s woes, senators grilled the company\u2019s chief executive, Maria das Gra\u00e7as Foster, on Tuesday. She contended that losses related to a controversial Houston refinery deal were being overestimated. Defending the company\u2019s strategies, she said, \u201cNo operation is 100 percent safe.\u201dSo far foreign bondholders, who now fund a record 43 percent of the company\u2019s giant investment program, have been remarkably patient. But analysts warn that much of this largess has been driven by the global liquidity glut. If Petrobras\u2019s troubles continue to mount, it could run into resistance on international markets.The ills that plague Petrobras \u2014 too much debt and spending for too little return \u2014 reflect a larger concern that the golden age for Brazil, China, Russia and Turkey, once the vanguard of the emerging-market boom, is coming to an end.\u201cThe problem with Brazil is that the days of 4 percent growth are gone,\u201d said Tony Volpon, a Latin America expert at Nomura Securities, who expects the country\u2019s economy to expand at well below 2 percent this year.The problems at Petrobras, which is 60.5 percent owned by Brazil\u2019s government, have come into sharp relief in recent weeks as the company grapples with a simmering scandal over its acquisition of a Houston refinery, beginning in 2006 and completed years later, at an estimated cost of $1.19 billion from Astra, a Belgian oil trading company that bought the refinery for just $42.5 million in 2005.Police here also recently arrested one of Petrobras\u2019s most powerful former executives, Paulo Roberto Costa, who led refining operations until 2012. Investigators say he was involved in a sprawling money-laundering scheme and may have received bribes related to the construction of a refinery that has ballooned in cost to $18.5 billion from $2.5 billion.The list goes on. Petrobras faces scrutiny over claims that its employees received $139 million in bribes from SBM Offshore, a Dutch supplier of oil rigs. Petrobras said this month that an internal audit had not found evidence of the bribes, but federal investigators are still examining the matter. Another investigation is looking into claims of gross overbilling in an $825 million contract with Odebrecht, the Brazilian construction and oil services giant.Despite the scandals, Petrobras remains Brazil\u2019s most powerful company. Even as the company aims to invest about $220 billion over the next five years, Mr. Volpon points out that most other companies in Brazil are not following suit. On the global stage, he says, Brazilian companies, hobbled by high interest rates, inflation and an expensive currency, are becoming less competitive.Meanwhile, Petrobras, in the last five years, has sold $51 billion worth of bonds to yield-starved global investors, nearly a quarter of all corporate bonds emanating from Brazil and the most of any emerging-market company, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters.But the munificence of foreign investors is not bottomless. As interest rates in the United States creep up and as Brazil\u2019s finances come under greater stress, Petrobras\u2019s top creditors \u2014 which include mutual fund giants like Pimco, Fidelity and BlackRock \u2014 may well view their exposure as too risky and begin to unload their bonds.\u201cIt\u2019s just such a big issuer,\u201d said Gary N. Kleiman, an emerging-market investment consultant who says that a Petrobras sell-off could ignite a broader emerging-market pullback. \u201cWe are just waiting for this thing to blow up.\u201dCiting the increasing debt load, Moody\u2019s downgraded the company\u2019s debt last October to Baa1, the third-lowest investment grade rating offered by the credit agency.The effect on Petrobras\u2019s financing ambitions has been minimal.Nearly a year after setting an emerging-market record with an $11 billion bond sale, the company tapped the bond market last month for yet another monster offering. Petrobras raised $8.5 billion, the biggest corporate debt offering of the year, period. Meanwhile, as corruption scandals ensnare Petrobras, the company is struggling to lift oil and gas production, which fell 2.2 percent in 2013 to an average of 2.55 million barrels a day. There are signs this year that Petrobras may finally be succeeding in reversing such declines; the company\u2019s oil production in Brazil climbed 0.3 percent in February from the previous month.Perhaps Petrobras\u2019s biggest challenge is that it is not just an energy company. It is also at the heart of a fierce debate here over the extent of the Brazilian government\u2019s use of its wealth to achieve political and economic goals.In an effort to keep inflation from accelerating during an election year, President Dilma Rousseff\u2019s government has prevented Petrobras from raising fuel prices to meet the cost of importing refined gasoline and diesel. At the same time, domestic fuel consumption has surged since the Brazilian authorities offered incentives to car manufacturers to raise production.The result is that Petrobras\u2019s losses in its refining, transportation and marketing operations reached $8 billion in 2013.Throughout the economy, examples abound of Petrobras being stretched thin by policies aimed at asserting greater state control over the oil industry, like measures requiring Petrobras to buy equipment domestically, effectively propping up inefficient industries in Brazil like shipbuilding.Speaking at a Brazilian shipyard on Monday, Ms. Rousseff lashed out a critics of Petrobas and her government\u2019s energy policies, describing the oil giant as Brazil\u2019s \u201cmother company.\u201d Contending that any corruption at Petrobas would be rooted out by investigators, she accused political opponents of a \u201csmear campaign\u201d against the company.Still, as these so-called local content rules make Petrobras\u2019s costs skyrocket \u2014 and increase the company\u2019s debt \u2014 energy analysts here are also growing dismayed over the crisis in Brazil\u2019s once-envied ethanol industry, which has been shuttering dozens of plants as producers fail to compete in price with Petrobras\u2019s subsidized gasoline.Facing budgetary pressures, the authorities have also quietly stopped strengthening Brazil\u2019s sovereign wealth fund. Created in 2008 soon after Petrobras announced its major oil discoveries, the fund was viewed as a pillar of efforts to establish greater financial stability in Brazil, as commodities exporters like Norway, Chile and Canada have done.But in an attempt to meet a budget target for the 2012 fiscal year, officials withdrew about 80 percent of the money in the fund, leaving it with just $1.3 billion. Instead of replenishing the fund with proceeds from oil exports, Petrobras has grown more dependent on importing fuel and building costly projects, forcing its debt up.Petrobras remains far from approaching the levels of political tension and opaque dealings that now characterize Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, the acutely politicized oil producer owned by Venezuela\u2019s government that was once considered an industry leader and a bastion of technical expertise.But some contend that Petrobas is also being stretched by Bras\u00edlia\u2019s political ambitions. \u201cPetrobras\u2019s woes are the result of well-defined government policies,\u201d said John Forman, a former head of the regulatory agency overseeing Brazil\u2019s oil industry. \u201cThat\u2019s where things get complicated, because changing the policies is challenging indeed.\u201dSimon Romero reported from Rio de Janeiro, and Landon Thomas Jr. from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bookstores in Seattle Soar, and Embrace an Old Nemesis: Amazon.com", "Date": "2014-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmazon.com Inc. also calls Seattle home. And in recent years, as many small independent bookstores here and around the nation struggled or closed their doors, owners often placed blame for their plight on the giant online retailer\u2019s success in delivering best sellers at discount prices, e-readers and other commodities of the digital marketplace.But now there are signs of a thaw in those tensions, at least here in the city that most embodied them. As Amazon has exploded with growth, hiring thousands of tech workers at its downtown headquarters and helping bolster the Seattle economy, local bookstore owners have seen a surprising new side of the company they loved to hate: Many Amazon employees, it turns out, are readers who are not shopping at the company store.Whether it is Amazon or something else, the broader pattern is unmistakable, said Oren J. Teicher, the chief executive of the American Booksellers Association, a national bookstore trade group. \u201cSeattle has become one of the most successful independent bookstore cities in the country,\u201d he said.Last month, Mr. Nissley\u2019s bookish-in-Seattle tale came full circle when he signed a contract to buy and run his own small independent bookstore. The shop, Santoro\u2019s, which he plans to rename Phinney Books, is in a neighborhood, Phinney Ridge, with plenty of Amazon employees, many of whom Mr. Nissley knows as former colleagues or neighbors, and who he hopes will shop at his store (or at least come in to offer commiseration and advice). The purchase price, essentially the value of the inventory, was $35,000.\u201cI think I know what I\u2019m getting into,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope so.\u201dThe soon-to-be-Phinney is by no means a Goliath. At 1,200 square feet, and about 5,000 titles on the shelves, it is a retail space that might have once fit a five-and-dime. Glass windows open onto the street where other local businesses like Bluebird Ice Cream, Caffe Vita and Cornuto Pizza line the block.Part of Mr. Nissley\u2019s optimism is that he believes local shops have increasingly found their feet in how to avoid competition with Amazon, or other giant retailers, by offering services or products that only a local can provide. He plans to offer, in addition to books, a line of paper goods, toys and vinyl handbags made by the business that his wife, Laura Silverstein, started.He is also convinced, he said, that the e-book revolution, which seemed ready a few years ago to sweep away the old world of pages and print, has reached a plateau. Publishers, wanting to keep independent bookstores alive, have also helped \u2014 easing traditional repayment rules for books, or helping with promotions or advertising.\u201cAmazon makes great contributions to the vitality of Seattle,\u201d Mr. Page said in an interview. \u201cThey are putting their footprint right down in the middle of Seattle and they\u2019re pouring a lot of money and energy into it, and it is one of several drivers that are making this a vibrant, interesting and expensive place to live.\u201dAnd Amazon as a big local employer also means Amazon as a big producer of Amazon expatriates like Mr. Nissley with bookselling experience. Two of Island Books\u2019 10 employees, Mr. Page said, also once worked at Amazon.Mr. Nissley said that some of his favorite memories of Amazon were the early years when employees at headquarters would occasionally be asked to pitch in at the warehouse, helping pack books before they went out into the world. In his new shop, he said, he will be going back in a way to that simpler time.\u201cMaybe it\u2019s an effect of living your life online \u2014 that you also want these physical things,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ads Remind Desert Residents Water Doesn\u2019t Grow on Trees", "Date": "2014-04-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCampaign SpotlightAn effort to promote water conservation among people who live and work in Southern Nevada offers a practical perspective rather than, say, the jocular suggestion during the 1960s to \u201csave water, shower with a friend.\u201dTo emphasize the message, the words appear in a desert landscape, symbolic of Las Vegas\u2019s location in the Mojave Desert, and are formed by plants and flowers blooming in the style of topiary.The campaign, now underway, is being created by R&R Partners in Las Vegas, the longtime advertising agency of record for the water authority, which is composed of seven members that include the City of Las Vegas, the Clark County Water Reclamation District and the Las Vegas Valley Water District.The campaign is part of regular advertising outreach to consumers by the water authority, which also includes programs to encourage \u201cwater-smart\u201d landscaping of residential and commercial properties and information on water-efficient technologies and innovations.\u201cAs a community, we\u2019re working hard to make sure that Southern Nevada has a reliable water supply so that our businesses, families and neighborhoods can continue to thrive,\u201d says the text of one ad from the campaign. \u201cBecause life here just wouldn\u2019t be the same without it.\u201cLet\u2019s stay water smart, Southern Nevada,\u201d the ad concludes. \u201cLearn more at snwa.com.\u201dThe issue of water conservation in the Western United States is not as cut and dried as it may seem to be in the eastern part of the country. Some critics complain that not enough is being done to save water, decrying the continued existence of lush golf courses. Others charge that conservation efforts will choke off growth.The water authority was reminded of those crosscurrents last month when Eric Holthaus \u2014 a meteorologist who writes about weather and climate for the Future Tense section of Slate \u2014 wrote an article that was critical of the water authority.The concerns about curbing water usage in Southern Nevada were somewhat less urgent during the financial crisis and recession, when the region\u2019s strong growth faltered. Now, \u201cas we see the green shoots of an economic recovery here,\u201d says John Entsminger, general manager of the water authority, which is based in Las Vegas, \u201cwe\u2019re getting back to more normalized\u201d growth patterns.\u201cSometimes we compare the \u201890s through 2006 to Las Vegas\u2019s teenage years,\u201d he says, when the local economy did nothing but \u201cgrow, grow, grow.\u201dAlthough \u201cwe don\u2019t see that double-digit growth occurring again,\u201d he adds, growth rates are now likely to be in the range of 2 to 3 percent each year compared with a range of 1 to 2 percent in the last couple of years, \u201cflat in \u201810-'11 and a minus in \u201808-'09.\u201dThe water authority stepped up its conservation initiatives in 2002, Mr. Entsminger says, when \u201cthe drought on the Colorado River\u201d \u2014 the source of most of the water for Southern Nevada \u2014 \u201cbegan to deepen.\u201d\u201cFrom 2002 to the present day, there\u2019s been a reduction of about 33 percent in the consumption of water while the population increased by about 25 percent in that same time frame,\u201d he adds. \u201cThe campaign has been tremendously successful in reductions in water use and changing attitudes among people who call the Mojave Desert home.\u201dThe changes from previous campaigns to the current one is \u201cnuanced,\u201d Mr. Entsminger says. \u201cWhen we were reacting to the onset of the drought, it was more about \u2018We need the community to reduce water use so there\u2019s enough for everybody.'\u2009\u201dNow, \u201cwe\u2019re not reacting to the drought, to double-digit growth,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for more sustainable messaging to encourage the wise use of water in the desert.\u201dThe focus on desert flora is meant to remind residents that when it comes to landscaping, \u201cwe don\u2019t all have to look like Lexington, Ky., here,\u201d Mr. Entsminger says, a reference to the \u201cwall-to-wall Kentucky bluegrass\u201d that uses up so much water.\u201cThe Mojave Desert has its own beauty,\u201d he adds.Such entreaties not to copy the outdoor look of other locations are \u201cironic,\u201d Mr. Entsminger acknowledges, in a place where \u201cwe\u2019ve recreated New York, we\u2019ve recreated Paris\u201d as part of casino architecture.Those measures are necessary if Southern Nevadans want to continue \u201cgrowing our community in the desert,\u201d he says. \u201cHaving it be sustainable growth is at the heart of the campaign.\u201dThe goal is for the campaign to be less of a reaction to outside forces, Mr. Entsminger says, and not be perceived as proscriptive.It should not come across as \u201c'We\u2019re the water cops and here are the rules to follow,'\u201d he adds, because, as the saying goes, \u201cyou can\u2019t legislate morality.\u201dRather, \u201cstaying water smart\u201d ought to be part of the behavior of every Southern Nevadan, Mr. Entsminger says.That thought is addressed in some of the campaign\u2019s print ads. For instance, one ad, featuring a topiary that forms the word \u201cjobs,\u201d declares: \u201cTogether, we\u2019ve saved more than 63 billion gallons of water, helping businesses thrive, which provides jobs so families and communities can continue to flourish.

But before it can happen, we need to continue conserving our water so our businesses, families and communities can continue thriving.\u201cSo keep conserving, Southern Nevada,\u201d the ad concludes. \u201cBecause having a reliable water source means having a future. Learn more at snwa.com.\u201dBilly Vassiliadis, chief executive at R&R Partners, describes working on campaigns for the water authority as \u201ca fascinating challenge.\u201dFirst, there was the period that Southern Nevada was \u201cgrowing very fast, darn near outpacing the ability to get water\u201d in sufficient quantities, he says, which led the water authority to decide that it \u201cneeded to get very aggressive in the conservation area.\u201dThe intent was \u201ceducational,\u201d he adds, \u201cdefining how serious the problem was without scaring people\u201d and taking the form of reminding residents \u2014 particularly transplants from the East and Midwest \u2014 that \u201c'hey, you\u2019re in the desert now'\u201d and as a result, \u201cwater is a scarce commodity and it needs to be protected.\u201d\u201cThen it became a question of how to sustain\u201d the change, he adds, \u201cless of an educational campaign and more of a reminder campaign.\u201dMr. Vassiliadis estimates that 60 to 70 percent of Southern Nevadans \u201cunderstand\u201d the purpose of the water authority\u2019s campaigns \u201cand will modify their behavior, somewhat to a lot.\u201dThere are 25 to 30 percent who want to continue using the amount of water they want to, he says, and \u201cthey won\u2019t be persuaded by public relations or by advertising.\u201d\u201cBut the great majority will,\u201d Mr. Vassiliadis says.According to the water authority, its budget for all water conservation advertising efforts is $1.74 million for the 2013-14 contract year, compared with $1.44 million for 2012-13 and $1.62 million for 2011-12.Kantar Media, a unit of WPP, reports that the water authority spent $720,000 last year to run ads in major media, compared with $557,000 in 2012, $416,000 in 2011, $698,000 in 2010 and $602,000 in 2009.-------Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Investigating Family\u2019s Wealth, China\u2019s Leader Signals a Change", "Date": "2014-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 His son landed contracts to sell equipment to state oil fields and thousands of filling stations across China. His son\u2019s mother-in-law held stakes in pipelines and natural gas pumps from Sichuan Province in the west to the southern isle of Hainan. And his sister-in-law, working from one of Beijing\u2019s most prestigious office buildings, invested in mines, property and energy projects.In thousands of pages of corporate documents describing these ventures, the name that never appears is his own: Zhou Yongkang, the formidable Chinese Communist Party leader who served as China\u2019s top security official and the de facto boss of its oil industry.But President Xi Jinping has targeted Mr. Zhou in an extraordinary corruption inquiry, a first for a Chinese party leader of Mr. Zhou\u2019s rank, and put his family\u2019s extensive business interests in the cross hairs.Even by the cutthroat standards of Chinese politics, it is a bold maneuver. The finances of the families of senior leaders are among the deepest and most politically delicate secrets in China. The party has for years followed a tacit rule that relatives of the elite could prosper from the country\u2019s economic opening, which rewarded loyalty and helped avert rifts in the leadership.Whether to wipe out Mr. Zhou\u2019s influence or to send an unmistakable signal to the entire party elite, Mr. Xi appears to be rewriting the rules. He has widened the inquiry into Mr. Zhou to include his wife, a son, a brother, a sister-in-law, a daughter-in-law and the son\u2019s father-in-law, all of whom have been taken away by the authorities in recent months, according to relatives and witnesses.Zhan Minli, one of the few members of the clan who remain free, said her granddaughter \u2014 who is also Mr. Zhou\u2019s granddaughter \u2014 has been left in the care of a kindergarten in Beijing because the rest of the family is in custody. \u201cIt is too cruel for a 5-year-old child,\u201d she said in an interview in her home in Southern California. \u201cThe government needs to answer to the people as well as the leadership itself,\u201d she added.Officially, the Chinese leadership has said nothing about the corruption investigation into Mr. Zhou or the detention of his immediate relatives, and Mr. Xi\u2019s ultimate intentions about how to handle the case remain a matter of speculation.Some political analysts argue that a leader of Mr. Zhou\u2019s status would not face an inquiry of this kind unless Mr. Xi regarded him as a direct threat to his power. In other words, Mr. Zhou is the loser in a political struggle. His family\u2019s financial dealings lost their immunity only because Mr. Zhou fell from favor, not because elite business dealings were being criminalized.But another school of thought is that Mr. Xi considers the enormous agglomeration of wealth by spouses, children and siblings of top-ranking officials a threat to China\u2019s stability by encouraging mercenary corruption and harming the party\u2019s public standing. Those people say he has pushed the Zhou investigation beyond traditional bounds to signal that the rules have changed and that top leaders will be held responsible for their family\u2019s business activities, even though Mr. Xi\u2019s own family members have been among those who have grown rich.If that is so, the case has the potential to alter the political compact of China\u2019s boom years. For many elite clans, like Mr. Zhou\u2019s, acquiring stakes in lucrative enterprises that did business in the realm that the family patriarch supervised was not effectively banned \u2014 and sometimes not even well disguised.An investigation by The New York Times of the assets held by Mr. Zhou\u2019s relatives highlights the considerable sums involved and illustrates how deeply invested members of the party establishment are in industries where political connections are important.\u201cBecause of his connections to energy, land and the internal security system, in effect the family had kind of carte blanche to go into anything they wanted,\u201d said Andrew Wedeman, a professor of political science at Georgia State University who studies corruption in China.In all, the holdings examined by The Times are worth at least one billion renminbi, or about $160 million, though that estimate is based on a limited assessment of each company\u2019s value and does not include real estate or overseas assets, which are more difficult to identify and assess.Even so, these assets make Mr. Zhou the third member of the nine-man Politburo Standing Committee that ruled China from 2007 to 2012 to have family members with documented wealth exceeding $150 million.Long Ties to Oil IndustryThe first hint of a move against Mr. Zhou came in late 2012, shortly after Mr. Xi formally became China\u2019s top leader. Within three weeks of Mr. Xi\u2019s elevation, and Mr. Zhou\u2019s retirement, party investigators detained a senior official in Sichuan Province who had risen under Mr. Zhou\u2019s wing. Since then, the authorities have detained and announced investigations into more than two dozen of Mr. Zhou\u2019s former aides and colleagues, and their business allies, including seven men who worked as senior managers at China National Petroleum Corporation or its listed arm, PetroChina.No evidence has emerged that proves Mr. Zhou, 71, was involved in the investments or did anything illegal. Nor is it clear that his relatives violated any Chinese laws or actively used their relationship with Mr. Zhou to secure deals. But Mr. Xi appears confident that he has enough evidence to eliminate Mr. Zhou\u2019s influence.The son of a beet farmer who caught eels as a sideline, Mr. Zhou rose to become one of the most feared politicians in China. He began his career as an oil field technician, spending more than a decade in the 1970s and early 1980s working his way up the administration overseeing the Liaohe Oil Field in northeastern China. He kept rising through the ranks until he became head of C.N.P.C., the nation\u2019s largest energy company, which accounts for more than half of China\u2019s oil production and three quarters of its gas production.Mr. Zhou later became party chief of Sichuan, one of the country\u2019s most populous provinces. In 2002, he was appointed minister of Public Security and, in 2007, he joined the Politburo Standing Committee, the party\u2019s top echelon, and assumed control of the body overseeing the police, courts and intelligence agents.Mr. Zhou\u2019s relationship with C.N.P.C. gave him influence over a unique player in the Chinese economy, a giant firm with annual revenue in excess of $400 billion, operations from Sudan to Venezuela and tendrils in every corner of China. Enjoying near monopoly status in some regions and industries, the company is a magnet for politically connected people seeking money-making opportunities.At least three of Mr. Zhou\u2019s relatives profited from C.N.P.C.\u2019s rise: his oldest son, Zhou Bin; Ms. Zhan; and his sister-in-law, Zhou Lingying, the wife of a younger brother.Several members of Zhou Yongkang\u2019s family have made investments in companies with ties to the China National Petroleum Corp., the state oil company formerly run by Mr. Zhou.Zhou Bin, 42, is majority owner of a Beijing company that sells equipment to Liaohe as well as to C.N.P.C. oil fields in at least three other provinces, corporate records show. His mother-in-law, Zhan Minli, 71, owns companies selling natural gas with C.N.P.C. in two provinces. And Zhou Lingying, 63, teamed up with C.N.P.C. to sell natural gas in another province and owns stakes in companies that also work with C.N.P.C. in western China, according to the documents.All told, the three relatives hold or have recently held ownership stakes in at least 11 companies that have done business with C.N.P.C. or the other state-owned oil giant, Sinopec, company documents show. At least four of the companies are owned in part by C.N.P.C. subsidiaries.In each case, the investments came long after Mr. Zhou left C.N.P.C. and had ascended to the Politburo.An Office Suddenly ClosesA short walk south from C.N.P.C. headquarters in Beijing, the offices on the 21st floor of the gleaming New Poly Building are dark and locked. It was here that Zhou Lingying and her business partners, through their company, Beijing Hongfeng Investment Company, bought control of C.N.P.C. assets in Sichuan, the province Mr. Zhou ran until 2002.Late last year, employees abruptly stopped coming to work after government officials showed up one day to examine the company\u2019s records, a security guard said. A wilted potted plant remained as evidence of a sudden end to business. The offices are on the same floor as the China Investment Corp., the country\u2019s $575 billion sovereign wealth fund.Much of what can be traced of Ms. Zhou\u2019s businesses leads to the New Poly Building. She owns stakes in at least seven companies with addresses there, investing in energy, mining and real estate projects across the country. They include a mining project in China\u2019s far western Xinjiang region, property and energy investments in Sichuan and a struggling potash mine there acquired from C.N.P.C.Zhou Lingying began her career as a shop girl at a general store, working her way up to become manager and later running a supply company before retiring at age 50 in 2001, according to a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 included in corporate documents and residents in the Zhou family village of Xiqiantou in eastern China.But Ms. Zhou made a major new foray in December 2007, weeks after her brother-in-law was elevated to the Politburo Standing Committee, setting up her principal holding company, Beijing Honghan Investment Company, with her son, Zhou Feng. Records show at least four other companies linked to Mr. Zhou\u2019s relatives sprang up about the same time.Even as Mr. Zhou prepared to retire, his sister-in-law was still working to forge relationships with C.N.P.C., forming a venture with a subsidiary to sell natural gas and invest in gas filling stations in the family\u2019s home city of Wuxi.At a condominium development in Wuxi sprinkled with ponds and walking paths, Ms. Zhou and her husband Zhou Yuanqing lived in a fourth-floor duplex, where the authorities detained them in early December. Asked if the couple were still living in the apartment, one of the two security guards at the gate jested, \u201cNo, and they probably won\u2019t be in ever again.\u201dLinks Stretch to CaliforniaOn the other side of the Pacific Ocean, Zhan Minli lives in an Orange County, Calif., retirement community of ranch-style homes and broad lawns. Short and silver haired, she opened the door to her house after reading written questions passed under her door about the companies she owned in China.Ms. Zhan said the holdings in her name were actually controlled by Mr. Zhou\u2019s son, Zhou Bin, who is married to her daughter, Huang Wan. She said it was customary in China to put assets in the name of one\u2019s parents, and suggested that her son-in-law used her name because his own mother had died in a traffic accident.Ms. Zhan said she and her husband were longtime United States passport holders despite Chinese documents that said they had retained Chinese citizenship. Property records show they have lived in the United States for nearly three decades, moving from Maryland to New Jersey and finally to Southern California, where their house has an estimated value of more than $700,000, according to the online real estate database Zillow.Ms. Zhan\u2019s home in Beijing looks to have been much more expensive. In 2010, a company document listed her residence in a luxury development in northeastern Beijing where units can sell for more than $11 million.Her official business address was listed several miles away inside a dusty compound at the end of a dirt road. The building appears long abandoned, but for the red light on a surveillance camera peering from above the front entrance and the ferocious barking of a dog.Several firms in deals with C.N.P.C. are registered at the address under Ms. Zhan\u2019s name and that of a business partner, Mi Xiaodong, 43, identified by the Chinese business magazine Caixin as a college friend of and proxy for Mr. Zhou\u2019s son. The companies have invested in gas projects on Hainan Island and in Hebei Province outside Beijing as well as in a housing development outside the capital. Ms. Zhan and Mr. Mi also owned a Beijing company, dissolved in February 2009, that held an oil drilling firm in northwestern China\u2019s Shaanxi Province, where C.N.P.C. ran an oil field.Ms. Zhan denied any wrongdoing or having much knowledge of these investments. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen the oil field we owned,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how money laundering works.\u201dAn Elusive FigureMr. Zhou\u2019s son, Zhou Bin, is more elusive, though records show he is also plugged into the family business.Zhou Bin studied English at an oil industry university in Sichuan, according to recent profiles of him in Chinese news media. He then moved to the United States, attending the University of Texas at Dallas and living in the state for much of the 1990s, according to school and property records.Ms. Zhan described her son-in-law as \u201ctaciturn\u201d and \u201cplain-spoken,\u201d a \u201cgood kid\u201d who was introduced to her daughter by a mutual friend. When they started dating, Ms. Zhan said, she did not even know he was the son of Zhou Yongkang.He remained a shadowy figure when he returned to China more than a decade ago, with few photos or media reports about him published even abroad despite his father\u2019s prominence.His name appears in the records of only one of the 37 companies examined by The Times, an energy investment firm in Beijing named Zhongxu Yangguang Energy Technology Company. His wife and his wife\u2019s parents also feature in the company\u2019s filings.Though Ms. Zhan denied any knowledge of Zhongxu, company records show she owned 80 percent of it when it was set up a decade ago. Its assets climbed more than sixfold in the years after Zhou Yongkang joined the Politburo Standing Committee in 2007, to $27 million in 2012.In 2009, Zhou Bin assumed control of the firm, taking Ms. Zhan\u2019s stake. An audit that year showed the company was selling products to C.N.P.C. oil fields across the country. It also sold sales management systems to 8,000 C.N.P.C. filling stations.Even Zhou Yongkang\u2019s other brother, Zhou Yuanxing, a farmer turned liquor distributor, was placed under 24-hour police surveillance in Xiqiantou, a village of 400 people near the Yangtze River in Jiangsu Province, neighbors said. Among the Zhou family members, he at least is certain to escape prosecution.

{"Headline": "Citing Russian Moves, NATO Plans New Deployments", "Date": "2014-04-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 The head of NATO pledged on Wednesday to immediately step up military patrols along the alliance\u2019s vast eastern border in response to mounting evidence of Russian interference in Ukraine.The announcement by Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the secretary general of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, appeared to be another sign that the confrontation with Russia over Ukraine was becoming more acute. But Mr. Rasmussen emphasized that the move was designed to be a deterrent rather than preparation for conflict.Even so, the moves represent a significant strengthening of NATO\u2019s posture in a region where it is already operating an air-policing mission in the Baltic states and surveillance flights over Poland and Romania.Mr. Rasmussen said the decision on Wednesday meant that aircraft will fly more sorties over the Baltic region and that allied ships will deploy to the Baltic Sea, the eastern Mediterranean and elsewhere, as required.In addition, military personnel will deploy \u201cto enhance our preparedness, training and exercises,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will have more planes in the air, more ships on the water, and more readiness on the land,\u201d he said.The measures will be implemented \u201cstraight away,\u201d he said, and \u201cmore will follow, if needed, in the weeks and months to come.\u201dMr. Rasmussen also renewed calls on Russia to stop destabilizing Ukraine, to pull back its troops from the Ukrainian border and to \u201cmake clear it doesn\u2019t support the violent actions of well-armed militias of pro-Russian separatists.\u201dAt a separate news conference in Brussels on Wednesday, Maja Kocijancic, a spokeswoman for Catherine Ashton, the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, said preparations were underway among the bloc\u2019s leadership to strengthen sanctions against Russia if necessary.\u201cWhen it comes to Stage 3, the preparatory work is in an advanced stage,\u201d said Ms. Kocijancic, referring to a possible toughening of measures that are already in place.Ms. Kocijancic declined to comment on whether European Union divisiveness over how to react to evidence of growing Russian interference in Ukraine was affecting plans for a possible summit meeting next week. She said it would be up to Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the European Council, to decide whether to hold such a meeting.The announcement that NATO was strengthening its presence in Eastern Europe heightened nerves about Ukraine across all of Europe.While officials did not want to speak on the record, the announcement fed palpable doubts about whether four-way talks scheduled for Thursday in Geneva \u2014 bringing Russia and Ukraine to the same table for the first time since February, with the United States and European Union joining in \u2014 would proceed as planned.Germany, which has Europe\u2019s strongest economy and is the most important European trading partner for Russia, was at pains ahead of the scheduled meeting to stress that the Continent spoke with one voice on sanctions against Russia.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and other leaders here have for weeks made it clear that they will go along with tougher sanctions, while cautioning behind closed doors that a serious rupture in business and other ties could take years to heal.Germany depends on Russia for up to 40 percent of its natural gas.Ms. Merkel and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia talked by telephone on Tuesday evening, according to statements from both governments. In Berlin, a government spokesman, Georg Streiter, underlined that the two leaders did not necessarily come to any meeting of the minds, let alone a shared assessment that Ukraine, as Mr. Putin was quoted as saying, verged on the brink of civil war.Instead, Mr. Streiter said, it will be \u201cvery important\u201d for Russia to withdraw its forces from the border with eastern Ukraine and to tone down its rhetoric on the crisis there.German officials also sought to emphasize that to date, the 28-nation European Union had avoided open splits and intended to do so in and after the meeting in Geneva.\u201cEurope speaks with one voice and is coordinating closely with the United States,\u201d a German Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Sawsan Chebli, told reporters.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Slide, Rich Nations Now Lifting Growth, I.M.F. Reports", "Date": "2014-04-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The rich countries whose property bubbles and collapsing banks plunged the world into recession in 2009 are now helping to lead the still-halting recovery out of it.\u201cThe recovery is strengthening,\u201d Olivier Blanchard, the fund\u2019s chief economist, said at a generally upbeat news conference on Tuesday.As growth has slackened in the big emerging economies, it has strengthened in rich countries, the fund said, especially in the United States. It now sees the world economy as growing about 3.6 percent this year and 3.9 percent next year, up from 3 percent in 2013. That is down slightly from its early forecast in January, when it predicted the world economy would grow about 3.7 percent this year.\u201cFor the past five years the emerging market and developing economies have been shouldering the burden of recovery, accounting for 75 percent of the increase in global growth since 2009,\u201d said Christine Lagarde, the International Monetary Fund\u2019s managing director, speaking in Washington last week. \u201cThe recovery is finally becoming a bit more balanced, in an overall economic landscape that has changed significantly.\u201dThe forecast is one of the sunniest that the fund has offered since the global recession. But it warned that growth, in many cases, remained fragile and that many economies remained significantly depressed. \u201cDownside risks continue to dominate the global growth outlook, notwithstanding some upside risks in the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany,\u201d it said.Even as the I.M.F. stressed that things were looking up in general, it reduced some countries\u2019 growth forecasts to account for lingering sluggishness, internal financial problems or new geopolitical strife, as in Ukraine.The primary effect \u201cis clearly on Ukraine first, but then on Russia,\u201d Mr. Blanchard said. There are two main channels: \u201cThe first one is an investment climate, which was not perfect to start with and is probably a bit worse. And more hesitation on the part of investors to put their money in Russia or leave it in Russia, so that one can expect fairly substantial capital outflows.\u201dThe bank cut its forecast of Russian growth this year to 1.3 percent, down from nearly 2 percent.Rich countries are increasingly helping to power the global recovery, with fiscal austerity and budget cuts slowing, banks becoming stronger and investors taking on more risk, the fund said. The uptick has been particularly strong in the United States because of factors including the Federal Reserve\u2019s extra efforts to stimulate investment, improving household finances and the nascent real estate recovery.The American economy is providing a \u201cmajor impulse to global growth.\u201d After a slow start last year, it picked up some momentum in the second half of 2013 and the monetary fund now expects the American economy to expand about 3 percent both this year and next, up from 1.9 percent in 2013.Even the euro area has finally stopped contracting, the fund said, and relief from government-imposed fiscal austerity might help that growth take seed. The drag from steep government cutbacks has dropped to 0.25 percent of economic output this year, from 1 percent last year. Economists at the International Monetary Fund anticipate that the euro area will grow about 1.2 percent this year and 1.5 percent next year, after having shrunk for the last two years.\u201cFor the first time in two years, southern periphery countries are forecast to have positive, if admittedly quite low, growth,\u201d Mr. Blanchard said, referring to such euro zone nations as Italy, Portugal and Spain. \u201cBut while their exports are generally quite strong, internal demand is still weak. And it has to become stronger if the recovery is to be sustained in those countries.\u201dA senior Treasury official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the diplomatic issues involved, said that the United States remained concerned that chronic low inflation and weak demand in Europe were holding back the recovery. The Treasury has repeatedly recommended that strong economies in Europe \u2014 in particular, those with big current-account surpluses like Germany \u2014 bolster demand to help the regional economy as a whole.\u201cThere are signs that the global economy is regaining momentum, and this is welcome news,\u201d the Treasury official said. \u201cBut there are downside risks, including new geopolitical risks, and global economic activity remains weak and uneven.\u201dThe recovery in rich countries poses new risks to emerging economies, too, the fund warned, as conditions return closer to normal and the Fed moves to scale down its stimulus efforts. \u201cStronger growth in advanced economies implies increased demand for their exports,\u201d Mr. Blanchard said in the report. \u201cThe normalization of monetary policy, however, implies tighter financial conditions and a tougher financial environment. Investors will be less forgiving, and macroeconomic weaknesses will become more costly.\u201dFor the major emerging economies \u2014 including China, Latin American nations like Brazil, Middle Eastern countries and South Africa \u2014 growth should be solid, if unremarkable, the fund said, peppering its report with terms like \u201cmodest\u201d and \u201cmoderate.\u201dThe fund left many of its economic projections unchanged from its January forecast, though it cut its forecasts for near-term growth in sub-Saharan Africa, Russia and the lower-income countries in Europe. It also tamped down its projections for growth in Latin America, the Caribbean and the Middle East.An earlier version of this article misattributed quotations from Olivier Blanchard, the chief economist for the International Monetary Fund.

{"Headline": "Despite Missing Economic Goals, Greece Manages to Meet a Bailout Target", "Date": "2014-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGreece\u2019s mountain of debt will decline more slowly than previously expected, the European Commission said in a Friday report.As the country\u2019s recovery from a debilitating recession creeps only slowly ahead, the report said, Greece\u2019s effort to lower its nearly 319 billion euro debt by selling off state assets continues to miss targets.Even so, Greece has made enough progress in trying to mend its tattered finances that the government still plans to press its international creditors to reduce some of the debt it owes them, in a round of negotiations expected this year.The report by the European Commission, one of Greece\u2019s lenders, paves the way for the country to receive \u20ac6.3 billion, or $8.7 billion, in bailout funds that creditors had withheld for months because of concerns the government was not reforming its economy fast enough.The report forecasts Greek debt, currently at 177 percent of gross domestic product, as still being as high as 125 percent of G.D.P. in 2020 and around 112 percent in 2022. Those forecasts are up slightly from earlier assessments that put the debt at 124 percent of output in 2020 and \u201csubstantially below\u201d 110 percent in 2022.Since the onset of the financial crisis in 2008, the Greek economy has shrunk by about one-quarter. But the commission now sees growth slowly returning \u2014 at a pace of around 0.6 percent pace this year and rising to as high as 2.9 percent next year.But such forecasts have fallen short in the past. While Greece has shown signs of turning a corner \u2014 this month it returned to the bond markets for the first time in four years \u2014 other hurdles remain, according to the commission, which is the administrative arm of the European Union.Greece is still grappling with a staggeringly high unemployment rate of around 27 percent. And while foreign investment has been picking up, it is still nowhere near the levels needed to make up for jobs destroyed in the downturn.The nation\u2019s privatization program has also been slow to bear fruit. Efforts to sell state assets like railway operators and regional airports have so far not raised the billions of euros hoped for, although the government is striving to make greater progress.The report said Athens had made strides on a number of reforms its creditors had demanded in exchange for two bailouts that have totaled more than \u20ac215 billion. Among other things, the government work force, which at one time represented around a quarter of employment in the country, has been whittled by 20 percent since 2010. Efforts to collect taxes have also improved, as the government works to modernize and enforce tax procedures.The government has also improved what economists call \u201cprice competitiveness\u201d by forcing wages down sharply. Compensation per employee fell by 4.2 percent in 2012 and is forecast to decline by 7 percent in 2013, and by a further 1.5 percent in 2014, the report said.Greece has managed to achieve a primary surplus \u2014 a budget surplus before debt payments \u2014 of \u20ac1.5 billion by also cutting spending on things like pensions and health care. The budget cuts have been so severe, however, that the commission said Greece now need to find ways to improve the quality of and access to health care, which has become all but unobtainable for millions of Greeks who have been out of work for long periods.With consumer spending sharply down and many Greek households and businesses unable to pay debts, the commission warned that Greece\u2019s banking system faced a major risk, with more than 30 percent of all loans in jeopardy of not being paid off.Greek banks have been able to raise capital in financial markets recently, as international investors see a recovery taking hold in the country. The banks still need more than \u20ac6 billion in extra capital to set aside as insurance to cope with nonperforming loans.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "My Bitcoin Befuddlement", "Date": "2014-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEssayAM I the only person in the world who doesn\u2019t have Bitcoin jangling in a cryptographic wallet? Sometimes it seems that way. This famous experiment in virtual cash, with its aura of near anonymity and lack of pesky regulation, gets tech heads really excited. Yet it may be the most famous thing in the world that nobody really understands. People who hear about it have questions like \u201cWhat is it?\u201d and \u201cWait, I still don\u2019t understand. What is it?\u201d and \u201cWhy has the price fluctuated so wildly?\u201d And, finally, \u201cAre any of them, maybe, lodged between my sofa cushions?\u201dI can answer only the last question: No, unless you also have a virtual sofa.I was born too late for the tulip bulbs and too early for Beanie Babies, but I don\u2019t want to miss out on Bitcoin mania. Of course, I can\u2019t become a Bitcoin mogul without knowing anything about it, so I did some research. Wouldn\u2019t you know it? The bureaucrats are circling.The Internal Revenue Service has been looking at Bitcoin too, and with something of a gimlet eye. It recently tried to get a fix on just what Bitcoin is, because commerce is the sort of thing that the I.R.S. likes to get a piece of.Does that sound like paperwork and trouble? Well, you might say that, and news of the potentially burdensome ruling drove the cost of a Bitcoin to below $500. But many people took the news as a move forward for the legitimacy of the currency, or investment, or whatever the heck it is. To be fair, something whose value bobs and weaves this way does sound more like an investment than a currency. In fact, it sounds like many investments I\u2019ve made in my proven track record of buying high and selling low. It\u2019s a gift. I\u2019M still no expert, but isn\u2019t playing by the rules the opposite of what many people who are interested in Bitcoin want \u2014 and, more important, what I want? Don\u2019t I get to fly my pirate flag? If I wanted to play by the rules, wouldn\u2019t I just invest in a money-market fund, with perfect safety and ... sorry, I just fell asleep for a moment. But that dream state reminds me: As a science-fiction fan, I used to tear through books that predicted a digital-currency future, an anonymous underground economy where value flowed without government buttinskis. It made money seem exciting, not just depressing. And the novels predicted that government, threatened by the crypto-cash revolt, would do anything it could to block that future. Of course, who needs government sabotage when the collapse of Mt. Gox, a Bitcoin exchange, already seems to be doing a fine job of undermining faith in digital currency? It has out-Finra\u2019d Finra!He told me that Bitcoin wasn\u2019t yet functioning quite like money because of all the volatility, but that it\u2019s well on its way to the kind of respectability that requires a less swashbuckling demeanor. \u201cOnce you\u2019re successful,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019re stuck with this nuance of having to put on the cloak of legitimacy.\u201d As my brain started to melt, I realized that some of the smartest people in the business world completely disagree about Bitcoin. It\u2019s caused something of a billionaire slap fight between Warren Buffett and Marc Andreessen. Mr. Buffett recently expressed skepticism about the new currency. \u201cIt\u2019s a mirage, basically,\u201d he told CNBC on March 14. He added, \u201cThe idea that it has some huge intrinsic value is just a joke, in my view.\u201dMr. Buffett didn\u2019t respond publicly to Mr. Andreessen, or to my request for comment, because he\u2019s Warren Buffett, for crying out loud, and he doesn\u2019t need to mess with this kind of stuff.Sorry, I dropped off again ... But what bothers me is this: When billionaires fight, shouldn\u2019t it be with weaponry more impressive than tweets? Twitter is the battleground for weenies. Billionaires have the money to buy private armies! Of robot warriors! With lasers! On a giant chessboard! That\u2019s the true spirit of virtual currency, isn\u2019t it?Real life is such a disappointment. I\u2019M hoping for the Bitcoin world to be more fun. So far, though, finding someone who accepts virtual currency isn\u2019t that easy. The site useBitcoins.info lists more than 2,000 businesses that take the currency, or investment, or whatever, all over the world. If I need an electrician in Coventry, England, I\u2019m covered, and I can use Bitcoin to satisfy all of my beef jerky needs at beefjerky.com.Yet trying to handle transactions in my New Jersey neighborhood is a little tougher. I\u2019ve been asking around. There\u2019s apparently a fitness \u201cboot camp\u201d in the town next door that accepts Bitcoin, but I don\u2019t like paying people to sweat when I can sweat just fine for nothing. At my local car-rental counter, the guys look at me as if I were trying to pull a fast one. The checkout machine at Home Depot doesn\u2019t have a button for paying with Bitcoin. And my cats act as if they don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about.I guess they aren\u2019t living in the future.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "It\u2019s the End of the World as We Know It . . . and He Feels Fine", "Date": "2014-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLate one night last August, on the chalk downlands of southern England, Paul Kingsnorth stood in a field beside an old-growth forest, two yurts and a composting toilet. Kingsnorth is 41, tall, slim and energetic, with sweeping brown hair and a sparse beard. He wears rimless glasses and a silver stud in his ear, and he talks with great ardor, often apologizing for having said too much or for having said it too strongly.On this occasion, Kingsnorth was silent. It was the final night of Uncivilization, an outdoor festival run by the Dark Mountain Project, a loose network of ecologically minded artists and writers, and he was standing with several dozen others waiting for the festival\u2019s midnight ritual to begin. Kingsnorth, a founder of the group, had already taken part in several sessions that day, including one on contemporary nature writing; a panel about the iniquities of mainstream psychiatric care; and a reading from his most recent book, \u201cThe Wake,\u201d a novel set in the 11th century and written in a \u201cshadow language\u201d \u2014 a mash-up of Old and modern English. He had also helped his two young children assemble a train set while trying to encapsulate his views on climate change and environmental degradation in what Kingsnorth describes as an era of global disruption. The \u201chuman machine,\u201d as he sometimes puts it, has grown to such a size that breakdown is inevitable. What, then, do we do?In the clearing, above a pyre, someone had erected a tall wicker sculpture in the shape of a tree, with dense gnarls and hanging hoops. Four men in masks knelt at the sculpture\u2019s base, at cardinal compass points. When midnight struck, a fifth man, his head shaved smooth and wearing a kimono, began to walk slowly around them. As he passed the masked figures, each ignited a yellow flare, until finally, his circuit complete, the bald man set the sculpture on fire. For a couple of minutes, it was quiet. Then as the wicker blazed, a soft chant passed through the crowd, the words only gradually becoming clear: \u201cWe are gathered. We are gathered. We are gathered.\u201dAfter that came disorder. A man wearing a stag mask bounded into the clearing and shouted: \u201cCome! Let\u2019s play!\u201d The crowd broke up. Some headed for bed. A majority headed for the woods, to a makeshift stage that had been blocked off with hay bales and covered by an enormous nylon parachute. There they danced, sang, laughed, barked, growled, hooted, mooed, bleated and meowed, forming a kind of atavistic, improvisatory choir. Deep into the night, you could hear them from your tent, shifting every few minutes from sound to sound, animal to animal and mood to mood.The next morning over breakfast, Dougie Strang, a Scottish artist and performer who is on Dark Mountain\u2019s steering committee, asked if I\u2019d been there. When he left, at 3 a.m., he said, people were writhing in the mud and singing, in harmony, the children\u2019s song \u201cTeddy Bears\u2019 Picnic.\u201d (\u201cIf you go down in the woods today, you\u2019re sure of a big surprise.\u201d) \u201cWasn\u2019t it amazing?\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cIt really went mental. I think we actually achieved uncivilization.\u201dKingsnorth himself arrived at this point about six years ago, after nearly two decades of devoted activism. He had just completed his second book, \u201cReal England,\u201d a travelogue about the homogenizing effects of global capitalism on English culture and character. \u201cReal England\u201d was a great success \u2014 the first of his career. All the major newspapers reviewed the book; the archbishop of Canterbury and David Cameron (then the opposition leader) cited it in speeches; Mark Rylance, the venerated Shakespearean actor, adopted it as a kind of bible during rehearsals for his hit play \u201cJerusalem.\u201d Yet Kingsnorth found himself strangely ambivalent about the praise. \u201cReal England\u201d was a painful book to write. For months he interviewed publicans, shopkeepers and farmers fighting to maintain small, traditional English institutions \u2014 fighting and losing. Everywhere Kingsnorth traveled, he saw the forces of development, conglomeration and privatization flattening the country. By the time he published his findings, he was in little mood to celebrate.At the same time, he felt his longstanding faith in environmental activism draining away. \u201cI had a lot of friends who were writing about climate change and doing a lot of good work on it,\u201d he told me during a break from his festival duties. \u201cI was just listening and looking at the facts and thinking: Wow, we are really screwed here. We are not going to stop this from happening.\u201dThe facts were indeed increasingly daunting. The first decade of the 21st century was shaping up to be the hottest in recorded history. In 2007, the Arctic sea ice shrank to a level not seen in centuries. That same year, the NASA climatologist James Hansen, who has been ringing the climate alarm since the 1980s, announced that in order to elude the most devastating consequences, we\u2019d need to maintain carbon dioxide in the atmosphere at a level of 350 parts per million. But we\u2019d already surpassed 380, and the figure was rising. (It has since reached 400 p.p.m.) Animal and plant species, meanwhile, were dying out at a spectacular rate. Scientists were beginning to warn that human activity \u2014 greenhouse-gas emissions, urbanization, the global spread of invasive species \u2014 was driving the planet toward a \u201cmass extinction\u201d event, something that has occurred only five times since life emerged, 3.5 billion years ago.\u201cEverything had gotten worse,\u201d Kingsnorth said. \u201cYou look at every trend that environmentalists like me have been trying to stop for 50 years, and every single thing had gotten worse. And I thought: I can\u2019t do this anymore. I can\u2019t sit here saying: \u2018Yes, comrades, we must act! We only need one more push, and we\u2019ll save the world!\u2019 I don\u2019t believe it. I don\u2019t believe it! So what do I do?\u201dThe first thing that Kingsnorth did was draft a manifesto. Also called \u201cUncivilization,\u201d it was an intense, brooding document that vilified progress. \u201cThere is a fall coming,\u201d it announced. \u201cAfter a quarter-century of complacency, in which we were invited to believe in bubbles that would never burst, prices that would never fall . . . Hubris has been introduced to Nemesis.\u201dThe initial print run of \u201cUncivilization\u201d was only 500 copies. Yet the manifesto gained widespread attention. The philosopher John Gray reviewed it in The New Statesman. Professors included it on their reading lists. An events space in Wales invited Kingsnorth and Dougald Hine, Dark Mountain\u2019s co-founder, to put on a festival; 400 people showed up. Doug Tompkins, the billionaire who started the outdoor-apparel company the North Face, and his wife, Kristine Tompkins, the former C.E.O. of Patagonia, offered financing and invited Kingsnorth and his family to spend two months on land they own in southern Chile.There were others, however, who saw Kingsnorth\u2019s new work as a betrayal. With waters rising, deserts spreading and resource wars looming, how could his message be anything but reckless \u2014 even callous? He and his sympathizers were branded \u201cdoomers,\u201d \u201cnihilists\u201d and (Kingsnorth\u2019s favorite epithet) \u201ccrazy collapsitarians.\u201d One critic, a sustainability advocate, published an essay in The Ecologist \u2014 a magazine Kingsnorth once helped run \u2014 comparing Dark Mountaineers to the complacent characters in the Douglas Adams novel \u201cThe Restaurant at the End of the Universe\u201d: \u201cDiners [who] enjoyed watching the obliteration of life, the universe and everything whilst enjoying a nice steak.\u201dKingsnorth regards such charges with equanimity, countering that the only hope he has abandoned is false hope. The great value of Dark Mountain, he has claimed, is that it gives people license to do the same. \u201cWhenever I hear the word \u2018hope\u2019 these days, I reach for my whiskey bottle,\u201d he told an interviewer in 2012. \u201cIt seems to me to be such a futile thing. What does it mean? What are we hoping for? And why are we reduced to something so desperate? Surely we only hope when we are powerless?\u201dInstead of trying to \u201csave the earth,\u201d Kingsnorth says, people should start talking about what is actually possible. Kingsnorth has admitted to an ex-activist\u2019s cynicism about politics as well as to a worrying ambivalence about whether he even wants civilization, as it now operates, to prevail. But he insists that he isn\u2019t opposed to political action, mass or otherwise, and that his indignations about environmental decline and industrial capitalism are, if anything, stronger than ever. Still, much of his recent writing has been devoted to fulminating against how environmentalism, in its crisis phase, draws adherents. Movements like Bill McKibben\u2019s 350.org, for instance, might engage people, Kingsnorth told me, but they have no chance of stopping climate change. \u201cI just wish there was a way to be more honest about that,\u201d he went on, \u201cbecause actually what McKibben\u2019s doing, and what all these movements are doing, is selling people a false premise. They\u2019re saying, \u2018If we take these actions, we will be able to achieve this goal.\u2019 And if you can\u2019t, and you know that, then you\u2019re lying to people. And those people . . . they\u2019re going to feel despair.\u201dWhatever the merits of this diagnosis (\u201cLook, I\u2019m no Pollyanna,\u201d McKibben says. \u201cI wrote the original book about the climate for a general audience, and it carried the cheerful title \u2018The End of Nature\u2019 \u201d), it has proved influential. The author and activist Naomi Klein, who has known Kingsnorth for many years, says Dark Mountain has given people a forum in which to be honest about their sense of dread and loss. \u201cFaced with ecological collapse, which is not a foregone result, but obviously a possible one, there has to be a space in which we can grieve,\u201d Klein told me. \u201cAnd then we can actually change.\u201dKingsnorth would agree with the need for grief but not with the idea that it must lead to change \u2014 at least not the kind of change that mainstream environmental groups pursue. \u201cWhat do you do,\u201d he asked, \u201cwhen you accept that all of these changes are coming, things that you value are going to be lost, things that make you unhappy are going to happen, things that you wanted to achieve you can\u2019t achieve, but you still have to live with it, and there\u2019s still beauty, and there\u2019s still meaning, and there are still things you can do to make the world less bad? And that\u2019s not a series of questions that have any answers other than people\u2019s personal answers to them. Selfishly it\u2019s just a process I\u2019m going through.\u201d He laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely narcissistic of me. Rather than just having a personal crisis, I\u2019ve said: \u2018Hey! Come share my crisis with me!\u2019 \u201dFor Kingsnorth, the notion that technology will stave off the most catastrophic effects of global warming is not just wrong, it\u2019s repellent \u2014 a distortion of the proper relationship between humans and the natural world and evidence that in the throes of crisis, many environmentalists have abandoned the principle that \u201cnature has some intrinsic, inherent value beyond the instrumental.\u201d If we lose sight of that ideal in the name of saving civilization, he argues, if we allow ourselves to erect wind farms on every mountain and solar arrays in every desert, we will be accepting a Faustian bargain.When Kingsnorth describes how he came to this way of thinking, he nearly always begins with an ancient chalk hill outside Winchester, not far from the site of the recent Uncivilization festival. It was 1992, and the conservative British government was about to break ground on a vast network of highways across England.The highways were proposed three years earlier by Margaret Thatcher, whose administration announced that they would constitute the \u201cbiggest road-building program since the Romans.\u201d As it happened, they would also cut through areas that had remained unspoiled since the Romans. Direct opposition to the program began at a hill called Twyford Down, through which the government planned to build a six-lane highway. The purpose of the road was to reduce the commute to London by a matter of minutes. In 1992, a small band of radicals calling themselves the Dongas staged a demonstration. Soon road protests were popping up across the country, drawing support from itinerant hippies, the working classes and the nobility.Students of popular movements often credit the road protests of the 1990s with radicalizing a generation of British youth. This is certainly true of Kingsnorth. While at Oxford, he spent many weekends at Twyford Down \u2014 locking arms, waving placards, shouting slogans. He found it intoxicating to put himself on the line for a cause. At Twyford Down, he was arrested for the first time, for chaining himself, along with 50 others, to a bridge. He loved it. (He later sued the police and received a settlement of $5,000.) Kingsnorth was even more intoxicated by the proud impracticality of the protests. The core of the demonstrators\u2019 complaints was not that the new highways would worsen air pollution, cause car accidents or fracture communities; it was that some things, like wilderness and beauty, were \u2014 despite, or perhaps because of, their \u201cuselessness\u201d \u2014 more important than getting to work on time. The motivation was raw, intuitive and, in its Wordsworthian love of the Arcadian, very, very English. In an essay titled \u201cConfessions of a Recovering Environmentalist,\u201d Kingsnorth wrote that after Twyford Down, he \u201cvowed, self-importantly, that this would be my life\u2019s work: Saving nature from people. Preventing the destruction of beauty and brilliance, speaking up for the small and the overlooked and the things that could not speak for themselves.\u201dIt proved easier to make this vow than to act on it. The chief obstacle was his father: a driven, competitive man who scraped his way up from a working-class background to become the head of a manufacturing firm. Kingsnorth\u2019s father was not without a love of the outdoors, but it was a striving, willful kind of love. He often took Kingsnorth on long, arduous hiking trips, forcing him to carry heavy packs and disappearing far up the trail to teach his son the virtues of independence and struggle.These trips were both trials and revelations. It was while backpacking with his father on the moors of Cornwall and atop the hills of Northumberland that Kingsnorth had his first cathartic experiences in nature \u2014 experiences that were responsible for the direction his life was now taking. But his father wasn\u2019t prone to seeing that as a consolation. \u201cI\u2019d gone off to Oxford as a guy in jeans and a T-shirt,\u201d Kingsnorth says, \u201cthen I started wearing tie-dye tops and putting beads in my hair and walking around in big boots, as dudes do.\u201dKingsnorth wouldn\u2019t tell his father about his arrest for 10 years. Nor would he find a way to elude the expectations placed on him. His 20s were an awkward \u2014 and not very successful \u2014 mix of idealism and ambition. At Oxford he was editor of Cherwell, the university\u2019s longest-running student newspaper, whose staff has included Graham Greene, W. H. Auden and (on the business end) Rupert Murdoch. He parlayed this honor into an entry-level position as a researcher at The Independent, in London. He was miserable. He found the work frivolous and his superiors out of touch. In 1995, seven years after the creation of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and six years after a global treaty regulating CFCs, he had to explain to an editor the difference between global warming and ozone depletion.Kingsnorth lasted on Fleet Street for less than a year. He stayed in London another two, working for a poorly run nonprofit, writing a protest novel no one wanted to publish and getting increasingly fed up with the congestion and noise. Finally he returned to Oxford, figuring he would freelance. The rent was cheap, and in the late 1990s the pubs were filled with green activists and writers. But Kingsnorth has always found it difficult to stand still \u2014 another trait, he says, he inherited from his father. In 2001, hungry to travel, he took his agent\u2019s advice to write a book about the growing anti-globalization movement, which came to prominence two years before when thousands gathered to protest the World Trade Organization in Seattle.For Kingsnorth, the anti-globalization movement was both opportunity and mission. He attended mass protests in Prague, where he was tear-gassed for the first time, and Genoa, where the police shot and killed a young anarchist two streets from where Kingsnorth was marching. The experiences radicalized him anew. \u201cIt was similar to what I\u2019d felt at the road protests,\u201d he told me. \u201cHere\u2019s millions of people who don\u2019t like this way of measuring the world, don\u2019t like this way of living, don\u2019t like this way of seeing the world.\u201d He made reporting trips to four continents, tracing the movement\u2019s roots and common themes.His timing could not have been worse. His book came out in March 2003, during the first week of the Iraq war. It landed \u201cwith an inaudible thud.\u201d He returned to Oxford and spent the next few years writing pamphlets, articles and another novel (for which, again, he could not find a publisher), and he began \u201cReal England.\u201dIn August 2007, as he was picking flowers in the small back garden of his house, he got a call that his father had killed himself. Kingsnorth\u2019s father had been living in Cyprus, in semiretirement. His marriage had fallen apart. He had a nervous breakdown and spent time in a psychiatric hospital. One morning, he wrote a bitter suicide note, got in his car and drove full speed into a parked truck.Kingsnorth\u2019s reaction to his father\u2019s death was conflicted. He\u2019d often suspected that behind his own drive to achieve \u2014 to have his opinions aired on television and his books published by mainstream presses, to lead mass movements \u2014 was a need to satisfy his father\u2019s more conventional expectations of him. Now that need was obsolete. He felt a sense of release, as if he\u2019d been given permission to say what he wanted to say, in any way he wanted to say it. He felt he could finally, with a clear conscience, \u201cgo to the margins.\u201d All he had to do was figure out what that meant.The first follower is a concept introduced by the musician and entrepreneur Derek Sivers in a short TED talk titled, \u201cHow to Start a Movement.\u201d In the talk, Sivers shows an amateur video that begins with a shirtless man gyrating wildly on a hillside at what seems to be a concert. For a while the man dances alone, swinging his hips and arms as if possessed, or more likely high. Eventually someone joins him, and they hold hands and gyrate together. Before you know it, a full-fledged dance party has broken out.\u201cThe point being,\u201d Hine said, \u201cthat the first follower transforms you from a lunatic into someone who\u2019s got the beginning of something.\u201dFor Hine, the equivalent of the lone dancer was a pair of blog posts Kingsnorth wrote in late 2007. The first was a bilious rant announcing his retirement from journalism. (\u201cThe media can go hang. I\u2019ve had it. I\u2019m out.\u201d) The second, written after yet another international climate conference sputtered out, expressed his \u201cjoyous\u201d abandonment of hope that global warming could be stopped. Hine was just turning 30. A scruffy, bright-eyed man with an unruly mop of hair, he had for years worked, unhappily and off and on, as a radio reporter for the BBC. Like Kingsnorth, he quit in a spasm of disgust. Also like Kingsnorth, Hine experienced a transformation in his feelings about climate change: first an obsessive phase of turning off light switches and idling electronics; then a despondent \u201cOskar Schindler phase of \u2018It\u2019s never enough\u2019 \u201d; then a point of curious repose. He emailed Kingsnorth and introduced himself. In the fall of 2008, they met at a pub in Oxford to discuss how they might collaborate.During their first meeting, Kingsnorth and Hine spent most of their time exchanging influences \u2014 \u201cshowing each other our maps,\u201d is how Hine puts it. Hine talked about his passion for the author and critic John Berger, who for the past four decades has lived and farmed in a small French village, and for the late Austrian priest and polymath Ivan Illich, a fierce critic of Western culture. Kingsnorth, in turn, introduced Hine to the American poet Robinson Jeffers, who quickly became a kind of lodestar for Dark Mountain.Jeffers is little read today, but he was one of the most celebrated writers of the 1930s and 1940s. A friend of Edward Weston and D. H. Lawrence, he lived, as one critic put it, \u201clike a reclusive movie-star-wizard\u201d in a stone tower overlooking the Pacific, writing hundreds of poems endowed with the spirit of what he came to call Inhumanism \u2014 \u201ca shifting of emphasis and significance from man to not-man.\u201d At a time when the Great Depression was destroying millions of lives and Europe was militarizing for a new war, Jeffers saw human history as an inexorable, almost naturally destructive force. \u201cThe beauty of modern/Man is not in the persons,\u201d he wrote in \u201cRearmament,\u201d a poem that became the epigraph for \u201cUncivilization,\u2019, \u201cbut in the/Disastrous rhythm, the heavy and mobile masses, the dance of the/Dream-led masses down the dark mountain.\u201dKingsnorth and Hine\u2019s aspirations for their manifesto weren\u2019t revolutionary, but neither were they nihilistic. Each man draws a distinction between a \u201cproblem,\u201d which can be solved, and a \u201cpredicament,\u201d which must be endured. \u201cUncivilization\u201d was firm in its conviction that climate change and other ecological crises are predicaments, and it called for a cadre of like-minded writers to \u201cchallenge the stories which underpin our civilization: the myth of progress, the myth of human centrality and the myth of separation from \u2018nature.\u2019 \u201dWriters whose work more or less fit the manifesto\u2019s bill answered Kingsnorth\u2019s and Hine\u2019s call. In 2010, he and Hine published the first in what has become a series of Dark Mountain books \u2014 literary journals, essentially \u2014 hard-bound and lavishly illustrated. Naomi Klein is by far the best known of the contributors, but the series also includes lengthy interviews with the cultural ecologist David Abram and the social critic Derrick Jensen.Kingsnorth and Hine consider the books to be the heart of Dark Mountain\u2019s work. Had it not been for the surge of interest that greeted the manifesto, Kingsnorth might have stopped there, retreating into the private life of a father and an artist. Retreat was, after all, what he was after \u2014 or what he thought he was after. In 2009, he and his wife, a psychiatrist with the National Health Service, decided to move from Oxford to Cumbria, in the far north of England. Kingsnorth wanted to spend his time writing; taking his children for hikes in the hills, as his father had taken him; and improving his skills on the scythe, a tool he valued for its simplicity and efficiency. (For the past three summers, he has taught scything classes in the area around his home.) Instead he found himself at the head of a burgeoning organization that even its critics might concede was changing the environmental debate in Britain and the rest of Europe. It was a slightly awkward position. Just when Kingsnorth had publicly abandoned faith in movements, he became the leader of one.Watching the concert at the edge of the shelter, I met a young woman, Sarah Thomas, who\u2019d spent the summer backpacking around England. Halfway through the show, we decided to check out an art project by Strang, the Scottish artist, that had emerged as the festival\u2019s most popular draw. It was raining, and we walked up and down hills in the dark until we came to a tiny makeshift hut with a red door and a round wooden sign that read \u201cCharnel House for Roadkill.\u201dThe installation was inspired by a Barry Lopez essay in which he suggests that people pay respect to the lives of animals killed crossing roads and highways. (\u201cYou never know,\u201d Lopez writes, \u201cthe ones you give some semblance of a burial, to whom you offer an apology, may have been like seers in a parallel culture. It\u2019s an act of respect, a technique of awareness.\u201d) The hut was cramped and eerie, decorated with the bones of small animals in illuminated glass cases. Haunting music was piped in from an iPod. You walked through a curtain, sat down and put on a heavy papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 mask \u2014 a badger surrogate. Directly across from you, seated behind a window in the back wall, was another person \u2014 a volunteer \u2014 also wearing a badger mask. He or she sat silently, except when mirroring whatever movements you made, until, driven by emotion, fatigue, satisfaction or plain discomfort, you left.Sitting in the hut, the air stale and the light almost nonexistent, I thought of something Hine told me earlier. \u201cPeople think that abandoning belief in progress, abandoning the belief that if we try hard enough we can fix this mess, is a nihilistic position,\u201d Hine said. \u201cThey think we\u2019re saying: \u2018Screw it. Nothing matters.\u2019 But in fact all we\u2019re saying is: \u2018Let\u2019s not pretend we\u2019re not feeling despair. Let\u2019s sit with it for a while. Let\u2019s be honest with ourselves and with each other. And then as our eyes adjust to the darkness, what do we start to notice?\u2019 \u201dHine compared coming to terms with the scope of ecological loss to coming to terms with a terminal illness. \u201cThe feeling is a feeling of despair to begin with, but within that space other things begin to come through.\u201d Yet arriving at this acute state of \u201cawareness of what\u2019s worth doing with the time you\u2019ve got left\u201d isn\u2019t always easy for Dark Mountain\u2019s followers. \u201cSome people come here,\u201d Hine told me, \u201cthey get very excited by the fact that people are inspired, and they go: \u2018Right! Great! So what\u2019s the plan?\u2019 \u201d He and Kingsnorth have worked hard to check this impulse, seeing Dark Mountain as a space to set aside what Kingsnorth refers to as \u201cactivist-y\u201d urges.This wasn\u2019t always the case. At the first festival, in 2010, Kingsnorth behaved the way he thought the leader of a new movement ought to behave. He proselytized. He lectured. He gave a talk that he describes as \u201cHere\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with environmentalism, and this is what must change!\u201d But he quickly concluded that a didactic tone was inappropriate for the new group. Dark Mountain had more in common with the anarchism of Occupy Wall Street than with the collectivism of 350.org: everyone was to choose his or her own course of action. Recently, Kingsnorth and Hine decided not to hold any more festivals. They want to focus their limited resources on publishing more books more frequently, but they also don\u2019t want the gatherings to ossify into a predictable program \u2014 or worse, an annual party.For more conventional activists, Dark Mountain\u2019s insistence on remaining impractical can be not only disorienting but also irksome. George Monbiot, one of the England\u2019s most prominent environmental journalists, is among Kingsnorth\u2019s oldest friends. In 2009, after the manifesto was published, he and Kingsnorth held a debate in The Guardian, for which Monbiot writes a column. It was a heated exchange. Kingsnorth argued that civilization was approaching collapse and that it was time to step back and talk about how to live through it with dignity and honor. Monbiot responded that \u201cstepping back\u201d from direct political action was equivalent to a near-criminal disavowal of one\u2019s moral duty. \u201cHow many people do you believe the world could support without either fossil fuels or an equivalent investment in alternative energy?\u201d he asked. \u201cHow many would survive without modern industrial civilization? Two billion? One billion? Under your vision, several billion perish. And you tell me we have nothing to fear.\u201dNaomi Klein also sees a troubling abdication in Kingsnorth\u2019s work. \u201cI like Paul, but he\u2019s said rather explicitly that he\u2019s giving up,\u201d she told me. \u201cWe have to be honest about what we can do. We have to keep the possibility of failure in our minds. But we don\u2019t have to accept failure. There are degrees to how bad this thing can get. Literally, there are degrees.\u201dOn the surface, it can indeed seem as if Kingsnorth is giving up. Last week, he and his wife made a long-planned move to rural Ireland, where they will be growing much of their own food and home schooling their children \u2014 a decision, he explained to me, that stemmed in part from a desire to distance himself from technological civilization and in part from wanting to teach his children skills they might need in a hotter future. Yet Kingsnorth has never intended to retreat altogether. For the past three years, he has spent a good portion of his time trying to stop a large supermarket from being built in Ulverston, in northern England. \u201cWhy do I do this,\u201d he wrote to me in an email, anticipating my questions, \u201cwhen I know that in a national context another supermarket will make no difference at all, and when I know that I can\u2019t stop the trend caused by the destruction of the local economy, and when I know we probably won\u2019t win anyway?\u201d He does it, he said, because his sense of what is valuable and good recoils at all that supermarket chains represent. \u201cI\u2019m increasingly attracted by the idea that there can be at least small pockets where life and character and beauty and meaning continue. If I could help protect one of those from destruction, maybe that would be enough. Maybe it would be more than most people do. \u201cIt\u2019s an ethic reflected in the novel he has just published. When he was a schoolboy, Kingsnorth told me, his teachers described the Norman Conquest, in 1066, as a swift transformation. An army of Norman and French soldiers from across the channel invaded England and swept away Anglo-Saxon civilization. The old ways vanished, and a new world emerged. He was surprised to learn, much later, that a resistance movement bedeviled the conquerors for a full decade. These resisters were known as the Silvatici, or \u201cwild men.\u201d Eventually William the Conqueror drove them from the woods and slaughtered every last one of them. They were doomed from the start, and knew it. But that hadn\u2019t stopped them from fighting.when will i be free saes the cilde to the stagand the stag saes thu will nefer be freethen when will angland be freeangland will nefer be freethen what can be donenaht can be donethen how moste i lifthu moste be triewe that is all there isbe triewebe triewe\u201cI hope these ramblings are of some use to you!\u201d he signed off. \u201cI will have a glass of wine now and try not to worry about it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Statistically Speaking", "Date": "2014-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the dark days of the Great Depression, the economist Simon Kuznets set about calculating the total national income of the United States. It was a case of a demand creating its supply, the demand by Congress and citizens to understand the scale of the economic calamity the nation was then experiencing. The same demand for understanding helps explain the public\u2019s interest these days in what might otherwise seem to be dry, uninviting economic statistics. How secure is the recovery from the impact of the 2008 financial crisis? What good is a recovery that benefits only the wealthy minority? Do our children have any hope of seeing their living standards rise as ours did over the late 20th century \u2014 or is that dream of progress over?Zachary Karabell\u2019s lively account, \u201cThe Leading Indicators,\u201d is a terrific introduction to the range of statistics economists and governments use to address these questions. As Karabell tells us, the role of the government in the economy explains why we have the statistics we do: \u201cUntil the early 20th century, significant economic hardship was so woven into human history and experience that it wasn\u2019t yet seen as an aberration. Only the combination of a severe crisis and the belief that such crises not only could but should be prevented by collective government action led to the creation of unemployment statistics.\u201d Karabell also shows how many judgment calls are involved in developing statistics. Even so seemingly straightforward a measure as unemployment requires assumptions \u2014 for example about how to treat transient workers or students or people who are working fewer hours than they would like. This is why there are several different unemployment measures, although only one hits the \u00adheadlines.Rulers have long collected some statistics, Karabell points out. William the Conqueror\u2019s Domesday Book of 1086 was a comprehensive register of his kingdom\u2019s assets. Karabell also pinpoints right at the start the central challenge of economic measurement: The reality is complex, but the politicians and the public demand simple answers. Gathering statistics is both a sophisticated technical exercise and an art of storytelling aiming to show the main contours beneath the confusing mass of numbers. Just as in the famous short story by Jorge Luis Borges, \u201cOn Exactitude in Science,\u201d a map with a one-to-one scale would defeat its purpose.Karabell\u2019s book gets into its stride with the 1930s, and the impetus the Depression and then World War II gave to the collection of the economic statistics so familiar to us now. He breathes life into what could be a dull story by giving walk-on parts to some of the economists and statisticians involved, and to politicians like Herbert Hoover and Franklin Roosevelt, who made the collection of economic data a government activity. A set of official statistics is now published pretty much every day; the key numbers drive the financial markets and are listed like magical incantations by commentators in the news media.\u201cNo single number has become more central to society in the past 50 years\u201d than gross domestic product, Karabell says. It led to nothing less than the invention of \u201cthe economy\u201d as a concept. \u201cUntil the 1940s, there was no \u2018the economy.\u2019 People did not use the term, and they had only just begun to think of the material affairs of a nation as a coherent and cohesive subject that could be defined, measured and tracked over time.\u201d Here he might have made more of the way the measurement of G.D.P. and the theories of the British economist John Maynard Keynes reinforced each other. Without G.D.P., it would have been hard to put into practice the idea that the government could manage the economy like a machine.The second half of the book turns to more recent history and the way changes in the character of the economy are making the conventional statistics less useful. Take inflation. Karabell describes the fraught history of the Consumer Price Index, politicized from the start by accusations that the government wanted to underplay cost-of-living increases to limit Social Security payments and bear down on wage claims. The methodology has changed frequently, including the introduction of a \u201ccore\u201d measure that excludes food and energy prices, although any normal person would think these a central part of most people\u2019s cost of living. The most recent issue has been how much to adjust rises in the C.P.I. to take account of the large improvements in the quality of consumer electronic goods, the so-called \u201chedonic\u201d adjustments. The digital economy poses all kinds of statistical problems, from how to actually collect price data to reflect online purchasing to the deeper question of how to assess the benefits consumers get from \u201cfree\u201d services online. Economists like Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee in their book \u201cThe Second Machine Age\u201d and Michael J. Mandel of the Progressive Policy Institute have written extensively about this.So we come full circle to the question of what we mean by \u201cthe economy\u201d when it is changing so much. Karabell is far too kind to the claim that governments should try to increase \u201cgross national happiness.\u201d The kingdom of Bhutan replaced standard economic measures with measures of happiness as long ago as 1972. Yet Bhutan\u2019s G.D.P. per head is still one of the lowest in the world, life expectancy is relatively low and infant mortality high, so it is easy to see why the king would not want anyone to mention the economy. And Karabell is too unkind to the idea suggested by the Nobel Prize-winning economists Amartya Sen and Joseph Stiglitz, together with the French economist Jean-Paul Fitoussi, of looking at a \u201cdashboard\u201d of indicators of well-being instead of simply one. He writes here: \u201cAll of these efforts dance around the core challenge of what to do with a set of entrenched indicators that frame the way almost every country in the world \u2014 Bhutan notwithstanding \u2014 assesses its economic success and the viability of its national economic policies.\u201d Yet he goes on to describe the great success the statistician Hans Rosling has had in bringing to life the way numbers tell meaningful stories. There is no reason to believe dashboards cannot become both engaging and influential statistical reports, and to be given as much attention as the quarterly G.D.P. figures.For as Karabell himself concludes, \u201cno one number will suffice.\u201d Modern economies are complicated, with a vast range of products and services. G.D.P. was adequate for the age of mass production, but adding up the components of today\u2019s American economy is not the same as adding up the number of cars rolling off the assembly line. Even more important is a distinction not made clearly in the book, namely the difference between economic activity and society\u2019s well-being. We need a measure of total activity, but G.D.P. cannot indicate how good economic prospects are for the next generation, or even for a majority of us today. The so-called leading indicators no longer answer the most important questions people are raising about how they live.THE LEADING INDICATORSA Short History of the Numbers That Rule Our WorldBy Zachary Karabell287 pp. Simon & Schuster. $27.Diane Coyle is an economist and the author of \u201cGDP: A Short but Affectionate History.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Part-Time Faculty", "Date": "2014-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersReaders discuss an editorial about the quality and pay of adjunct professors.\u00a0As an adjunct professor at Northern Virginia Community College, I know firsthand that our institution demands the same performance and integrity of us as it does of our full-time counterparts. We are required to keep office hours, maintain email contact, give all sorts of feedback to students, and, above all, be just as prepared as the full-timers.The real issue is not the quality of the adjunct teachers; it is the substandard pay. The poor pay from these institutions forces adjuncts to pursue other lines of work. That is the single reason we leave the school when class is over. We must get to the many other jobs we are forced to take to pay the rent. The majority of my colleagues have about three jobs.My fellow adjuncts and full-timers are some of the most dedicated, knowledgeable and inspiring teachers I have ever seen. The colleges do not need to do a better job of screening the part-time instructors. They need to pay them more than minimum wage.Adjuncts are part of an academic sweatshop and yet, somehow, the stigma of poor quality always falls on us.\u00a0A larger percentage of faculty, also well educated (many with Ph.D.\u2019s and essential master\u2019s degrees), toil without tenure or the security of work from one semester to the next, without benefits, office space and time to think. This majority mainly labors in community colleges, the stepchildren of higher education, where our most disadvantaged students matriculate, amass student debt beyond their means to repay, and fail to graduate in alarmingly high numbers.This is the higher education system we have allowed to flourish and have justified for decades as cost-effective. The question is at what cost and at whose cost.Obviously, thousands of well-educated, part-time faculty pay the price. Certainly, our most needy students do. And ultimately we all pay the price as we descend more deeply into two disparate systems of higher education.The writer is a retired community college English professor. \u00a0A financially insecure and transient faculty body cannot have an effective say in who may teach and what courses may be taught, thus undermining the climate of creative freedom that is necessary to sustain the intellectual life of the university.Moreover, part-time faculty cannot participate in any meaningful way in university governance. Their employment is totally dependent on the whims of the administration; you are here one semester and out the next.This trend will only contribute to the growing disconnect between faculty and administration on university campuses and to the deepening of power differentials. The academic community must urgently address this challenge.The writer is a professor of political science at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and the Graduate Center, City University of New York.\u00a0The report, from the Coalition on the Academic Workforce, indicates that four-year contingent faculty members are among those least likely to have regular salary increases, priority for tenure-track openings, or job security and seniority when it comes to class assignments. With nontenure-track faculty members already accounting for a third of the faculty in four-year institutions, the challenges associated with the rise of part-time faculty members need to be addressed at all levels, including four-year colleges and universities.The writer is an associate professor of political science and public policy at the University of California, Riverside.\u00a0State legislatures have gutted the operational budgets of public colleges, first cutting them to the bone and since the recession draining the lifeblood of these institutions. The Morrill Act of 1862 created the land grant university system, the envy of the world. Affordable education was then available to anyone who was qualified.Today, students are given a second-class education, mostly delivered by \u201crent a profs\u201d and graduate students, leaving school deep in debt and graduating into an economy not prepared to employ them.Indeed, many are questioning whether or not a college education is worth the time and expense.As tenured professors are not replaced and colleges and universities accept part-time, ridiculously compensated faculty to educate the future leaders of our country, the value of the college experience has been discounted.I foresee a time in the not-too-distant future when residential public colleges and universities will not exist, having been replaced by online courses.The writer was a professor of environmental science at North Carolina State University.

{"Headline": "Obama Fails on Message of Good News", "Date": "2014-04-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From WashingtonWASHINGTON \u2014 Here\u2019s a bit of good news for nervous Democrats: President Obama\u2019s health care law isn\u2019t going to be the albatross many feared it would be in this year\u2019s congressional elections. Enrollment has soared, and the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the program will cost less than initially projected and that premiums will rise only slightly this year.The House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, and the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, aren\u2019t popping the Champagne corks, however. The economy could clobber Democrats in November. And the president continues to alternate between telling Americans how much better things are and deploring how many are being left behind.Both statements are true, but that makes for a message that is muddled, incoherent and too negative.The Senate leadership and White House staff have started to meet each week to develop a coordinated economic message for the fall. They have a ways to go.Politicians see the same poll numbers the news media does. In a recent Wall Street Journal-NBC News poll, the sentiment about the economy showed no positive movement. A Bloomberg national survey last month indicated more pessimism than a year before about the economy, job growth and housing. A majority said they thought health care costs were getting worse and gave Mr. Obama negative marks on health care and the economy.Congressional Democrats find it especially frustrating that the president doesn\u2019t make a strong and more compelling case for the improvements on his watch. On health care, it isn\u2019t just that eight million people have signed up for coverage under the law; health care costs have been growing at the slowest pace in decades, and this positive trend is expected to continue throughout the year.The Federal Reserve has forecast that the economy will grow at about 3 percent this year, after five years of average growth of less than 2 percent after the financial crisis. Housing has climbed out of its slump, the energy industry is booming, the financial sector has recovered along with lending, and manufacturing is at least crawling, with a vibrant automobile industry. Compared with the rest of the world, this is a great American comeback story.But there is a darker side to the American picture. The underemployment rate \u2014 which includes the jobless, those working part time for economic reasons and those who want a job but have quit looking \u2014 was at 12.7 percent in March. Average hourly earnings have been essentially stagnant for the past five years.This bothers Mr. Obama, as it should. Yet his attempts to tell this tale of two cities produce a disjointed narrative and a sense of a president still in campaign mode.That is scary for Democrats on the ballot this year. Many of the crucial races are in Republican or Republican-leaning states where the president is unpopular and his health care law still could be a liability.And on the economy, which is likely to be the determining issue in the congressional contests, the White House and Democrats are winning on the parts or pieces \u2014 a minimum wage increase, pay equity for women, more generous overtime regulations \u2014 and losing the fight for the larger picture of people\u2019s lives and futures.The White House says the president has repeatedly evoked the good news. The problem, aides contend, has been breaking through with a clear message.Although Mr. Obama\u2019s personal story is one of can-do optimism, that isn\u2019t what he often conveys. He had a similar problem of tone during his 2012 re-election campaign as he struggled to frame the message of an improving economy.That turned around almost exactly two months before Election Day. The moment: former President Bill Clinton\u2019s speech to the Democratic National Convention in which he articulated how much the economy had improved since Mr. Obama took office and why continuing that progress hinged on his re-election.That sound you hear from the Capitol\u2019s Democratic cloakrooms these days? \u201cBring back Bubba.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Germany Can Teach Japan", "Date": "2014-04-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Imagine a postwar Germany that had never managed to become friends with its neighboring countries. Imagine a Germany that, despite all the remorse it had shown for its belligerence during World War II, had been excluded from the European Union. Imagine, even, that this Germany had been excluded from NATO, because it had forever been denied the right to engage in a defense alliance. On top of all of this, imagine the following: Your economy is in decline; a mighty, nondemocratic neighbor is increasing military spending while denouncing you as an aggressive, militaristic nation, even as it and other nearby countries are grabbing parts of your territory. If it\u2019s hard to imagine such a scenario, just hop on a plane to Japan.The comparison with my own country is certainly a compassionate reading of the new, assertive tone that Japan\u2019s government has adopted toward its neighbors. It\u2019s hard not to sympathize after speaking with the many Japanese officials I\u2019ve met here, who say they have just one wish: that Japan, almost 70 years after the end of World War II, could become a \u201cnormal country\u201d like Germany.Normal? At first the idea sounds humble, understandable. But \u201cnormal\u201d is a tricky concept: No country is truly \u201cnormal,\u201d even boring old Germany. And this desire comes at a time when being normal \u2014 including the right to militarize \u2014 may contribute to the spiral of mistrust underway among the major players in East Asia. My conversations with Japanese officials and observers persuaded me that, for all the differences between the countries, there are instructive parallels between Germany\u2019s experience and Japan\u2019s current position \u2014 above all, that normalcy is not something that is granted; it must be sought out and earned.Of course, there are good reasons that Germany and Japan followed divergent courses after the war. Japan has obviously had greater problems with coming to terms with its past: A foreign affairs official in Tokyo frankly told me the Japanese public was experiencing \u201capology fatigue\u201d \u2014 something most Germans would never admit to, even if they felt it. This is partly understandable. China is an undemocratic neighbor that has never seriously been interested in reconciliation; on the contrary, it uses Japan\u2019s guilty past \u2014 the massacre at Nanjing, the widespread enslavement of \u201ccomfort women\u201d \u2014 to stir up its own neo-nationalism. And then there is the simple fact of geography: Japan is an island nation, Germany has land borders with nine countries. You cannot take the train from Tokyo to Seoul as you can from Cologne to Paris. The lack of strong cultural interaction is a problem, too: There has not been anything like the real-life social network of the Erasmus student exchange program for the Pacific region.But for those precise reasons, if long-term peace is to be achieved, then someone has to take the lead on regional reconciliation. And there is no one more obliged than Japan to take on that burden. Here is where the Germany parallel becomes instructive. Nobody expects Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to kneel before the Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall in atonement, the way Chancellor Willy Brandt of Germany did before the Ghetto Uprising Memorial in Warsaw. But as Germany learned in its coming to terms with the past, the famed \u201cVergangenheitsbew\u00e4ltigung,\u201d strong symbols are sometimes more helpful than facts. While some Japanese scholars may be correct to say that Chinese propaganda inflates the numbers of victims of Nanjing, the easiest way to unwind its effect would be to make an impressive, lasting statement of guilt. Germany has been accepted as a full and fairly normal member of the international community not least because of the persistence with which it has remembered the Nazi atrocities. Another lesson from Germany: Withstand the temptation to blame others, even if you see good grounds for it. When I asked a Japanese official why his government didn\u2019t react to the proposal of President Park Geun-hye of South Korea to set up a committee for jointly developing history schoolbooks, after the Franco-German model, he said Tokyo had \u201cnot received any proposal from the Korean government in relation to this issue.\u201d If Germany had waited for a written invitation for reconciliation from France or Poland, my generation would probably still believe that we were surrounded by hereditary enemies.Reconciliation takes bravery as well as generosity. And you must want it. Without it, a country\u2019s path to \u201cnormality\u201d \u2014 perhaps best defined as earning and enjoying the trust of its neighbors \u2014 remains blocked. Reconciliation pays off, and a new normality is the reward. The opposite, creating boogeymen and playing blame games, happened in Europe in 1914. Does East Asia really want to go sleepwalking down that path a hundred years later? Japan, more than any of its neighbors, has the obligation, with a gesture to its neighbors, to prevent that. Perhaps the best way to prove you are a normal country is to hold your nerve when things get rough. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Companies Built on Sharing Balk When It Comes to Regulators", "Date": "2014-04-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the newfangled sharing economy, questions about safety, taxes and regulation have tended to be an afterthought. That has helped propel companies like Uber, Airbnb and Lyft into the stratosphere. But regulators as well as some elected officials across the country are increasingly questioning the presumptions and tactics of these start-ups, especially the notion that laws do not apply to them.The companies are fighting back by rallying their impassioned and growing customer base. And they are stocking up on lawyers and lobbyists. The latest confrontation comes Tuesday as Airbnb, the largest housing rental company, goes to court in Albany. It is fighting an effort by New York regulators to collect the names of Airbnb hosts who are breaking the law by renting out multiple properties for short periods.Airbnb, which is now estimated to be worth $10 billion, is framing the dispute as a case of government scooping up more data than it needs for purposes that are vague.\u201cHe claims to be targeting a small number of bad actors,\u201d said David Hantman, Airbnb\u2019s head of global public policy, referring to the New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman. \u201cBut he is asking for data on thousands of regular New Yorkers.\u201dIn a blog post, Airbnb said the regulators\u2019 plan was to accuse Airbnb hosts in court \u201cof being bad neighbors and bad citizens.\u201d It added: \u201cThey\u2019ll call us slumlords and tax cheats. They might even say we all faked the moon landing.\u201dIt is against the law in New York City to rent out an apartment for less than a month, a 2010 measure meant to curb unregulated hotels. Mr. Schneiderman says 60 percent of Airbnb rentals in New York are illegal. In an affidavit filed in New York State Supreme Court, the director of research for the state attorney general noted that of the more than 19,500 listings on Airbnb in New York at the end of January, the majority were for an entire apartment.Existing laws, Airbnb executives say, do not fit the sharing economy.Micah Lasher, Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s chief of staff, fired back that \u201cbeing innovative is not a defense to breaking the law.\u201dCalling consumers to arms is a defense that has worked well for the businesses of the sharing economy. Last week, ride-sharing companies collected enough signatures in Seattle to overturn a new City Council measure that limited their growth. This week, they are trying to fight an effort by Arizona legislators to introduce some modest controls on their business.Attempts at old-fashioned regulation are being cheered on by the taxi and hotel industries, who feel their livelihood is being threatened. Affordable-housing advocates are now joining the fray, saying companies like Airbnb are worsening a crisis.\u201cYou are throwing gasoline on a fire that the rest of us are trying to put out,\u201d a coalition of housing groups, Real Affordability for All, asserted Monday in an open letter to Airbnb. Until recently, start-ups generally avoided areas that were heavily regulated, like transporting people and renting rooms. Even a well-funded start-up did not have the money, time or patience to wrestle approval from bureaucrats.Then, a few years ago, Silicon Valley had a collective insight: Better to ask forgiveness than permission.Many start-ups define \u201cworking with\u201d regulators as simply accusing them of holding back innovation. But Mr. Laws said regulators were trying to balance many competing interests. \u201cThis assumption that they\u2019re always bad in my experience has been almost 100 percent wrong,\u201d he said.The New York regulators are seeking through a subpoena the names of landlords they think are breaking the law. On Jan. 31, there were 19,522 listings for New York City properties on Airbnb from 15,677 hosts, according to data the attorney general submitted to the court. But nearly a third of the listings were from only 12 percent of the hosts.One Airbnb landlord had 127 listings in Manhattan on a single weekend last fall. Sixteen other landlords had at least 15 listings each.Even as Airbnb was increasing the volume of its attack on regulators on Monday, it was deleting numerous New York hosts from its site.\u201cWhen we examined our community in New York, we found that some property managers weren\u2019t providing a quality, local experience to guests,\u201d the company said in a blog post. The removed landlords controlled a total of 2,000 rooms. The regulators took Airbnb\u2019s action as proof that people are indeed abusing the site, and that Airbnb knows it.\u201cThe publicly available data suggests that a disproportionate share of Airbnb\u2019s business comes not from struggling artists and grandmothers but rather large commercial enterprises,\u201d said Mr. Lasher, the chief of staff. He added that the \u201cstring of attacks\u201d on the attorney general was \u201ca transparent effort to distract from our investigation.\u201dOn Tuesday morning, Airbnb intends to put forth a fresh attack on Mr. Schneiderman, releasing a memo that plays up those struggling small stakeholders. \u201cKimberly is an Airbnb host on the Lower East Side,\u201d the memo says. \u201cShe has a chronic illness that prevents her from working.\u201d Kimberly is quoted directly: \u201cMy husband and I spent countless nights wondering if and when we would lose our home, or if we would have to stop treatment to keep a roof over our heads.\u201d She concludes, \u201cAirbnb saved us.\u201dWhat both sides seem to agree on is that being a New York landlord on Airbnb can be lucrative. Two years ago, Airbnb hosts in New York were making an average of $21,000 a year, the company said at the time, and some as much as $100,000.Of the top 40 highest-grossing Airbnb hosts in New York, each took in at least $400,000 over the last three years, Mr. Schneiderman said. Collectively, they have grossed more than $35 million over the last three years.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "I.M.F. Warns of Risk From Emerging-Market Corporate Debt", "Date": "2014-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As fears mount about emerging markets, American mutual fund investors with significant exposure to bonds issued by indebted companies in fast-growing economies may be at risk, the International Monetary Fund warned in a report published on Wednesday.Bonds issued by big companies in Brazil, China, Russia and Turkey have seen explosive growth in recent years after central banks around the globe started making extraordinarily large purchases of government and corporate bonds. Given rock-bottom interest rates in the developed world, investors flocked to such high-yielding debt, long seen as the riskiest slice of the emerging-market asset pie.Fund companies have been quick to tap into the market. Since 2008, assets in retail-oriented mutual funds that invest in emerging-market bonds have ballooned to $76 billion, from $12 billion, according to Thomson Reuters.At the outset, borrowers were generally corporations that either were backed by governments or received the bulk of their revenue in dollars \u2014 the energy giants Petrobras in Brazil and Pemex in Mexico, for example. More recently, the companies issuing bonds have been smaller and more financially precarious; many, like second-tier Brazilian banks and overextended Chinese developers, are not even generating revenue in dollars.\u201cMany of the funds that are buying these companies don\u2019t even know what they are buying,\u201d said Elizabeth R. Morrissey of Kleiman International Consultants, an emerging-market investment monitoring and analysis firm. \u201cAll of a sudden, we have Joe Middle Class loading up on emerging-market bond E.T.F.s. That is a little frightening.\u201dMs. Morrissey highlighted the case of Oil India, India\u2019s state-owned energy company. This week, the company tapped global markets for the first time, selling $1 billion worth of bonds in a deal that was nine times oversubscribed.But, as Mr. Tran pointed out, it is not just risky companies that are cashing in on this bonanza.This week, Pakistan, which had not issued a bond in global markets for seven years, sold $2 billion worth of five- and 10-year bonds at an interest rate between 7 percent and 8 percent to blue-chip mutual funds. Demand for Pakistan\u2019s bonds exceeded the amount on offer by more than $5 billion, according to Alex von Sponeck, a bond executive at Bank of America Merrill Lynch who was involved in the deal.In its report, the I.M.F. said that annual corporate bond issuance from emerging markets had more than tripled since 2008, with a record $300 billion sold last year. As a result, countries like China, Hungary and Malaysia have corporate debt of more than 100 percent of gross domestic product.With growth slowing and interest rates on the rise, the cost of servicing these debts is increasing just as earnings deteriorate. It is the same dynamic that has put many of Europe\u2019s indebted economies in a tight spot.\u201cThe share of corporate debt held by weak firms is even higher now than in the period following the September 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers,\u201d the report cautioned.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the state-owned Indian energy company. It is Oil India, not Indian Oil.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "British Economic Growth Accelerates in First Quarter", "Date": "2014-04-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Britain\u2019s recovery continues to gather pace with official figures on Tuesday showing growth of 0.8 percent in the first quarter of the year, confirming the country\u2019s place among the world\u2019s fastest-growing developed economies.The increase in gross domestic product, though marginally lower than what analysts had predicted, outdid the 0.7 percent recorded in the last three months of 2013. Overall G.D.P. was 3.1 percent higher in the first quarter of 2014 compared with the same quarter a year ago, according to the Office for National Statistics, which collects economic data.The data was welcomed by the chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, who sees the speed of the British economic rebound as a vindication of his austerity policies, which have included big public spending cuts to stabilize finances.\u201cToday\u2019s figures show that Britain is coming back, but we can\u2019t take that for granted,\u201d Mr. Osborne said in a statement released by the British Treasury. \u201cFor the first time in a decade all three main sectors of the economy \u2014 manufacturing, services and construction \u2014 have grown by at least three percent over the last year.\u201dAccording to Tuesday\u2019s statistics, growth was stronger in services than in construction, and it decreased in agriculture.The statistics office said that storms and flooding, which gripped some areas of Britain early in the year, might have held back the construction sector but had not, over all, had an impact significant enough for them to be classified as a \u201cstatistical special event.\u201dWith a general election due next year, Mr. Osborne appealed to voters to stick with his approach.\u201cThe impact of the Great Recession is still being felt, but the foundations for a broad-based recovery are now in place,\u201d he said. \u201cThe biggest risk to economic security would be abandoning the plan that is laying those foundations.\u201dNevertheless, economic output is still below its precrisis heights. From the peak in early 2008 to the trough in 2009, the economy shrank by 7.2 percent, according to the statistics office.While the first-quarter figures were marginally below market expectations of a 0.9 percent gain, the pace of recovery over the last year was \u201cfar stronger than anticipated,\u201d according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch research note.It noted that economic growth \u201cclimbed above the Euro area around a year ago, though is still a touch short of France, for example.\u201dThis month, Britain crossed an important threshold when growth in paychecks caught up with inflation after years of austerity and squeezed living standards. But because pay was held down for so long, many analysts believe that it may take time for most workers to feel the effect of the recovery.Whether or not voters start to feel better off in the next 12 months could play a decisive role in the next general election. The International Monetary Fund says that the British economy ought to grow by 2.9 percent in 2014.\u201cThe economy is motoring ahead with progress across many sectors as confidence continues to build among businesses and consumers,\u201d said Katja Hall, chief policy director of the Confederation of British Industry, the main business lobby organization. \u201cGrowth in the first quarter was mostly driven by the service sector, but we\u2019re also seeing our industrial base playing an important role in the recovery, with manufacturing output rising steadily.\u201dTuesday\u2019s figures bode well for a forecast of 3.1 percent G.D.P. growth in 2014, an analysis by Berenberg Bank in London said. \u201cWe expect the U.K. recovery to continue at least at this pace as rising real incomes support household spending and low interest rates paired with strong confidence boost investment.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Maryland, a Political Drama Befitting the Show at Its Center", "Date": "2014-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byANNAPOLIS, Md. \u2014 Where was Frank Underwood when he was really needed?As state lawmakers failed to find the money to guarantee that \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d would continue to film in Maryland, the vote-whipping of the masterfully manipulative Mr. Underwood, as played by Kevin Spacey in the hit political drama, might have wrangled the needed support.Instead, minutes before the end of the General Assembly session at midnight Monday, a bill to pay for a filmmaking subsidy, which the show\u2019s producers had demanded in what some saw as pure Hollywood-meets-Washington hardball, died.The relatively minor expenditure cast its melodramatic shadow over the entire 90-day legislative session in Annapolis, stealing attention from such sober achievements as raising the minimum wage to $10.10 and expanding prekindergarten. At times it seemed all anyone wanted to talk about was the visit of Mr. Spacey to a wine bar popular with state lawmakers in an effort to win the production company political supporters.The makers of \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d which filmed two seasons on locations including the House chamber in Annapolis and the headquarters of The Baltimore Sun, are seeking $15 million in subsidies before committing to shoot Season 3 in the state.Lawmakers agreed to provide much of the money. But before a final $3.5 million was allocated, political comity shattered in a debate over the economic stimulus value of filmmaking and the producers\u2019 tactics.\u201cIt really is a classic extortion,\u201d said Delegate C. William Frick, a Democrat from the Washington suburbs, who has led much of the resistance. He was referring to a decision by the producers to push back production of Season 3, originally planned for spring, until June, to see if the General Assembly would give them everything they wanted.In a letter that some saw as heavy-handed, the filmmakers, Media Rights Capital, wrote to Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley and legislative leaders threatening that if \u201csufficient incentives\u201d were not offered, \u201cwe will have to break down our stage, sets and offices and set up in another state.\u201dThat so infuriated delegates that they passed a budget amendment last month to use eminent domain to seize the property of filmmakers who leave the state after receiving taxpayer subsidies. \u201cI literally thought, \u2018What is an appropriate Frank Underwood response to a threat like this?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Frick, who proposed the amendment, told The Washington Post. The State Senate rejected the language. Maryland, like many other states, competes to lure filmmakers with taxpayer subsidies. In hearings in Annapolis this year, economic development officials said the \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d production had created thousands of jobs and injected $250 million into the economy. Critics in the Legislature questioned whether the impact justified diverting tax dollars from other priorities.The state\u2019s film tax credit program provided about $26 million for the Netflix series in its first two seasons. In a letter of intent to the Business and Economic Development Department, the show\u2019s producers anticipated qualifying for $15 million in subsidies for Season 3, an agency spokeswoman said. In the State Senate, more amenable to Underwood-style blandishments, $18.5 million was approved for the tax credit program in the coming budget year. It includes money for \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d and another locally filmed series, the White House comedy \u201cVeep.\u201dIn the House of Delegates, however, where opposition came from both Democrats and Republicans, strings were attached to a portion of that money, $3.5 million. The idea was to allow state officials to claw back money if a filmmaker shot a first season of a series and then left the state. Tempers rose during floor debate in the House on Monday when a Democratic supporter of the subsidy program told a critic, Delegate Mark Fisher, to \u201cstop pointing your finger at me.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m pointing a finger at you on behalf of the taxpayers of Maryland,\u201d Mr. Fisher, a Republican, replied. The issue was pushed to the last half hour of the session on Monday night, when a hastily called conference committee of House and Senate representatives failed to reach a deal.

{"Headline": "A Village Stadium Is a Symbol of Power for Hungary\u2019s Premier", "Date": "2014-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFELCSUT, Hungary \u2014 Something strange is going on here among the humble Soviet-era cottages.Construction cranes loom over what will soon be a nearly 4,000-seat sports stadium named after Ferenc Puskas, the Babe Ruth of Hungarian soccer. The price? Upward of $17 million.This blink-and-you-missed-it village, about 24 miles west of Budapest, might seem an odd place for such an extravagance. After all, only about 1,800 people live here.But Felcsut is also the hometown of Viktor Orban, Hungary\u2019s powerful prime minister. And Mr. Orban, an ardent soccer fan, will have the best seat in town: His country house sits about 20 feet from the stadium.\u201cThe whole town is working here,\u201d said Laszlo Molnar, a construction worker. \u201cIt\u2019s like a cathedral.\u201dWhat is happening in Felcsut is part of the changes that have washed over Hungary since Mr. Orban and his Fidesz party swept to power in 2010. His government has rewritten the constitution and passed hundreds of laws, including a tax code that makes business investment in sports tax-deductible. It has also come to dominate all branches of government and boosted a rising class of oligarchs. Mr. Orban is expected to consolidate his power in parliamentary elections this Sunday.While the European Union has been alarmed by the rise of autocratic leaders in neighboring countries, Mr. Orban\u2019s critics see him as a strongman within the bloc. After recently fast-tracking a nuclear energy agreement with Russia, Mr. Orban, a one-time anti-Communist activist, is pulling close to Vladimir V. Putin.Here in Felcsut, the new stadium has meant good jobs for many villagers. But some have benefited more than others. The mayor, Lorinc Meszaros, who is a friend of the prime minister, has gone from being a pipe fitter to one of Hungary\u2019s richest men. His construction company is one of the main firms building the stadium and has flourished on state contracts. Mr. Meszaros declined to comment.The former mayor, Gyorgy Varga, objected to terms of a deal that would have sold village land for the stadium. After that, the state passed a law that seemed tailored to usher Mr. Varga out of a job, disqualifying him from holding office because of an outstanding tax debt.\u201cIn the Communist times, it didn\u2019t matter if you knew your trade or if you were qualified to do a job, but if you were a loyal comrade, you got the job anyway,\u201d Mr. Varga said. \u201cToday, it\u2019s the same. You just don\u2019t have to be a good comrade, but a good friend.\u201dHungary\u2019s business leaders clearly want to please Mr. Orban. Mr. Meszaros, the mayor, is the president of a foundation that will operate the new stadium, along with an accompanying soccer academy that Mr. Orban founded. (Mr. Orban\u2019s son, Gaspar, who now plays for the academy\u2019s professional team, was once a student.) That foundation has been bankrolled by some of the country\u2019s largest corporations. Among them are MOL, the state gasoline giant, and OTP, the biggest bank. Contributing, too, is Kozgep, a construction company tied to Mr. Orban; his son-in-law sits on the board. Coca-Cola Hungary and Suzuki have also kicked in.To Mr. Orban\u2019s critics, Felcsut is the centerpiece of Orban Inc., a lucrative alliance between his government and politically connected corporate interests. The prime minister\u2019s ambitions are visible in the cavernous arena here, which is topped with towers and an undulating, black-shingled roof.Hungary\u2019s autocratic turn has made it something of a black sheep in the European Union, which it joined in 2004. Mr. Orban is pushing his special projects even as the Hungarian economy struggles and financial markets show apprehension about the nation\u2019s currency, the forint. Gordon Bajnai, who led Hungary under its former Socialist government, has called Felcsut \u201cthe capital of Orbanistan.\u201d\u201cThink of a stadium that has double the capacity of the population of the village,\u201d Mr. Bajnai said. \u201cThe whole thing is like Disneyland. When you are a child, you dream of having a Disneyland at the end of your garden where you can go every day, and now this dream is being realized.\u201dMr. Orban declined to comment. A spokesman provided his public disclosure form, which showed that the prime minister owned homes in Budapest and Felcsut, as well as modest land holdings. A local newspaper recently reported that 94 acres of land near the stadium were registered in the name of Mr. Orban\u2019s wife.For businesses of all sizes, being on the wrong side of Fidesz can be costly. The party has chilled outside investment by targeting industries for special taxes and, in some cases, structuring those taxes to favor domestic companies whose leaders back Fidesz.One leaked audiotape caught a Fidesz official discussing the possibility of granting licenses to sell tobacco only to party loyalists. Mr. Orban was also caught on tape saying he could create a law that would allow Budapest to repatriate a building from a foreign investor.In statements, Coca-Cola Hungary said it worked with various partners to promote an \u201cactive lifestyle\u201d and called the academy, which has 130 full-time students, \u201cone of the most recognized organizations for education and training of young football talents in the country.\u201d OTP Bank, Hungary\u2019s biggest bank, said it earmarked its contributions for \u201cthe development and education of talented youngsters, not building stadium or arena in Felcsut.\u201dThe academy\u2019s foundation also runs a local cable channel and a 37-bed hotel in a neighboring town. It is planning a bigger hotel closer to the stadium, as well as a museum. Gyorgy Szollosi, a spokesman for the academy, said \u201cthe football stadium did not come to be built next to the house of a prime minister\u201d \u2014 disputing a reporter\u2019s phrasing \u2014 \u201cbut the prime minister\u2019s family built their weekend house next to the old football pitch of the village.\u201dWhile Mr. Orban has no official role, Mr. Szollosi said: \u201cWe all know that Mr. Orban is a very popular politician and that this project, which is for future generations and which it is well known is important to him, was well supported by a number of private companies even when he was the leader of the opposition.\u201dAn article last Friday about changes in Hungary since Viktor Orban became prime minister in 2010 misstated the political affiliation of his predecessor, Gordon Bajnai. Mr. Bajnai is an independent who served as prime minister when the Socialists were in power; he is not himself a Socialist.Anita Komuves contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Owners to Invest $800 Million More in Shanghai Disneyland", "Date": "2014-04-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Shrugging off economists\u2019 concerns about a cooling Chinese economy, the Walt Disney Company on Monday announced a deal to increase spending on its coming Shanghai megaresort by $800 million.Disney and Shanghai Shendi Group, a consortium of state-owned companies, had already committed to spend $4.7 billion on the theme park resort, which is scheduled to open at the end of next year, an ambitious time table. The additional $800 million \u2013 with Disney contributing about 43 percent and Shanghai Shendi shouldering the balance \u2013 will be used to increase the number of rides operating on opening day.Disney did not specify what rides and entertainment offerings the additional funds would allow it to add. A spokeswoman said the $800 million would flow entirely toward new offerings and that the deal in no way reflected budget overruns.Increased spending at the resort, Disney said, reflects the company\u2019s belief that the opportunity in Shanghai has only increased. Disney on Monday cited a study by a research firm called PhoCusWright indicating that the Chinese travel market was projected to grow 34 percent between 2012 and 2015. About 330 million people live within a three-hour trip of the resort, which is in Shanghai\u2019s Pudong district.\u201cWe\u2019ve been impressed with the growth of China\u2019s economy, especially the rapid expansion of the middle class and the significant increase in travel and tourism,\u201d Robert A. Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement.Disney has also been pouring money into its Hong Kong Disneyland, which opened to underwhelming results in 2005 in part because of limited offerings. To some degree, the additional spending on Shanghai Disneyland may be intended to avoid similar opening-day complaints there.After a $500 million expansion was completed, attendance at Hong Kong Disneyland totaled 7.4 million people last year, an increase of 10 percent from the year before. The theme park, still the smallest in Disney\u2019s worldwide fleet, has now delivered double-digit increases in attendance since 2009 and has started turning a modest profit.Disney owns roughly 43 percent of Shanghai Disneyland, with the balance held by Shanghai Shendi. The initial $4.7 billion investment was split along ownership percentages. But Disney will have operational control, holding a 70 percent stake in a management company created with Shendi to run the resort.The resort, one of the largest foreign investments in China ever, includes a 225-acre Magic Kingdom-style park with a castle surrounded by themed areas, although guests will enter through a lush 11-acre garden instead of down an American-style Main Street shopping esplanade.Disney won approval for the park from the Chinese government after two decades of talks in part by promising that the resort would be sharply different from the original Disneyland, which has become a symbol of American culture.Disney has kept most details of the park under wraps, in part because it fears that other theme park operators in China will try to churn out knockoffs. So far, the only major attraction Disney has announced, aside from the castle, is Pirates of the Caribbean: Battle of the Sunken Treasure, a boat experience themed around the company\u2019s \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d movies.Shanghai Disneyland will also include two hotels, a lake and a shopping district, bringing the initial size to about 963 acres.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The New Censors of Hanoi", "Date": "2014-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorHANOI, Vietnam \u2014 More and more state-owned enterprises in Vietnam, from banks to shipbuilders, are being turned over to private hands. Government-run television stations broadcast competing commercials for consumer goods. For some urban families, weekly trips to megamalls and KFC have become de rigueur. In cafes or on social websites, the young show off branded clothes, electronic toys and photos of trips abroad \u2014 while in the streets loudspeakers blare out news of party meetings and decrees. Communism and capitalism make awkward bedfellows, especially when it comes to culture. The government continues to monitor art exhibitions and music shows, films and TV programs, books and CDs. In classic Communist tradition, it still officially bans \u201coffenses against the state\u201d (an all-encompassing and ill-defined crime), violations of custom (like mannequins without underwear) or behavior it deems deviant (like hair dyed in bright colors). But the new enforcers of these old restrictions are driven less by ideological purity than by a mixed bag of political correctness and market-driven concerns \u2014 and this may be hampering artistic creation more than conventional censorship did under classically Communist governments. For years after the Communists took power in the mid-1950s, party leaders would spell out the limits of what was culturally acceptable. Their mind-set was patriarchal, authoritarian and suspicious. Dull bureaucrats with dull minds would debate a song\u2019s patriotic fervor or a painting\u2019s shades of red. Artists were expected to extol the party\u2019s determination during the war against America and portray the people of reunified Vietnam as peaceful and contented. In reality, many Vietnamese suffered terribly during the postwar years, thanks largely to a mismanaged central economy. By the mid-1980s, even the Politburo had taken note, and it began a policy called Doi Moi, or Renovation. Some private enterprise was allowed. Farmers could set their own production rates and prices. The country opened up to tourism. Official shackles on culture were also loosened: It was now in the government\u2019s interest to let writers and painters describe the social problems the state was professing to fix. It was during these laxer days, in 1989, that I first came back to Vietnam. (Like many Vietnamese from the South, I had left at the end of the war.) I met many local artists who were eagerly turning their backs on Soviet-style socialist realism. Painters were embracing abstraction. Writers like Nguyen Minh Chau, Bao Ninh and Nguyen Huy Thiep were detailing not the heroics of war but its horrors, and the enduring hardships of living in post-conflict Vietnam. By the mid-1990s, however, a new generation of leaders decided they had heard enough criticism, especially about abuses of power, nepotism and corruption. The culture ministry began forcing artists to attend \u201cworking sessions,\u201d instructing them to produce more positive images of Vietnam. Renegades were sanctioned. An exhibit of Truong Tan\u2019s tormented homoerotic paintings was taken down; as was his installation of a giant diaper with the absorbent parts made to look like the pockets on the uniforms of police officers. Le Quang Ha and Le Hong Thai made unflattering portraits of politicians, but even when they painted over them, the faintly discernible silhouettes that remained would earn them official reprimands.By the time I moved to Vietnam, in 2006, protest art had all but faded away. I opened a gallery in Hanoi seeking out alternative artworks \u2014 pieces questioning the hypocrisy of party policies, the traditional treatment of women, the rising influence of money. For a couple of years, the police openly followed me around. Officers would ask me about the intellectuals I met; they would ask my artist friends about me. Yet the gallery was allowed to stay open, and it still is today. This is because it caters to a very small audience and has no ambition to be commercial. Vietnam has entered yet another era in its history of cultural control. Forget apparatchiks with comb-overs and coordinated suits trying to protect the revolution against degenerate thought. The people who now run Vietnam\u2019s publishing houses, film festivals and cultural exchange programs are artists \u2014 many of whom were once censored under Communism \u2014 and they have been co-opted by the lure of condos, cars and washing machines. In the 1990s, Dang Xuan Hoa was noted for making paintings featuring traditional ceramic pots or hand-carved wooden furniture set upside down or lying askew; critics argued that the disarray in the compositions defied the Communists\u2019 insistence on rosy depictions of society. Today, Mr. Hoa\u2019s friends and colleagues wonder about his role as an officer of the Artists\u2019 Union, which vets exhibitions and performances. A writer whose stories decrying the lack of decency in contemporary Vietnam were once banned is now a state editor for TV and film scripts. Ten years ago, she would complain about the cost of making a cellphone call; she now rides around in a chauffeured S.U.V. Other writers tell me she O.K.\u2019s scripts in exchange for bribes, using her connections with state authorities to bypass restrictions. One gallery owner describes how customs officials and intermediaries invoke vague cultural proscriptions to prevent her from bringing into the country, or sending out, unconventional artwork. Yet for the right amount of cash, they will let almost any piece through. In the old Communist days, strict party discipline limited bribery. Today, corruption is rampant, and censorship has become a pretext for extortion. This breeds a curious kind of self-censorship. Artists must choose either to produce noncontroversial, commercial works and pay up, or resign themselves to doing what they want for a tiny audience. Mainstream art is dumbing itself down while truly experimental or critical work is becoming increasingly marginal. The more avant-garde groups \u2014 like the film studio DocLab, the artists\u2019 collective Nha San Studio, the music school and performance group Dom Dom \u2014 protect their activities from official scrutiny and bribery by registering as design companies and nonprofit organizations, and working closely with foreign embassies. Other artists go overseas. Lai Thi Dieu Ha and Nguyen Phuong Linh, two young female painters and performance artists whose works focus on modernization, displacement and repressed sexuality, are better known abroad than in Vietnam. The same goes for the painter and performer Tran Luong and the painter and experimental musician Nguyen Manh Hung, two committed critics of Communism. For a time, the country\u2019s embrace of capitalism seemed to promise greater freedom for the production of art. But under Vietnam\u2019s new artists/censors, the profit motive is proving even more stifling than political propaganda. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Protecting Hong Kong\u2019s Autonomy", "Date": "2014-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialIn 1997, when Britain returned Hong Kong to China, the United States stressed the need to ensure that the semiautonomous city would maintain a vigorous rule of law and a free market. \u201cWe will be watching it very closely,\u201d Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said then. Some 17 years later, such vigilance is as important as ever given growing concerns about press freedoms as well as interference from China in Hong Kong\u2019s internal affairs. The responsibility to speak out against these trends falls mostly on Britain, which signed a joint agreement with China outlining a formula of \u201cone country, two systems\u201d that let Hong Kong keep its free-market economy, legal system and other rights alongside the mainland\u2019s repressive Communist system. The United States has also promised to promote the city\u2019s autonomy.One major concern involves the election of the city\u2019s next leader. Although China promised to allow direct elections for the first time in 2017, it has indicated that it will limit the names on the ballot by retaining some version of Hong Kong\u2019s existing nominating committee. The panel is dominated by Beijing loyalists, and it is virtually certain that whatever replaces it would undermine popular will by ensuring only China-approved candidates. To its credit, the Obama administration has endorsed \u201cprogress toward genuine universal suffrage\u201d as laid out in the Basic Law, Hong Kong\u2019s de facto constitution. But Britain lamentably has been less inclined to speak out.The other concern involves press freedoms. In February, the Committee to Protect Journalists reported that China sometimes puts direct pressure on Hong Kong news media, while in other cases, journalists engage in self-censorship by curtailing reporting they fear would anger the government or prompt businesses to pull advertising. Recent attacks on media executives have raised alarms about the safety of journalists. Last month, two executives planning to launch a newspaper later this year were attacked by men with iron bars; in February, the former chief editor of the newspaper Ming Pao was critically wounded by knife-wielding assailants. Although police said they arrested two suspects in the February attack, most assaults on journalists have gone unsolved. Hong Kong\u2019s position as a Chinese city with a free press and other rights has been central to its cultural vitality and success as a free-market economy. Ensuring it stays that way is in the interest of China, the business community and the West. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Utilities and Technology Help Shares End 3-Day Slide", "Date": "2014-04-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe stock market rose modestly on Tuesday, breaking its three-day losing streak. The rebound came as investors picked up stocks that had fallen the most over the previous three days. Utility stocks also rose sharply as skittish investors bought less volatile shares.\u201cLonger-term investors should really use this as an opportunity to buy attractive areas that have sold off,\u201d said Kristina Hooper, United States investment strategist at Allianz Global Investors. \u201cFor them, stocks are on sale.\u201dThe market has been volatile in April. After the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index reached a high last Wednesday, reflecting optimism about the improving outlook for the economy, stocks fell sharply on Friday as investors decided that some of the highflying stocks in technology and biotechnology no longer justified their lofty valuations.On Tuesday, the S.&P. 500 rose 6.92 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,851.96. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 10.27 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to close at 16,256.14. The Nasdaq composite index rose 33.23 points, or 0.8 percent, to 4,112.99. Even as investors sent stocks higher, they were still cautious. Investors typically buy utilities when they are worried about volatility. That is because those companies pay big dividends and the demand for the power they generate tends to be stable, regardless of how the economy is doing.On Tuesday, utility companies rose 1.5 percent. The sector has gained 10.5 percent this year, making it by far the best-performing industry group in the S.&P. 500. Health care stocks are the next best performers, gaining 2.7 percent over the same period.Technology stocks and consumer discretionary stocks, among the biggest decliners in the three-day sell-off, also logged gains on Tuesday. Facebook rose $1.24, or 2.2 percent, to $58.19. Google\u2019s new class C shares rose $16.75, or 3.1 percent, to $554.90. The recent volatility is making it tough for investors looking to get back into stocks after switching to cash and bonds after the financial crisis and the recession, said Michael J. Mussio, a managing director with FBB Capital Partners, a wealth management company.Corporations start reporting first-quarter earnings this week, which should help stabilize the market, said Joe Quinlan, chief market strategist at U.S. Trust. Mr. Quinlan attributed the stock market\u2019s recent wobble to investors\u2019 nervousness before corporate earnings.Over all, corporate earnings are forecast to grow just 0.2 percent in the first quarter compared with a year earlier, according to S&P Capital IQ. That would be the weakest showing since the third quarter of 2009, when earnings fell 1.7 percent.\u201cSeems like every time we come up to earnings season, we get a little nervous,\u201d Mr. Quinlan said. \u201cThis will pass.\u201dAmong the stocks on the move, Whole Foods Market gained $1.09, or 2.2 percent, to $51.38 after analysts at UBS raised their price target for the stock to $70 from $62. Gilead Sciences fell $2.22, or 3.1 percent, to $70.01 after reports that Express Scripts, one of the largest domestic pharmacy benefits managers, planned to ask its clients to join a coalition that would stop using Gilead\u2019s Sovaldi, a treatment for hepatitis C, once a rival medicine was approved for use in the United States next year. The Dr Pepper Snapple Group fell $2.06, or 3.8 percent, to $51.62 after analysts at Wells Fargo Securities cut their outlook for the company\u2019s earnings.

The individuals will also be denied visas to enter the United States. Moreover, the United States will cut off the export or re-export of American-made products to 13 of the companies and deny export licenses for high-technology items that could contribute to Russia\u2019s military capabilities.The 17 firms targeted were all tied to Russian businessmen who were targeted in previous rounds of sanctions. Eleven of the companies are linked to Gennady N. Timchenko, including the Stroytransgaz Group, the pipeline construction arm of Gazprom, and the Volga Group, his private investment holding company. Mr. Timchenko was a co-founder of the Gunvor Group, a commodities trading firm in which the Treasury Department has previously said Mr. Putin has personal investments. Gunvor has adamantly denied that Mr. Putin has any financial ties to the company, and Mr. Timchenko has sold his shares in Gunvor.Three other firms targeted on Monday were tied to Arkady and Boris Rotenberg: InvestCapitalBank, SMP Bank and Stroygazmontazh. Three others were subsidiaries of Yuri V. Kovalchuk\u2019s Bank Rossyia: Abros, Zest and Sobinbank. The Treasury Department has referred to Mr. Kovalchuk as the personal cashier for Mr. Putin.Others targeted Monday were Dmitri N. Kozak, a deputy prime minister; Vyacheslav V. Volodin, a deputy chief of staff to Mr. Putin; Aleksei Pushkov, chairman of the international affairs committee of the State Duma, the lower house of Parliament; Oleg Belavantsev, appointed by Mr. Putin last month as presidential envoy overseeing the annexed Crimean Peninsula; and Yevgeny Murov, director of Russia\u2019s Federal Protective Service.Although administration officials said over the weekend that they also expected Aleksei B. Miller, the head of the energy giant Gazprom, to be targeted, he was not on Monday\u2019s list, but he may be added later.\u201cToday\u2019s targeted sanctions, taken in close coordination with the E.U., will increase the impact we have already begun to see on Russia\u2019s own economy as a result of Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine and from U.S. and international sanctions,\u201d Jacob J. Lew, the Treasury secretary, said in a statement.In imposing sanctions on Mr. Sechin, the administration has targeted a top partner of Exxon Mobil, which has multiple joint ventures with Rosneft. It is not known if Mr. Sechin has any assets in the United States to freeze, but he will no longer be permitted into the country to consult with his Exxon Mobil partners. Exxon Mobil had no comment on Monday.That the sanctions covered no large publicly listed Russian companies came as a relief to traders in Moscow. Russia\u2019s benchmark Micex index closed with a modest gain of 1.5 percent. \u201cIt looked to be on the light side\u201d of what the markets expected, said one banker in Moscow, speaking on the condition of anonymity. \u201cThis was more of a reminder that a new phase of sanctions is possible.\u201dAndrew E. Kramer contributed reporting from Moscow, and Mark Landler from Manila.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Panama Capitalizes on Glimmers of Resurgence", "Date": "2014-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPANAMA \u2014 At the tip of Punta Pac\u00edfica, a neighborhood in Panama covered with skyscrapers, a narrow bridge leads to a new 25-acre artificial island.The island, which covers 10 hectares, is the first part of a residential and marina development called Ocean Reef, originally announced in 1998 by Empresas ICA, a Mexican conglomerate. Today, Grupo Los Pueblos, a Panamanian company hired by Empresas ICA to develop the project, is handing over the first lots to buyers planning to build homes there.The project, with a marina and resort-style amenities, has all the elements of a development designed for international buyers seeking a second home. But of the 63 buyers so far, 56 are from Panama, said Alfredo Alem\u00e1n, executive vice president of Grupo Los Pueblos.Sales to foreign buyers dried up here after the 2008 global economic crisis. But developers like Mr. Alem\u00e1n are reviving their global marketing efforts amid signs of renewed interest from international buyers in a city that is often called the Miami of Latin America.In the residential market, \u201ca lot of the growth will come from existing multinationals that already have moved here,\u201d said Justin Boyar, who tracks the market for Jones Lang LaSalle, a property consulting firm.There is no central source of reliable real estate data in Panama. But agents say that prices increased 10 percent or more in the last year, with a jump in buyers from Venezuela, Colombia and North America. For example, apartments selling for $186 a square foot six months ago now are selling for $205 to $214 a square foot, said Duncan McGowan president of Punta Pacifica Realty, a local estate agent (Panama real estate is typically transacted in dollars.)The price increase is a contrast to the steady declines of recent years. After a building boom in which dozens of residential towers were completed, prices in many projects dropped 30 percent to 50 percent from 2008 to 2012, according to industry estimates. At the time, more than 300 towers were in the planning stages, under construction or recently completed in the city. More than 50 percent of the buyers in Trump Ocean Club \u2014 which opened in 2011 as the tallest building in Central America at 932 feet \u2014 forfeited their deposits rather than complete the purchase of units that had significantly dropped in value.Even as the global economy recovered, prices in the city were slow to rebound. And projects completed after the downturn have added more than 4,000 apartments to the market over the past three years, according to data tracked by Panama Equity, a local estate agency.Yet many say that they believe that the canal and mining projects will attract more buyers.\u201cI think there will be two Panamas: the Panama before the expansion of the canal and the Panama afterward,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Bern, president of Empresas Bern, one of the most prolific residential builders in the city along Avenida Balboa, the main road on the central city\u2019s waterfront.Industry supporters and local residents also hope that the completion of a long list of infrastructure projects will help ease the city\u2019s longstanding problems with sewage and traffic. A citywide subway system, the first in Central America, is scheduled to open this spring.\u201cThe biggest hope is that it will release us from the massive amount of cars on the road here,\u201d said Sandie Davis, a Seattle native who invested in real estate even before she moved to the city five years ago.In 2006, Ms. Davis paid a preconstruction price of $117,000 for a three-bedroom, 1,100-square-foot apartment in the Costa del Este, a fast-growing master-planned, 310-acre development a few miles outside the city center. She rented it out for $1,800 to $2,000 a month, finally selling it in 2012 for $180,000.Ms. Davis now lives in a 2,368-square-foot, two-bedroom apartment in an older building in Obarrio, the city\u2019s banking district, about a block from a new metro station. She paid $240,000 for the apartment, including the furniture, in 2009.With the market in decline at the time, \u201cit was a little bit of an emotional play,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cI\u2019d seen the apartment a year before and fell in love with it.\u201dMost of the new residential activity in the city has come from Costa del Este. Empresas Bern is shifting its emphasis to the newer area, said Mr. Bern, the company president.\u201cWe\u2019ve completed delivery of our last building on Avenida Balboa,\u201d he said.Development is also increasing in Panam\u00e1 Pac\u00edfico, a 3,450-acre project at the former Howard Air Force Base, on the west side of the Panama Canal. Developed by the British company London & Regional Properties, the project plans for more than 20,000 residential units as well as office and commercial space.So far, about 800 homes have been sold, most in the past two years, said Marco Ruiz, London & Regional\u2019s director of residential development. As for construction, 270 homes were built in 2013, with 600 scheduled for completion this year, he said.Eric Carrasco, a Panamanian who runs a tour company, recently purchased a four-bedroom, 3,330-square-foot home being built in Panam\u00e1 Pac\u00edfico. He says the new house will give his family a different life than what they now have in a congested Panama neighborhood.\u201cNow I drive my kids to school and it takes 45 minutes,\u201d Mr. Carrasco said. \u201cThere, they will be able to ride their bicycles to school.\u201dAbout 80 percent of the buyers in Panam\u00e1 Pac\u00edfico are Panamanian, but the developers expects international sales to account for a larger percentage in the future.\u201cWe know it\u2019s going to turn around,\u201d Mr. Ruiz said. \u201cThe demographics are there. They\u2019ve always been there.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Most G-7 Nations Still Trying to Recoup Lost Jobs", "Date": "2014-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ChartsMORE than six years after the Great Recession began, people in most industrialized countries are still less likely to be employed than they were before the downturn.\u201cThe recovery in the labor market has been exceptionally slow,\u201d Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, said in an appearance at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday, as she explained why the Fed continues to seek to stimulate the American economy.Figures compiled by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development that were released this week show that the United States is not the only nation experiencing a sluggish recovery in its labor market. By the end of 2013, among the major industrialized countries, only Germany and Japan had jobs for as high a percentage of the working-age population as they did at the end of 2007. In the United States, 71.6 percent of people from the age of 15 to 64 had a job at the end of 2007, the O.E.C.D. said, while only 67.8 percent were employed at the end of the first quarter of this year.The United States has experienced the largest decline in employment rate of any country in the Group of 7 industrialized nations, but it has also rebounded more than most of those countries from the lows reached in 2010.The figures in the accompanying charts show the changes for men and women in three groups of working-age people. The first is people ages 15 to 24, many of whom are still in school, and the last is those ages 55 to 64, some of whom are retired. The middle group, ages 25 to 54, is the prime working-age group. Those over 64, who are counted in the working-age population in figures released by the United States government, are not included, although some of them, of course, are working.Germany is the clear leader in labor market recovery. The percentage of young men with jobs is virtually the same now as it was at the end of 2007, but all groups of women, as well as men in the prime and older groups, are more likely to be employed. In Japan, the proportion of people with jobs has risen, but only because more women have gone to work. The percentage of men with jobs has declined in all three age categories. Among the hardest-hit economies are Greece and Ireland. In both, only 71 percent of prime-age men had a job at the end of 2013, compared with 92 percent in Japan, 88 percent in Germany and 83 percent in the United States. Countries with relatively low proportions of prime-age women working outside the home include Greece, at 51 percent, and Italy, at 58 percent. In Austria, Norway and Sweden, more than 80 percent of prime-age women have a job.Many European countries have had relatively low retirement ages, and some governments have sought to extend working lives, in part to reduce government spending on pensions. In the euro zone excluding Germany, the proportion of both men and women ages 55 to 64 with jobs has risen substantially since 2007 but remains well below the employment rates of the same group in other major countries, including Britain, Japan and the United States.

{"Headline": "Delaware Is Building a Strategy to Lift Some Cities\u2019 Economies", "Date": "2014-04-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWILMINGTON, Del. \u2014 Hoping to generate interest in rejuvenating urban areas, Delaware\u2019s governor wants to offer modest development grants for proposed projects in 15 districts around the state.In an announcement this month, Gov. Jack Markell said the state would cover up to 20 percent of the construction costs for builders, investors, nonprofits or homeowners who develop properties in designated downtown districts in those cities.The program, which requires the approval of the state Legislature, aims to revitalize city centers that have been losing jobs and residents since the recession but are now, like many others around the country, increasingly favored by people who want easier access to jobs, shops and restaurants than they would get in the suburbs.\u201cReorienting state growth strategies to incentivize urban living is especially important in a small state,\u201d Mr. Markell, a Democrat, said. \u201cThe more spread out we are, the more costly it is for taxpayers.\u201dGovernor Markell, who plans to cut spending to fill a projected $40 million operating budget gap in the 2015 fiscal year, said the program would provide only $7 million in development grants in its first year.But he hopes to spur much greater private investment, as seen in the development of Wilmington\u2019s Christina riverfront, where a multiyear investment of about $150 million in public money has helped attract \u201chundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars\u201d in private money, he said.\u201cI can\u2019t make any commitments about what the dollar figure will be in the future, but I would certainly like to see it grow,\u201d Governor Markell said in an interview at World Cafe Live at the Queen, a live music club and former vaudeville theater that was vacant from 1959 to 2011. It is now among a growing number of renovated properties on Market Street in central Wilmington.The program would also offer help to designated districts from state agencies like the transportation department, which would give priority to projects in those areas, or the housing authority, which would offer additional incentives to buy and renovate abandoned homes.Some tax credits for the preservation of historic buildings would be reserved for projects in the new development districts.State Senator Margaret Rose Henry, the lead sponsor of a bill to put the program in place, said some Wilmington neighborhoods were \u201changing by a thread\u201d and could be helped by the proposal.State officials will designate the districts where the grants will be awarded after screening applications from municipalities. Grants will be awarded on the basis of a district\u2019s economic health, whether it is suffering from urban blight and whether a city is helping attract a project with its own incentives.Governor Markell predicted that the plan, which was modeled on one started by Virginia in 2005, would be approved by state lawmakers by the end of June. Municipalities would then take 60 to 90 days to submit their applications for designated districts, after which state officials would evaluate submissions over the following 30 to 60 days.Rob Buccini, a developer based in Wilmington, said redevelopment of older neighborhoods like the one on Wilmington\u2019s Market Street depended on help from public sector financing because developers\u2019 returns on investment are significantly lower for renovated older buildings than for new buildings in suburban locations.Mr. Buccini, who is co-president of the Buccini/Pollin Group, said only about two-thirds of the space in a typical older building is rentable, compared with up to 85 percent in a new suburban apartment block.He predicted that state financing of 20 percent of construction costs in development districts would entice the private sector to fund the rest. \u201cThe program will be sufficient to get the 80 percent of private dollars that are needed,\u201d he said in an interview.He said that Wilmington\u2019s apartment market now had around 95 percent occupancy and that demand had increased for office and retail space in the last six months.Still, about a third of the properties on Wilmington\u2019s Market Street remain vacant or underused and are unlikely to attract private investment without state money, now that a $15 million city program has expired, Mr. Buccini said.\u201cVery few projects will occur if legislation is not passed,\u201d he said.The governor will initially designate at least one but not more than three districts, which would include one from each of Delaware\u2019s three counties, for inclusion in the program. After the initial phase, no more than 15 districts can participate at one time.The grants would be available to investors who spent at least $25,000 on a property, which could be residential, commercial, industrial or mixed-used developments.David Scolnic, a real estate lawyer with the Philadelphia firm Hangley Aronchick Segal Pudlin & Schiller, said the Delaware plan, like those that have preceded it in other states, might revitalize designated districts but was likely to do so at the expense of other areas of any city that did not already have a strong economy.He said that while new buildings resulting from the incentive program could attract tenants, without independent sources of job creation, the new occupants were likely to move from nearby neighborhoods, resulting in no net gain to the local economy.Wilmington is an example of an anemic local economy that is unlikely to benefit from the program, Mr. Scolnic said.\u201cWe are not going to have a massive influx of people to offices and retail space,\u201d Mr. Scolnic said. \u201cThe overall occupancy of the city and the state isn\u2019t going to change because of this. It will be a big shell game.\u201dBut the program could benefit any city whose economy is already growing because the new construction would offer new jobs, he said. \u201cIf you told me that the fundamentals are strong, the program could make the tipping point,\u201d he said.Andrew Lippstone, the governor\u2019s chief legal counsel, said Wilmington\u2019s economy was underpinned by jobs in banking and corporate law and was well-placed to benefit from the new measures.The initial financing of $7 million is expected to be significantly multiplied by privately leveraged funds, Mr. Lippstone said. He said the Virginia program raised as much as $47 in private money for each $1 of grant funds.\u201cWe believe $7 million can make a real difference given the small number of districts, the small size of those districts and the ability to leverage private dollars,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In the U.S., Punishment Comes Before the Crimes", "Date": "2014-04-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneFew things are better at conveying what a nation really cares than how it spends its money. On that measure, Americans like to punish.The United States spent about $80 billion on its system of jails and prisons in 2010 \u2014 about $260 for every resident of the nation. By contrast, its budget for food stamps was $227 a person.The nation\u2019s unique strategy on crime underscores the distinct path followed by American social and economic institutions compared with the rest of the industrialized world.Scholars don\u2019t have a great handle on why crime fighting in the United States veered so decidedly toward mass incarceration. But the pivotal moment seems to have occurred four decades ago.\u201cWith few and isolated exceptions, the rehabilitative efforts that have been reported so far have had no appreciable effect on recidivism,\u201d he wrote. Standard rehabilitation strategies, he suggested, \u201ccannot overcome, or even appreciably reduce, the powerful tendency for offenders to continue in criminal behavior.\u201dCrime was rising in the 1960s and 1970s, alarming the public and increasing the risk to politicians of appearing \u201csoft\u201d on crime.The decline in manufacturing employment, once the backbone of many urban economies, wasn\u2019t helping. Later, in the 1980s and \u201990s, crack cocaine became a scourge of the nation\u2019s inner cities.But as Steven Raphael of the University of California, Berkeley, and Michael A. Stoll of the University of California, Los Angeles, note in their book \u201cWhy Are So Many Americans in Prison?,\u201d what drove up imprisonment rates was not crime but policy.If rehabilitation was out of reach, the thinking went, all that was left was to remove criminals from society and, through harsh sentencing, deter future crime. From 1975 through 2002, all 50 states adopted mandatory sentencing laws, specifying minimum sentences. Many also adopted \u201cthree strikes\u201d laws to punish recidivists. Judges lost the power to offer shorter sentences.And the prison population surged. Four decades ago, the correctional population in the United States was not that dissimilar from the rest of the developed world. Less than 0.2 percent of the American population was in a correctional institution. By 2012, however, the share of Americans behind bars of one sort or another had more than tripled to 0.7 percent.Bruce Western of Harvard suggests a specific American motivation, which sprang to some degree from the victories of the civil rights movement.\u201cThe crime debate was racialized to an important degree,\u201d Professor Western told me. \u201cThe anxieties white voters felt were not just about crime but about fundamental social changes going on in American society.\u201dGrowing inequality, too, appears to have played a role. As Devah Pager of Harvard told me: \u201cThere is something to the idea that the more distant the rich become to the poor, the easier it is to impose policies that are more punitive than others.\u201dProfessor Raphael is wary of linking incarceration with income dynamics. Still, he agrees the trends are suspiciously similar. \u201cIn the 1970s, something changes,\u201d he told me. \u201cThe increasing concentration of income at the top follows the incarceration rate almost perfectly.\u201dThe United States had another singularity: a comparatively small welfare state that struggled to address social and economic dislocation. \u201cThe criminal justice system became the only effective institution that could bring order and manage urban communities,\u201d Professor Pager said.Prison, according to Professor Western, \u201cbecame a last resort for a whole variety of social failures.\u201d Whether it is caused by problems with mental health, drug abuse or unemployment, he said, \u201call the people that slip through the safety net and end up in crime end up in the prison system.\u201dWhat did we get from this? Crime rates have fallen by almost half since 1990, to the lowest level since the early 1970s. But that may have little to do with mass incarceration. Demographic trends \u2014 there are simply fewer young men around \u2014 help explain much of the decline. Some states, like New York, have managed to reduce crime even while cutting the prison population through better policing.Indeed, a growing body of research has concluded that the costs of the strategy are much steeper than prisoners\u2019 room and board.More than half of inmates have minor children. Their children are almost six times as likely to be expelled or suspended from school. Family incomes fall 22 percent during the years fathers are incarcerated.California \u2014 which had to release tens of thousands of prisoners in 2011 and 2012 to reduce prison crowding \u2014 offers a perspective into what life might be with a more lenient approach.According to calculations by Professors Raphael and Stoll, there were 1.2 more auto thefts for every prison year not served. Violent crime wasn\u2019t affected at all.Extrapolating to a national scale, they estimated that reducing the imprisonment rate by 20 percent would lead to 121 new property crimes for every 100,000 Americans, a 5 percent increase over 2012.This is a price American voters, and their elected officials, might be willing to pay \u2014 especially if they can save money on prisons.Even Southern states that traditionally locked up criminals for as long as possible, like Georgia and Kentucky, have begun to experiment with cheaper, less punitive alternatives.These changes could turn around the imprisonment juggernaut. After rising relentlessly for three decades, the nation\u2019s incarceration rate hit a peak in 2008 and started gradually to decline. In 2011 and 2012, the total correctional population actually shrank slightly.We might spend the savings on food stamps.Email: eporter@nytimes.com;\nTwitter: @portereduardo Advertisement"}

The report also discusses how some of those refugees might never enter Nepal proper, saying there are \u201cserious concerns that Nepal may at times forcibly return Tibetans to China.\u201dAny forced return of Tibetans at the border would be a violation of a \u201cgentleman\u2019s agreement\u201d between Nepal and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which runs a transit center for Tibetans in the Katmandu Valley. That agreement is aimed at guaranteeing Tibetans safe passage to India, which has a significant Tibetan refugee population.Many Tibetans have complained of repression \u2014 including torture and suppression of religious practices \u2014 under Chinese rule. Those who are caught having tried to enter Nepal or returning to Tibet after a trip to India are often held for weeks or months in detention and interrogated.Many Tibetans cross through Nepal to India to try to see the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of the Tibetans, who lives in the foothills of the Indian Himalayas, or to try to build a better life away from the confines of Tibet and China. There are about 20,000 Tibetans in Nepal.The flooding of parts of the Tibetan plateau with Chinese security forces since the Tibetan uprising of 2008 and greater cooperation between Chinese and Nepalese forces have resulted in a huge drop in the number of Tibetan refugees arriving in Nepal. In 2013, fewer than 200 refugees were recorded as having fled China to Nepal, compared with an annual average of 2,000 before 2008, Human Rights Watch said.Nepal was traditionally a haven for Tibetan refugees, but that is no longer the case, given China\u2019s economic influence in the region. Nepal, a poor, landlocked nation, relies on investment from China to help its economy. The government also tries to strengthen ties with China as a counterbalance to India.Shankar Prasad Koirala, a spokesman for the Ministry of Home Affairs, said in an interview on Tuesday that Nepal had never mistreated any refugees on Nepalese soil. \u201cThough we have yet to sign international treaties concerning refugees, we are behaving well to all refugees on humanitarian grounds,\u201d he said.Mr. Koirala said the government would investigate any security officials suspected of mistreating refugees.In recent years, Tibetans in Katmandu, the Nepalese capital, have complained of detentions by security forces during anti-China protests. Those forces break up rallies and sometimes prevent public gatherings on dates that the Chinese government considers sensitive, such as the Dalai Lama\u2019s birthday. Even celebrations of Tibetan culture can be shut down, refugees say.Tenzin Chokzin, 22, a Tibetan refugee in Katmandu, said in an interview last month that Tibetans in Nepal were often barred from performing in cultural programs. \u201cPolice vigilance has tightened after 2008,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are even forced to cancel our cultural programs organized in hotels.\u201dMr. Koirala said the Nepalese government could not tolerate any protests that might harm the interests of neighboring countries.Since 2009, more than 120 Tibetans in Chinese-ruled Tibet have set themselves on fire to protest Communist Party policies. In February 2013, a Tibetan monk in Katmandu, Drupchen Tsering, 25, died after setting himself on fire near a revered Buddhist stupa, or shrine, in Boudhanath, a Tibetan enclave. Tibetans in the area asked for the body, but officials ordered it cremated in the middle of the night, saying no family members had claimed it.The Human Rights Watch report said China decided to \u201csignificantly scale up its economic and political engagement with Nepal\u201d after the 2008 uprising. The culmination of those efforts was a January 2012 visit to Nepal by Wen Jiabao, then the Chinese prime minister.China has become a top foreign direct investor in Nepal, a move that is, according to the report, \u201cin part aimed at influencing Nepal\u2019s calculations about where its national interests lie.\u201dEdward Wong reported from Beijing, and Bhadra Sharma from Katmandu, Nepal.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "European Firms Seek to Minimize Russia Sanctions", "Date": "2014-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 With the showdown over Ukraine escalating and President Obama warning Moscow of a tough new round of sanctions, Russia and its allies in the European private sector are conducting a separate campaign to ensure that they can maintain their deep and longstanding economic ties even if the Kremlin orders further military action.European banks and businesses are far more exposed to the Russian economy than are their American counterparts. Trade between the European Union and Russia amounted to almost $370 billion in 2012, while United States trade with Russia was about $26 billion that year.As a result, they have lobbied energetically to head off or at least dilute any sanctions, making it hard for American and European political leaders to come up with a package of measures with enough bite to influence Moscow\u2019s behavior in Ukraine.In a statement on Friday, the White House said Mr. Obama had discussed Ukraine with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France and Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy. Mr. Obama said only that the leaders had \u201cagreed to work closely together, and through the G-7 and European Union, to coordinate additional steps to impose costs on Russia,\u201d and European governments, without being specific, signaled that they were ready to take some kind of action.On Friday evening, a senior Obama administration official said sanctions against more Russian individuals could be announced as early as Monday. Two Western officials said that the European Union would impose sanctions against 15 Russians.And late Friday night, the White House released a statement from the Group of 7, which said: \u201cWe have now agreed that we will move swiftly to impose additional sanctions on Russia.\u201cGiven the urgency of securing the opportunity for a successful and peaceful democratic vote next month in Ukraine\u2019s presidential elections,\u201d the statement added, \u201cwe have committed to act urgently to intensify targeted sanctions and measures to increase the costs of Russia\u2019s actions.\u201d The phone discussion among the leaders came at the end of a week in which executives of the giant Russian gas company, Gazprom, stumped across the European capitals, rallying support from customers and suppliers against increased tensions and making the case that Russia and Europe were long-term economic partners who should not let temporary crises cut their ties. Gazprom is 50 percent owned by the Russian government.\u201cSanctions will not help anybody, they would not just hurt Russia, but also Germany and Europe as a whole,\u201d Mr. Seele of Wintershall has said.Alexander Medvedev, the No. 2 at Gazprom, said that his company had done everything possible to keep gas flowing to both Ukraine and Europe, but that the time of a financial reckoning was near, alluding to the $18.5 billion that he said Ukraine owed. How, he asked, can a publicly traded company like Gazprom keep contractual promises and make needed investments with such a cash shortfall from a slippery customer? Perhaps, he suggested, Ukraine\u2019s Western friends would like to help meet these bills. About a quarter of the European Union\u2019s gas supplies originate in Russia. More than half of Russia\u2019s exports go to the European Union, and 45 percent of its imports come from the European Union, according to European statistics.No European industry has been as open in its support of Russia as the energy industry. Executives have publicly voiced skepticism about the effectiveness of sanctions, lobbied behind the scenes to head them off and traveled to Russia, on at least one occasion to pose with Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin. And the Russians, while publicly playing down the effects of sanctions, have been trying to exert influence in Brussels and elsewhere, lobbyists said.In an interview on Friday, Gerhard Roiss, the chief executive of the Austrian oil and gas supplier OMV, which has been working with Gazprom for five decades, said, \u201cYou cannot talk about sanctions if you don\u2019t know the outcome of sanctions.\u201d\u201cEurope has developed over the last 50 years into a region where we have a division of labor and a division of resources, and this means in concrete terms that energy is imported from Russia and products \u2014 automotive or machinery \u2014 are exported from European countries into Russia,\u201d he added.Mr. Roiss met with Gazprom\u2019s chief executive this week and reaffirmed their business ties. He pointed out that this was hardly the first political crisis the sides had faced. The year Russian gas first started flowing into Austria, 1968, was the same year the Soviets invaded the former Czechoslovakia. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a crisis situation several times, but if you see it over the 50 years, natural gas was not used as a weapon, and we should not use gas as a weapon,\u201d he said.Before the call between the European leaders and Mr. Obama, Ms. Merkel called Mr. Putin in what appeared to be a last warning to fulfill the accord reached in Geneva last week to reduce tensions in Ukraine. Minutes later, a Kremlin statement put a different spin on the call, saying that both Mr. Putin and Ms. Merkel had called for three-party talks on Russian gas supplies to Europe through Ukraine.Whether that was an indication that Mr. Putin now feared that tough sanctions loom \u2014 sanctions that Western leaders argue would inflict more harm on Russia\u2019s heavily oil- and gas-dependent economy than on Europe \u2014 was not clear.Mr. Medvedev\u2019s tour of Europe, and what he said was constant contact with the European Union\u2019s energy commissioner, Guenter Oettinger, suggested that Russian business was very worried about losing what it has carefully built.Do not forget, Mr. Medvedev urged Europe, that Gazprom has for decades \u2014 right through the Cold War and multiple East-West crises \u2014 been a reliable supplier. It has no intention of leaving customers in the lurch now.\u201cWe are not planning to cut gas to Ukraine,\u201d Mr. Medvedev said. \u201cWe just would like to receive payment for the gas that we are going to deliver.\u201dIn 2006 and especially 2009, when Ukraine and Russia were locked in disputes over natural gas prices, European customers experienced delivery shortfalls for which Gazprom blamed Ukraine\u2019s siphoning of supplies intended for Europe to meet its own domestic needs.\u201cThere never were, are not and won\u2019t be plans to cut\u201d delivery, Mr. Medvedev said of the current situation. For one thing, he added, \u201cwe are too much dependent on the cash flow from Europe.\u201dWhether that has bought much independence from the image of the Russian government is questionable. Pressure has risen markedly on German business since Joe Kaeser, the chief executive of Siemens, met Mr. Putin in late March. Mr. Kaeser was not admonished outright, but Ms. Merkel had a distinctly frosty face for him two days later when both attended a signing of new contracts with China.BP has a 19.75 percent stake in Rosneft, the Russian oil giant. \u201cWe\u2019re monitoring the situation, and clearly we\u2019re committed to our investment in Russia,\u201d said Toby Odone, a BP spokesman. \u201cPeople keep asking us to speculate what would happen if such and such a sanction were imposed, and we\u2019re not going to do that. As things stand, our interests in Russia have not been affected by the measures that have so far been imposed.\u201dMr. Roiss said he had spoken to officials \u201con the European level and on the national level.\u201d\u201cThis is not an issue of lobbying, it\u2019s an issue of saying what you think,\u201d he said. \u201cMy feedback from talking to politicians, wherever they are, is that people see that this is quite a broad issue, that one should not really mix too much into politics.\u201dAlison Smale reported from Berlin, and Danny Hakim from London.

{"Headline": "Sherpas Move to Shut Everest in Labor Fight", "Date": "2014-04-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKATMANDU, Nepal \u2014 Over the years, as Mount Everest attracted larger crowds of amateur climbers from the West, the Sherpas adjusted: to a slower ascent, to traffic jams, to bulging loads of gear. Every spring some new frustration would get them talking, then recede with the end of the season.This was the year that frustration boiled over. The avalanche that killed at least 13 Sherpas last Friday has prompted an extraordinary labor dispute, as Mount Everest\u2019s quiet workhorses took steps on Tuesday to shut down the mountain for the season, demanding that the government share proceeds from what has become a multimillion-dollar business.Tensions were coursing through Mount Everest\u2019s base camp on Tuesday after a rowdy meeting where, according to people who were present, two-thirds of the Sherpas opted to cancel planned ascents. As a few teams of climbers packed their bags and began the long journey out of the Himalayas, two veteran expedition leaders left the camp by helicopter for an emergency meeting with Nepalese officials in an effort to avert a shutdown.Mount Everest is now far more popular than most of the world\u2019s other high peaks, with as many as 600 people a year reaching the summit, more than half of them Sherpas, who are mostly members of a small ethnic group renowned for their skill at mountaineering.Foreign climbers pay professional Western guides as much as $100,000 to ease their path up the mountain. Altitude Junkies, for instance, charges $42,500 for a 60-day expedition, which includes extras like helicopter flights and \u201ctwo personal Sherpas on summit day.\u201d Of that, $11,000 goes to the Nepalese government for a climbing license, and issuing such licenses has netted the government $3 million to $4 million annually in recent years. Money also pours into the local economy, including hotel rooms, nights in teahouses, local cellphone use, and the hiring of yaks and porters to carry supplies up the mountain.\u201cClimbers actually say, \u2018I\u2019ve paid $50,000, you are here to work for me, and you have to accompany me,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he told an analyst studying Mount Everest. \u201cThe mountain itself feels like it is losing its value. Just about everyone seems to want to climb it by paying a Sherpa who will ensure reaching the summit.\u201d\u201cWhen it ended in the middle of town, they were very, very angry with the government,\u201d Mr. Bista, who is based in Katmandu, said in a telephone interview. \u201cThis time, it really is a crucial moment. If the government is not taking it seriously, there might be more agitation and fighting.\u201dBy Sunday night, some of the Sherpa guides at the base camp were advocating canceling the rest of the season\u2019s expeditions on Mount Everest, confronting international climbers with the prospect of abandoning plans that had cost them tens of thousands of dollars and had been years in the making. Many, in their initial comments on social media, were sympathetic to the Sherpas.He added, \u201cI would still like to climb this mountain, but there are things at stake more important than my selfish, arrogant and egotistical summit ambitions.\u201dBut various people at the camp, both foreigners and Nepalese guides, said tensions were growing as the prospect of abandoning the ascent became real.\u201cThere were so many Sherpas in numbers, and I think foreign climbers couldn\u2019t express what they want clearly,\u201d he added. Tendi Sherpa of the Nepal National Mountain Guide Association said 200 of the roughly 300 Sherpas at Tuesday\u2019s meeting were in favor of canceling all planned ascents. \u201cEveryone is working hard not to have any violence,\u201d he said.Other popular summits in Nepal, like Annapurna, were unaffected by the Sherpa agitation.A list of demands presented to Nepal\u2019s Ministry of Tourism gave officials until Monday to respond, according to Alan Arnette, a climbing expert who runs a respected mountaineering website. On Tuesday, the ministry announced that it would satisfy some of the demands put forward by Nepalese guides at the base camp, including raising minimum insurance rates for Sherpas to about $15,000, erecting a memorial to lost guides and creating a relief fund from climbers\u2019 fees to help support the families of the dead.Some groups were already leaving the base camp on Tuesday, including about 30 of the 341 foreign climbers on the mountain, Mr. Arnette said. But most, he added, were waiting to see the results of negotiations between the guides and the government.Tenzing Sherpa, 28, was among those who did not wait. In his group of five climbers, there were two Sherpas who no longer wanted to climb the mountain. He described watching on Friday as helicopters lifted the bodies of the dead tethered to a rope. He said he unhooked the bodies of the dead one by one.\u201cThat really shook the local people,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have never seen this much.\u201d Although he had heard of the government\u2019s concessions on Tuesday, he was skeptical. \u201cIt\u2019s Nepal,\u201d he said. \u201cUnless you see the money with your eyes, you can\u2019t be sure.\u201dMr. Crampton, a British-born expedition leader who has ascended Mount Everest 11 times, said he was hoping that he and his clients would also not be forced to leave camp. If this season\u2019s ascents were canceled, he said, the government would keep fees already paid, and the fear of losing future investments could deter foreign climbers for years to come.At an emergency meeting scheduled for Wednesday morning, which will also be attended by Russell Brice, a veteran Mount Everest guide from New Zealand, Mr. Crampton said he planned to remind Nepalese officials that \u201cwe put an awful lot of money into the economy, and we feel that the Sherpas have been given a very, very hard time in the past.\u201d\u201cWe had a historic accident, and now we\u2019ve got a historic moment, where we could close down the whole season,\u201d Mr. Crampton said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m doing something I should have done a long time ago.\u201dGraham Bowley contributed reporting from New York, and Rajneesh Bhandari from Katmandu.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "South Korea\u2019s Struggle With Suicide", "Date": "2014-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBUSAN, South Korea \u2014 As the author of the novel \u201cI Have the Right to Destroy Myself,\u201d I\u2019m often asked why I think South Korea\u2019s suicide rate is so high. The protagonist in my story is a professional \u201csuicide counselor\u201d who is hired to help clients plan and execute their own deaths. I started writing the novel in 1995, a time when South Korea\u2019s annual rate of suicide was much lower than the average of the other industrialized nations. But it soared in the wake of the 1997 Asian financial crisis \u2014 and it has been getting worse ever since. When the novel was published in 1996 no one, including me, would have thought that suicide could become such a scourge. South Korea has had the highest suicide rate in the industrialized world for eight consecutive years; 14,160 people committed suicide in 2012, an average of 39 people per day and a 219 percent increase from the 6,444 suicides in 2000. It\u2019s the No.1 cause of death for people between the ages of 10 and 30. For people in their 40s, suicide is the second most common cause of death, after cancer. Among the older generations, the numbers are even more bleak. Suicide is everywhere. I was having a drink with a friend at a bar in Seoul recently and the young bartender asked us if we thought the weather would permit boats trips the next day. Her brother had killed himself a year ago, she said, and her family was planning to take a boat into the harbor, where they had scattered his ashes, for the anniversary. Then my old friend told me that our college classmate, who we had all thought died of a heart attack, had actually committed suicide. Now, whenever I hear news that a young person has passed away, suicide is the first possibility that comes to mind. The \u201cBridge of Life\u201d campaign is a typical example of the authorities\u2019 misguided approach to the epidemic. Mapo Bridge, which cuts across the Han River in Seoul, had so many people throwing themselves over the side to their deaths that it became known as the \u201cSuicide Bridge.\u201d In 2012, the Seoul government and Samsung Life Insurance initiated a joint project to transform the \u201cSuicide Bridge\u201d into the \u201cBridge of Life.\u201d An advertising firm invited the public to suggest greetings that were put on illuminated panels above the guardrails of the bridge. The panels would light up as people approached the railings, greeting pedestrians with phrases like, \u201cI know it\u2019s been hard for you\u201d and \u201cHow are you today?\u201d A year later, the suicide rate off the Mapo Bridge was six times higher. Instead of deterring suicide, the \u201cBridge of Life\u201d campaign attracted suicides. Just a few days ago, the security team for a big-budget Hollywood production found the body of a 21-year-old man in the water underneath the Mapo Bridge during filming; he had been dead for two weeks. According to research by the department of Family Medicine at Hallym University, some 60 percent of people who attempt suicide are suffering from depression. Yet too many people in South Korea have outdated views of psychological illness. Many think that when someone is suicidal he simply lacks a strong will to live; he\u2019s weak. There\u2019s little sympathy or interest in probing below the surface. And it\u2019s not easy to get therapy for depression in South Korea, where there is still strong societal resistance to psychological treatment. Kim Eo-su, a professor of psychiatry at Yonsei Severance Hospital, told me: \u201cOne out of three depression patients stops mid-treatment. One of the biggest issues is that many patients think they can overcome depression on their own through a religious life or through exercise.\u201d Many people who seek psychiatric treatment are afraid of doctors keeping records. There was a rumor going around recently among married women that having a record of treatment or medication for depression could mean losing custody of your children if your husband were ever to sue for divorce. Satisfactory explanations for the root causes of the epidemic are hard to come by. For the elderly, many analysts cite the breakdown of the traditional family unit, and the poor economy. Among the youth, the pressure over college entrance examinations is often blamed. And for the middle-aged, it\u2019s uncertainty about the economy. But no matter what the age, too many South Koreans see suicide as a viable escape from the stresses of modern life. That attitude has to change. The good thing is that a shift is underway at the local level. In 2013, Busan became the first city in the country to begin monitoring people at high risk for suicide. And psychiatric specialists started studying the mental environment of people who committed suicide by conducting in-depth interviews with their survivors. Busan officials cited the example of Finland, where the authorities implemented a similar system in 1992, when that nation\u2019s suicide rate was among the highest in the world. Using this kind of program, they managed to reduce suicides by 40 percent. Following Busan\u2019s lead, Incheon set up a comprehensive project for suicide prevention with the goal of reducing the suicide rate by 20 percent. On the national level, the government is starting to address the problem. But the effort is still too weak: The total national budget for suicide services is close to $7 million. By comparison, Japan spends more than $130 million on suicide programs, and they have seen strong results for their efforts. Today, I could never write a suicide-filled novel like \u201cI Have the Right to Destroy Myself.\u201d I would be too afraid of inspiring others to kill themselves. I look forward to the day when a writer like me can once again comfortably use suicide as the stuff of fiction. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Bond Funds Think Outside the Box", "Date": "2014-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUNCONSTRAINED bond funds can own debt instruments of any type \u2014 long- or short-term, high- or low-quality, corporate or government or whatever, in any country and currency \u2014 to try to enhance returns. With interest rates near record lows and investors eager to bolster yields, enthusiasm for these portfolios, also known as nontraditional funds, seems boundless too.The level of assets in nontraditional bond funds tracked by Morningstar rose about 80 percent last year, to $123 billion. They continued to attract fresh money early this year, reaching $132 billion in assets at the end of February. How richly have shareholders been rewarded for these funds\u2019 ability to go anywhere in search of the best performance? Not very. The average nontraditional bond fund returned 0.3 percent last year and 1.1 percent in the first quarter of 2014.Unconstrained can mean unprofitable, it turns out, and it can mean riskier too, versus conventional bond funds, investment advisers warn. While the freedom to hold any type of bond can make unconstrained funds valuable portfolio additions, it\u2019s essential to use the freedom wisely, they say. Some managers may be taking on too much risk to satisfy investors who are fed up with the low income of many bonds.\u201cPeople tell us they\u2019re not looking at regular bonds; they want unconstrained. They want 5 to 6 percent yields,\u201d said Laird Landmann, co-director of fixed income at the TCW fund management company. \u201cIt\u2019s an end-of-cycle dynamic. When people are reaching for yield, it\u2019s a warning sign that they want to take more risk at the wrong time. I\u2019m not sure that unconstrained funds will protect investors if the cycle turns.\u201dRunning unconstrained funds is tricky: They are effective only if managers are imaginative in allocating assets and are neither too bold nor too timid.\u201cSome funds might have wanted to benefit from the idea of being unconstrained, especially in 2013, when the average bond fund lost money,\u201d said Todd Rosenbluth, director of fund research at S&P Capital IQ, part of Standard & Poor\u2019s. \u201cIn theory, these funds can go anywhere, but whether they do,\u201d and where they go, needs to be examined case by case, he said.\u201cThe average unconstrained fund is a simple bond fund,\u201d he said. \u201cIt gives the manager leeway to do what he wants, but there\u2019s not a lot of creativity in most of them.\u201d For a fund to be truly unconstrained, in his view, it would have to be able to do more than just go into any market. It would also have to be able sell bonds short to bet on falling prices and use derivative instruments to hedge exposure to different risks, like rising interest rates or falling currencies. Where Mr. Izenstark finds too much creativity is among debt issuers who he contends are dumping paper of dubious quality, including securitized subprime mortgages, the scourge of the 2007-9 financial crisis, on credulous investors.\u201cYou have to be very careful in some of these spaces,\u201d he warns. \u201cPeople want it, so you have someone make it, even if it\u2019s absolute garbage. These things that are coming out, it\u2019s not that it\u2019s not a great time to be in them. It\u2019s a great time to sell them.\u201d \u201cUnconstrained funds are supposed to have strategies that provide high returns and protect you from trouble,\u201d he said, \u201cbut 50 percent of the universe is just credit funds or equity funds in another guise.\u201d The unconstrained fund of which he is a co-manager has lower exposure to high-yield debt than other funds in the category, Mr. Landmann said. The ability of managers to own anything can make it hard for investors who are still interested in this niche to choose a suitable fund.\u201cEverything unconstrained goes in the same box,\u201d Mr. Rosenbluth said, \u201cbut unconstrained, by definition, does not go in a box.\u201dThat makes it vital to inspect the contents before buying.\u201cTry to understand where they\u2019re investing,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you combine it with other bond funds, you need to know how it fits in. Are its holdings long- or short-term, government or credit, U.S. or foreign? Understand where they\u2019ve gone most recently and how quick the turnover is.\u201d\u201cOne of the keys to using an unconstrained fund is to understand the organization behind it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need one that can pull the trigger on all those pieces \u2014 high yield, emerging markets, bank debt.\u201dHe pointed out, though, that such grand scope has drawbacks. \u201cYou need size for economies of scale and research capability,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you need to be small enough not to move markets.\u201dThe BlackRock and Putnam funds have annual expenses of less than 1 percent on at least one share class with a minimum investment of $10,000 or less, and a retail share class of the MainStay fund has annual expenses of 1.3 percent. The corresponding figures are 1.4 percent for the J.P. Morgan fund, 1.3 percent for the Pimco fund, 1.2 percent for the Iron fund and 1 percent for the Metropolitan West fund.Mr. Landmann warns that this isn\u2019t a time for bond funds or their shareholders to take on undue risk. \u201cThe time to be aggressive in a nontraditional fund was a year or two ago,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s time to be conservative. The traditional way to protect yourself from a turn in the credit cycle is long-duration Treasury bonds. That\u2019s still true; it\u2019s probably the best hedge.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Early Count in Indonesia Favors Largest Opposition Party", "Date": "2014-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 Out of power for 10 years, Indonesia\u2019s largest opposition party was leading unofficial vote tallies from Wednesday\u2019s national legislative elections, as the country\u2019s focus now quickly turns to a presidential election in July.But if the final results from Wednesday are borne out, it will nonetheless be a disappointing showing for the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle, according to analysts, who noted that the party had been hoping to ride the coattails of the presumptive presidential candidate, Joko Widodo, the popular governor of Jakarta, to gain as much as 30 percent or more of the popular legislative vote.The opposition party, known as the P.D.I.P., was garnering 19 to 20 percent of the vote in a 12-party contest, according to independent quick counts of official results conducted by Saiful Mujani Research and Consulting, a joint count by the Jakarta-based Center for Strategic and International Studies and Cyrus Network, and Indikator Politik Indonesia.The twelve political parties competed for seats in the House of Representatives and in provincial and district legislatures, as well as in the Regional Representative Council, a second national parliamentary body that proposes and advises on bills related to Indonesia\u2019s many far-flung regions.The quick counts also indicated that the Golkar Party, the political vehicle of the autocratic President Suharto, was, as expected, battling for second place with 14 percent of the vote against the opposition Great Indonesia Movement Party, known as Gerindra, with around 12 percent.The P.D.I.P. has not placed first in any election since 1999, when Indonesia held its first free and fair polls in more than 40 years. Its chairwoman is Megawati Sukarnoputri, a former president and leader of the political dynasty built by her father, Sukarno, the country\u2019s revered founding father.\u201cObviously it\u2019s quite a big disappointment,\u201d said Marcus Mietzner, a senior lecturer at Australian National University and author of \u201cMoney, Power, and Ideology: Political Parties in Post-Authoritarian Indonesia.\u201d\u201cIt is really at the low end of what they hoped for, and what that means of course is they have to completely change the strategy of the coalition they will try to build,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were aiming for a smaller coalition.\u201dUnder Indonesia\u2019s complex presidential nominating system, a party must win 20 percent of the 560-seat national House of Representatives, or 25 percent of the popular vote, to nominate a presidential candidate, or it may form a coalition with other parties to reach either threshold. While final official results could ultimately push the P.D.I.P. past the 20 percent threshold on its own, analysts said the party would be forced to try to form a coalition in the coming weeks with a hodgepodge of parties that fared less well on Wednesday \u2014 including other secular-nationalist and even Islamic-based parties \u2014 to secure 51 percent of the House to have a commanding position before July\u2019s presidential election.President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono cannot seek a third term, meaning Indonesians will be choosing a new leader for the first time in 10 years.Mr. Joko still holds a strong lead in respected national polls and has promised a \u201cmore people-centric\u201d style of government in a country rife with official corruption and poverty. Indonesia, while belonging to the Group of 20 major economies, still has more than 100\u2009million people living on $2 a day or less.However, Mr. Joko, a former mayor in Central Java Province who improbably shot to national political stardom after winning the Jakarta governorship in September 2012, will nonetheless go into the forthcoming presidential election campaign with less luster.\u201cI think those people who had hoped that he would be given the instruments to implement fundamental reform \u2014 and that instrument was a small, coherent coalition \u2014 they will be disappointed because he will have to include parties in his coalition that he had no intention to include. That will impact his ability to institute fundamental reforms,\u201d Mr. Mietzner said.On Wednesday night, Mr. Joko himself acknowledged while addressing reporters on national television that his P.D.I.P. would need other parties, but he warned that they should remember their place: \u201cWe don\u2019t like the word \u2018coalition.\u2019 It sounds like power-sharing.\u201dMrs. Megawati, who had harbored presidential ambitions herself, put off officially declaring Mr. Joko, popularly known as \u201cJokowi,\u201d the party\u2019s presidential candidate until shortly before the official campaign period began in March, a delay that analysts said prevented the party from using his popularity for maximum benefit.He said the initial results appeared to show that the votes were widespread among both secular-nationalist and Islamic-based parties. The Islamic parties were not expected to do well. He said there was a general public dissatisfaction with the performance of the country\u2019s democratic system, which remains rife with official corruption some 16 years after the fall of Mr. Suharto\u2019s 32-year government in 1998.This includes a series of scandals during the past five years in the national legislature, Mr. Yudhoyono\u2019s own cabinet and even within his governing Democratic Party, which quick counts indicated had crashed from 21 percent in 2009 to only around 10 percent on Wednesday.\u201cI think the performance of political parties, as everyone knows, is not so good,\u201d Mr. Ramlan said. \u201cThe news about corruption leads to perceptions that politicians don\u2019t care. Swing voters are a remarkable 35 percent, so that might explain why P.D.I.P. did not do better.\u201dMr. Prabowo, who analysts said should be pleased with the election results given that his party is only six years old, also railed during the legislative election campaign against Mr. Yudhoyono\u2019s government, claiming it had sold out the country to foreign business interests.The quick counts, however, indicated that Mr. Prabowo may be compelled to form a coalition with other secular-nationalist parties \u2014 or even willing Islamic-based parties \u2014 that finished lower in Wednesday\u2019s polls just to reach the nominating threshold.Golkar\u2019s second place showing in the early results also suggests that it may be able to put a coalition together, but its declared presidential candidate, Aburizal Bakrie, is trailing well behind Mr. Joko and Mr. Prabowo, according to respected opinion polls.After the polls closed Wednesday, Mr. Aburizal posted on Twitter that the elections \u201cwent well, smoothly and peacefully,\u201d and said Golkar would accept the final results, which will not be officially released until May.More than 187\u2009million people were registered to vote at more than 450,000 polling stations on more than 7,000 islands across the vast Indonesian archipelago. Voter turnout was expected to be more than 70 percent, according to analysts.Voting was orderly on the top floor of a traditional market in South Jakarta that was converted into a polling station for the day, with residents only complaining about the multiple separate ballots for the various races.

{"Headline": "Adapting to a New Environment", "Date": "2014-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBehind the Wheel | 2014 Nissan RogueFor those of the mammalian persuasion, evolution has tended to be a leisurely process. This has not been the case among compact crossover utility vehicles, which in the last half-dozen years have made leaps in sophistication while adapting to a changing high-tech environment.Now the redesigned 2014 Nissan Rogue, with attributes that stand out in its class like a collision-warning system and LED headlights, is making new contributions to the crossover gene pool.\u201cThe segment is evolving and maturing at an incredibly fast pace,\u201d said Michael Bunce, Nissan\u2019s product planning director.Compact S.U.V.s were once seen as providing basic interim transportation, often until owners could afford a larger vehicle. But Nissan sees that changing. \u201cThis segment is becoming, really, the new all-purpose segment,\u201d said Scott Pak, Nissan\u2019s senior manager for product planning.In an email, Jeff Schuster, the senior vice president for forecasting at LMC Automotive, noted the segment\u2019s \u201ctremendous\u201d growth since 2007, when fewer than 1.5 million compact S.U.V.s were sold. LMC predicts 2014 sales of almost two million. The traffic jam of competitors includes the Chevrolet Equinox, Ford Escape, Honda CR-V, Hyundai Tucson, Kia Sportage, Mazda CX-5 and Toyota RAV4. When the Rogue was introduced as a 2008 model, it was aimed at buyers in their early 30s. Now Nissan also hopes to attract young families and empty nesters.Prices start at $23,350 for the front-wheel drive S; $25,090 for the SV and $28,930 for the fancy SL. All-wheel drive adds $1,350. The model I tested was an SL with all-wheel drive. Its $30,280 price included a long list of standard equipment from heated \u201cleather appointed\u201d seats to a navigation system and power liftgate. The $1,990 Premium Package included a huge sunroof, LED headlights, blind-spot monitor, lane-departure warning, forward-collision warning and moving-object detection. That brought the total to $32,395, not a surprising amount for a heavily equipped compact crossover.The Rogue has a new look, the most notable change being the substitution of a bold U-shape grille \u2014 a theme that will soon show up in other Nissans \u2014 for a toothy chrome version.The overall length of 182.3 inches, an inch shorter than last year, but a slightly longer wheelbase and clever packaging permitted significant interior improvements. There is now 37.9 inches of second-row legroom, a gain of 2.6 inches. That means a pair of 6-foot adults will fit in the back while two more are up front. An optional third row is new, priced at $1,190 on the least expensive Rogue. But it is hard to imagine how that seat could comfortably accommodate anyone but a small child or a sedated teen. Because the extra row takes room that would have gone to a compact spare tire, Rogues with that option get run-flat tires. 9 PhotosThere is 32 cubic feet of cargo space behind the second row, a gain of 3.1 cubic feet from last year. Shelves back there can be moved around, providing flexibility and tidiness.The interior has an upscale look, the controls are easy to use and there\u2019s adequate storage. The rear window is on the small side, making backing up a challenge. A solution is the Around View Monitor that shows the vehicle\u2019s front, back and flanks and is available with an object-detection system for bump-free parking. It is not available on the basic Rogue S.There\u2019s also some other optional safety technology that\u2019s unusual in this segment, such as lane-departure and forward-collision warnings.With the Rogue, Nissan\u2019s Common Module Family \u2014 a set of shared underpinnings for a range of vehicles \u2014 is making its debut in North America. Major components that were carried over, albeit with some improvements, include the suspension, the 4-cylinder engine and the all-wheel-drive system. The continuously variable transmission is a new unit shared with the 4-cylinder Altima. And the Rogue is now assembled in Smyrna, Tenn., rather than in Japan. The Rogue\u2019s original focus on driving entertainment has not diminished. Indeed, there are improvements because of technology not often found in this segment.Driven in a conservative manner on a two-lane, the Rogue feels competent and slightly nose-heavy. But when the driver starts to push harder, Nissan\u2019s \u201cactive trace control\u201d \u2014 standard on all versions \u2014 uses sensors and a computer to apply the brakes on individual wheels to help the vehicle turn more sharply. The steering lacks the road feel of the competitive Mazda CX-5, but it is wonderfully predictable and doesn\u2019t get lighter or heavier as the vehicle turns. Aim the Rogue through a turn and it is the soul of undeterred compliance.The body feels solid and ride motions are nicely controlled. But there is no free dynamic lunch: On a rough surface there\u2019s moderate jostling, although the Rogue manages to fend off the most hurtful impacts.The only transmission is the C.V.T., a Nissan favorite because it works to improve fuel economy by reducing engine speed when the car is not accelerating. The 2.5-liter engine has been carried over, and although it has been tweaked a bit it lacks the newest efficiency-improving feature, gasoline direct injection, which is found in the Tucson and CX-5. Consequently, the Rogue\u2019s 170-horsepower engine is challenged by the vehicle\u2019s 3,605-pound unloaded weight, providing only adequate acceleration despite audible distress. There\u2019s also a tiresome drone and vibration felt through the steering wheel whenever the engine hovers around 1,300 r.p.m.Fuel economy is significantly better for 2014. The front-drive model is rated at 26 miles per gallon in the city and 33 on the highway. The all-wheel-drive version is rated 25/32 m.p.g. In each case that\u2019s an improvement of 3 m.p.g. in town and 5 on the highway. Nissan recommends regular-grade fuel.Almost 648,000 last-generation Rogues were sold in the United States, making the new version an incredibly important vehicle for Nissan. Thus the company\u2019s decision not to use a new engine is puzzling. But like all automakers, Nissan has to consider the cost-benefit ratio.Nevertheless, there\u2019s a lot to appreciate about the new Rogue: more room, good fuel economy, impressive crash protection and a zestful approach to a mountain road. And all of that is available with the least expensive model, meaning there\u2019s no need to spend $30,000. That combination makes a pretty compelling argument in the Nissan\u2019s favor.Advertisement"}

At 30,000 feet, your skin is more likely to resemble a lizard\u2019s. But there are ways for business executives to look and feel polished when walking off a plane and into a boardroom.A decade after spa chains began sprouting in airport concourses, on-the-go grooming is reaching new heights, be it gate-side manicure stations or in-flight body lotion from Christian Dior.Many airports, having mastered selling extravagances like luxury handbags and silk ties, are now offering travelers rest, relaxation and exercise. \u201cPractically every major airport now has a spa,\u201d says a 2014 trends report from SpaFinder Wellness 365, an industry group.In the United States, spas are among the most popular airport amenities, second only to shoeshine stands, according to a 2013 study by the Global Gateway Alliance, a group that advocates for the improvement of New York area airports.And if you think this is a female-driven phenomenon, think again.\u201cMen do more facials, men do more massages,\u201d said Marisol Binn, the president and founder of XpresSpa, one of the largest international airport spa chains. Men are even the bulk of customers for the company\u2019s new hair services. \u201cSeventy-eight percent of it is men doing their hair,\u201d Ms. Binn said. \u201cThey\u2019re mostly business travelers. That\u2019s maybe why we get more men.\u201dThe services are not cheap \u2014 these are captive airport audiences, after all. But they fall within the typical range for pampering. An hourlong table massage at XpresSpa or one of its competitors, Be Relax, for instance, is $120. But Bliss, the midrange international spa chain, charges more than that for less time (49 minutes) in Manhattan.Basic manicures at the chains are about $30 to $35. That is indeed higher than at the many, many shops in New York City, where a manicure can be had for about $15 to $25.XpresSpa, which began 10 years ago with one location at John F. Kennedy International Airport, now has more than 50 locations worldwide, and a new one opens almost every week. The chain is also rolling out a variety of \u201cwellness\u201d amenities, including gate-side manicures and massages.Do not be surprised if in the future you see a curvy little cart with a built-in seat and tray being wheeled toward your gate. The \u201cPOD,\u201d as Ms. Binn calls it \u2014 for Pampering on Demand \u2014 includes enough sterilized equipment to perform as many as 10 manicures.Instead of water, the manicurist uses polish remover, cuticle cream and disinfectant. \u201cWe go to wherever the gate is full,\u201d Ms. Binn said.Inside the spas, offerings include hair washing, cutting and styling. XpresSpa is offering hair styling in Minneapolis, Miami, Philadelphia, Orange County, San Francisco and Los Angeles, and plans to have hair services at all of its new locations. \u201cThe only thing we don\u2019t do is color, anything that has an odor,\u201d Ms. Binn said.Other new services include table massages for travelers who prefer not to disrobe \u2014 in deference to the sensitivities and religious beliefs of some customers. The massage tables are out in the open, although privacy panels help block out the hubbub of passers-by.Even the spas themselves are being reinvented, moving from an earthy aesthetic of bamboo and beige tones to one that is sleek with stark white walls.Additionally, there will be a line of XpresSpa-branded travel products, including facial creams and foldable flip-flops. \u201cWe\u2019re working on nail polish,\u201d Ms. Binn said, \u201csomething that dries fast and applies easily.\u201dBe Relax \u2014 which offers massages, manicures and pedicures, facials and waxing from 10 minutes to an hour \u2014 is celebrating its 10th anniversary. The company, which has about 30 locations in six countries, has already opened new stores in Dubai and the United States this year and has plans for more.Full spas are not the only airport grooming option. This year Delta began testing services like manicures and chair massages in some of its clubs. The Centurion Lounges from American Express, which opened last year, offer manicures and other treatments for body, face and hands.At the same time, popular beauty brands are installing self-service machines. At Austin-Bergstrom International Airport in Texas, Benefit Cosmetics opened its first \u201cGlam Up & Away\u201d airport kiosk last year with 30 of the brand\u2019s best-selling products.In the air, many airlines are introducing new amenity kits. This month, Delta\u2019s economy-class customers on international flights longer than six hours will receive sleep kits that include an eyeshade and earplugs. Last year the airline introduced amenity kits for the intercontinental BusinessElite cabins of its international flights that include Malin & Goetz lip moisturizer and neroli-scented hand and body lotion in a case by Tumi, the luggage maker.Singapore Airlines recently introduced amenity kits for first-class and suite passengers on long-haul routes that include four different types of moisturizers by Sothys, the French beauty brand. On Air France, special limited-edition kits celebrate the airline\u2019s 80th anniversary. This summer, the airline will introduce a business-class kit inspired by those once distributed onboard the Concorde. Shaped like a portfolio, the kit will be filled with Clarins products. \u201cWe will have the new comfort kit in several colors,\u201d said Maxime Patula, a spokesman for Air France. United Airlines has also been doling out limited-edition kits in business class. The containers, meant as souvenirs and made of a type of steel, feature different designs for each of the airline\u2019s eight North American hubs. Last year, Cathay Pacific introduced kits for business-class passengers on long-haul flights that include products like day cream, lip balm and citrus hand cream by Jurlique, the Australian natural skin care brand. In first class, passengers receive skin care and toiletries by Aesop, another Australian brand.Qatar Airways offers business-class travelers lip balm, hand cream and eau de toilette and perfume by Salvatore Ferragamo, while those in first class began receiving serums and creams by Dior. (For the youngest elite travelers, there are SpongeBob SquarePants activity kits.) And on Air Berlin, new amenity kits for business-class passengers on long-haul flights include products from either L\u2019Occitane, Institut Karit\u00e9 or Rituals.Such kits may prove particularly handy for do-it-yourselfers. As anyone who has tried to book a manicure at the last minute knows, the demand for such pampering has made it more difficult to walk into an airport spa and get a treatment on the spot. Ms. Binn said that was because more travelers were purposely waiting to take care of their grooming at the airport. \u201cWe get a lot of reservations,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had somebody call six months in advance because they were putting it in their travel schedule.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "J & R Closes Manhattan Store for a Redesign", "Date": "2014-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe move was foreshadowed in October, when the store scaled back its footprint between Ann and Beekman Streets. Once occupying eight buildings on those blocks totaling 300,000 square feet, the business was resized to five floors each at 1 Park Row and 15 Park Row. Rachelle Friedman, who with her husband, Joseph, opened J & R across from City Hall in 1971, acknowledged at the time that as part of the changes they were laying off some employees.The store, whose closing was reported on Wednesday evening by The Daily News, said in the announcement that it needed to keep up with technology, retailing and real estate trends and that it would close \u201cso that we can rebuild this location into what we hope will be an unprecedented retailing concept and social mecca.\u201dThe closing leaves the company without a brick-and-mortar presence for the first time.

{"Headline": "Gas Prices for Summer Projected to Hold Steady, Reflecting Sufficient Supply", "Date": "2014-04-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 Just a few years ago, American families faced uncertainties when planning their summer vacations, fearing that rising gasoline prices would blow their budgets. Then came the 2008-9 economic downturn, sending fuel prices lower.This summer season, according to the Energy Department, average gasoline prices should actually be lower than current prices and close to or slightly below those of last summer. The department\u2019s Energy Information Administration projected on Tuesday that a gallon of regular gasoline would cost $3.57 on average nationally, down a penny from last summer.\u201cWe have prices flat from last year and prices peaking in May,\u201d said Tancred Lidderdale, an Energy Information Administration economist.The summer driving season is from April through September.The remarkable stability in price for gasoline is a reflection of the stability in world oil prices in recent years because of a lucky balance of supply and demand. Political unrest has caused interruptions of supplies from North Africa and the Middle East. But even as shipments from places like Libya, Nigeria and Sudan have dropped for months at a time, Saudi Arabia and a few other Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries suppliers have bolstered production.The United States has been the biggest contributor to increased global supplies because of a boom in shale drilling that has elevated production to the highest levels since the early 1970s. Production from Canada is also growing at a steady pace.In recent days, Libyan militias surrendered control of two oil export terminals, potentially enabling the country to increase its exports by more than 100,000 barrels in the coming days. Several other terminals may soon open as negotiations between the weak central government and regional militias continue, although oil experts remain skeptical that the country will return to its traditional export level of more than a million barrels a day anytime soon. Meanwhile, Iraqi exports have surged in recent months to the highest level in more than 30 years despite persistent sectarian unrest.At the same time, global growth in oil demand has been moderate because of a sluggish economy in Europe and easing demand growth in China. The Energy Department said that in 2013, world consumption averaged 90.4 million barrels a day, 1.2 million barrels more than in 2012. The department expects global growth of 1.2 million barrels a day again in 2014 and 1.4 million more barrels a day in 2015.Lower consumption is expected in Japan and Europe this year, according to the Energy Department. American oil consumption increased by 400,000 barrels a day in 2013 because of the improving economy, and it is expected to remain fairly flat in 2014 and then rise slightly in 2015. While Americans are driving more, their cars are becoming increasingly efficient, energy experts say.The global Brent benchmark crude price has bounced around a narrow band in recent years, from about $100 to $112 a barrel. In 2013, it averaged $109 a barrel, and the Energy Department expects it to average $105 a barrel this year before declining further to $101 in 2015. With the surge in United States drilling, American benchmark prices are expected to stay a few dollars lower than Brent prices, giving American refineries a competitive advantage on world markets.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "This Time, Get Global Trade Right", "Date": "2014-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialMany Americans have watched their neighbors lose good-paying jobs as their employers sent their livelihoods to China. Over the last 20 years, the United States has lost nearly five million manufacturing jobs. In that same time, however, the prices that Americans pay for basic goods like T-shirts and televisions have fallen. The cost of clothing is down 8.2 percent since 1993, as \u201cmade in China\u201d and \u201cmade in Bangladesh\u201d labels have crowded out \u201cmade in U.S.A.\u201d on the shelves of the local mall.There is a national ambivalence about our trade of goods and services with the rest of the world, which has more than doubled in the last two decades. Americans want the benefits of trade \u2014 and they are potentially big and quite real, including opening up new markets to American cars and software \u2014 but they\u2019re increasingly anxious about the downside, which includes closed factories and lower wages. The country needs to pursue new trade agreements, but this time we need to get the agreements right.The Obama administration has revealed so few details about the negotiations, even to members of Congress and their staffs, that it is impossible to fully analyze the Pacific partnership. Negotiators have argued that it\u2019s impossible to conduct trade talks in public because opponents to the deal would try to derail them. But it\u2019s important to remember that our trade with trade-agreement countries, like Mexico, is much more balanced than our trade with China. Those countries buy more American goods and services than they would without an agreement, sending money and jobs back in this direction.The president also needs to make clear to America\u2019s trading partners that they need to adhere to enforceable labor and environmental regulations. This would level the playing field for American workers and improve the lives of tens of millions of workers in developing countries. The Obama administration also needs to do much more to counter the demands of corporations with those of the public interest. Consumer and workers groups should have been on the same industry advisory committees. And Mr. Froman, the trade representative, must make clear that these agreements will allow countries to adopt regulations without the threat of a lawsuit from powerful businesses. On patents, the agreements should not cut off developing countries\u2019 access to lifesaving generic medicines.To a large extent, the administration has only itself to blame. By keeping secret so much information about trade negotiations, which have ceased to be purely about trade matters like tariffs and quotas, the government has made itself a target for criticism. Mr. Obama and Mr. Froman argue that their critics have misunderstood or misrepresented their intentions. But that is precisely why the president should provide answers to the questions people have raised about these agreements. It is time for him to make a strong case for why these new agreements will be good for the American economy and workers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hey, Robot: Which Cat Is Cuter?", "Date": "2014-04-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s the EconomyOne recent morning, while contemplating writing this column, I scrolled through thousands and thousands of listings for mundane microgigs on Mechanical Turk, or Mturk, a decade-old platform created by Amazon. On Mturk, which advertises paid \u201chuman intelligence tasks,\u201d I could review and correct transcriptions. I could tag images, perform a Google search, write a few sentences on a given topic, rate jokes or list items found on a receipt. For each, I would make a nickel or a quarter.Computers are great at rote, simple tasks. This, of course, has wreaked havoc on all sorts of jobs throughout our economy. Robots have replaced countless machinists and garment workers. Kayak and Priceline, among others, have all but crowded out travel agents. Auto\u00admated scanning systems are slowly phasing out the checkout clerk, while Tesla is hoping to sell its zippy plug-in cars straight to customers, eliminating the salesman. (And soon those cars might drive themselves.) Mturk and its competitors, like CrowdSource, are intended for the menial jobs that still require a flicker of human intelligence and that computers can\u2019t replicate, like deciding whether a photograph is safe for work or understanding a thick, slang-laden accent.The platform has prompted much consternation for being a sort of outsourcing service that drives down wages. Estimates of hourly earnings generally come out to $5 or less, or around two-thirds of the current federal minimum wage \u2014 a good-enough sum, perhaps, for the India-based workers who supply about half the labor on the site but not so much for the other half who are based in the United States. More than one commentator has described Mturk as a \u201cdigital sweatshop.\u201d But even more troubling is the fact that crowdsourcing platforms are hurrying along the automation of more and more of these tasks. Erik Brynjolfsson, a co-author of the popular book \u201cRace Against the Machine,\u201d cites image recognition as one obvious place where humans have helped robots replace them. Crowdworkers can collect pennies for identifying adorable cats in photographs, and then companies take that data and improve software that identifies adorable cats with a marginal cost that approaches zero. \u201cWe\u2019re at a real inflection point in terms of artificial intelligence and machine learning,\u201d Brynjolfsson said. \u201cThings are speeding up.\u201d Indeed, many Turkers are actively helping to put themselves out of jobs. \u201cYesterday it was spam moderation,\u201d said Panos Ipeirotis, a professor of business at New York University. \u201cAnd today it\u2019s transcriptions and translation. Once we help computers solve the problem of today, we move on to more challenging tasks. Maybe in 10 years, it\u2019s something we think of as completely out of the range of computers right now. I see it happening, all the time.\u201dThis is, of course, the latest iteration of a proc\u00adess that has been going on at least since the evolution of the ax and the plow: Man invents a machine to make life easier, and then that machine reduces the need for man\u2019s work. Ultimately, it\u2019s a virtuous cycle, because it frees humans up to work on higher-value tasks. But technological change can also cause huge economic dislocations. And right now, the great fear is that robots are taking over jobs faster than humans can adjust. High-tech firms may be the most vibrant part of the economy, but they just don\u2019t require the manpower of former blue-chip companies. \u201cAt the height of its power, the photography company Kodak employed more than 140,000 people and was worth $28 billion,\u201d writes the computer scientist Jaron Lanier in \u201cWho Owns the Future?\u201d \u201cBut today Kodak is bankrupt, and the new face of digital photography has become Instagram. When Instagram was sold to Facebook for a billion dollars in 2012, it employed only 13 people.\u201d Lanier describes the future of automation as big-data \u201cpuppetry,\u201d where the actions of humans are replicated once the set of data is big enough. White-collar jobs were once deemed mostly immune to such automation, but that is no longer true, either. Carl Benedikt Frey, an economist, and Michael Osborne, a professor of machine learning, at Oxford University estimate that about half of American jobs \u2014 sailors, paralegals, you name it \u2014 are susceptible to automation. \u201cSoftware substitution, whether it\u2019s for drivers or waiters or nurses\u201d is coming, Bill Gates said recently at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. \u201cTwenty years from now, labor demand for lots of skill sets will be substantially lower. I don\u2019t think people have that in their mental model.\u201dJournalists have often thought of themselves as impervious to automation, but there are creeping signs that the robots have come for our gigs too. Last month, after an earthquake woke up Los Angeles, the first post on the temblor at The Los Angeles Times gave the basic information and carried one Ken Schwencke\u2019s byline. \u201cThis information comes from the USGS Earthquake Notification Service and this post was created by an algorithm written by the author,\u201d it noted at the end.Yet that does not necessarily mean that half of all journalists \u2014 or half of all Americans, for that matter \u2014 will lose their jobs to the robots, never to reclaim them. Economists refer to this fear as the \u201clump of labor\u201d fallacy, the incorrect assumption that there is a finite amount of work to be done, and that the more robots do, the less there will be for the rest of us. In the past, after all, humans have proved remarkably adept at thinking up new things to do when plows, cows, steam trains and dishwashers arrived to help free up some of our time.This time around, however, there is a notable difference. With computers getting so much better, faster and faster and faster, there might be a rough period of transition as median wages keep falling for American families. Workers \u2014 especially those without college degrees \u2014 will continue to find themselves less and less valuable in the marketplace. \u201cThe big challenge for us as individuals, and as a society, is to race with machines, rather than racing against machines,\u201d Brynjolfsson said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some catastrophic failure of imagination, failing to think of more ways to put that vast middle class of people to work and to employ them more productively.\u201d The challenge, in other words, is for humans to allow software, algorithms, robots and the like to propel them into higher-and-higher-value work. For journalists like me, that might mean letting computers take over on earnings reports, weather, earthquake warnings and flash sports scores \u2014 and doubling down on narratives, investigations and analytical pieces. This very column, for example. I distilled my thoughts down to four bullet points and offered two Turkers a rather handsome sum of $2 to write four sentences. In half an hour, I had my responses back: \u201cWriting projects derived from crowdsourcing are best used for blogs, backlinking, nonexpert informational articles and other needs that do not require 100 percent accuracy. The major downside to crowdsourced work is the vast variability of skills and work ethic. . . .\u201dFor now, at least, I think my job is safe. Annie Lowrey is an economics reporter for The Times.Deep thoughts this week:\n1) There are few things\nthat robots cannot yet do. 2) But we\u2019re\ninadvertently teaching them\nthose skills. 3) That includes my job.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Senate Set to Pass Bill Extending Jobless Aid", "Date": "2014-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate is expected to easily approve legislation Monday restoring unemployment benefits to nearly three million people, throwing the bill to a divided House where Republicans favor starkly different approaches to the issue.Six Senate Republicans joined all 55 Democrats last week to end debate on legislation that retroactively restores benefits cut off Dec. 28 and extends them through June 1, clearing the way for passage Monday.Seven House Republicans from high-unemployment regions or swing districts plan to send the House speaker, John A. Boehner of Ohio, a letter coinciding with Senate passage to urge him to take up the Senate bill or a similar measure.Other House Republicans are pressing to attach to the Senate bill what they call job-creation measures: building the transcontinental Keystone XL pipeline; consolidating job training programs; or raising employer-mandated health care coverage to employees who work 40 hours a week, rather than 30, as written in President Obama\u2019s health care law.But many House Republicans oppose passing the unemployment benefits under any circumstances, arguing that such \u201cemergency\u201d benefits are no longer needed nearly six years after they were first extended at the outset of the recession.\u201cTo me it\u2019s important to get this done, politically to get it off the table, but also there are people who need it,\u201d said Representative Peter T. King, Republican of New York, one of the drafters of the new House letter. \u201cIf we\u2019re blaming Obama for the economy, we shouldn\u2019t be penalizing people who are the victims.\u201dDemocrats would like an improving economy to benefit Mr. Obama \u2014 and thus benefit them during the 2014 congressional campaigns. But they also want to keep the pressure on Republicans to renew unemployment benefits.Republicans have the opposite task: Paint the economic recovery as woeful but not so bad as to warrant renewed aid to the unemployed.\u201cAmerica doesn\u2019t work when hard-working people can\u2019t find the jobs or hours they need to make ends meet,\u201d Representative Eric Cantor, Republican of Virginia, the House majority leader, said Friday.Republicans pushing for the benefits include: Representatives Jon Runyan, Christopher Smith and Frank A. LoBiondo of New Jersey; Representatives King, Chris Gibson, and Michael Grimm of New York; and Representative Joe Heck, whose Nevada district has the third highest unemployment rate.House Republican leaders have yet to decide their approach to the issue, senior aides said. Most House Republicans feel no pressure to act quickly, but some do relish the chance to send the Senate\u2019s unemployment bill back to Senate Democrats with at least one of the measures that divide them: the Keystone pipeline, a repeal of the tax on medical devices in the Affordable Care Act or raising the hours-per-week threshold where the employer-mandated coverage kicks in.Senate Democratic leadership aides say they will not consider how to deal with that scenario until they see if the House could actually muster the votes to pass such a bill. For them, Monday\u2019s vote \u2014 the culmination of a four-month fight \u2014 kicks off a run of bills they say will show they favor economically strained voters.On Tuesday, Senate Democrats will bring up a bill to guarantee women equal pay for work equal to their male counterparts, coinciding with a speech by the president on the same subject. That budget again would convert Medicare to a program of subsidized private insurance plans.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "NBC Expects to Strike Gold in a Late-Night Renaissance Led by Fallon", "Date": "2014-04-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdvertisingTOP executives of NBCUniversal took a victory lap of sorts on Monday, briefing a roomful of reporters on recent healthy ratings \u2014 practically round the clock \u2014 for their NBC television network and suggesting they would seek healthy increases in advertising rates when the upfront market for the 2014-15 season begins next month.\u201cI think we will have a strong upfront,\u201d Stephen B. Burke, president and chief executive of NBCUniversal, said during a 90-minute lunch on the 51st floor of the G.E. Building at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, and NBC is going into it \u201cin the strongest position in a decade.\u201dIn the last couple of upfront markets \u2014 so named because negotiations take place before the coming season \u2014 NBC charged lower ad rates in prime time than competitors did because the network\u2019s ratings had lagged behind those of its rivals, giving rise to what trade publications described as the \u201cNBC discount\u201d on ad rates based on cost per thousand viewers, or cpms, a common way that commercial time is sold.There is a difference between \u201cwhen you sell at a discount and come in in fourth place,\u201d Mr. Burke said, and \u201cwhen you sell at a discount and come in in first place.\u201d His reference was to NBC\u2019s results in prime time for the 2013-14 season to date, from Sept. 23 through March 23, among viewers ages 18 to 49, those most sought after by advertisers.\u201cWe\u2019ve made real progress,\u201d Mr. Burke said, but \u201cwe need to do a lot better\u201d on Thursdays, once a stronghold for NBC but now a night of flops.Mr. Burke\u2019s counterpart at CBS, Leslie Moonves, president and chief executive of the CBS Corporation, is known for making annual predictions that his network will achieve the largest growth in cpms among the four biggest broadcasters; Mr. Moonves made that forecast for 2014-15 at a conference last month.Asked for a Moonves-style prediction, Mr. Burke described how he believed the American economy was doing better even as it was still recovering from the recession.\u201cIf you create great content,\u201d he said, \u201cthere\u2019s money there\u201d from advertisers. Mr. Burke was especially effusive about NBC\u2019s success in handling the late-night transition from Jay Leno to Jimmy Fallon, noting that since Mr. Fallon took over \u201cThe Tonight Show,\u201d on many nights he has scored ratings higher than those of his two main rivals \u2014 Jimmy Kimmel on ABC and David Letterman on CBS \u2014 combined.Mr. Burke praised Mr. Fallon\u2019s broad entertainment skills and his brand of \u201coptimistic, enthusiastic, not snarky\u201d comedy, describing him as \u201cexactly what America was looking for.\u201dMr. Fallon was apparently what NBC was looking for as well: namely, a switch from Mr. Leno that did not disturb the ratings leadership of \u201cTonight\u201d in late night. NBC\u2019s previous effort to remove Mr. Leno \u2014 and insert Conan O\u2019Brien, while giving Mr. Leno a show in prime time \u2014 turned into a chaotic failure.\u201cWe wanted to do the best handoff we\u2019ve ever done,\u201d Mr. Burke said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some difficult handoffs.\u201dNBC had expected Mr. Fallon to start out with much lower ratings, Mr. Burke said \u2014 only about 50 percent of what he is drawing now, which would have placed him behind \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live.\u201d NBC believed that it might take as long as a year for Mr. Fallon to catch up to Mr. Kimmel.No one could have predicted how popular Mr. Fallon has been out of the box, Mr. Burke said, and one reason for that is that Mr. Fallon is bringing people back to late-night network television.Linda Yaccarino, NBCUniversal\u2019s president for advertising sales, put it this way: \u201cWe thought Jimmy would do well. We didn\u2019t know he would hit a grand-slam home run.\u201d As a result, some advertisers that bought commercials during \u201cTonight\u201d in last year\u2019s upfront market, when Mr. Fallon was still hosting NBC\u2019s \u201cLate Night,\u201d are benefiting from higher ratings than they had expected, she added, but NBCUniversal is confident that it can \u201ctake advantage of the dollars and the demand\u201d going forward.The success of Mr. Fallon\u2019s \u201cTonight\u201d is having a halo effect on other NBC properties, Mr. Burke said, including the last 15 minutes of local news on NBC-owned stations, \u201cLate Night With Seth Meyers,\u201d and \u201cToday\u201d the next morning. Moving \u201cTonight\u201d back to New York City \u2014 \u201cwe spent a lot of money\u201d on that, Mr. Burke said \u2014 has injected new energy into the show and even helped with talent bookings for other NBC shows, Mr. Burke said.Mr. Burke and Ms. Yaccarino endorsed the concept of NBC\u2019s adopting a 52-week prime-time schedule as cable channels have, offering viewers new shows during traditional rerun periods like summer rather than concentrating them in 35 weeks from September to May. Fox Broadcasting has long supported that, and all four big English-language broadcasters \u2014 ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC \u2014 schedule some new programming in the summertime.\u201cThe 35-week season is an anachronism,\u201d Mr. Burke said. \u201cWe should all move to a 52-week season.\u201d NBC will offer viewers nine new series, scripted and unscripted, this summer, he added.Other subjects discussed at the briefing included the networks\u2019 initiatives to generate ad dollars from viewers who watch shows and videos on mobile devices, online or through video on demand; whether television will broaden its focus from 18-to-49-year-old viewers to the free-spending baby boomers, ages 50 to 68; and efforts to change the commercial ratings used to make upfront buys to live viewing plus seven days delayed viewership from the current standard, live plus three days.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Many Auto Show Visitors Unfazed by G.M. Recalls", "Date": "2014-04-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLouis Monetti pulled a tape measure from his back pocket and stretched it across the Chevrolet Cruze\u2019s trunk to make sure his bicycle would fit. Then he crouched for a good look at the car\u2019s rear suspension. It all seemed fine, he said on Saturday at the New York International Auto Show, adding that he probably would buy the Cruze over the Ford Fusion.Mr. Monetti was one of many at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan whose confidence in General Motors cars had not been shaken by the company\u2019s long-delayed recall of millions of small cars for an ignition switch defect that G.M. has linked to 13 deaths and 31 accidents. Despite federal investigations, contentious hearings in Congress and mounting criticism from lawmakers and consumer advocates, potential buyers at G.M. exhibits, and at those of other automakers, expressed little concern.\u201cThe cars here are different than the ones that were recalled; the ignition switch is an old issue,\u201d said Mr. Monetti of Brooklyn. \u201cSure, the whole situation blemishes G.M., but every car company has issues. How many have covered something up?\u201dThe Cruze succeeded the Cobalt, the compact Chevrolet car at the heart of G.M.\u2019s ignition switch crisis and one no longer in production. The Cruze, too, has been included in this year\u2019s wave of recalls \u2014 but not for an ignition issue. The Cruze has a right-front axle shaft that can fracture and separate without warning.Most of the other models that G.M. showed off at the auto show \u2014 the new Chevrolet Trax, a small sport utility vehicle, and the Corvette Z06 convertible \u2014 bore little similarity to the compact, economy-class cars that have been the focus of the continuing defect investigations.Product specialists at the show said that in the two days it had been open to the public, questions about the recall were rare.One reason for the lack of concern, analysts said, is that all of the 2.6 million cars recalled because of the ignition switch are out of production.\u201cIt\u2019s really lucky for G.M. that the vehicles affected by the recall are out of today\u2019s shoppers\u2019 minds,\u201d said Jeremy Acevedo, an analyst for Edmunds.com, referring to the ignition switch recall. \u201cThe Cobalt, Ion, HHR, you\u2019re not seeing those at the auto show. All the vehicles that have been recalled are part of a defunct brand,\u201d he said, referring to Saturn and Pontiac. \u201cOr they\u2019re vehicles G.M. is no longer producing.\u201d G.M.\u2019s sales did not suffer in March, the first full month since the recall. The company posted a 4 percent increase in sales over the previous March, with Chevrolet models making up 70 percent of all vehicles sold.General consumer interest in G.M. cars has not waned, according to Edmunds.com. Since January, web browsing of Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, Chrysler and GMC models on the site has held steady or increased.Jesse Toprak, chief analyst for Cars.com, suggested that the market might need more time to process news of the defects and G.M.\u2019s admitted mishandling of them. \u201cChances are there will be more of a negative impact on G.M.\u2019s sales in April,\u201d Mr. Toprak said, \u201cwhen consumers will have more awareness of the expanded recalls.\u201dThe spotlight on G.M. has certainly not dimmed. This month, Mary T. Barra, the company\u2019s chief executive, testified before Congress about its delay of years in acting on knowledge of the ignition flaw. G.M. has lent 30,000 vehicles to owners of recalled cars who requested them while they awaited replacement parts, which have been rationed to dealers. Some dealers in the Midwest have received one to five replacement switches in spite of waiting lists approaching 100 people.But some who attended the auto show, which runs through April 27, said they had seen the congressional hearings and thought nothing of them.\u201cI saw some clips of the C.E.O. being really vague and saying she didn\u2019t really know anything,\u201d said Natalie Saldana, who was examining the Cruze with her family. \u201cBut I feel like that\u2019s kind of irrelevant to my search.\u201dEdwin Saldana, Ms. Saldana\u2019s brother, said they planned to research safety specifications before his sister made her purchase. \u201cWe haven\u2019t reviewed the air bag safety of the car yet, but we want to,\u201d he said as his young nephew sat in the driver\u2019s seat and played with the steering wheel.\u201cFinancially, it\u2019s a really good deal,\u201d Ms. Saldana said of the Cruze, which starts at $18,345. Nearby, huddled over the Chevrolet Impala, Jan Miller and Lynn Chippeaux of New Jersey did not pay attention to the federal investigation and recall, either.\u201cThirteen people died over how many years?\u201d Ms. Miller asked. \u201cI feel really bad for the families, but how many millions of cars was that out of? It\u2019s like the odds of being hit by lightning. Stuff happens.\u201dStill, not all consumers at the auto show shrugged off news of the defects.\u201cI\u2019m not looking at G.M. products very favorably,\u201d said Andrea Stover of Vestal, N.Y., as she examined the Cruze\u2019s exposed turbodiesel engine, on display on the show floor. \u201cIt took so long for this to come out. What else are they hiding?\u201dMs. Stover said she and her husband were looking at the General Motors showcase only because a convention center entrance had deposited them in it. \u201cWe want to see the Hyundais and Nissans,\u201d Ms. Stover\u2019s husband, Dennis, said.Other consumers were ambivalent, neither alienated nor unaffected by the recalls.Paul MacCormac came from Canada to look at Fords. He had driven Chevys all his life, he said. \u201cG.M. handled this situation poorly, and people died,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll drive next \u2014 could be a Chevy, could not be. Now it\u2019s wide open.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Greece Dives Back Into the Bond Market", "Date": "2014-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 Europe\u2019s leaders have been preaching austerity for years, arguing that only deep budget cuts will revive the economy and inspire the necessary confidence among investors.Now, they have symbolic proof, as Greece returns to the capital markets with plans to begin selling long-term bonds on Thursday.The deal represents a major milestone for the country, which was effectively shut out of the markets in 2010 when the debt crisis left it dependent on international bailouts to stay afloat. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who more than any other leader is associated with European austerity, is scheduled to arrive in Athens on Friday to affirm that the government is on the right path.The bond sale reflects increased optimism that Greece and other wobbly euro zone countries have turned a corner. In recent months, borrowing costs dropped significantly for Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy, as the investors deemed them less risky.But the restored stability in the financial markets won\u2019t settle the debate over whether the benefits of austerity are worth the costs.Greece, like many of its peers, still faces rampant joblessness and deep economic fissures. Unemployment is staggeringly high at 27 percent. On Wednesday, the streets of Athens were again clogged with protesters, denouncing years of budget cuts and steep declines in their standard of living.\"This is our answer to the dead-end policies that have squeezed workers and made Greek people miserable,\u201d the Greek private workers\u2019 union G.S.E.E. said in a statement as thousands of protesters gathered in front of the Greek Parliament. \u201cWe are striking and fighting to put an end to austerity.\"The still-fragile economic situation in Europe has not deterred investors.The bonds of both Portugal and Ireland have been in strong demand since those countries returned to the markets earlier this year. Ireland plans to raise a fresh 1 billion euros from international bond investors on Thursday, the second such move since the country exited its international bailout in December.In part, investors are chasing yield, as the bonds\u2019 rates are more attractive than those available from more prosperous countries like Germany. Portugal\u2019s 10-year bond is currently offering investors a yield of nearly 3.9 percent, compared with less than 1.6 percent on Germany\u2019s equivalent bond.Investors are also energized by a pledge from the European Central Bank\u2019s president, Mario Draghi, to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to prevent the crisis from breaking out anew. With such assurances, investors are more comfortable taking what might otherwise be perceived as a risky bet.As a result, borrowing costs among the most troubled euro zone economies have been falling fast. At the height of the crisis, investors were demanding more than 30 percent for 10-year Greek bonds. Now, it is less than 6 percent. The interest rate on the new five-year bonds is expected to be about 5 to 5.5 percent, according to Greek media reports.\u201cAusterity has benefited the financial markets, there\u2019s no doubt about that,\u201d said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a research fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. Austerity has been \u201cpart of the price its creditors have demanded politically for supporting it, and it is that support that is actually now enabling Greece to come back to the markets.\u201dMr. Kirkegaard added that creditors had helped the country stay in the euro, which has been enormously beneficial for the average Greek. \u201cHad there been no troika program and Greece left the euro, the situation would be much worse than it is today,\u201d he said, referring to the three main international lenders that have given Greece 240 billion euros, or $332 billion, in bailout loans.\u201cSo in that sense austerity required by Greece\u2019s creditors has saved Greeks from a much worse fate,\u201d Mr. Kirkegaard said, \u201ceven if it hasn\u2019t maintained their living standards at precrisis levels.\u201dA spokesman for Ms. Merkel acknowledged the Greek public\u2019s pain but tried to cast things in a positive light ahead of her Friday visit. \u201cThe chancellor has repeatedly said publicly how much she admires the path taken by the Greeks and how aware she is that this was a difficult path for many people in Greece, but one that is now showing results,\u201d said the spokesman, Steffen Seibert.The government has labored to improve Greece\u2019s international image since the country accepted an international rescue package in 2010, and again in 2012, in the face of worries that Greece might need to leave the 18-nation club of E.U. member countries that use the euro.Such fears are gone. The economy is stabilizing, with the International Monetary Fund recently raising its forecast for growth this year, to 0.6 percent. Greece has met a number of fiscal targets, and the government recently announced a primary surplus \u2014 a surplus before debt payments \u2014 of about \u20ac2.5 billion. The government said it planned to return nearly three-quarters of that to Greeks hit hardest by the austerity measures.Since it had to seek bailouts, the Greek government has made do on its short-term financing needs with auctions of short-term debt. On Tuesday, it sold \u20ac1.3 billion in six-month Treasury bills at just above 3 percent, a rate the Finance Ministry said confirmed \u201cthe improved economic and investment climate in our country.\u201d In 2011 and 2012, six-month bills had sold for as much as 5 percent.But Greece still has numerous economic hurdles to overcome, including a mountain of debt that will take decades to repay. Where the country will find the resources is unclear.Returning to the markets complicates the situation in some ways. Greece\u2019s debt load \u2014 about \u20ac320 billion \u2014 will continue to grow. And borrowing costs are higher than those on its bailout loans, which charge only around 3 percent interest.Economists said Greece would need annual economic growth of nearly 5 percent over the next decade to make progress in paying off what it owes creditors. Foreign investment has been returning to the country, but not nearly at the pace needed to stoke jobs and growth.Efforts to privatize state assets to raise cash to repay bailout funds have continued to fall short.

{"Headline": "Wish for Change Animates Voters in India Election", "Date": "2014-04-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW DELHI \u2014 Over the last several years, as the yearning for a strong leader began to deepen and swell in the Indian electorate, one politician was systematically preparing himself to be the answer to that demand.Narendra Modi, the leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party, has spent this campaign season standing above oceans of people \u2014 a stern, commanding figure who brags of his \u201c56-inch chest.\u201d He has offered himself as a C.E.O. for the nation, poised to slice through India\u2019s bureaucracy with the sure hand of an experienced manager.This message has won him the confidence of India\u2019s working and middle classes, who are pinched by food inflation, disillusioned with the Gandhi dynasty and wearied of the corruption scandals that have accumulated around the governing Congress party. The election, which began on Monday as the first of India\u2019s 814 million registered voters cast ballots in the country\u2019s remote northeast, is less about policies than a desire for change.\u201cThe sentiment is that we have a slightly embarrassing leadership,\u201d said Siddharth Khanna, 27, a Delhi advertising executive. \u201cWe are seen to be lagging. We feel if we have strong leadership, we will be insulated from the effects of the global slowdown. We don\u2019t trust anyone, to be honest. But it might as well be someone who is aggressive in whatever stance he takes.\u201dIt has never been clear what kind of leader Mr. Modi would be, should his coalition win enough seats to form a government after nine waves of votes are counted on May 16. At 63, he has shown radically different faces to the world as he has risen through the political system: Before campaigning on a technocratic, good-governance platform, Mr. Modi was shaped by his years working as a propagandist for a Hindu-right organization, and he was widely blamed for bloody religious riots that broke out in the state he governed.He is enthusiastically embraced by international corporations, but he also answers to an electoral base of small traders dead set against globalization.His sometimes autocratic style may collide with several constraints, among them a boisterous press, activist courts and fractious allies, that have slowed his predecessors.His method of governing may be determined by arithmetic. Opinion polls suggest that his National Democratic Alliance will emerge with the largest number parliamentary seats. Though Hindus make up 80 percent of India\u2019s population, the country is a kaleidoscope of religious diversity, including a large Muslim population along with Christians, Sikhs and Buddhists. The Constitution enshrines a secular state, and the country has a long history of accommodating a wide range of religious and ethnic diversity.Mr. Modi will look to the margin of victory as a measure of his popular mandate, said Ashok Malik, a prominent columnist who has supported Mr. Modi\u2019s candidacy. A haul of 220 out of 545 seats in the lower house, he said, would signal \u201ca mandate for revolutionary change.\u201d For Mr. Malik, that mandate matters for economic reasons, giving Mr. Modi the independence to challenge powerful state lobbies and restructure the economy to create jobs and integrate India in global supply chains.But Mr. Modi\u2019s critics worry that a sweeping victory would embolden Mr. Modi to pursue a risky and divisive Hindu nationalist agenda sought by some of his most loyal supporters.\u201cHe will look around and decide what he can do \u2014 whether he can make India into a Hindu nation or not,\u201d said Nilanjan Mukhopadyay, the author of a biography of Mr. Modi. \u201cIf it takes too much risk, he will not do it. If he can, he will. Initially, he will focus on growth.\u201dIf Indians disagree about Mr. Modi\u2019s intentions, it is partly because he has reinvented himself several times. The son of a tea-stall owner in a small town, he traces his political awakening to the age of 8, when he began taking part in the evening drills of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, a Hindu nationalist right-wing organization.The R.S.S. offered him a way to break from family obligations, and he bucked his parents\u2019 authority by walking away from an arranged marriage in favor of years of ascetic wandering; a new biography, distributed to journalists by the B.J.P., said he was turned away from three monasteries, finally returning to full-time work for the R.S.S.Explore key developments in the 2002 riots in Gujarat that shadowed Narendra Modi\u2019s ascent to the prime minister\u2019s office.In a rare television interview broadcast last week, Mr. Modi credited the organization with shaping him. \u201cI got the inspiration to live for the nation from the R.S.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cIt inculcated discipline into me. I learned to live for others, and not for myself. I owe it all to the R.S.S.\u201dMr. Modi did not become famous for several decades after that, until he had risen through the ranks of the B.J.P. to become chief minister of his home state, Gujarat.By then, his ideological background had been thoroughly eclipsed by his international reputation as an effective manager. Corporate executives gushed about their experience in Gujarat, saying that Mr. Modi had increased efficiency by taking a tough approach with bureaucrats who worked under him. He asked judges to work extra hours to plow through a backlog of court cases, and put many state activities online, reducing corruption.Rajeev Jyoti, managing director of Bombardier, a Canada-based aerospace and transportation company, recalled approaching Mr. Modi\u2019s office in 2007, after winning a contract to produce subway cars. Eighteen months later, the factory was built and operating, Mr. Jyoti said in an interview. \u201cIt was incredible,\u201d he said, \u201cand it was a world record within Bombardier.\u201dPolice responded slowly, witnesses said, as unspeakable violence unfolded over several days. At one point, a Hindu mob armed with stones, iron rods and homemade bombs surrounded a walled compound where Muslim families had taken refuge. The compound\u2019s owner, Ehsan Jafri, a former member of Parliament, spent hours making frantic calls to high-ranking officials, begging for police protection, but they arrived late, witnesses said. Sixty-nine people, including women and children, burned to death with Mr. Jafri.For years, Mr. Modi\u2019s critics have argued that he failed to take steps to halt the violence, and he has denied any responsibility. In a 2002 interview, he said his only regret about the episode was that he did not handle the news media better.Late last year, an Indian court rejected a petition filed by Mr. Jafri\u2019s widow seeking Mr. Modi\u2019s prosecution in the riots. Mr. Modi greeted this decision as a victory, commenting via Twitter that \u201ctruth alone triumphs.\u201dIn an interview with foreign journalists last week, Arun Jaitley, a senior B.J.P. leader, ruled out the idea that Mr. Modi would apologize, calling the persistent questioning \u201ca fake campaign.\u201d\u201cThose asking for an apology wanted the apology to be an act of confession,\u201d Mr. Jaitley said. \u201cIf he has actually committed a mistake, why should he apologize? He should have been prosecuted and punished.\u201dThe question of who Mr. Modi really is \u2014 the steady-handed corporate leader or the Hindu-nationalist preacher \u2014 has been woven through this election season, as he took his place before throngs of men chanting his name.Shekhar Gupta, the editor of The Indian Express, a daily newspaper, said the shift actually began many years ago, when Mr. Modi first saw \u201ca chance for himself on the national stage.\u201d\u201cI sometimes joke that I\u2019ve never seen a human being resemble his mask more than Mr. Modi,\u201d Mr. Gupta said. \u201cThe fact is that he will give you many new versions of that mask. The Mr. Modi you see today sounds very different \u2014 he looks the same, but he sounds very different from the way he sounded in 2007.\u201dMr. Gupta said that if the B.J.P. wins, the next few years will see a \u201ccalmer, more catholic Mr. Modi.\u201d The reasons, he said, are purely practical.\u201cHe wants to be in power for a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is young by Indian standards, and that is not going to work with a purely polarizing agenda. What works in Gujarat doesn\u2019t work in India.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Economist Receives Rock Star Treatment", "Date": "2014-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrench economists who boldly question the dominance of capital over labor \u2014 and call for a progressive global tax on wealth \u2014 visit the American halls of power about as often as French rock stars headline Madison Square Garden. But those halls of power are where Thomas Piketty, a 42-year-old professor at the Paris School of Economics, has been singing his song of late. Since touching down in Washington this week to promote his new book, \u201cCapital in the 21st Century,\u201d Mr. Piketty has met with Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, given a talk to President Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers and lectured at the International Monetary Fund, before flying to New York for an appearance at the United Nations, a sold-out public discussion with the Nobel laureates Joseph Stiglitz and Paul Krugman, and meetings with media outlets ranging from The Harvard Business Review to New York Magazine to The Nation.But through all the accolades, Mr. Piketty seems to be maintaining a most un-rock-star-like modesty, brushing away comparisons to Tocqueville and Marx with an embarrassed grimace and a Gallic puff of the lips.\u201cIt makes very little sense: How can you compare?\u201d he said on Thursday between gulps of yogurt during a break in his packed schedule \u2014 before going on to list the 19th-century data sets that Marx neglected to draw on in \u201cDas Kapital,\u201d his 1867 magnum opus.\u201cIf Marx had looked at them, it would have made him think a bit more,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I started collecting data, I had no idea where it would go.\u201dSince then, it has hit the New York Times best-seller list, and sold some 46,000 copies (hardback and e-book) \u2014 a stratospheric number for a nearly 700-page scholarly tome dotted with charts and graphs (as well as references to Balzac, Jane Austen and \u201cTitanic\u201d). At the book\u2019s center is Mr. Piketty\u2019s contention \u2014 contrary to the influential theory developed by Simon Kuznets in the 1950s and \u201960s \u2014 that mature capitalist economies do not inevitably evolve toward greater economic equality. Instead, Mr. Piketty contends, the data reveals a deeper historical tendency for the rate of return on capital to outstrip the overall rate of economic growth, leading to greater and greater concentrations of wealth at the very top.Despite this inevitable-seeming drift toward \u201cpatrimonial capitalism\u201d that his charts seemed to show, Mr. Piketty rejected any economic determinism. \u201cIt all depends on what the political system decides,\u201d he said.But Mr. Piketty, who writes in the book that the collapse of Communism in 1989 left him \u201cvaccinated for life\u201d against the \u201clazy rhetoric of anticapitalism,\u201d is no Marxian revolutionary. \u201cI believe in private property,\u201d he said in the interview. \u201cBut capitalism and markets should be the slave of democracy and not the opposite.\u201d Even if he doesn\u2019t expect his policy proposals to find favor in Washington anytime soon, Mr. Piketty called his meetings there gratifying. Mr. Lew, he said, seemed to have read parts of the book carefully. A member of the Council on Economic Advisers corrected a small error concerning Balzac\u2019s novel \u201cLe P\u00e8re Goriot,\u201d which includes a discussion of getting ahead through advantageous marriage rather than hard work. \u201cI was impressed,\u201d Mr. Piketty said.His book, however, ends not with an appeal to policy makers, but with a call for all citizens to \u201ctake a serious interest in money, its measurement, the facts surrounding it and its history.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s too easy for ordinary people to just say, \u2018I don\u2019t know anything about economics,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said, before rushing to his next appearance. \u201cBut economics is not just for economists.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "State Visit of Ireland\u2019s President to Britain, a First, Underlines Evolution of Relations", "Date": "2014-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 In a sign of the warmth of relations between two countries with a troubled history, Ireland\u2019s president, Michael D. Higgins, is to arrive here Monday for the first state visit to Britain by an Irish president.Once tainted by the legacy of colonialism, Anglo-Irish ties are now so close that Dublin worries about Britain\u2019s drift from the European Union, the bloc to which both countries belong.Mr. Higgins and his wife, Sabina, are to stay as guests of the queen in Windsor Castle \u2014 a privilege in royal protocol \u2014 and be taken by horse-drawn carriage through the streets of Windsor. There will be a state banquet and visits to Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s office on Downing Street and to Parliament, where Mr. Higgins is to address lawmakers. He has been to Britain before, but this is his first state visit.The red-carpet treatment underscores comments last month by Mr. Cameron, who said Anglo-Irish relations were at an \u201call- time high.\u201d Yet Irish politicians fear the consequences of Britain\u2019s disenchantment with the European Union and the prospect that their closest trading partner could quit the bloc, which includes a single economic market. Both nations joined its forerunner in 1973 and the union is seen in Dublin as vital glue in the relationship with London.\u201cIreland will be very anxious not to be presented with a choice between our relations with the European Union and our relations with Britain,\u201d Eunan O\u2019Halpin, professor of Contemporary History at Trinity College, Dublin, said Thursday. \u201cIrish diplomats will be tearing their hair out to avoid that.\u201dLittle of that will be evident in public during four days of events intended to celebrate ties between neighbors whose histories, cultures and economies are intertwined.The countries share a passport-free travel area and Irish influence pervades British life in many areas, like business and the media, where Irish broadcasters and entertainers are prominent.Though there is still tension and sectarian violence in Northern Ireland, the governments in London and Dublin generally cooperate well.During the last, turbulent century that was often not the case. Mr. Higgins, a respected academic, plans to view the colors of Irish regiments of the British Army that were disbanded after Irish independence. An estimated 200,000 Irish soldiers fought in the British Army in World War I, and Mr. Higgins plans to lay a wreath at the grave of the unknown warrior at Westminster Abbey. He is also scheduled to visit the remains of a cathedral in Coventry that was destroyed during World War II. Ireland remained neutral in that conflict.In a separate effort to come to terms with history, the British government said recently that in two years, it will be represented at centenary commemorations of the 1916 Easter Rising against British rule.Over the decades, Irish immigrants experienced discrimination in Britain \u2014 landlords once felt free to advertise rooms with signs saying, \u201cno Irish, no blacks, no dogs\u201d \u2014 but racism is rare now, according to Bernard Purcell, editor of The Irish World, a newspaper aimed at Irish immigrants here.\u201cThings have changed immensely,\u201d he said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t the institutional racism of the kind that existed in the 1960s.\u201d The most important recent factor is the peace agreement, he added, because bombing campaigns by the I.R.A., and the suspicion they brought upon Irish people, were \u201cthe biggest single shadow hanging over the Irish community in the 1970s and 1980s.\u201dProfessor O\u2019Halpin said political and economic ties were complemented by other connections. \u201cThere are enormous cultural crossovers,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that the two countries are identical, but it\u2019s a closer relationship than with other European countries.\u201dConsequently, what happens in Britain affects Ireland. In September, Scotland is to vote on independence from the United Kingdom; Ireland\u2019s government has sought to stay out of the matter.But Dublin has urged Britain not to leave the European Union. Mr. Cameron has promised that if re-elected, he will renegotiate the terms of British membership in the European Union and put that to a referendum in 2017.Unlike Britain, Ireland has adopted the euro, but the two countries work closely on European issues. Both prize their relationships with the United States and favor free markets, so usually end up as allies in negotiations at the European Union headquarters in Brussels.In a speech last year, Eamon Gilmore, Ireland\u2019s foreign minister, expressed concern about calls in Britain for withdrawal, saying it would be bad for Ireland \u201cif its most important economic partner were to distance itself from the European Union.\u201d\u201cAt best, British detachment from Europe would slow and limit our efforts towards closer cooperation with each other,\u201d Mr. Gilmore added. \u201cAt worst, it could reverse them.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Putin\u2019s Useful Idiots", "Date": "2014-04-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd in the last century intellectuals like Andr\u00e9 Gide, Pablo Neruda and Jean-Paul Sartre all stumped for the Soviet Union as what Lenin allegedly called \u201cuseful idiots,\u201d apologizing for its monstrosities long after the rest of the world recognized them.To those in the Eastern Europe left \u2014 myself included \u2014 who know Russia better than most, such na\u00efvet\u00e9 has long been a source of chagrin. And yet it continues, even today, as many American and Western European intellectuals do all they can to minimize the dangerous aggression by Vladimir V. Putin.Ukraine, he wrote, is part of Russia\u2019s sphere of influence, so why can\u2019t we just accept Mr. Putin\u2019s proposal that Ukraine be federalized, with neutrality guaranteed in a new constitution?Mr. Cohen\u2019s defense of Russia\u2019s sphere of influence overlooks the question of whether the countries that fall within it are there by choice or coercion. Ukraine is willing to be in the Western sphere of influence because it receives support for civil society, the economy and national defense \u2014 and Russia does nothing of the kind.True, such people were present at the square, but they were marginal figures, and slogans about ethnic purity never gained popularity. Yes, generally speaking, Ukraine has its skinheads and its anti-Semites and even serial killers, pedophiles and Satanists. They are not present in smaller or larger numbers than in any other country, even in the most mature European state.In one particularly egregious passage, Mr. Blumenthal writes about how the \u201copenly pro-Nazi politics\u201d of the Ukrainian political party Svoboda and its leader, Oleg Tyagnibok, \u201chave not deterred Senator John McCain from addressing a Euromaidan rally,\u201d nor did it \u201cprevent Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland from enjoying a friendly meeting with the Svoboda leader this February.\u201dThat distorts how these things work. A whole range of Western political leaders traveled to Euromaidan, and virtually all of them were photographed with Mr. Tyagnibok. For better or worse, Svoboda was part of the coalition of parties behind the Euromaidan movement, and they had agreed to support one another. Americans would behave exactly the same way in a similar situation.Strangely, Western intellectuals seem unbothered by anyone who notes the similarity between their pronouncements and Russian propaganda. Indeed, they dismiss such charges out of hand. Zoltan Grossman, who teaches at Evergreen State in Olympia, Wash., writes that it is \u201cwrong and irresponsible to assert that the presence of fascists and Nazis in the new government is merely Russian propaganda.\u201dFor Dr. Grossman, inconvenient details are less important than the fact that Dmytro Yarosh, the leader of the far-right organization Right Sector, had been appointed deputy secretary of the National Security and Defense Council.That sounds ominous, until you realize that Mr. Yarosh is not formally a member of the government, and that in February he met with Israel\u2019s ambassador to Ukraine and gave public assurances that Right Sector intended to fight all instances of anti-Semitism, xenophobia and chauvinism.What na\u00efve American intellectuals say free of charge, the canny Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, the former German chancellor, says for 250,000 euros a year as a board member of Gazprom, the Russian oil giant. Mr. Schr\u00f6der, the German father of \u201cGazprom socialism\u201d \u2014 a new subspecies of limousine liberalism \u2014 has repeatedly embarrassed Berlin by supporting Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea.He isn\u2019t alone \u2014 another former chancellor, Helmut Schmidt, has likewise sung Russia\u2019s praises of late, as has G\u00fcnter Verheugen, a prominent former European Union commissioner.What drives these men? Is it a case of poorly conceived pacifism? An eruption of remorse for war crimes carried out against Russians, so many years ago? Or the Stockholm syndrome of a victim fascinated by his executioner?Obviously, they are entitled to their opinions. But in speaking out this way they are doing great damage to Germany\u2019s postwar government, built on a commitment to democracy and national self-determination, everything that is currently under attack by Mr. Putin.The irony is that by standing beside Russia and pointing fingers at fascist phantoms in Ukraine, Western intellectuals are aligning themselves not just with the autocrat in the Kremlin, but the legions of far-right parties across Europe that have come to Russia\u2019s defense, among them Hungary\u2019s Jobbik, Vlaams Belang in Belgium, Austria\u2019s Freedom Party, Italy\u2019s Lega Nord and the French Front National. Who says Russia needs propaganda? It already has its useful idiots.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bush 41 Reunion Looks to Burnish His Legacy", "Date": "2014-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The elder George Bush will not give a speech. He is done with all that, he tells friends. But he will mingle and reminisce and bask in the admiration of graying men and women who helped him govern at a time when, some thought, they had reached the end of history.As it happens, history is not done with Mr. Bush, at least not if his advocates have anything to say about it. More than 800 supporters, allies, aides and even former opponents of Mr. Bush, the 41st president, will gather in College Station, Tex., on Friday for a three-day reunion to mark the 25th anniversary of the first Bush administration and try to burnish its legacy along the way.This seems to be a season for presidential rehabilitation, if not for the incumbent then for his predecessors. On Thursday night, Jimmy Carter attended the opening of a new play in Washington called \u201cCamp David,\u201d about his landmark Middle East peace treaty. On Friday morning, George W. Bush will reinvent himself as an artist as he puts his post-presidency paintings on display for the first time, at his Dallas library.Next week, four former presidents will travel to Austin to help the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library conduct a three-day conference commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act, even as a play on Johnson shows on Broadway. And every week, it seems, Bill Clinton is working on what could be the ultimate legacy project, helping elect his wife president.None of them, however, has undergone the political reincarnation that George Herbert Walker Bush has. Frail from a form of Parkinson\u2019s disease, Mr. Bush, 89, has benefited from a wave of historical revisionism that has transformed him from the biggest incumbent loser since William Howard Taft to, by at least one measure, the most popular former president of the past half century.\u201cThis is a man who campaigned for a kinder, gentler nation,\u201d said Mark K. Updegrove, director of the Johnson library, who is working on a book about the two President Bushes. \u201cAnd it\u2019s interesting that after a quarter-century, he\u2019s getting a kinder and gentler verdict in history.\u201dMr. Updegrove\u2019s is one of several books in the works about the 41st president and will take its place among recent documentaries and awards. After bestowing the Presidential Medal of Freedom on Mr. Bush three years ago, President Obama brought him back to the White House last summer to honor him. Last week, Mount Vernon gave Mr. Bush its first Cyrus A. Ansary Prize for Courage and Character. Next month, he will receive the Profile in Courage award from the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation.Mr. Bush\u2019s single term, from 1989 to 1993, proved a pivot point at home and abroad. The last president to have served in World War II, he managed the end of the Cold War, reunified Germany and expelled Iraq from Kuwait. He reauthorized the Civil Rights Act, updated the Clean Air Act and signed the Americans with Disabilities Act. But he broke his \u201cread my lips\u201d promise not to raise taxes and lost re-election when he seemed disengaged from a troubled economy.\u201cTwenty-five years later, history is beginning to recognize that George Bush was the best one-term president in American history,\u201d said James A. Baker III, his secretary of state and friend.Robert Gates, Mr. Bush\u2019s C.I.A. director, who later served the younger Mr. Bush and Mr. Obama as secretary of defense, said, \u201cThere is no precedent for the collapse of a great empire without a war,\u201d adding that Mr. Bush was \u201cbeginning to get the credit for the way he managed that.\u201dThe nostalgia for Mr. Bush may say as much about these times as his. Those were the days when America went to war with Iraq and then got out, when the two political parties struck grand bargains tackling the budget deficit, when Russia was a newfound friend retreating from confrontation rather than provoking it.Just as telling are Mr. Bush\u2019s current friends and foes. Among the friends are some of the same Democrats who tormented him but now lavish him with praise. Among the foes are some of today\u2019s Republicans, who see him as the epitome of everything they do not want to be.\u201cYou never hear anyone point to Bush 41,\u201d said Matt Kibbe, president of FreedomWorks, a Tea Party group. \u201cBy definition, a one-term president is a failed president. The American people rejected his economic policies.\u201d On the other side of that argument is Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, who ran for the Democratic nomination to challenge Mr. Bush in 1992. \u201cI know they\u2019re building statues of Ronald Reagan at airports,\u201d Mr. Harkin said, \u201cbut in terms of their lives and their life\u2019s work, to me, Bush 41 is much more integral to the development of American government and the process of democracy.\u201dMr. Harkin will attend this weekend\u2019s events at the elder Bush\u2019s library at Texas A&M University, organized by Frederick D. McClure, chief executive of the library foundation. Mr. Harkin will appear on a panel to discuss the Americans with Disabilities Act, on which he collaborated with Mr. Bush.Also on hand will be another Democrat, former Representative David R. Obey of Wisconsin, who helped broker the 1990 budget deal that included tax increases. \u201cIf there\u2019s a single word that you can use to describe Bush\u2019s approach to politics, it\u2019s governance,\u201d Mr. Obey said. \u201cIt was a case where the adults ran the show.\u201dOther Democrats are quick to add praise. \u201cI actually have a high opinion of Bush 41,\u201d said former Representative Richard A. Gephardt, Democrat of Missouri, who ran for president in 1988. Mr. Bush showed \u201cstrong presidential leadership,\u201d Mr. Gephardt said, in taking on his own party over taxes and not pursuing Iraqi troops all the way to Baghdad.But Mr. Bush\u2019s broken tax promise arguably paved the way for a revolution within, as Newt Gingrich and others wrested control from the establishment. Grover Norquist, the antitax activist who has labored to persuade Republicans never to repeat the \u201cdisaster\u201d of the 1990 tax deal, today acclaims Mr. Bush as a \u201cbrilliant president\u201d on foreign policy, who \u201cdid brilliant things.\u201d \u201cBut he threw away the presidency,\u201d Mr. Norquist laments.Jon Meacham, who is writing a biography of Mr. Bush called \u201cThe Last Gentleman,\u201d said that if Mr. Bush had a regret, \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure \u2018read my lips\u2019 is pretty high up there.\u201d But, he said, \u201cThe shriller the political climate becomes, the more attractive George H. W. Bush\u2019s essential good grace and good manners seem.\u201dIn the end, Mr. Meacham said, \u201cI do think he\u2019s very much at peace.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It is building bus and rail systems for spectators that will not be finished until long after the games are done.But the World Cup projects are just a part of a bigger national problem casting a pall over Brazil\u2019s grand ambitions: an array of lavish projects conceived when economic growth was surging that now stand abandoned, stalled or wildly over budget. The ventures were intended to help propel and symbolize Brazil\u2019s seemingly inexorable rise. But now that the country is wading through a post-boom hangover, they are exposing the nation\u2019s leaders to withering criticism, fueling claims of wasteful spending and incompetence while basic services for millions remain woeful. Some economists say the troubled projects reveal a crippling bureaucracy, irresponsible allocation of resources and bastions of corruption. Huge street protests have been aimed at costly new stadiums being built in cities like Manaus and Bras\u00edlia, whose paltry fan bases are almost sure to leave a sea of empty seats after the World Cup events are finished, adding to concerns that even more white elephants will emerge from the tournament. The growing list of troubled development projects includes a $3.4 billion network of concrete canals in the drought-plagued hinterland of northeast Brazil \u2014 which was supposed to be finished in 2010 \u2014 as well as dozens of new wind farms idled by a lack of transmission lines and unfinished luxury hotels blighting Rio de Janeiro\u2019s skyline.Economists surveyed by the nation\u2019s central bank see Brazil\u2019s economy growing just 1.63 percent this year, down from 7.5 percent in 2010, making 2014 the fourth straight year of slow growth. While an economic crisis here still seems like a remote possibility, investors have grown increasingly pessimistic. Standard & Poor\u2019s cut Brazil\u2019s credit rating last month, saying it expected slow growth to persist for several years.Making matters tougher for the government, it is an election year, with a poll last month showing support for President Dilma Rousseff\u2019s administration falling to 36 percent from 43 percent in November as sluggish economic conditions persist.Ms. Rousseff\u2019s supporters contend that the public spending has worked, helping to keep unemployment at historical lows and preventing what would have been a much worse economic slowdown had the government not pumped its considerable resources into infrastructure development.Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Ms. Rousseff\u2019s political mentor and predecessor as president, put many of the costly infrastructure projects into motion during his administration, from 2003 to 2010. In a recent interview, he acknowledged that some of the ventures were facing long delays. But he contended that before he came into office, Brazil had gone for decades without investing in public works projects, so the country essentially had to start from scratch.\u201cWe stayed for 20 years without making or developing any public infrastructure projects,\u201d Mr. da Silva said. \u201cWe had no projects in the drawer.\u201dFirst, they say, Brazil gives extraordinary influence to a web of state-controlled companies, banks and pension funds to invest in ill-advised projects. Then other bastions of the vast public bureaucracy cripple projects with audits and lawsuits.\u201cFor infrastructure projects which deserve state support and get it,\u201d Mr. Lazzarini continued, \u201cthere\u2019s the daunting task of dealing with the risks that the state itself creates.\u201dThe Transnordestina, a railroad begun in 2006 here in northeast Brazil, illustrates some of the pitfalls plaguing projects big and small. Scheduled to be finished in 2010 at a cost of about $1.8 billion, the railroad, designed to stretch more than 1,000 miles, is now expected to cost at least $3.2 billion, with most financing from state banks. Officials say it should be completed around 2016.But with work sites abandoned because of audits and other setbacks months ago in and around Paulistana, a town in Piau\u00ed, one of Brazil\u2019s poorest states, even that timeline seems optimistic. Long stretches where freight trains were already supposed to be running stand deserted. Wiry vaqueiros, or cowboys, herd cattle in the shadow of ghostly railroad bridges that tower 150 feet above parched valleys.\u201cThieves are pillaging metal from the work sites,\u201d said Adailton Vieira da Silva, 42, an electrician who labored with thousands of others before work halted last year. \u201cNow there are just these bridges left in the middle of nowhere.\u201dBrazil\u2019s transportation minister, C\u00e9sar Borges, expressed exasperation with the delays in finishing the railroad, which is needed to transport soybean harvests to port. He listed the bureaucracies that delay projects like the Transnordestina: the Federal Court of Accounts; the Office of the Comptroller General; an environmental protection agency; an institute protecting archaeological patrimony; agencies protecting the rights of indigenous peoples and descendants of escaped slaves; and the Public Ministry, a body of independent prosecutors.Still, Mr. Borges insisted, \u201cProjects get delayed in countries around the world, not just Brazil.\u201dMr. da Silva, who oversaw the start of work on the Transnordestina eight years ago, was frank about the role of his Workers Party, once the opposition in Brazil\u2019s National Congress, in creating such delays. \u201cWe created a machinery, an oversight machinery, that is the biggest oversight machinery in the world,\u201d he said, explaining how his party helped create a labyrinthine system of audits and environmental controls before he and Ms. Rousseff were elected.\u201cWhen you\u2019re in the opposition, you want to create difficulties for those that are in the administration,\u201d Mr. da Silva said. \u201cBut we forget that maybe one day we\u2019ll take office.\u201dThen there is the extraterrestrial museum in Varginha, a city in southeast Brazil where residents claimed to have seen an alien in 1996. Officials secured federal money to build the museum, but now all that remains of the unfinished project is the rusting carcass of what looks like a flying saucer.\u201cThat museum,\u201d said Roberto Macedo, an economist at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, \u201cis an insult to both extraterrestrials and the terrestrial beings like ourselves who foot the bill for yet another project failing to deliver.\u201d Brazil\u2019s economic boom bore big construction projects to empower its impoverished interior. But as the economy cools, many are unfinished, leaving a legacy of division and dislocation.Taylor Barnes contributed reporting from Rio de Janeiro, and Rick Gladstone from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Debt Trap", "Date": "2014-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cWe cannot mortgage the material assets of our grandchildren without asking the loss also of their political and spiritual heritage.\u201d So said President Dwight Eisenhower in his 1961 farewell address. In his new book, \u201cAmerica\u2019s Fiscal Constitution,\u201d Bill White, the Democratic former mayor of Houston, argues that Eisenhower was part of a forgotten American tradition, once embraced by both Democrats and Republicans, of limiting the use of debt except under extraordinary circumstances like war and severe economic downturns. Any use of debt was temporary; afterward, the federal government promptly balanced its budget.This book will be music to the ears of budget hawks everywhere. \u201cAmerican economic history does not support the idea that a strong economy depends on chronic federal borrowing,\u201d White writes. But our tradition collapsed in 2001, and today, the government routinely borrows a third or more of its expenses. The nation is \u201cin a situation similar to that of an employee who receives annual pay raises but cannot improve his or her standard of living because of the need to pay rising debt service to creditors.\u201d This is history from the perspective of dollars and cents. White begins with the \u201cinsolvent\u201d Congress of the Confederation to explain the founding fathers\u2019 attitudes toward debt, highlighting the role that money has played in our wars. He also explains the creation of Social Security and Medicare, and how the necessarily complex accounting for these programs began to undermine the core principle of pay-as-you-go budget clarity. Familiar figures pop up \u2014 Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton \u2014 along with a few surprises. There\u2019s Albert Gallatin, the frontiersman turned secretary of the Treasury, and the \u201cultraconservative\u201d Harry F. Byrd Sr., the Senate Finance Committee chairman during the Kennedy years, who \u201cconsidered tax breaks financed with debt as a type of federal subsidy.\u201d There\u2019s Andrew Mellon, Treasury secretary in the 1920s, who, although embraced by proponents of today\u2019s supply-side economics, in fact disagreed with the idea that borrowing with reduced taxes was better than high taxes with reduced debt.And there\u2019s Franklin Roosevelt, who told his staff to \u201crefrain from claiming that public works created indirect jobs as a result of spending by construction workers\u201d because he didn\u2019t want to create the impression that the government could create prosperity by spending large amounts of borrowed money. \u201cA careful student of history,\u201d Roosevelt also asked his staff \u201cto actively search for spending bills that he could veto as a sign of his financial stewardship\u201d \u2014 in stark contrast to today. White, deputy energy secretary during the Clinton administration, identifies as a \u201cfiscally conservative politician with progressive principles.\u201d His take on recent administrations isn\u2019t surprising. On Reagan: \u201cNever in the nation\u2019s history had a president proposed large, simultaneous spending increases and tax cuts when the federal budget already had a deficit.\u201d White is a fan of Clinton, who tried (and failed) to remove Social Security and Medicare trust funds from the unified budget, which would have returned the budget to some semblance of clarity. But \u201cAmerica\u2019s Fiscal Constitution\u201d mostly lets the numbers speak for themselves. White resists ideologically easy answers, like taxing the rich, because he says the numbers don\u2019t work. He notes that very high tax rates have led to tax evasion. He also compiles a list of what he calls \u201cmyths concerning federal debt.\u201d One such myth is the notion that partisan gridlock is a major impediment. White points out that from 2001 to 2006, \u201cdebt-financed appropriations bills sailed through Congress with lopsided bipartisan majorities.\u201dIn his measured way, he is critical of both George W. Bush and Barack Obama \u2014 both of whom have stressed the importance of balanced budgets with great rhetorical flourish. But for six years Bush didn\u2019t veto a single spending bill, White notes. When faced with enormous deficits in 2003, he \u201casked Congress to pass debt-financed tax cuts, an expansion of Medicare and substantial funding for the reconstruction of two nations occupied by American forces.\u201d And Obama was responsible for expanding medical coverage when the government couldn\u2019t afford to pay for Medicare. \u201cFederal leaders have always had a long list of spending items or tax cuts they would support only if they could be funded with available tax revenue,\u201d White writes. \u201cThe nation\u2019s founding fathers deferred many of their own cherished plans until the nation paid off its debts.\u201d This is an important book, but not an easy one. The detail frequently creates clutter rather than clarity, and if you don\u2019t understand monetary policy well, you\u2019ll need to rely on Google for explanations. Nor does it make happy reading, although White does offer specific solutions \u2014 for example, a budget that allows members of Congress to vote only for tax-funded appropriations. And we have the model of the past, of earlier generations who followed the path of fiscal safety and \u201covercame partisan, regional and ethnic obstacles far greater than those today.\u201d In other words, we can do it.

{"Headline": "Sweden Turns Japanese", "Date": "2014-04-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThen the sadomonetarists moved in.Sure enough, Swedish unemployment stopped falling soon after the rate hikes began. Deflation took a little longer, but it eventually arrived. The rock star of the recovery has turned itself into Japan.In short, this was a classic case of sadomonetarism in action.I\u2019m using that term (coined by William Keegan of The Observer) advisedly, not just to be colorful. At least as I define it, sadomonetarism is an attitude, common among monetary officials and commentators, that involves a visceral dislike for low interest rates and easy money, even when unemployment is high and inflation is low. You find many sadomonetarists at international organizations; in the United States they tend to dwell on Wall Street or in right-leaning economics departments. They don\u2019t, I\u2019m happy to say, exert much influence at the Federal Reserve \u2014 but they do constantly harass the Fed, demanding that it stop its efforts to boost employment.And when I say that the dislike for low rates is visceral, I mean just that. While sadomonetarists may offer what sound like coherent analytical rationales for their policy views, they don\u2019t change their policy views in response to changing conditions \u2014 they just invent new rationales. This strongly suggests that what we\u2019re looking at here is a gut feeling rather than a thought-out position.Where does this gut dislike for low rates come from? At some level it has to reflect an instinctive identification with the interests of wealthy creditors as opposed to usually poorer debtors. But it\u2019s also driven, I believe, by the desire of many monetary officials to pose as serious, tough-minded people \u2014 and to demonstrate how tough they are by inflicting pain.Whatever their motives, sadomonetarists have already done a lot of damage. In Sweden they have extracted defeat from the jaws of victory, turning an economic success story into a tale of stagnation and deflation as far as the eye can see.And they could do much more damage in the future. Financial markets have been fairly calm lately \u2014 no big banking crises, no imminent threats of euro breakup. But it would be wrong and dangerous to assume that recovery is assured: bad policies could all too easily undermine our still-sluggish economic progress. So when serious-sounding men in dark suits tell you that it\u2019s time to stop all this easy money and raise rates, beware: Look at what such people have done to Sweden. Advertisement"}

The army did not give details on who was in the trucks or where along the border the strike took place. Syrian state news media said the vehicles did not belong to the Syrian Army.The Jordanian government has denied that it assists either side in the conflict.Jordanian security forces routinely arrest smugglers on the border, and sometimes clash with them, but such airstrikes are rare.Qaisar Habib, an activist in southern Syria, said in a Skype interview that the vehicles hit Wednesday morning belonged to a Syrian rebel group. He said the attack showed that the Jordanian government was \u201cvery sensitive\u201d about the border as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, an extremist militant group, tries to establish a presence in southern Syria.Mr. Habib said the strike also could have been a signal from Jordan that it would not tolerate recent attempts by another militant group, the Nusra Front, to attack the Nasib border crossing, which is surrounded by rebel-held territory but still run by the Syrian government.Jordan has pressured the rebels not to attack the crossing, which would disrupt trade between Jordan and Syria.\u201cThe incident today can be translated as a clear message to everyone that this is not allowed,\u201d Mr. Habib said.But Abu al-Majd al-Zoubi, a spokesman for the Yarmouk Division, a prominent rebel group, said the vehicles did not belong to any rebel group.Rebels in southern Syria complained in recent interviews that while they received aid from their international backers though Jordan, the assistance was not enough to allow them to advance. Many think it is fueling a stalemate and prolonging the war.Also on Wednesday, Ahmad Assi al-Jarba, the president of the exile National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, said the group was open to attending a third round of talks aimed at ending the war, Reuters reported.\u201cIf the Syrian government is sincere, the National Coalition is willing to join the third round of talks in Geneva,\u201d said Mr. Jarba, according to a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China, which Mr. Jarba was visiting for talks with China\u2019s foreign minister, Wang Yi.In Beijing, Mr. Wang said China supported a political solution to a crisis that \u201chas reached a new critical moment.\u201dChina has joined Russia to veto several United Nations Security Council resolutions against the Syrian government, while calling for a political solution and occasionally meeting with opposition figures.Anne Barnard reported from Beirut, and Karam Shoumali from Istanbul.

{"Headline": "South Sudan Cannot Starve", "Date": "2014-04-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialA staggering 3.7 million people, roughly one-third of the population, are facing starvation in South Sudan, where a civil war has created a humanitarian catastrophe. But many countries have ignored or given short shrift to the United Nations\u2019 urgent appeal for aid. They must do better. Of the $1.27 billion the United Nations has requested for 2014, only $385 million has been received. Officials say South Sudan needs $230 million more in the next 60 days to avoid the worst starvation in Africa since the 1980s, when hundreds of thousands perished in Ethiopia. Along with food and water, seeds and farming tools are needed so crops can be planted before the end of May when rains bring the planting season to an end.This should not be happening. Over two years ago, when South Sudan declared independence from Sudan, everyone knew the struggle to build a functioning state would be long and hard. But the new country had important supporters, including the United States, which strongly advocated its independence, gave considerable aid and was ready to work with South Sudan\u2019s leaders as they moved forward and tried to resolve disputes with Sudan over borders and oil resources, which seemed to be the main challenges.Since December, however, the more pernicious threat to stability has been homegrown. That is when a political rivalry between South Sudan\u2019s president, Salva Kiir of the Dinka tribe, and Riek Machar, the former vice president and a Nuer, erupted into violence. Thousands of people have been killed and one million have been forced to flee their homes. The United Nations has accused both sides of mass atrocities. On Thursday, President Obama took an important step by issuing an executive order that allows the imposition of sanctions on South Sudanese officials and opposition leaders viewed as a threat to peace.Other humanitarian disasters, including Syria\u2019s, are taxing many countries. But let\u2019s face it, it is usually the same donors (the West and Japan) who can be counted on to respond to emergency appeals. In 2013 and 2014, for instance, America has funneled $411 million in humanitarian aid to South Sudan. China and Russia, the second- and eighth-largest economies, hardly ever appear on these lists. They should join the rest of the world in making sure that South Sudan\u2019s people have enough to eat. It would be unspeakably tragic if they gained their independence only to starve to death at the hands of their leaders.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Deadly Blast at Fruit Market Shatters Calm in Pakistan\u2019s Capital", "Date": "2014-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 In the deadliest attack on the Pakistani capital in more than five years, a powerful explosion ripped through a crowded market in Islamabad on Wednesday, killing at least 22 people and suggesting that, after a long stretch of relative calm, the city was back in the firing line of the country\u2019s militants.The bomb, which the police said had been hidden in a crate of guava and possibly triggered by remote control, went off in the early morning at a wholesale fruit market on the edge of the city. Video on television showed the devastating aftermath \u2014 charred debris, shattered carts and bloodstained fruit \u2014 while witnesses spoke of seeing dismembered limbs and bodies flung high into the air. At least 100 people were reported to have been injured.Immediately after the attack, a spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban said that the group had nothing to do with it. He criticized the violence against civilians \u2014 the group\u2019s stock in trade since its formal emergence in 2007 \u2014 and insisted that the Taliban were observing a cease-fire until Thursday in support of peace talks with the government.\u201cAttacks on public places and targeting innocent people is regrettable and un-Islamic,\u201d the spokesman, Shahidullah Shahid, said in a statement released to the Pakistani news media.Instead, a man identifying himself as a spokesman for a little-known separatist group, the United Baluch Army, claimed responsibility for the bombing.But then the Interior Ministry took the unusual step of trying to discredit the group\u2019s claim \u2014 all the while declining to say who it thought was responsible.\u201cIt is not only surprising, but ridiculous that the United Baluch Army has claimed responsibility for the attack,\u201d a ministry spokesman said in a text message to reporters. \u201cAccording to government and intelligence agency investigations, the root of this incident can be found elsewhere.\u201dThe statement concluded that \u201cwhoever is responsible\u201d would be brought to justice.Baluch separatists have been fighting for independence from Pakistan for about eight years, accusing the central government of ignoring their sprawling, poverty-stricken province. But the United Baluch Army is not among the main militant groups, which until now have generally limited their attacks to Baluchistan Province.The conflicting claims and emergence of shadowy groups come at a tense time in Pakistan, and come against a background of fluctuating relations among the civilian government, the Taliban and the military.The attacks throughout the cease-fire have been taken as either an attempt by the Pakistani Taliban to negotiate through force, or as evidence that the group, always a relatively loose confederation of militants, might be fracturing into violent internal divisions.Reports from the tribal belt indicate sharp disagreements between militants from the Mehsud tribe, who used to lead the Pakistani Taliban and are said to favor talks, and the militant group\u2019s recently chosen leader, Maulana Fazlullah, who reportedly opposes them. Further, there have been growing reports of violence within the Mehsud faction itself.\u201cThe militants are not a monolith. There are different factions and not all of them agree on peace talks,\u201d said Rasul Baksh Rais, the director general of the Institute of Strategic Studies. \u201cA lot of foreign intelligence agencies have also entered into the subversive element of militancy.\u201dThe talks began in earnest on March 26, and since then have drawn sharp criticism from opposition leaders, like Bilawal Bhutto Zardari of the Pakistan Peoples Party, who accuse Mr. Sharif of ceding too much ground to the militants. Last week, the Interior Ministry announced the release of 19 Taliban prisoners from the Mehsud tribe. Government officials say more prisoners will be freed this week.Mr. Sharif\u2019s position is further complicated by his fragile relationship with the country\u2019s military leadership. Plans to mount a military offensive against the Taliban stronghold of North Waziristan, which appeared imminent in February, have been shelved. Some army commanders have privately indicated they believe the time has come to fight, not talk, with the Taliban.The army and Mr. Sharif are also arguing over the fate of the former military ruler, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, who faces treason charges in the Supreme Court. The army is bitterly opposed to the trial, which it views as a challenge to its authority. Mr. Sharif\u2019s government insists the case must go ahead.Salman Masood reported from Islamabad, and Declan Walsh from London.Advertisement"}

Booker, Democrat of New Jersey and one of the most junior members of the Senate, said it was surreal to see the play and then return to the actual Senate floor and hear colleagues discuss a play that was partially set on the Senate floor.

Schumer, Democrat of New York, raved about the play during a meeting in the Oval Office and said he encouraged President Obama to attend if possible. At a recent weekly luncheon of Senate Democrats, Mr. Schumer urged all of his colleagues to catch it before it ends in late June \u2014 and not just for the potential economic boost to his hometown.\u201cI think it will make them all better senators,\u201d said Mr. Schumer, who added that one scene hit particularly close to home, because he once held the House seat previously filled by Representative Emanuel Celler of New York, who is a minor character in the play as a supporter of the civil rights bill (though he was less keen on equality between the sexes). \u201cIt makes you feel close to history,\u201d Mr. Schumer said.And as many have noted, even if it takes a bruising amount of skulduggery, ruthlessness, arm twisting or horse trading, at least something gets done.

For instance, there is Representative William M. Colmer, the Mississippi segregationist who claims that Congress is being subjected to \u201cblackmail, if you will\u201d to pass the bill. Senate giants like Richard B. Russell Jr. of Georgia and Everett Dirksen of Illinois loom large, even though they are now known more by the Senate office buildings named for them.To Ms. Pelosi, Mr. Israel and others, the answer is no.

Designers like Frank Del Giudice of Teague Associates, creator of the Tiger Lounge, sought to use the new, expanded interior space provided by the 747 and counterparts like the DC-10 in both first class and economy to usher in a long epoch of the kind of elegant, sociable travel once reserved for oceangoing ships.

But during that apex moment for personal comfort in American air travel, innovations like the Tiger Lounge seemed the wave of the future \u2014 at least for the affluent passengers sought by the highly regulated, highly profitable major airlines.Because the (now-defunct) Civil Aeronautics Board controlled prices and routes, those big carriers competed for fliers on the basis of service.

The airlines thereupon jousted overwhelmingly on the basis of computer-driven price-cutting. Expensive interiors, meals and service became a luxury they could no longer afford \u2014 especially when those carriers, now called \u201clegacy\u201d airlines, went bankrupt and many remaining employees lost their pensions.Thus the Age of the Tiger Lounge ultimately lasted only about eight years.Advertisement"}

The decline came with sentiment in the manufacturing sector bumping along at weak levels since January and with real estate prices beginning to rise less quickly and overall industrial activity starting to grow less briskly.The State Council, China\u2019s cabinet, made clear its willingness to step in with a statement late Wednesday night, following a meeting that day.The statement described officials at the meeting as saying that China would \u201cstimulate enterprises, expand domestic consumption and boost employment\u201d this year.The government is also ready to adopt further fiscal measures if needed to help the economy \u201cin coping with unexpected challenges,\u201d the statement noted.Economists described the government\u2019s new effort as the beginnings of a \u201cmini-stimulus\u201d campaign.Qu Hongbin, the co-head of Asian economic research at HSBC, and Sun Junwei, the bank\u2019s China economist, said in a research note, \u201cThis may be a start of a slew of fine-turning measures.\u201dYet the government\u2019s promise of support drew a lukewarm welcome in the Shanghai stock market Thursday. Share prices edged up in the morning, only to slump in the afternoon, for a loss of 0.7 percent for the day, dragged down by the stocks of banks and real estate developers.The decline reflected worries that government stimulus measures may not go far enough. The announcement Wednesday night had only one immediate consequence: an extension for one more year, through 2016, of an existing exemption from business taxes for the first 60,000 renminbi, or almost $10,000, of profits at small businesses. The State Council also said it was mulling a significant increase in the amount of profits that would be exempted.The statement contained few other details, except to mention that railroad construction would be carried out rapidly and the renovation of rundown urban neighborhoods would continue.China plans to open 4,100 miles of new rail lines this year, an increase of 620 miles from last year.Prime Minister Li Keqiang has said the government will build or renovate homes for 4.7 million people living in makeshift shelters.China also intervened in currency markets on a huge scale in late February and through March, issuing torrents of renminbi to buy up dollars. That had the effect of at least temporarily driving the value of the renminbi down about 1 percent, which helps make Chinese exports more competitive in foreign markets. The extra renminbi moving through the economy also brought down short-term interest rates, making it easier for troubled real estate developers and other large borrowers to continue borrowing.But the scale of China\u2019s measures so far is much smaller than those in 2009, during the global financial crisis. China limited its slowdown then with a huge spending program. The nation\u2019s central bank also expanded China\u2019s broadly measured money supply on a scale that dwarfed what the Federal Reserve achieved in the United States with its quantitative easing \u2014 the manipulation of the money supply and interest rates in an effort to stimulate growth.Chinese leaders have called repeatedly since then for a shift toward consumption-led growth, but achieving that has proved difficult.The Asian Development Bank in a report on Tuesday called for governments across Asia, including China\u2019s, to adjust their fiscal policies to promote economic growth that is more inclusive of the poor.Zhuang Juzhong, the deputy chief economist of the Manila-based regional lending institution, said in an interview in Hong Kong on Wednesday that China relies heavily on consumption taxes to finance government spending, which does little to address the country\u2019s gap between rich and poor.Consumption taxes, mainly a value-added tax that reaches 17 percent for a wide range of consumer goods, represent almost half of government revenues in China. That compares with less than a third of government revenues in most affluent countries.At the same time, China has struggled to figure out how to introduce property taxes, which would tend to fall more heavily on the rich, and collects only a tenth of government revenues through personal income taxes, compared with about a third for affluent countries.Advertisement"}

At the initial rallies to mark the day, people warned of overpopulation, a denuded planet, hundreds of millions of people starving to death, a new Ice Age or the greenhouse effect. Many \u2014 though not all, obviously \u2014 of those forecasts were off.Here is our overview of how the environment has changed in the 44 years since April 22, 1970:The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration began tracking atmospheric concentrations of CFC-11, one of the most significant types, in 1977, measuring it at about 140 parts per trillion. That number nearly doubled, to 270 parts per trillion, in 1994 before beginning a slow decline as production was phased out and existing CFCs were replaced by other chemicals. In January 2014, the concentration measured 233.8 parts per trillion, down about 13 percent from its peak.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Global Warming Scare Tactics", "Date": "2014-04-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsShowtime\u2019s producers undoubtedly have the best of intentions. There are serious long-term risks associated with rising greenhouse gas emissions, ranging from ocean acidification to sea-level rise to decreasing agricultural output. But there is every reason to believe that efforts to raise public concern about climate change by linking it to natural disasters will backfire. More than a decade\u2019s worth of research suggests that fear-based appeals about climate change inspire denial, fatalism and polarization. Other factors contributed. Some conservatives and fossil-fuel interests questioned the link between carbon emissions and global warming. And beginning in 2007, as the country was falling into recession, public support for environmental protection declined. Still, environmental groups have known since 2000 that efforts to link climate change to natural disasters could backfire, after researchers at the Frameworks Institute studied public attitudes for its report \u201cHow to Talk About Global Warming.\u201d Messages focused on extreme weather events, they found, made many Americans more likely to view climate change as an act of God \u2014 something to be weathered, not prevented.Some people, the report noted, \u201care likely to buy an SUV to help them through the erratic weather to come\u201d for example, rather than support fuel-efficiency standards.Many climate advocates ignore these findings, arguing that they have an obligation to convey the alarming facts. Claims that current disasters are connected to climate change do seem to motivate many liberals to support action. But they alienate conservatives in roughly equal measure. What works, say environmental pollsters and researchers, is focusing on popular solutions. Climate advocates often do this, arguing that solar and wind can reduce emissions while strengthening the economy. But when renewable energy technologies are offered as solutions to the exclusion of other low-carbon alternatives, they polarize rather than unite. One recent study, published by Yale Law School\u2019s Cultural Cognition Project, found that conservatives become less skeptical about global warming if they first read articles suggesting nuclear energy or geoengineering as solutions. Another study, in the journal Nature Climate Change in 2012, concluded that \u201ccommunication should focus on how mitigation efforts can promote a better society\u201d rather than \u201con the reality of climate change and averting its risks.\u201d While the urgency that motivates exaggerated claims is understandable, turning down the rhetoric and embracing solutions like nuclear energy will better serve efforts to slow global warming.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Waiting for the Markets to Blink", "Date": "2014-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHEADING into the second quarter, investors seem to have little conviction about the direction of stock and bond markets. Both ended the first three months of 2014 barely changed, despite a big change in Federal Reserve policy.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index rose 1.3 percent in the period, closing near a record high. Bonds were up modestly, too, benefiting from a decline in 10-year Treasury yields to 2.72 percent, among the lowest yields of the last 50 years, from 3.03 percent. Both markets took in stride the so-called taper \u2014 a reduction in the Fed\u2019s quantitative easing or bond-buying program \u2014 and the central bank\u2019s pledge to maintain short-term interest rates at very low levels for months.But maybe the market reaction was too blas\u00e9. The returns \u2014 decent but far from extravagant \u2014 belie an apparent divergence of expectations, strategists say. Stocks are priced as if buyers can glimpse prosperity just around the corner, while bond yields indicate a belief that a thriving economy is nowhere in sight. Successful investing this year may hinge on figuring out which market is making the correct forecast.Mr. Morris comes down on the side of the stock bulls.\u201cWe think the equity market is right,\u201d he said. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, bond yields are too low.\u201d He conceded that he has been \u201cmore bearish on Treasuries than has been warranted.\u201d Even so, he warned, \u201cthe risk is that we have a sharper increase in yields than people are pricing in.\u201dAs evidence that economic conditions warrant rising yields, he cited the recovery of the European financial system in the last two years. He also mentioned comments from the new Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, that were interpreted on Wall Street as hawkish because they appeared to suggest that the Fed would begin to raise short-term interest rates six months after debt purchases ceased.Bond funds, however, didn\u2019t appear to be pricing in higher yields in the first quarter. The average bond fund in Morningstar\u2019s database was up 1.8 percent, with long-term government portfolios rising 8.1 percent. The average domestic stock fund returned 1.8 percent, with sectors such as health care, real estate and precious metals excelling.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to buy things at the right price, but it\u2019s been hard for us,\u201d Mr. Beam said. \u201cWe\u2019re constructive about the future and think all this intervention is going to work, but how much is priced in\u201d to the stock market? So much, in his view, that \u201cwe\u2019ve been selling into the strength,\u201d he said.But Mr. Beam isn\u2019t putting the proceeds into Treasury bonds. \u201cDo you believe that things are going to get better? If you do, you don\u2019t want to be in Treasuries at 2.5 percent,\u201d he said. \u201cSome things don\u2019t make sense to me. It\u2019s frustrating.\u201d\u201cFive years have passed and we still have zero percent rates,\u201d Mr. Sri-Kumar said. \u201cHow do you know there has been an economic recovery and the patient is breathing normally when it\u2019s in an oxygen tent?\u201dKeeping interest rates so low funnels excess capital into the stock market, distorting valuations, he said. It also leads borrowers and lenders to make bad decisions, he said, and it artificially increases corporate earnings by reducing interest costs to below levels where they would be if market forces set rates.Albert Edwards, a global strategist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, called the earnings reported by American companies uninspiring at best. Net profits for companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, excluding banks, are estimated to have grown by 12.8 percent last year, he pointed out in a recent note to investors.That sounds impressive, but profits in the previous year were reduced significantly by special items, flattering the 2013 results, he said. He noted that operating earnings and cash flow barely rose 4 percent and that sales were up less than 2 percent. Such anemic numbers bode ill for business investment and, in turn, economic growth, he warned.While some economic indicators have been promising lately, notably declining claims for jobless benefits, other evidence has pointed to a flagging expansion. Fourth-quarter gross domestic product growth was reported in March at an annual rate of 2.6 percent, down from a January estimate of 3.2 percent. For all of 2013, gross domestic product increased by 1.9 percent, compared with 2.8 percent for 2012.Orders and shipments of durable goods \u2014 large household and industrial machinery and other products expected to remain in use for at least three years \u2014 were flat in 2013, and housing has weakened. February was the eighth consecutive month of declines in pending home sales, leaving them down 10.2 percent from 12 months earlier.\u201cIt will be extremely difficult for the U.S. economy to escape its Great Recession hangover with this poor profits backdrop,\u201d Mr. Edwards wrote. \u201cIndeed it leaves the economy extremely vulnerable to adverse shocks,\u201d like declining growth in Asia.Reports of rapidly deteriorating credit conditions in China have become a source of global concern, reflected in shrinking forecasts for economic growth and in tumbling prices for copper and coal, commodities that are particularly sensitive to Chinese industrial output.\u201cWe\u2019ve been overweight equities for a year, and we\u2019re holding onto that,\u201d she said. \u201cWe expected this year would be more volatile, in part because of the shift in Fed policy and in part because we thought China would continue to slow. We didn\u2019t expect returns to be as great as last year, but we thought that equities would be better than other assets.\u201dFunds that focus on Chinese stocks had a weak quarter, losing 5 percent and helping to drag the average emerging-market fund to a decline of 0.6 percent. The picture was mixed for mature markets, with Europe funds rising 2.4 percent and Japan specialists down 4.4 percent. \u201cWe\u2019re keeping a very close eye on China,\u201d Ms. Patterson said. \u201cIf there are signs that it\u2019s slowing more than we expect, that would hurt our view of emerging markets and worsen the outlook for developed markets due to contagion\u201d because of the increasing importance of China in the global economy.Until that happens, she will maintain her modest appetite for stocks, emphasizing sectors like health care and technology and limiting exposure to basic materials, energy and financial services. Because she expects interest rates to rise, she recommends bonds with shorter maturities, mainly Treasury instruments and mortgage securities. For well-off investors who can afford them, hedge funds are worthy investments, she said, because \u201cif you have good managers you\u2019ll get good returns over all, but with less volatility than the stock market.\u201dMr. Beam detects pockets of value in the stock market \u2014 American real estate companies and European banks, for instance \u2014 but he is keeping 13 percent of his fund in cash because of a dearth of attractive investment choices.\u201cI\u2019m being careful these days with my capital,\u201d he said.Mr. Morris finds a wider array of opportunities. He likes shares of consumer-discretionary companies, which provide the products and services that people want but do not need. The sector includes businesses as diverse as hotels, carmakers and clothing stores.The economic recovery has lagged as a result of \u201clower-than-normal household spending,\u201d he said. \u201cAs things improve, there are a lot of things people can buy.\u201dHe also anticipates greater spending by businesses, which is why he likes the industrial sector, which includes manufacturers of business equipment. Another preferred segment is banks; he expects them to flourish as interest rates rise and the gap widens between what they charge in interest and what they pay.Mr. Morris encourages stock investors to buy American. The domestic market is likely to keep outperforming because the earnings outlook is better at home than abroad, he said.As for bonds, given his outlook for interest rates, he calls high-yield instruments \u201cthe best of various unappetizing options\u201d for the near future, although exposure to government issues still makes sense for long-term investors looking for income or diversification. \u201cFor investors thinking of retirement, the fixed-income part of the portfolio is just insurance,\u201d he said. \u201cIf things go badly, that\u2019s the part of the portfolio that\u2019s going to save you.\u201dMr. Sri-Kumar said portfolios might need all the saving they can get. He predicted continued strength in high-quality American bonds, and said the 10-year Treasury yield was likely to fall to 2.5 percent.European government bonds are a different story. Yields in the peripheral countries where the European crisis was centered have declined to levels not appreciably higher than their American counterparts, despite what he sees as substantially greater risk. He does favor some exposure to stocks, but in safe sectors like utilities and health care and other issues with high dividend payouts.\u201cStay domestic, stay risk-off, and allocate a portion of assets to high-grade fixed income,\u201d he advised.NOW that the beginning of the end of the Fed\u2019s extraordinary measures has arrived, Mr. Sri-Kumar says he is convinced that investors will face some unpleasantness before the end of the end.\u201cYou can\u2019t just unwind quantitative easing, with all of its distortions, and achieve stability without some pain along the way,\u201d he warned. \u201cWhat that pain is, when it happens, that\u2019s where the uncertainties lie. The margin to maneuver is getting less and less with the passage of time.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ferrari\u2019s Big Challenge", "Date": "2014-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial Report: Chinese Grand PrixThink Ferrari and you will probably think of a sports car with a massive, powerful, purring engine, in a road car that is about as expensive and inefficient to operate as a private jet. So it is no surprise that of the three engine manufacturers in the Formula One racing series, which is preparing for its fourth race of the season at the Chinese Grand Prix at Shanghai on Sunday, Ferrari seems the least able to benefit from the new engine rules that have dominated the racing discussion so far this year. The downsized 6-cylinder, 1.6-liter turbo-charged engines with a maximum of 15,000 r.p.m. and a fuel consumption of no more than 100 kilograms over the race \u2014 to say nothing of the 160-horsepower energy-recuperation systems \u2014 are far from the legendary 12-cylinder monsters of the Italian racing team\u2019s glory days. They are also a far cry from the sports cars that Ferrari sells to its rich, horsepower-hungry clientele. And judging by the complaints over the first three races of the season, from Ferrari fans to the highest levels of the company\u2019s management, it is also a far cry from the image the company wants to give in Formula One.Before the previous race, in Bahrain two weeks ago, Luca di Montezemolo, the Ferrari chairman, compared the new engine setup to \u201ctaxi-cab driving,\u201d criticizing the technical regulations\u2019 focus on fuel and tire conservation and a lack of appreciation for what has traditionally made the series a reflection of the Ferrari road car: high-octane, loud, fossil-fuel-burning pure brute power racing. Then the Bahrain Grand Prix produced one of the most exciting races in recent memory. But a Mercedes-powered car again won the race \u2014 as it had the two first races \u2014 while the best-placed Ferrari was only ninth. Montezemolo had left the race in disgust with 12 laps remaining. After three races, Ferrari lies fifth in the series, while three teams motorized by Mercedes are in the top three spots, and the Renault-powered Red Bull is in fourth. The two other Ferrari-powered teams, Marussia and Sauber, have scored no points. Yet despite its blustery, public condemning of the new Formula One, Ferrari not only has business to gain from this new format, but until the year began it vaunted its aspirations. In what amounted finally to conceding that the team itself has failed to rise to the challenge, Stefano Domenicali, the director of the racing team, announced his resignation last Monday It should not have been a surprise. In a promotional video about the challenge posed by the new rules made last year by Shell Oil, the Ferrari fuel supplier, the tone was of optimism rather than denunciation of the new technical regulations.\u201cEveryone has to start from zero, and everyone has to think about the power-train, has to think about the car,\u201d said Luigi Fraboni, head of engine trackside operations for Ferrari. \u201cI am confident that Ferrari will interpret the new rules better than the others, and we will be successful again next year.\u201dThe problem was, however, that because Ferrari is the only team that has taken part in the series since its inception in 1950, because it is the most victorious in the total number of constructors\u2019 and drivers\u2019 titles it has won, with 31, and in the number of Grand Prix race victories, with 221, and because it is an Italian national icon and obsession, it is also under the spotlight like no other racing team.\u201cBeing Ferrari, you have to win,\u201d said Luca Marmorini, director of engine and electronics, in the video. \u201cSecond position is not a position for Ferrari.\u201dBut in an interview a couple of hours before the race in Bahrain, in what would turn out to be one of his last, Domenicali countered some of the popular views about Ferrari\u2019s commitment to the new, greener formula. He pointed out that the original idea for the smaller engines had come from Renault \u2014 largely supported by Mercedes \u2014 and that Renault had considered leaving the series if it did not become more relevant to developing road cars in line with regulations in many countries calling for reduced carbon dioxide emissions and better fuel economy. The same reasoning is true for Ferrari, even if to a lesser degree, Domenicali said. \u201cIt is important, because the regulations on fuel consumption are quite strict,\u201d he said. \u201cIn certain markets \u2014 it depends where \u2014 you pay a lot of money in terms of taxes, for pollution and so on. So therefore, I assume and I believe, that something will be beneficial for sure also in that area for us.\u201dAnd he said that the kinetic-energy-recovery system was relevant to the new LaFerrari hybrid car that was unveiled at the Geneva auto show last year and the turbo was relevant to the new Ferrari California model. On the other hand, Ferrari is behind the mass-market road car companies in terms of being able to call on huge research and development resources from the parent company for development of the electronic hybrid technology. Both Mercedes and Renault in their Formula One engine programs have called directly on the resources of the parent company to solve problems with the new technology. \u201cIt is a brand new technology brought into Formula One, so there is also a learning curve that you have to pass through,\u201d Domenicali said. \u201cAnd I assume that the one that could have a better knowledge of certain technologies in the new power unit concept may have a shorter learning curve because of the knowledge that they already have.\u201dIn the end, Domenicali said, complaints from the fans go beyond the disgruntlement of the fans and the team at not winning races. \u201cThe point is that from one side there is technology and from the other side there is the sporting approach; so we need to balance between the two,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the sporting side we need to make sure that people feel Formula One is a performance formula, not a formula of efficiency. That is the main aspect.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russia Economy Worsens Even Before Sanctions Hit", "Date": "2014-04-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Margarita R. Zobnina, a professor of marketing here, has been watching the Russian economy\u2019s gathering woes with mounting alarm: friends who have moved abroad with no plans to return; others who put off new business ventures because of rising uncertainty. Meanwhile, Ms. Zobnina and her husband, Alexander, also a professor, have rented a safe deposit box to hold foreign cash as a hedge against the declining ruble.Most shocking, she says, is that her local grocery is now selling anchovies packed in sunflower oil rather than olive oil, an obvious response to the soaring cost of imports. \u201cThat really freaks me out,\u201d she said.While the annexation of Crimea has rocketed President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s approval rating to more than 80 percent, it has also contributed to a sobering downturn in Russia\u2019s economy, which was in trouble even before the West imposed sanctions. With inflation rising, growth stagnating, the ruble and stock market plunging, and billions in capital fleeing the country for safety, the economy is teetering on the edge of recession, as the country\u2019s minister of economic development acknowledged on Wednesday. Mr. Putin, who just lavished $50 billion on the Sochi Olympics, also must now absorb the costs of integrating Crimea, which economists and other experts say has its own sickly economy and expensive infrastructure needs. The economic costs have been masked by recent patriotic fervor but could soon haunt the Kremlin, as prices rise, wages stall and consumer confidence erodes.Even before the Crimean episode, and the resulting imposition of sanctions by the West, Russia\u2019s $2 trillion economy was suffering from stagflation, that toxic mix of stagnant growth and high inflation typically accompanied by a spike in unemployment. In Russia, joblessness remains low, but only because years of population decline have produced a shrunken, inadequate labor force.\u201cThis is our fee of sorts for conducting an independent foreign policy,\u201d Aleksei L. Kudrin, a former Russian finance minister, said at a recent investor conference in Moscow. He added that the sanctions and the fallout from Mr. Putin\u2019s foreign policy moves would drain hundreds of billions of dollars from the national economy and strangle growth for the remainder of the year.But Mr. Kudrin, who quit his post in a dispute over the Kremlin\u2019s economic policies, said the population had yet to confront the full bill, which he predicted would grow as a result of the steep costs of absorbing Crimea, a geographically isolated peninsula. \u201cSociety has not yet seen the final result, and that will be when this puts the brakes on real incomes,\u201d he said. \u201cFor now, society accepts this fee.\u201dFrom a textbook perspective, the deep-rooted ills in Russia\u2019s economy have been clear for years: The decade-long skyrocketing in energy prices that buoyed Mr. Putin\u2019s popularity has flatlined, exposing the country\u2019s dangerous over-reliance on revenues from oil and natural gas. Efforts to diversify into manufacturing, high technology and other sectors have failed, and officials have been unable, or unwilling, to stop the rampant, corrosive corruption that scares off foreign investors.Consumer demand, which had been a primary driver of the Russian economy in recent years, stalled hard in 2013. Surveys by the Levada Center, Russia\u2019s only independent polling institute, show that consumer sentiment has been on a slow, steady decline since 2010, while fears of inflation \u2014 especially rising prices for basic necessities, which have persisted since the 1990s \u2014 have grown along with new anxiety about a potential drop in wages or rising unemployment.\u201cIf you want to open your eyes, you would admit that it is a slow, downward trend of social optimism and consumer optimism,\u201d said Marina Krasilnikova, who leads income and consumer research for the Levada Center.\u201cThe situation with Ukraine and Crimea has resulted in patriotic and imperialistic optimism,\u201d Ms. Krasilnikova said. But, she added, \u201cthis optimism will not last long.\u201dSome analysts said that Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea had proved that Mr. Putin puts politics ahead of reasonable economic decisions, and that there was little reason for economic optimism, particularly given his inward, xenophobic turn, including his vow to create Russia\u2019s own cashless pay systems and even its own credit rating agency so it would not have to rely on the global financial system.Miljenko Horvat, a private equity investor who ran Citibank\u2019s office in Russia in the 1990s, said that Russia had simply failed to make itself economically relevant beyond its energy supplies.Mr. Horvat, who now lives in Vancouver, British Columbia, said that he often challenged his Russian friends by making the following point: \u201cI wake up in the morning and drink coffee from a machine made by a Swiss company, Nescaf\u00e9. I wear something that was designed in France or Italy but probably made in Turkey. I get into a German car, look at a Korean phone, use a computer that was designed in California but made in Japan or Korea. Russia just doesn\u2019t touch me in my daily life. It just doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s just not relevant. So where is the economic engine going to come from?\u201dMr. Horvat said that he had lived in Russia through defaults in 1991, 1993 and 1998 and that he expected another one. \u201cI am not long in Russia,\u201d he said, invoking the financial term for betting on a rising stock, \u201cneither in my portfolio, nor in life.\u201dBut even without a shock, it is not clear how Russia will manage to climb out of the current quagmire. Stagflation is among the most confounding economic problems that policy makers can face, and officials here seem flummoxed, with the Central Bank, Finance Ministry and Economics Ministry urging contradictory steps.Last month, the bank raised its key interest rate to 7 percent from 5.5 percent to combat inflation and support the ruble, a step that could slow growth. Meanwhile, the Economics Ministry, worried about growth, favors borrowing and government spending as a stimulus and to reduce capital flight, a possibly inflationary strategy that is opposed by the Finance Ministry, which wants to keep debt low and reserve funds available to weather any unexpected drop in oil prices.\u201cAll of them have their clear priorities, and they stick to their priorities,\u201d said Alexei Deviatov, the chief economist for Uralsib Capital, an investment bank here, \u201cand there is very little coordination between these authorities.\u201dWhile Russian and global investors and businesses have been moving billions of dollars out of Russia to places perceived as less risky, it is not just money that is fleeing. Ms. Zobnina, who teaches at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow, said that one of her classmates had left for the United States after college 10 years ago, and that another friend followed three years ago to pursue a Ph.D., with no plans to return. Still another friend, a journalist, moved to London last summer with her husband and three children.Ms. Zobnina, 32, said that she and her husband, 30, were thinking about finding posts in Europe or the United States, and for now were keeping their savings in dollars and euros. In an interview, she conceded that putting cash in a safe deposit box hardly amounted to sophisticated financial planning, particularly for two economics professors.\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely not rational to prefer safe box than deposit because you lose interest,\u201d she said. \u201cBut in this unpredictable situation, when the ruble is falling and banks are unstable \u2014 and who knows when we\u2019ll be cut off from the global financial system or which bank will be next to be closed \u2014 it\u2019s better to have this small bird in hand.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}

LOUIS \u2014 BY now most of us know the basic facts of America\u2019s rising income inequality: Since the early 1970s, the gap between the top and bottom of the income distribution has expanded significantly; what\u2019s more, the only group to have experienced real economic gains during this period has been those in the top 20 percent, with gains heavily concentrated in the top 10, 5 and \u2014 most famously \u2014 1 percent. The picture drawn of the 1 percent has been that of a static population, just as the 99 percent is often portrayed as unchanging. There is a line drawn between these two groups, and never the two shall cross. But is it the case that the top 1 percent of the income distribution are the same people year in and year out? Or, for that matter, what about the top 5, 10 and 20 percent? To what extent do everyday Americans experience these levels of affluence, at least some of the time?It turns out that 12 percent of the population will find themselves in the top 1 percent of the income distribution for at least one year. What\u2019s more, 39 percent of Americans will spend a year in the top 5 percent of the income distribution, 56 percent will find themselves in the top 10 percent, and a whopping 73 percent will spend a year in the top 20 percent of the income distribution. Yet while many Americans will experience some level of affluence during their lives, a much smaller percentage of them will do so for an extended period of time. Although 12 percent of the population will experience a year in which they find themselves in the top 1 percent of the income distribution, a mere 0.6 percent will do so in 10 consecutive years.It is clear that the image of a static 1 and 99 percent is largely incorrect. The majority of Americans will experience at least one year of affluence at some point during their working careers. (This is just as true at the bottom of the income distribution scale, where 54 percent of Americans will experience poverty or near poverty at least once between the ages of 25 and 60).Likewise, data analyzed by the I.R.S. showed similar findings with respect to the top 400 taxpayers between 1992 and 2009. While 73 percent of people who made the list did so once during this period, only 2 percent of them were on the list for 10 or more years. These analyses further demonstrate the sizable amount of turnover and movement within the top levels of the income distribution.One of the reasons for such fluidity at the top is that, over sufficiently long periods of time, most American households go through a wide range of economic experiences, both positive and negative. Individuals we interviewed spoke about hitting a particularly prosperous period where they received a bonus, or a spouse entered the labor market, or there was a change of jobs. These are the types of events that can throw households above particular income thresholds.Ultimately, this information casts serious doubt on the notion of a rigid class structure in the United States based upon income. It suggests that the United States is indeed a land of opportunity, that the American dream is still possible \u2014 but that it is also a land of widespread poverty. And rather than being a place of static, income-based social tiers, America is a place where a large majority of people will experience either wealth or poverty \u2014 or both \u2014 during their lifetimes.Rather than talking about the 1 percent and the 99 percent as if they were forever fixed, it would make much more sense to talk about the fact that Americans are likely to be exposed to both prosperity and poverty during their lives, and to shape our policies accordingly. As such, we have much more in common with one another than we dare to realize.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For China and Japan, the Economic Challenges Ahead Are Similar", "Date": "2014-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Japan and China do not always see eye to eye on politics. But when it comes to economic policy, Tokyo and Beijing have remarkably similar goals: Both want to push through far-reaching changes in their economies in the face of mounting debt and rapidly graying populations.In China, the authorities are trying to steer the economy toward more domestic consumption and growth in the service sector. In Japan, the government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is trying to haul the economy out of years of deflation and lethargic growth.To what extent each country succeeds will be of critical importance, not just to Asia, but to the world. China, with a gross domestic product of about $9 trillion last year, and Japan, with its $5 trillion economy, are the second- and third-largest economies in the world, after the United States. Much hinges on whether these economic powerhouses can succeed in their overhauls over the next few years.\u201cYou have two of the largest economies in the world firing on just one cylinder,\u201d said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economics at HSBC. \u201cThis is a critical period.\u201dAnalysts and business people have welcomed the changes that have been introduced or at least announced in China and Japan over the past 18 months.\u201cThey have recognized that they really need to do something,\u201d said Gemma Godfrey, head of investment strategy at Brooks Macdonald Asset Management in London. \u201cDon\u2019t underestimate how important that is.\u201dBut faster growth is tough to achieve, and much of the hard work is yet to come.In China, statistics show that the economy grew 7.4 percent year-on-year in the first quarter \u2014 down from 7.7 percent in the last quarter of 2013.And in Japan, a sharp drop in economic expectations among supermarket managers and restaurant workers, in a gauge released last week, hinted at worsening business conditions in coming months. The central bank refrained from stepping up its economic stimulus efforts this month but may need to do so later this year to help offset a slowdown in consumer spending that is expected to set in after a sales tax increase came into effect at the start of the month.What is more, analysts say, both Beijing and Tokyo now have to move beyond simply pump-priming their economies with cheap money, as they did after the global financial crisis. They now face the tougher challenge of making their economies and business environments more efficient and competitive.\u201cFor both China and Japan, the problems are deep-seated and structural,\u201d said Rob Subbaraman, an economist at Nomura in Singapore. \u201cIt\u2019s not a case of being able to cut interest rates to stimulate growth \u2014 they have to do more.\u201dIn China, the leaders who took the helm last year have pledged to tackle corruption and environmental degradation. Thousands of companies have been ordered to cut down excess capacity. Taxes for small businesses have been cut. The renminbi has been given more leeway to fluctuate. Beijing has permitted several small defaults, sending a signal that it will not always bail out failed investments.It has been a \u201ctough love\u201d approach \u2014 necessary to guide the economy from adolescence to maturity but bound to be painful along the way.And in the eyes of many analysts, the jury is still out on whether China can avoid a hard landing that could send ripples around the world.\u201cThe process is fraught with risks,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, a professor at Cornell University and a former head of the International Monetary Fund\u2019s China division. \u201cGiven how congealed the system is, if they introduce some economic risk, they risk unleashing a set of dynamics that could turn against them.\u201dHe added: \u201cThe scale of the problems and the economy mean that it will be a tough balancing act.\u201dWith its much more advanced economy, Japan faces somewhat different issues, but the overhaul efforts are just as crucial to the country\u2019s long-term economic prospects.Unlike the main challenge for China, the one for Japan is not to move up the manufacturing chain or to increase urbanization or infrastructure, analysts say. Instead, the rapidly aging country needs to shake up restrictive labor laws and get more women into the work force.So far, the action in Japan has been mainly in the form of government spending plans and aggressive monetary stimulus.This approach, begun last year, has helped push up growth and earnings at many Japanese companies. Sony, Toyota, Nissan and others have benefited from a weaker yen. Toyota said last month that it would raise wages for the first time since 2008. Office rents in Tokyo could climb more than 5 percent this year, as companies become more confident, the real estate services firm JLL believes. The Nikkei 225 stock index is nearly 70 percent higher than in November 2012, before hopes of an economic push began to take root.But in Japan, as in China, much of the heavy lifting still remains to be done, and many analysts worry that the initial sugar rush to the Japanese economy could fizzle.\u201cThe aggressive quantitative easing and government spending plans were low-hanging fruit,\u201d said David Mann, head of regional research in the Singapore office of Standard Chartered. Creating structural changes and making the service sector more efficient \u201cwill be much harder to do,\u201d he said.Underlining this, a business survey earlier this month showed that although the mood among large companies brightened in the three months through March, many companies were wary about the next few months. The worry is that consumer spending and economic growth will be tested by the sales tax increase that kicked in on April 1.The rise in the sales tax, crucial for getting a handle on government debt and injecting some much-needed inflation into the economy, may only \u201cstabilize but not reduce government debt,\u201d said Rajiv Biswas, chief Asia economist at the consulting firm IHS. Because Japan\u2019s population is shrinking, the number of savers who ultimately fund Japan\u2019s debt by buying government bonds is declining.Investors, now more skeptical of the challenges ahead, have sold out of Japanese stocks in recent months. The Nikkei 225, down 11.5 percent since the start of 2014, is one of the world\u2019s worst performers this year.Investors may now have to wait to get clarity on whether the reform efforts in Japan and China succeed. The \u201cfull verdict\u201d is likely to take at least two to three years to materialize, said Mr. Neumann, the HSBC economist.\u201cPolicy makers can\u2019t simply pull a rabbit out of a hat,\u201d Mr. Neumann said. \u201cBoth economies face fundamental challenges. There are no quick fixes.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": " Yellen Says Job Weakness Forestalls Raising Rates ", "Date": "2014-04-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEven as a number of indicators point to better economic times ahead, the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, Janet L. Yellen, reiterated on Wednesday that she expected interest rates to remain very low until the recovery is on a more secure footing and the American economy is more fully involving available workers and other resources. In one of her first major public speeches since assuming the top job at the Fed in February, Ms. Yellen said that while \u201cthe recovery has come a long way\u201d \u2014 citing a rebounding housing sector and a resurgent auto industry as examples \u2014 a robust and healthy job market still appeared to be \u201cmore than two years away.\u201d As a result, she said, the central bank believed that \u201ceconomic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping short-term interest rates below levels\u201d that are \u201clikely to prove normal in the longer run.\u201d Her speech seemed intended, in part, to clarify her remarks last month during her first news conference as Fed chairwoman that suggested the central bank might begin to lift rates as early as the middle of 2015. In her speech, which was given to the Economic Club of New York, Ms. Yellen also said that the risk of inflation rising above the Fed\u2019s 2 percent target remained less of a threat than the danger posed by too little inflation. She emphasized that even as the headline unemployment rate, now at 6.7 percent, has been falling, other measures of the job market\u2019s health \u2014 like the number of people forced to take part-time positions because they can\u2019t find full-time work, the still-sizable ranks of the long-term unemployed and the proportion of the population that has dropped out of the work force entirely \u2014 all point to weakness. Optimism about the economy\u2019s prospects has increased in recent weeks, with some experts arguing that the end of an unusually cold and icy winter will encourage more retail activity, hiring and construction in the months ahead, after a weak patch at the end of 2013 and the very beginning of 2014. Ms. Yellen said she and fellow Fed policy makers shared that basic outlook and \u201cgenerally believe that a significant part of the recent softness was weather-related.\u201d Throughout her speech and in the question-and-answer session afterward, Ms. Yellen emphasized that under her watch, the Fed must remain nimble enough to respond to what she called the \u201ctwists and turns\u201d of a still-recovering economy, noting unexpected roadblocks in recent years like the sovereign debt crisis in Europe and large federal budget cuts in Washington. \u201cSo we have, indeed, had a disappointingly slow recovery, and our consistent expectations for a pickup in growth have been dashed over a number of years,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the labor market is behaving in some perplexing ways and showing patterns that are novel.\u201dShortly after Ms. Yellen finished her remarks, the Federal Reserve released its April survey of economic activity in its 12 districts around the country, noting that there had been a pickup in most areas. In particular, the Fed reported, \u201cConsumer spending increased in most districts, as weather conditions improved and foot traffic returned.\u201d There were some other encouraging signals from the Fed earlier on Wednesday, with better than expected data on industrial production in March, and the highest reading for capacity utilization among companies in nearly six years. Ms. Yellen\u2019s remarks on monetary policy, the signs of a spring thaw in the Fed\u2019s survey and the robust manufacturing data all helped to push stocks sharply higher in later trading. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average both rose about 1 percent, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index, which has dropped sharply recently, rebounded by 1.3 percent. \u201cMeaningful progress has been made toward recovery,\u201d said Michael Darda, chief economist at MKM Partners. \u201cAlthough this business cycle has been slow, it has been steady.\u201d While more hawkish policy makers and some prominent economists have worried aloud that a prolonged period of loose monetary policy, with short-term interest rates near zero, might ultimately unleash too much inflation, Ms. Yellen seemed to offer a pointed rejoinder to this group.\u201cOnce it starts, deflation can become entrenched and associated with prolonged periods of very weak economic performance,\u201d she said. \u201cWith longer-term inflation expectations anchored near 2 percent in recent years, persistent inflation well below this expected value increases the real burden of debt for households and firms, which may put a drag on economic activity.\u201dIn recent months, she noted, the unemployment rate has fallen to 6.7 percent, while one closely-followed measure of inflation, the price index for personal consumption expenditures, ran at an annual rate of less than 1 percent in February. Nevertheless, by the end of 2016, Ms. Yellen said, she was hopeful the economy would be able to match Fed projections for unemployment to fall to 5.2 to 5.6 percent, while inflation would come in at 1.7 to and 2 percent. \u201cIf this forecast was to become reality, the economy would be approaching what my colleagues and I view as maximum employment and price stability for the first time in nearly a decade,\u201d she said. \u201cI find this baseline outlook quite plausible.\u201dAfter serving as vice chairwoman of the Fed since 2010, Ms. Yellen succeeded Ben S. Bernanke as the nation\u2019s top central banker at the beginning of February. Her task in the coming months will be delicate, as she must slowly unwind the extraordinary steps Mr. Bernanke took in the wake of the financial crisis and deep recession without moving so quickly as to hurt the fragile recovery.In particular, Ms. Yellen repeatedly emphasized the still-soft nature of the labor market during her speech on Wednesday \u2014 a crucial reason not to tighten monetary policy too rapidly. But as nearly every central banker traditionally does, she also sought to reassure listeners during the question-and-answer session that came after that she was committed to the Fed\u2019s traditional role in combating inflation.Asked whether inflationary pressures might mount more quickly than expected if the labor market finally gained steam and many more unemployed workers found jobs, Ms. Yellen acknowledged that was possible, if not probable.An uptick in inflation is \u201cone of the surprises we could see \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t rule it out,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is not what I anticipate will happen, but, again, the purpose of my remarks today is to emphasize that there can be a lot of twists and turns.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Not Getting Through to Mr. Putin", "Date": "2014-04-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialYet given Mr. Putin\u2019s demonstrative disdain for the Geneva agreements, along with the aggressive behavior of Russian troops massed on Ukraine\u2019s borders and the continued occupation of administrative and security buildings in southeastern Ukrainian cities by Moscow-directed secessionists, such targeted penalties are not likely to change Russia\u2019s behavior. And the sort that would \u2014 coordinated United States-European Union sanctions on financial institutions, the energy sector or defense industries \u2014 have proved very difficult to construct, largely because of the substantial difference between American and European exposure to Russia\u2019s economy.About a quarter of the European Union\u2019s gas supplies come from Russia, and despite years of talk about reducing this dependence, little has been done. European Union trade with Russia, moreover, amounted to almost $370 billion in 2012, compared with United States-Russia trade of $26 billion. This includes some huge sales, like the two helicopter carriers France is building for the Russian Navy as part of a $1.6 billion deal signed in 2011. What that means is that any sanctions that really bite will cost Europe a lot more than the United States.But there will be other costs if Europe and America do not join in a unified response. Among other things, a weak and fragmented response would call into question a longstanding trans-Atlantic commitment to protect international law and democratic values against the kind of aggression Mr. Putin is engaging in. And optics here are important: The decision of Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, the former German chancellor, to meet with Mr. Putin on Monday in St. Petersburg and embrace him in a bear hug sent an unacceptable signal that some prominent Europeans are willing to ignore Mr. Putin\u2019s brutish ways. One result has been pressure on President Obama, largely from Republicans in Congress but also within his own administration, to act unilaterally. That would be a mistake, and Mr. Obama has been right to maintain a unified front with the Europeans even if that has slowed and weakened the response. As he correctly told reporters in Asia, if America were to block certain arms sales to Russia unilaterally, European contractors would simply move in. Acting separately would also fit into Mr. Putin\u2019s efforts to split the United States from Europe, and East Europeans from West Europeans, by consistently painting the United States as the orchestrator of discord in Ukraine. But Ukraine is very much a European crisis. It was an accession treaty offered by the European Union that touched off the current crisis, and it is the European Union\u2019s eastern members who are most threatened by Mr. Putin\u2019s efforts to revise the post-Cold War order.Europe\u2019s concern over the economic repercussions of broader economic sanctions are understandable. But that should not lead to any myopia about the danger Mr. Putin poses and the need to rein him in. His authoritarian behavior at home, his disdain for the Geneva agreement and, most recently, the capture of a European military observer mission in Slovyansk should persuade all European leaders that, as Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier of Germany told the magazine Spiegel, \u201cWe\u2019ve slid into the worst crisis since the end of the Cold War.\u201d That crisis will only get worse unless the West is prepared to unite behind serious economic sanctions that hurt Russia\u2019s financial, energy and military sectors.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Ukraine Tensions Mounting, U.S. Weighs New Sanctions Against Russia", "Date": "2014-04-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama warned President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Monday against further disruption of eastern Ukraine even as the United States and Europe prepared to expand sanctions against leading Russian figures in the next few days.The American sanctions would also be imposed on at least one Russian institution that is deemed part of the so-called crony network supporting Mr. Putin, officials said. But they added that Mr. Obama does not plan to place more crippling measures on whole sectors of the Russian economy unless the Kremlin escalates its actions. The White House wants to hold those sanctions in reserve should Moscow invade Ukraine or seek to annex its eastern regions.The debate over the Western response came as tensions continued to mount. The Pentagon said Monday that a Russian attack aircraft made 12 close passes near an American destroyer in the Black Sea on Saturday. And the White House confirmed that John O. Brennan, the director of the C.I.A., visited Kiev over the weekend, a move that provided propaganda ammunition to the Kremlin, which has presented the crisis as an American-orchestrated intervention.Judging by public accounts, the latest telephone call between Mr. Obama and Mr. Putin did little to bridge the divide. In the call, requested by Moscow, Mr. Obama accused Mr. Putin of trying to subvert Ukraine by fomenting takeovers of security buildings. \u201cThe president expressed grave concern about Russian government support for the actions of armed, pro-Russian separatists who threaten to undermine and destabilize the government of Ukraine,\u201d the White House said in a statement.Mr. Putin denied interfering in Ukraine. \u201cSuch speculations are based on inaccurate information,\u201d the Kremlin said in a statement. Instead, he placed blame for the turmoil on Ukraine\u2019s new pro-Western government and its \u201cunwillingness and inability to take into account the interests of the Russian and Russian-speaking population.\u201dThe United States and Europe are moving to shore up that government. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew met with his Ukrainian counterpart in Washington for the signing of a $1 billion loan guarantee agreement, while European Union foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg approved $1.4 billion in assistance.The sides were debating how far and how fast to apply additional sanctions. The Obama administration was trying to decide whether to impose them before a meeting scheduled for Thursday in Geneva that is to bring together Secretary of State John Kerry with counterparts from Russia, Ukraine and Europe.Some officials argued in favor of holding off sanctions, reasoning that it would sour the Geneva meeting and make it harder to forge a diplomatic solution. Others countered that taking action before the meeting would strengthen the hand of the West and signal that continued provocation would not be accepted. Mr. Obama called President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France on Monday to coordinate positions.\u201cThere will be further costs imposed on Russia,\u201d Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, told reporters before the president\u2019s call with Mr. Putin. \u201cAnd certainly if they go further down the road of attempting to destabilize Ukraine rather than choosing the path of de-escalation, the costs will continue to grow.\u201dTargeting Mr. Sechin would aim directly at Mr. Putin\u2019s inner circle. Rosneft, Mr. Sechin\u2019s oil company, is deeply involved with Western firms. BP owns nearly 20 percent of the company, and ExxonMobil has multiple projects with Rosneft in Siberia, the Arctic, the Black Sea, Canada, Alaska and Texas.Lawyers at ExxonMobil are researching the impact of sanctions against Mr. Sechin. Given that they would apply to Mr. Sechin personally and not his company, some specialists said it might mean little more than a logistical hassle because he could not travel to the United States to meet with his ExxonMobil partners. But Anders Aslund, a Russia specialist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said it would have more of an effect. \u201cIf Sechin is banned, it would be very difficult for these companies,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be connected with a person who\u2019s banned by the United States if you\u2019re a highly U.S.-dependent company.\u201dMr. Brennan\u2019s decision to travel to Kiev, however, struck many in Washington as baffling. Russian television first reported over the weekend that the C.I.A. director had arrived in Kiev under an assumed name to direct operations there. The White House and the C.I.A. initially refused to comment but on Monday confirmed his trip. Mr. Carney said it was meant simply to foster \u201cmutually beneficial security cooperation,\u201d and he called Russia\u2019s characterization \u201cabsurd.\u201dSome former intelligence officers privately criticized the visit, saying it only bolstered the conspiracies advanced by Russian officials that the C.I.A. was behind the Ukrainian unrest that toppled a pro-Moscow president in favor of a government oriented toward the West.But other C.I.A. veterans said there must have been a good reason for him to go because the White House would have known Mr. Brennan would be spotted. \u201cIt\u2019s a well-thought-out decision that had to be weighed against playing right into Putin\u2019s message,\u201d said Milton Bearden, chief of the C.I.A.\u2019s Soviet division during the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse.But according to a recent letter by four members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, concerns have been raised about Russia\u2019s missions over Ukraine. Before Russia can carry out observation missions with the improved monitoring, the United States and other signatories of the Open Skies agreement must certify that they may be used. The issue is to be discussed at a meeting of administration officials.\u201cThe invasion of Crimea and Moscow\u2019s ongoing efforts to destabilize Ukraine using subversive methods is sufficient reason to counsel further review,\u201d wrote the senators, Mark Warner of Virginia and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, both Democrats, and the Republicans Dan Coats of Indiana and Jim Risch of Idaho.In a separate letter to Mr. Obama, Mike Rogers of Michigan, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, urged Mr. Obama to reject the Russian move. \u201cPutin\u2019s attempt to upgrade Russia\u2019s sensing capabilities now is particularly problematic,\u201d he wrote.Michael R. Gordon and Mark Mazzetti contributed reporting.videovideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Finance Officials Push for Bold Action to Sustain Economic Growth", "Date": "2014-04-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 At the World Bank and International Monetary Fund annual spring meetings, concerns about crisis have given way to concerns about complacency.The euro zone has re-emerged from recession. Emerging-market jitters have quieted. The fiscal battles in the United States have abated. But the recovery remains fragile and in many cases, growth remains sluggish, leaving a jobs gap of 62 million.\u201cThe overriding topic for discussion will be the topic of growth, quest for higher growth, better quality growth, more inclusive growth and sustainable growth,\u201d said Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the fund, speaking with reporters on the eve of the weekend conference. \u201cWe need to act now.\u201dUnderlying the discussions of inflation, interest rates, fiscal balance and trade policy among the assembled ministers were concerns about Ukraine, as news of pro-Russian activists seizing official buildings in the eastern part of the former Soviet republic sent jitters through the meetings. Officials said they hoped that the situation would not escalate. But if it did, it might pose serious consequences to Europe\u2019s fragile recovery.\u201cWe are monitoring the economic situation in Ukraine, mindful of any risks to economic and financial stability, and welcome the I.M.F.\u2019s recent engagement with Ukraine,\u201d said a communiqu\u00e9 from the Group of 20, which consists of the world\u2019s biggest economies.The fund is preparing a financial rescue package for Kiev that would come with stringent conditions, including tax increases and cuts in government spending. The package would be worth $14 billion to $18 billion, Ms. Lagarde said. The World Bank, the fund\u2019s sister organization, is also offering Ukraine billions in aid, with individual countries preparing bilateral packages, as well. Finance ministers and central bankers also discussed the possibility of new penalties for Russia, said Jacob J. Lew, the Treasury secretary. \u201cThere is broad and strong unity within the G-7 on increasing the sanctions and costs in response to escalating action from Russia,\u201d he said, referring to the Group of 7, meaning Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States. \u201cThere was no dissent in the room that it was essential that there be unity in taking action if necessary.\u201dOn Monday, Mr. Lew plans to sign a declaration \u201cmoving forward\u201d $1 billion in loan guarantees for Ukraine.The Group of 20 gave a year-end deadline for Congress to act \u2014 saying that at that point, the monetary fund might move on without the United States\u2019 assent. It gave no further details. \u201cIf the 2010 reforms are not ratified by year-end, we will call on the I.M.F. to build on its existing work and develop options for next steps,\u201d a communiqu\u00e9 said.Much of the rest of the talks focused on creating jobs and strengthening growth now that the world has made its way out of crisis. \u201cShort-term risks to the global economy have eased,\u201d said Dr. Jim Yong Kim, the president of the World Bank. \u201cIncreasingly, our worries are focused on the medium term. Our concern is that the pace of reform could be slowing in this postcrisis period. The focus must return urgently to the structural reform agenda. Even a small setback can result in leaving millions of families in destitution rather than escaping poverty.\u201dWith that, the conversation among the world\u2019s finance ministers and central bankers generally atomized into individual prescriptions for individual countries.Growth has picked up in many rich countries, especially in the United States, and Europe has started growing again, too. But the Continent seems to have settled into a period of low inflation and low growth, with widespread concern that the will to make the major economic changes necessary for a stronger recovery might have faded along with the crisis. \u201cWe remain concerned by inflation rates consistently below target and weak demand,\u201d Mr. Lew said. \u201cMore needs to be done to support growth and guard against further disinflation in the euro area.\u201dThe effect of Japan\u2019s major stimulus package \u2014 called \u201cAbenomics,\u201d after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe \u2014 might also be waning. The I.M.F. cut its estimates of the country\u2019s growth shortly before the meetings. It has urged Tokyo to make structural reforms to bolster its labor market, by, for instance, bringing women into the work force.At a meeting in Sydney at the end of February, members of the Group of 20 major economies \u2014 which include rich countries like Canada and developing economies like Brazil and China \u2014 agreed to commit to policies to increase growth. The specific target is to lift economic output 2 percent beyond its current trajectory over the coming five years.Without policies to enhance growth and create jobs, inequality might intensify and tens of millions of workers might remain jobless. \u201cA massive global jobs gap which opened at the height of the financial crisis continues to widen and will do so in the years ahead unless growth both accelerates and is also job-rich,\u201d\u00a0said Guy Ryder, the director general of the International Labor Organization. \u201cCreating jobs and narrowing inequalities are essential.\u201d Advertisement"}

But for some economists, meeting that cost-cutting goal has not been worth the price paid in lost jobs and feeble growth.And while the deficit picture over all has improved, the euro zone\u2019s total debt has mounted, as countries continue to run deficits and add to their borrowing. The debt rose to 92.6 percent of euro zone gross domestic product \u2014 well above the 60 percent target in the 1992 treaty that created the euro.Simon Tilford, deputy director of the Center for European Reform, a research group in London, said the euro zone\u2019s deficit reduction, through what critics have come to call austerity budgeting, had come \u201cat an enormous cost\u201d in lost economic growth.Deficit financing by issuing bonds is a normal part of operations for most sovereign governments, used when revenues fall short of expenditures. But continued heavy deficit financing can lead to a situation in which the interest costs on the accumulating debt eat up so much of the budget that a country enters a self-reinforcing cycle of greater borrowing and more indebtedness that eventually becomes unsustainable.That happened to some euro zone governments after they borrowed heavily to keep their countries\u2019 banking sectors afloat after the 2008 financial crisis, only to experience a sharp downturn in tax receipts as economies slowed or fell into recession. Beginning in 2010, those problems broke open. Investors began dumping euro zone bonds, ultimately leading Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Cyprus to seek bailouts, and also raising concerns about whether Spain or Italy might be next, threatening the euro union itself.That year, the euro zone\u2019s deficit figure hit more than 6 percent of G.D.P.The 3 percent figure reported Wednesday, the deficit level that the countries agreed to under the 1992 Maastricht Treaty, had not been achieved since the onset of the global financial crisis.At the height of the crisis, with Germany blocking proposals for even more deficit spending to stimulate demand, and the European Central Bank unwilling to take the sort of expansionary monetary stimulus pursued by the Federal Reserve in the United States and the Bank of England in Britain, austerity budgeting was one of the few policy options on the table. The euro zone embraced that option, agreeing to recommit to the \u201cMaastricht criteria.\u201dDuring a time of economic weakness, the resulting tax increases and cuts in government spending, which reduced overall demand, invited criticism that the austerity policy was counterproductive, since a faster-growing economy could help achieve the same goal. Economists in the school of John Maynard Keynes say it would have been better for Germany, which runs a trade surplus with many of its euro zone partners, to stimulate demand at home to pick up the slack, rather than calling on weaker neighbors to make spending cuts that placed further drags on their economies. But other experts saw few alternatives, given the financial realities.\u201cIt\u2019s a religious question, not an economic question,\u201d Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING in Brussels, said of the austerity debate. \u201cThere is no real right or wrong answer.\u201dMr. Brzeski noted that investors this year had been once again willing to take the risk of buying bonds of weaker euro zone economies that they would not touch during the sovereign debt crisis. Ireland, Portugal and even Greece have re-entered the bond markets, finding ready buyers. \u201cIn 2010, there was no appetite for risk,\u201d he said.\u201cIn purely economic terms, it might not have been worth it,\u201d Mr. Brzeski said. \u201cBut you had to ask if these countries needed sustainable finances or not. And if some sort of action had not been taken, it would have meant leaving it in the hands of the markets. Europe didn\u2019t want to do that.\u201dWhatever the economic effects of the austerity pact, it did provide political cover for the European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi. He promised that monetary officials would do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to support embattled sovereign lenders, eventually stepping into the bond market to hold down yields for Italy and Spain when their borrowing costs appeared to be reaching unsustainable levels.The data released Wednesday also included a major step for Greece, the worst-hit of the euro zone countries. The country in 2013 achieved a primary budget surplus \u2014 a surplus before debt payments and excluding aid to its banking sector \u2014 of 1.5 billion euros, or about $2.1 billion, according to Simon O\u2019Connor, a spokesman for the European Commission in Brussels.That is equivalent to 0.8 percent of G.D.P. and paves the way for possible talks on granting Greece some debt relief. Euro zone officials said in November 2012 that such a surplus was necessary before any such discussions could be held. Greek officials, facing a debt burden equivalent to 175 percent of G.D.P., are planning to broach the subject as early as May 5, when euro zone finance ministers are to meet.In Athens, the government was preparing to distribute the bulk of its hard-won surplus to unemployed people and low-income households. By Wednesday, more than 300,000 Greeks had applied for the so-called social dividend that the government is eager to offer austerity-weary Greeks ahead of municipal and European elections next month.In Greece, \u201causterity was overdone,\u201d said Christian Schulz, an economist at Berenberg Bank in London, noting that it had contributed to a nearly 25 percent decline in G.D.P. since the crisis. But, he added, \u201cthe Greek death spiral is about to be broken,\u201d with the country doing much of what is needed to meet the Maastricht criteria by 2030.The austerity debate continues to bedevil France. President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande is fighting record unpopularity and trying to contain a rebellion within his own Socialist Party over a proposed plan to cut \u20ac50 billion from spending to meet the deficit target \u2014 even as he reduces employment taxes in hopes that doing so will spur hiring. On Wednesday, facing criticism from the European Commission over its failure to reach the target on time, the French government said its new plan would allow it to reduce the deficit to 3.8 percent of G.D.P. this year and to 3 percent next year.Mr. Tilford of the Center for European Reform said it appeared that Europe, having been in a long slump, was now experiencing a cyclical pickup. The outlook remains poor, however, he said, \u201cwhen the recovery we\u2019re seeing is so weak and patchy, especially considering the losses of output we have seen in the euro zone.\u201dWith inflation now \u201cexceptionally low,\u201d at less than 1 percent in the euro zone, Mr. Tilford said: \u201cThe only way to be optimistic about euro zone debt would be to see a period of strong growth and a pickup in inflation. There\u2019s no prospect of that at the moment.\u201dNiki Kitsantonis contributed reporting from Athens and Alissa J. Rubin from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bankers in Hong Kong Join Fight Against Mainland Influence ", "Date": "2014-04-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 In this city awash with money from mainland China, a former hedge fund manager hopes to incite a political awakening among the bankers, stockbrokers and financial traders whose livelihoods have become increasingly enmeshed in the mainland\u2019s cash and influence.In a letter to China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, to be published in newspapers on Wednesday, the financial industry activists say Hong Kong\u2019s economic health and social integrity have been jeopardized by threats to independent news media, an influx of suspect money and political cronyism that undermines fairness in banking and financial services, a mainstay of the economy.\u201cHong Kong\u2019s existing political system has become the stumbling block to the city\u2019s long-term social, political and economic growth and is the root cause of social division and disharmony in Hong Kong,\u201d says the letter, a copy of which Mr. Chin provided.Mr. Chin and his supporters, who call themselves a financial arm of the \u201cOccupy Central\u201d movement, embody a trend that could prove increasingly troublesome for Beijing\u2019s efforts to manage Hong Kong, which maintains its own administration and laws. Anxiety over mainland influence is reaching up the social ladder to include members of the professional establishment who outwardly appear to have much to gain from avoiding confrontation with the Chinese government and its supporters. Critics of Occupy Central warn that the movement could hurt economic confidence, but its backers say Hong Kong\u2019s long-term economic health requires political action to press for change.\u201cMost people think people who work in banking or finance only focus on work, or people say we are the beneficiary of this system,\u201d said Lai Chong Au, a marketing manager at an investment firm, who has joined the group started by Mr. Chin.\u201cBut that\u2019s not true,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the long run, if you want to maintain an international banking and financial center in Hong Kong, you need to have a good system, a good framework, in order to protect it.\u201dMichael E. DeGolyer, a political scientist at Hong Kong Baptist University, said a forthcoming study of public opinion showed levels of public discontent with the Hong Kong government similar to those seen before mass protests in 2003, when the government tried to introduce Beijing-backed antisubversion laws. \u201cPeople in Hong Kong have been characterized as politically apathetic, but that\u2019s the wrong term,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are extremely alert to things that might threaten them, their families and their fortunes.\u201dLong a British colony, Hong Kong returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. In recent years, the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d arrangement that was created to preserve Hong Kong\u2019s legal and administrative autonomy has come under pressure from Chinese political and economic influence. Despite the echoes of Occupy Wall Street, Hong Kong\u2019s \u201cOccupy Central With Love and Peace\u201d is focused on winning political and electoral rights, not challenging capitalism. But Mr. Chin, who runs an investment fund, said that in Hong Kong, too, wealth and opportunity have risen beyond the grasp of many middle-class residents, even financial professionals. The city\u2019s boast of being the world\u2019s freest economy is belied by realities, he said. \u201cIn Hong Kong, honestly, it\u2019s like 0.01 percent is what I call the ruling class,\u201d he said.Mainland China\u2019s deepening presence has been accompanied by an influx of suspect cash \u2014 possibly from corruption \u2014 and cronyism that have compromised Hong Kong\u2019s financial sector, Mr. Chin said. The most lucrative jobs and deals tend to go increasingly to people who are relatives of China\u2019s Communist Party elite or those who have their patronage, he said.\u201cThey definitely don\u2019t compete on the same level playing field,\u201d Mr. Chin said. He said that his group, mainly Hong Kong-born Chinese, had received support from some mainland Chinese people living in Hong Kong, who feared that the territory\u2019s relatively clean business environment could be tainted by rough-and-tumble practices and corruption more common on the mainland.\u201cThey have seen how it works on both sides,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want this city to die.\u201d\u201cGradually the apple has become rotten,\u201d said another activist backing Occupy Central, Bill Tsang, who recently retired as a senior manager at the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, or HKEx.\u201cThe mainlanders, they get big deals, not because of their competence, but maybe for political relationships or guanxi,\u201d he said, using the Mandarin word for connections. \u201cCorruption culture has now already come to Hong Kong.\u201dMr. Lau is recovering, and the police said the authorities in China had arrested two suspects.But members of the financial group supporting Occupy Central said they did not expect most of Hong Kong\u2019s financial sector workers to turn private support into public action. They said that many were too wary of recriminations, while others believed Hong Kong\u2019s best course was to accommodate or quietly resist mainland pressures.\u201cI think this is a long-term battle,\u201d said Ms. Au, the marketing manager. \u201cIt might not succeed, but at least when I look back, I will know I tried.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For the Auto Industry, a Showcase for Change", "Date": "2014-04-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe 2014 New York International Auto Show is billed, rightly so, as a showcase for dozens of new and significantly changed automobiles. But more than that, it is also a showcase for the quickening pace of change in the auto industry.Organizers have designated more than five dozen vehicles as world or North American premieres, among the hundreds on display at this year\u2019s show, which opens Wednesday for two days of press previews at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan. Models expected to draw large crowds include the 2015 Chevrolet Corvette Z06 convertible; the 2015 Jeep Renegade, a smaller addition to the Jeep line that made its debut earlier this year in Geneva; and the much anticipated Alfa Romeo 4C sports car.Among those debutantes are a large number, including the Ford Fusion, Chevrolet Cruze, Toyota Camry, Dodge Charger and Challenger and Volkswagen Jetta, that may seem like little more than familiar faces with freshened facades and fancier features. But the changes run more than skin deep.\u201cThis year\u2019s show will feature a wide range of both all-new and heavily refreshed vehicles,\u201d Karl Brauer, a senior automotive analyst for Kelley Blue Book, said in an email. \u201cThe automotive market is more competitive than it has ever been, which puts increased pressure on manufacturers to keep product fresh.\u201dProduct cycles are shortening. Where seven to eight years might have been the norm in the life cycle of an automaker\u2019s core products in the past, now it seems at least a significant refresh or face-lift is in order every three to four years.\u201cWe\u2019ll see this in the high number of significantly updated models like the Camry, Focus and Challenger,\u201d Mr. Brauer continued. \u201cAt the same time we\u2019ll see plenty of all-new models from luxury brands like Acura and BMW. The show reflects the need to keep innovating and revising models at a much faster rate than automakers had to just a few years ago.\u201dAs the competition among automakers intensifies, technological advances are happening faster, and likewise, obsolescence now seems to be lurking just around the corner.A timely example can be found at McLaren, the British racing legend and supercar builder, which is showing its new 650S model to the press at a location near the convention center. The 650S is so advanced compared with the 12C, a still-handsome model it has been making for just three years, that McLaren felt compelled to cancel the 12C.Also in New York, Ford is ready to introduce its sixth-generation Mustang, even though its outgoing fifth-generation model has been subjected to a series of updates almost yearly since at least 2009 \u2013 and still looks fresh. To gain an extra measure of attention, Ford is disassembling a new Mustang and putting it back together on the observation deck of the Empire State Building.Although Toyota introduced an all-new Camry in 2012, a heavily revised version will be unveiled at New York for the 2015 model year. The company said, \u201cThe refreshed Camry will challenge conventional expectations of a midcycle model change.\u201d New styling, new engines and transmissions and better fuel economy are among the changes promised.Honda provided one of the more radical examples of the need to move fast when it rolled out a much-changed Civic last year, little more than 18 months after a tepidly received new version had made its debut in 2012. This year, Honda is updating its Fit compact.Chrysler is carrying out what are called speed-to-market initiatives in which \u201cwe are not waiting until all-new, next-generation vehicles come out to make significant changes,\u201d Rick Deneau, a Fiat Chrysler Automobiles spokesman, said.Prime examples, he added, include running changes to Ram pickups, the Jeep Grand Cherokee and the Dodge Challenger and Charger. He says such initiatives \u201cget us closer to the customer.\u201dMark Schirmer, a Ford spokesman, said the pace of change might be a bit faster, \u201cor perhaps people are noticing it more because of the amount of change.\u201d\u201cBack in the 1950s, they made minor styling changes year after year, right? And then for a while through the dark days, it seemed we never changed the darn things,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you consider that a typical vehicle cycle is seven to eight years, which I think it still is -\u2014all-new to all-new \u2014 the midcycle is more aggressive and often includes new engines and updates throughout and lots of added technology and new features.\u201dLogistically speaking, Mr. Schirmer said, a major change still requires about 36 months to put into effect.There is also the staggered, year-round nature of new car introductions; gone are the fall \u201cnew car season\u201d introductions of the past.Ford is mixing in a significant midcycle update to the Focus, with a sneak peek of the next Edge crossover, a new Skyliner adaptation of the Transit van and a complete redesign of the Mustang. The net effect may appear more transformative, to Ford\u2019s overall lineup, than is actually the case.But to an untrained eye, even a new palette of colors on a line of existing models can seem brand new, especially under the bright lights of an auto show display.The show opens to the public Friday morning at the Javits center on 11th Avenue between 34th and 40th Streets and continues through April 27. Admission is $15 for adults, $5 for children 12 and younger.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bank of England Holds Key Rate at 0.5%", "Date": "2014-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The Bank of England on Thursday left a key interest rate unchanged at a record low, as Britain\u2019s economy continues to recover and inflation remains in decline.Britain\u2019s central bank said it would keep its benchmark interest rate at 0.5 percent, where it has been since March 2009. The bank also left unchanged a stimulus program of holding 375 billion pounds, or almost $630 billion, in government bonds that it has purchased over the past five years.The country is not expected to change rates until next year at the earliest, analysts said.The British economy recorded growth of 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter, outpacing much of Continental Europe. Growth in the first quarter may have risen further, to 0.9 percent, according to an estimate published this week by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research.Lower unemployment, most recently reported at 7.2 percent, and productivity gains will most likely lead the Bank of England to keep rates steady into next year, said Samuel Tombs, an economist at the research firm Capital Economics.The central bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee would \u201chold off raising rates until the second half of next year, predominantly because we think inflation is set to ease further over the course of this year,\u201d Mr. Tombs said.Inflation declined to 1.7 percent in Britain in February, lower than the bank\u2019s target of 2 percent. Official figures for economic growth and inflation are expected to be released later this month.Last week, the European Central Bank left its benchmark interest rate at 0.25 percent, but expressed concern about the effect a falling rate of inflation in Europe could have on some of the countries in the euro zone.In its announcement last week, the European Central Bank gave its strongest signal yet that it was considering so-called quantitative easing \u2014 purchases of government or corporate bonds \u2014 as a way to stimulate the European economy.At the same time, quantitative easing, adopted in Britain as an emergency measure in 2009, does not look like it will be disappearing anytime soon. Similar measures have been used by the Federal Reserve to bolster the American economy.Appearing before Parliament in March, Mark J. Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, said that any unwinding of the central bank\u2019s bond-buying program would most likely come only after several interest rate adjustments.Mr. Carney said at the time that rather than sell a block of the bonds, one possibility would be to not reinvest the proceeds of those bonds. The central bank has continued to reinvest proceeds from the bonds, however.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to sell \u00a3375 billion\u201d of government bonds, Mr. Carney said at a meeting of the Treasury Select Committee in March.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Deal is Reached to Ease Tension in East Ukraine", "Date": "2014-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGENEVA \u2014 The United States, Russia, Ukraine and the European Union reached an agreement on Thursday evening that called for armed pro-Russian bands in eastern Ukraine to surrender the government buildings they have seized and that outlined other steps to defuse a crisis that has rattled the international community.The diplomatic accord, while limited in scope, represented the first time Russia and Ukraine had found common ground since protests toppled a pro-Moscow government in Kiev, leading the Kremlin to annex the Crimean Peninsula and threaten other parts of Ukraine with 40,000 troops on its border. The deal came hours after Ukrainian security forces killed three pro-Russian activists in a firefight.But neither President Obama in Washington nor President Vladimir V. Putin in Moscow signaled that the crisis over Ukraine was over. During a long, televised question-and-answer session before the agreement was announced, Mr. Putin asserted historic claims over Ukrainian territory and the right to send in Russian troops. Speaking after the agreement was announced, Mr. Obama sounded a skeptical note, saying it offered \u201ca glimmer of hope,\u201d but \u201cwe\u2019re not going to count on it,\u201d and adding that the United States would take more punitive action if Russia did not abide by its terms.\u201cMy hope is that we actually do see follow-through over the next several days,\u201d Mr. Obama told reporters at the White House, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think, given past performance, that we can count on that, and we have to be prepared to potentially respond to what continue to be efforts of interference by the Russians in eastern and southern Ukraine.\u201dMr. Obama did not outline what those measures might be, but aides said that the White House had assembled a list of more Russian figures and institutions to sanction if Russia did not pull back and the situation in Ukraine continued to worsen. The president does not plan to impose more stringent measures against whole sectors of the Russian economy unless Moscow sends in troops or otherwise takes more drastic steps, aides said, a recognition of resistance in Europe, which is more tied economically to Russia.Hoping to coordinate a future response with European leaders, Mr. Obama spoke by telephone with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. called Slovakia\u2019s prime minister for the second time in recent days to press him to help reverse the flow of a natural gas pipeline to reduce Ukraine\u2019s reliance on Russian energy.Tension on the ground continued to mount in the hours before the Geneva agreement was announced. Pro-Russian protesters tried to storm a Ukrainian base in the eastern city of Mariupol, prompting a firefight that left three of the activists dead, 13 wounded and 63 captured, according to Ukraine\u2019s interim interior minister. In Donetsk, where pro-Russian militants have taken over a government building, fliers appeared ordering Jews to register with the authorities.And in the hours after the accord, brokered in part by Secretary of State John Kerry and Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov of Russia, militants occupying the government building in the name of the newly declared and wholly unrecognized People\u2019s Republic of Donetsk said that they would not be bound by anything Russia had agreed to.Roman Velikodny, who called himself commandant of the occupied building, said he had no intention of asking militants to leave until after a referendum that would allow residents of the region to choose autonomy from Kiev. \u201cBefore they let people openly express their opinions on the future of this land, we won\u2019t leave the building,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be no handing over of weapons and buildings before people express their views.\u201dVasili Domashev, who described himself as an aide to the commandant, said the armed men would not leave because they did not trust the Kiev government. \u201cLavrov and Kerry decided, but who are they to us?\u201d he said as a guard sat beside him, tapping the flat side of a samurai sword against his boot. \u201cWe are the Donetsk Republic. We have people who make their own decisions.\u201dThe Geneva agreement \u2014 hammered out during six hours of talks between Mr. Kerry; Mr. Lavrov; Andrii Deshchytsia, the interim Ukrainian foreign minister; and Catherine Ashton, the foreign policy chief for the European Union \u2014 called on all sides in Ukraine to refrain from violence or provocative behavior and rejected all forms of intolerance, including anti-Semitism.\u201cAll illegal armed groups must be disarmed,\u201d the joint statement said. \u201cAll illegally seized buildings must be returned to legitimate owners; all illegally occupied streets, squares and other public places in Ukrainian cities and towns must be vacated.\u201dIn exchange, the interim Ukrainian government agreed to grant amnesty to protesters who leave the government buildings they have occupied and give up their arms, unless they are suspected of murder or other capital crimes. The Kiev government would also ensure that constitutional revisions involve \u201coutreach to all of Ukraine\u2019s regions and political constituencies,\u201d a reference to Russian speakers in the eastern part of the country.But the agreement was as notable for what it did not address as for what it did. It did not require Russia to remove its troops from the border, nor did it commit Moscow to hold direct talks with Ukrainian officials, two of Mr. Obama\u2019s demands. Moreover, the agreement made no mention of Russia\u2019s seizure and annexation of Crimea, an action deemed unacceptable by the United States and Europe and yet unlikely to be reversed, at least in the foreseeable future, Western officials have acknowledged privately.\u201cNone of us leave here with the sense that the job is done,\u201d Mr. Kerry said afterward. \u201cWe do not envision this as the full measure of de-escalation.\u201d But he called the measures an important first step to avert \u201ca complete and total implosion\u201d in eastern Ukraine and said they could lead to more far-reaching moves to resolve the conflict.In response to a question, Mr. Kerry insisted that the United States had not dropped objections to Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea but acknowledged that it had not been the focus of the meeting. \u201cWe didn\u2019t come here to talk about Crimea,\u201d he said.Mr. Obama said Ukraine\u2019s government presented a \u201cdetailed and thorough presentation\u201d of overhauls it would make and went \u201cout of its way to address a range of the concerns\u201d expressed by Russians. Now it was time for Russia to \u201cuse the influence that they\u2019ve exerted in a disruptive way\u201d to give Ukraine a chance to hold elections and stabilize its economy.But Mr. Lavrov put the onus on the authorities in Kiev, saying that the deal was \u201clargely based on compromise\u201d and that a broader settlement of the crisis was primarily Ukraine\u2019s responsibility.The talks were held at the same luxury hotel where five years ago Mr. Kerry\u2019s predecessor, Hillary Rodham Clinton, presented Mr. Lavrov with a red \u201creset\u201d button intended to signal a fresh start in Russian-American relations, a gesture marred at the time by a mistranslation and mocked since as a symbol of a failed foreign policy.In Germany, the European country with the closest ties to Russia, the agreement was received with palpable relief. Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the foreign minister, said the agreement was \u201ca first step, and many more must now follow,\u201d but he seemed clearly content that \u201cdiplomacy now has a chance.\u201dThe firefight in Mariupol on Thursday was the deadliest in eastern Ukraine since the crisis began. According to Ukrainian authorities, attackers threw firebombs and opened fire on perimeter guards at a base used by the newly formed National Guard, which has drawn volunteers who took part in last winter\u2019s protest movement against the old pro-Moscow government. About 300 people were in the crowd.\u201cAfter warnings, in accordance with our rules, and after repeat attacks, we opened lethal fire,\u201d Arsen Avakov, the interim interior minister, said in a statement.Michael R. Gordon reported from Geneva, and Peter Baker from Washington. Reporting was contributed by Andrew E. Kramer from Donetsk, Ukraine; Andrew Higgins from Kiev, Ukraine; Nick Cumming-Bruce from Geneva; Alison Smale from Berlin; and C. J. Chivers from the United States.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "France Curtails Role at Genocide Services After Rwanda Leader Casts Blame", "Date": "2014-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Stung by critical remarks from Rwanda\u2019s president that laid some of the blame for that country\u2019s 1994 genocide at the door of France, the French government has scaled back its planned participation in the 20th anniversary commemoration of the massacres.Christiane Taubira, France\u2019s justice minister, had been expected to attend the ceremonies on Monday in Kigali, the Rwandan capital. But in a statement on Sunday, the Foreign Ministry announced that \u201cunder these conditions,\u201d she would not take part. \u201cIt\u2019s a long and complicated relationship between the two countries,\u201d said Carina Tertsakian, a senior researcher on Rwanda and Burundi for Human Rights Watch in London. \u201cThe whole of the international community bears a responsibility for not stopping genocide in 1994, but France\u2019s responsibility went beyond that because it had supported the previous government that perpetuated the genocide and had trained their soldiers,\u201d she said. \u201cIt took them 20 years to do it but better late than never,\u201d said Ms. Tertsakian, \u201cWe hope it won\u2019t be a one-off and that there will be others.\u201d While there has been some admission by France, in a parliamentary report, of its involvement in arming and equipping the government from 1990-94 when it was dominated by the Hutu ethnic group, there has never been an open discussion between the two countries. An estimated 800,000 members of the Tutsi ethnic group as well as Hutus suspected of being sympathetic to them were killed from April to July 1994. A French spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, Romain Nadal, said that his government was surprised by the statements from Mr. Kagame and that they were in contradiction with the diplomatic entente between the two countries. He denied, however, that France was boycotting the ceremonies in Kigali and told Agence France-Presse that France\u2019s ambassador to Rwanda would attend. For the French, the contretemps comes as human rights observers are once again questioning their commitment to protecting civilians in an impoverished, landlocked African country. This time it is the Central African Republic, a former French colony. A bloody sectarian war there has forced almost the entire Muslim population to flee Christian and animist militias. The French sent troops to the country in November because they feared that the growing violence could lead to genocide. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty unprecedented to have an entire population flee,\u201d said Peter Bouckaert, the emergencies director for Human Rights Watch, who has tracked the fighting in the Central African Republic. \u201cFrance has a very difficult time acknowledging how bad the situation is and they continue to say \u2018It\u2019s going according to plan\u2019 and their refusal to evacuate the remaining Muslim population who is starving and under constant attack is just unacceptable,\u201d Mr. Bouckaert said. He added that it was \u201ca hard decision to make, but under the circumstances, with the shadow of Rwanda and Srbenica hanging over this, sometimes you do have to evacuate people.\u201d The French army, shadowed by a sense of their failure in Rwanda, has struggled to plot a better course in the Central African Republic, according to articles in the French media, but remains unsure of its role amid the chaos of competing militias. Jacques Hogard, a former military official in Rwanda was quoted in Le Monde, the Paris newspaper, as saying: \u201cFor lack of a clear political line, we continue to make military interventions in Africa, which puts people in unbelievable situations.\u201d Mr. Kagame came to office in 2000 and even recently was lionized by Western leaders, including former President Bill Clinton for helping to remake his damaged country, and building its economy and educational system.For his government, the charge that the French shared some responsibility for the slaughter is something of a repeating theme that often comes up around the time of the anniversary as a way of reminding the French and the West of their responsibility for the genocide.Recently Mr. Kagame\u2019s government has been accused of both supporting violent rebels in the Democratic Republic of Congo and of being involved in the deaths of former Rwandan officials who had turned against him and gone into exile. Britain withheld $38 million in foreign aid to Rwanda because of its support of the Congolese rebels. The dulling of Mr. Kagame\u2019s luster has made some analysts wonder if his criticisms of Western countries are a way of distracting his domestic audience from his regime\u2019s more questionable behavior.

We underperform because our economic and military strengths don\u2019t translate into well-being for the average citizen.This Social Progress Index ranks New Zealand No. 1, followed by Switzerland, Iceland and the Netherlands. All are somewhat poorer than America per capita, yet they appear to do a better job of meeting the needs of their people.The Social Progress Index is a brainchild of Michael E. Porter, the eminent Harvard business professor who earlier helped develop the Global Competitiveness Report. Porter is a Republican whose work, until now, has focused on economic metrics.\u201cThis is kind of a journey for me,\u201d Porter told me. He said that he became increasingly aware that social factors support economic growth: tax policy and regulations affect economic prospects, but so do schooling, health and a society\u2019s inclusiveness.So Porter and a team of experts spent two years developing this index, based on a vast amount of data reflecting suicide, property rights, school attendance, attitudes toward immigrants and minorities, opportunity for women, religious freedom, nutrition, electrification and much more.Ireland, from which so many people fled in the 19th century to find opportunity in the United States, now ranks 15th. That\u2019s a notch ahead of the United States, and Ireland is also ahead of America in the category of \u201copportunity.\u201dCanada came in seventh, the best among the nations in the G-7. Germany is 12th, Britain 13th and Japan 14th.The bottom spot on the ranking was filled by Chad. Just above it were Central African Republic, Burundi, Guinea, Sudan and Angola.Professor Porter notes that Arab Spring countries had longstanding problems leading to poor scores in the \u201copportunity\u201d category. If that\u2019s a predictor of trouble, as he thinks it may be, then Russia, China, Saudi Arabia and Iran should be on guard. None do well in the category of opportunity.In contrast, some countries punch well above their weight. Costa Rica performs better than much richer countries, and so do the Philippines, Estonia and Jamaica. In Africa, Malawi, Ghana and Liberia shine. Bangladesh (no. 99) ranks ahead of wealthier India (no. 102). Likewise, Ukraine (no. 62) outperforms Russia (no. 80).China does poorly, ranking 90th, behind its poorer neighbor Mongolia (no. 89). China performs well in basic education but lags in areas such as personal rights and access to information.All this goes to what kind of a nation we want to be, and whether we put too much faith in G.D.P. as a metric.There are no quick fixes, but basic education and health care are obvious places to begin, especially in the first few years of life, when returns are the highest.The arguments for boosting opportunity or social services usually revolve around social justice and fairness. The Social Progress Index offers a reminder that what\u2019s at stake is also the health of our society \u2014 and our competitiveness around the globe. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "When Youth Violence Spurred \u2018Superpredator\u2019 Fear", "Date": "2014-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRetro ReportNot surprisingly, the shooter was charged with second-degree murder. Not insignificantly, prosecutors said he would be tried as an adult. Kahton is all of 14.That very young people sometimes commit dreadful crimes is no revelation. Nor is the fact that gang members are to blame for a disproportionate amount of youth violence in American cities. But it is worth noting that in Kahton\u2019s situation, no one in authority or in the news media invoked a certain word from the past with galvanic potential. That word is \u201csuperpredator.\u201dHad this Brooklyn killing taken place 20 years ago, odds are that some people would have seized on it as more evidence that America was being overwhelmed by waves of \u201csuperpredators,\u201d feral youths devoid of impulse control or remorse.Their numbers were predicted as ready to explode cataclysmically. Social scientists like James A. Fox, a criminologist, warned of \u201ca blood bath of violence\u201d that could soon wash over the land. That fear, verging on panic, is the subject of this week\u2019s segment of Retro Report, a series of video documentaries that examine major news stories from years ago and explore what has happened since.What happened with the superpredator jeremiads is that they proved to be nonsense. They were based on a notion that there would be hordes upon hordes of depraved teenagers resorting to unspeakable brutality, not tethered by conscience. No one in the mid-1990s promoted this theory with greater zeal, or with broader acceptance, than John J. DiIulio Jr., then a political scientist at Princeton. Chaos was upon us, Mr. DiIulio proclaimed back then in scholarly articles and television interviews. The demographics, he said, were inexorable. Politicians from both major parties, though more so on the right, picked up the cry. Many news organizations pounced on these sensational predictions and ran with them like a punt returner finding daylight.It certainly had consequences. It energized a movement, as one state after another enacted laws making it possible to try children as young as 13 or 14 as adults. (New York had such a law even earlier, and it is now being applied to Kahton Anderson.) Many hundreds of juveniles were sent to prison for life, though in the last few years the United States Supreme Court has ruled that such sentences must not be automatic, even in murder cases. Individual circumstances and possible mitigating factors should be weighed, the justices said.But how to explain the decline in youth violence?Various ideas have been advanced, like an improved economy in the late \u201890s (never mind that it later went south), better policing and the fading of a crack cocaine epidemic. A less conventional \u2014 not to mention amply disputed \u2014 theory was put forth by some social scientists who argued that the Supreme Court\u2019s 1973 ruling on abortion in Roe v. Wade had an impact. With abortions more readily available, this theory went, unwanted children who could be prone to serious antisocial behavior were never born.The superpredator scare fit neatly with a \u201clock \u2018em up and throw away the key\u201d approach to rising crime that had taken hold even before the \u201890s. Many states are now moving in the opposite direction, if only because incarceration is expensive, in both its human toll and its burden on strapped government budgets.Still, closing prisons is fraught with political peril. Maximum-security prisons in New York State, for example, are typically located in more or less rural areas, and are filled with inmates from New York City. Downstate crime produces upstate jobs, for corrections officers and others. So, even in an era of declining crime, any attempt to reduce the state\u2019s inventory of prison cells runs into resistance from upstate elected officials.As for superpredators, not everyone has abandoned the notion. In the \u201890s, Mr. DiIulio called those youngsters \u201cremorseless\u201d and \u201cimpulsive,\u201d describing them as unburdened by \u201cpangs of conscience.\u201dHmm, said Richard Eskow. Or words to that effect. Mr. Eskow, a senior fellow with the Campaign for America\u2019s Future, wrote for The Huffington Post two years ago that he knew a group of people who matched those very descriptions. They were, he said, the reckless bankers and Wall Street high rollers who almost brought the United States economy to its knees a few years ago.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Queens Shops Get Financial Lift by Storing Cellphones for Students", "Date": "2014-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMetroNew York City prohibits students from carrying cellphones in public schools, but many are reluctant to leave their phones behind. As a result, the rule has created a modest side business for shops near some schools that allow students to store their phones for a fee.But along one commercial stretch in Queens that is close to a cluster of schools, storing cellphones has become almost a matter of economic survival. Not only do the merchants reap a small but welcome source of income, but they have also come to rely on the ancillary sales of food and drinks they make to the students dropping off their phones in the morning and picking them up in the afternoon.\u201cIt helps me keep my business going,\u201d said Ali Ahmed, 59, the longtime owner of a candy store near the intersection of Hillside Avenue and Parsons Boulevard, where waves of teenagers flow through on weekdays, headed to and from one of several nearby schools, including Hillcrest and Jamaica High Schools.The phone storage business has transformed the storefront economy around the bustling intersection, producing such a strong business incentive that local owners say they must take part in order to avoid losing foot traffic.Mr. Ahmed said he started storing cellphones against his will. Like many of the merchants who store phones, he said he would prefer to avoid the headache of organizing storage, dealing with rambunctious teenagers and assuming the risk of losing phones or having them stolen.\u201cI never wanted to take the phones, but business got so bad last year that I had to start,\u201d said Mr. Ahmed, a Yemeni immigrant, who found himself facing dwindling newspaper sales and a rising rent. (He currently pays $3,000 a month for his tiny space.)So out of necessity, he joined a half-dozen or so nearby stores and began providing shelf space to local students in Briarwood, a working-class, immigrant neighborhood in Queens where one is hard-pressed to find a teenager without a smartphone.\u201cNobody wants to leave their phone at home, so we leave them here,\u201d Chitra Deodat, 17, a senior at Hillcrest, said as she picked up her phone from Hill Top Grocery Store on Parsons Boulevard, which is a stone\u2019s throw from Mr. Ahmed\u2019s shop.The competition among the neighborhood merchants has become so fierce that the daily storage rate has dropped to 50 cents a day, from $1.Mr. Ahmed, following other stores\u2019 leads, made a pile of claim tickets by cutting empty cigarette cartons into small squares and then numbering them. He now takes in about 30 phones a day, he said, which has resulted in a rush of afternoon customers buying snacks and sodas, accompanied by groups of friends who also buy items.\u201cIf they don\u2019t come here, they\u2019ll go over there,\u201d Mr. Ahmed said, pointing toward Sunshine Grocery, a small store across Parsons Boulevard that also stores phones.At Sunshine, Mohammed Mia, who works behind the counter, said he stored several dozen phones a day.\u201cWe don\u2019t make money on the phones,\u201d he said. \u201cWe offer it as a service. But, of course, when the students come in, they buy stuff.\u201dAs he spoke, groups of teenagers crowded the counter, holding out bright green numbered tickets to claim phones that had been tucked into individual plastic bags, each with a numbered tag inside.Even a local florist, Hillside Floral Design, now stores phones, in the hope that the teenagers will keep the shop in mind when buying party balloons or floral bouquets, the manager, Carlos Fernandez, said.With several stores to choose from, local students said they try to pick the most secure location. Nearly every teenager can rattle off details of the storied tale of a bunch of cellphones belonging to students that were taken during an armed robbery at Hill Top Grocery.\u201cThat was two years ago, before I got here,\u201d the afternoon counter man at Hill Top said on Tuesday, adding that no robberies had occurred since. He declined to give his name.It certainly has not hurt Hill Top\u2019s clientele. On some afternoons, the line to pick up phones stretches down the block, with police officers on hand to maintain order.Ms. Deodat, and her friend Kevon Ajodhia, 17, said they felt fairly secure leaving their iPhones at Hill Top.\u201cYou\u2019re taking a chance, wherever you leave it,\u201d Ms. Deodat said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t leave them at home because we both have jobs after school, and we need them.\u201dOf the two dozen or so teenagers interviewed in the area, nearly every one dismissed the notion of leaving their smartphone at home. The reasons for needing their phones with them included reaching parents, socializing and arranging rides home after athletic practices or work.At Student\u2019s Variety and Grocery, on Parsons Boulevard, the owner has posted a handwritten sign warning students: \u201cYou lose your ticket, you lose your phone.\u201dThe owner, who declined to give his name, called the stashing of phones crucial to business, saying: \u201cIf we don\u2019t take their phones, they don\u2019t come here. They go somewhere else to buy things.\u201dMost local store owners say they also advise students that they are not responsible for stolen phones.\u201cI tell them, \u2018If something happens, I\u2019m not going to pay you back, to replace your $500 phone,\u2019\u201d Mr. Fernandez, of the florist shop, said. \u201cGetting robbed is a chance you take.\u201dThere have been instances, students and merchants said, of claim tickets falling into the wrong hands and phones being picked up by strangers. That is one reason students lauded the owner of Student\u2019s Variety for taking down their names, asking for identification and refusing to release phones to anyone claiming to have a friendship with the actual owner.\u201cHe knows your name, and whose phone is whose,\u201d said Marco Alejos, 18, a senior at Hillcrest, who prefers to store his phone there. \u201cHe literally won\u2019t give you a phone if you don\u2019t have your ticket.\u201dA dishonest customer did enter Mr. Ahmed\u2019s business recently, claiming a $700 phone that belonged to someone else.\u201cSomeone must have found the ticket and claimed it,\u201d Mr. Ahmed said. \u201cWhen the real owner showed up, he went crazy. He wanted his phone. I gave him $200.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Robinson, a former prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago who was held hostage and shot during a bloody coup attempt by an Islamic group in 1990, died on Wednesday in Port of Spain, the nation\u2019s capital. He was 87. His death was announced by the national security minister, Gary Griffith, who said Mr. Robinson had been hospitalized for conditions related to diabetes.Mr. Robinson, who led Trinidad and Tobago from 1986 to 1991, was held hostage for six days in July 1990, along with several cabinet members and opposition legislators, in a failed coup attempt by 114 members of Jamaat al Muslimeen. The group, which drew followers mainly from the country\u2019s slums, blamed Mr. Robinson for the widespread poverty that followed the collapse of world oil prices in 1983. When the insurgents, brandishing firearms, invaded the Parliament building, they ordered Mr. Robinson to call off the security forces outside. Instead, he instructed the military to attack \u201cwith full force.\u201d He was then beaten and shot in his right leg. Many people died during the coup attempt, which ended with a ruse: Mr. Robinson\u2019s administration promised the insurgents amnesty, then arrested them. But the country\u2019s High Court eventually freed them, and the group\u2019s leader, Yasin Abu Bakr, has never been convicted of any crime. Arthur Napoleon Raymond Robinson was born on Tobago, the smaller of the two Caribbean islands that make up the country, off the coast of Venezuela. He studied law in Britain. He returned to his homeland in the mid-1950s and was first elected to Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s Parliament in 1961. He was finance minister from 1961 to 1967. He is credited with introducing the idea of a single Caribbean market and economy and helping to establish the International Criminal Court. From 1997 to 2003 he held the largely ceremonial position of president. His wife, the economist Patricia Rawlins Robinson, died in 2009. He is survived by a daughter and a son.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Japanese Rush to Buy Before Rise in Sales Tax", "Date": "2014-03-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 March was a boom month for Askul, but the online retailer is far from happy. Shoppers racing to beat an impending increase in Japan\u2019s national sales tax swamped Askul\u2019s systems, snapping up toilet paper, instant rice and other essentials that will be more expensive when the rate goes up to 8 percent on Tuesday, from 5 percent.With the last-minute rush, stationery now takes up to a week to reach customers \u2014 a crisis for a company that is so committed to overnight delivery that its name, Askul, is Japanese for \u201carrives tomorrow.\u201d And Askul worries that once the tax increase takes effect, business will screech to a halt as consumers cut back on spending.\u201cIt\u2019s been such a big disruption,\u201d an Askul spokesman, Kosuke Ito, said of the tax increase. \u201cNow we\u2019re bracing for a sharp falloff.\u201dSo is the rest of Japan. Some department stores in central Tokyo have stayed open late to accommodate last-minute shoppers. On Monday, cars lined up outside of gas stations, as drivers tried to fill up before midnight to save extra yen.\u201cWe got here just in time,\u201d said Kyoko Yamashita, waiting with her husband while an attendant filled up their Honda minivan late Monday at a 24-hour Showa Shell station in central Tokyo. After the rush to stock up, economists are concerned that consumers will hunker down in April \u2014 and maybe for longer. Any such pullback would be a big risk to the country\u2019s already shaky recovery. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has focused on trying to get consumers to spend as part of a broader effort to kick-start the economy and stoke inflation. But after years of deflation, consumers have been reluctant to open their wallets.As the tax increases takes effect, the worry is that consumers will only retrench further. Mrs. Yamashita said she would \u201cprobably think twice\u201d about hopping in her car to run errands now that taxes are going up.\u201cA fall in personal consumption is unavoidable after the consumption tax rate hike,\u201d Daiki Takahashi, an economist at Tokyo\u2019s Dai-ichi Life Research Institute, said in a report.History doesn\u2019t offer much solace. When Japan last raised its sales tax, in 1997, it cast a pall over consumption that helped plunge the country into a recession.At around that time, Japan also started to experience deflation, the painful fall in prices, wages and profits brought about by a shortfall in demand. Such issues are a big reason the nation\u2019s spending habits are so closely tracked.While Japan is on firmer economic footing now, Mr. Abe is encountering his first real headwinds since he took office in late 2012. He galvanized markets last year with a combination of aggressive monetary easing, government spending and promised reforms. But realizing the next phase of his economic recovery plan \u2014 creating a virtuous cycle of rising prices and wages \u2014 will be a tougher feat.Recent economic data have been worrisome. Japan\u2019s gross domestic product was weaker than expected, driven in part by softness in consumer spending and business expenditures.\u201cFor the next three months, the government will have to pivot from talking about growth figures and stock market gains to showing how it is cushioning the blow to Japanese households,\u201d said Tobias Harris, a Japan expert at Teneo Intelligence, a New York-based firm that advises companies.Mr. Abe has sought to address a possible slowdown in consumption with another blast of public works spending. The government pushed through a 5.5 trillion yen supplementary budget in February, and some economists expect the Bank of Japan to introduce more monetary easing.But both Mr. Abe and the Bank of Japan\u2019s governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, have stood firm in their support for higher taxes, which they say are necessary to meet the growing costs of taking care of a population that is both shrinking and aging. Mr. Abe is set to decide later this year whether a further increase in the consumption tax, to 10 percent in 2015, should go ahead as planned.Some retailers have been trying to capitalize on the tax increase by persuading consumers to spend now. Seiyu, a supermarket chain owned by Walmart, has encouraged its customers to buy in bulk to prepare for the higher taxes. Special deals include three months\u2019 worth of Red Bull (90 bottles), a year\u2019s worth of gum (11,000 pieces) and three years\u2019 worth of plastic wrap (60 rolls).But other retailers are worried about what happens next.To avoid a post-tax slump, Askul has been offering coupons to encourage consumers to spread out their spending. It has also been replenishing stocks of cheaper products that Mr. Ito said would most likely be popular in April as people tried to adjust to higher taxes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Silver Anniversary for Mazda\u2019s Blue-Ribbon Sports Car", "Date": "2014-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCollectingBritish automakers like Austin-Healey, Lotus and MG may have originated the tidy, nimble roadster, but it was Mazda, a Japanese company, that mastered the formula decades later. An early proposal for the Mazda MX-5 Miata billed the car as an MGB that would start on rainy days and not leak oil on the driveway. That initial concept became an apt description of the original 1990 model, both in its debut and decades later, when many examples show more than 100,000 miles on the odometer.At the New York auto show, which opened last week and continues through April 27, Mazda is celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Miata with an exhibit dedicated to the roadster. Examples from the three generations trace the roadster\u2019s history to its beginning; two of the cars at the Javits center were displayed at the 1989 Chicago auto show, where the Miata made its first public appearance.The Miata forged its reputation on serpentine roads, favoring a poised chassis over sheer speed. Its lightness and balance let the driver slice through corners, with an open-air rush to heighten the thrill.With the engine humming and the tires singing, the roadster establishes a man-machine connection few automobiles can match. Mazda calls it jinba ittai, the notion of horse and rider as one. The small steering wheel sits in your lap and the gearshift slips through the gates as naturally and effortlessly as scribbling your signature.Both the driving experience and the design highlight a minimalism rare in modern cars. Power steering was optional, the original 1.6-liter 4-cylinder made 116 horsepower and the car weighed 2,100 pounds. The nonpower fabric top could be lowered from the driver\u2019s seat with one hand. The Miata name, from the Old High German word for reward, is arguably the most literal badge ever affixed to a car. And at just $13,800, it was a reward within reach of the masses.The Miata\u2019s creation followed an unlikely course. Bob Hall, an automotive journalist at the time, first pitched the car to Mazda\u2019s head of research and development in 1979. Three years later, Mazda hired Mr. Hall, not to work on the roadster but as a designer of wheel covers for compact cars and front-end clips for the small B-series pickup, a rebadged Ford. Within 18 months he was told to spend his free time \u2014 mornings, lunches and after-hours \u2014 plotting a sports-car program.It was an unusual project for a low-volume manufacturer focused on building economy cars, especially since precursors like the Alfa Romeo Spider and the Fiat X1/9 suggested the demand for such models peaked at a few thousand per year. Mazda trimmed costs by incorporating parts from its higher-volume models. The 5-speed manual transmission came from the 929 sedan, while the 323 compact donated the engine and differential. To amortize costs, Mr. Hall proposed a 10-year life span when most Japanese cars were redesigned every four to six years.The Miata\u2019s program manager, Toshihiko Hirai, wasn\u2019t passionate about sports cars. Instead, he relied on fastidious research to develop the car that radiated passion.\u201cHe knew nothing about sports cars and he knew that he knew nothing about sports cars,\u201d Mr. Hall, who is no longer with Mazda, said in a phone interview. \u201cHe was doing the car the way he wanted, but he was making the car other people wanted.\u201dThen and now, those people are sun-seeking retirees, auto enthusiasts, Sunday drivers and amateur racers alike. Mazda sold more than 35,000 Miatas in the United States in the car\u2019s first full year on sale. The same traits that give it such broad appeal \u2014 reliability, affordability and spirited dynamics \u2014 have also, Mazda says, made the MX-5 the world\u2019s most popular roadracing car. The Miata has been imitated, though its success has never been duplicated. Honda offered a more powerful and more expensive take in 1999-2009 with its S2000. General Motors followed Mazda\u2019s philosophy even more closely with the 2006 Pontiac Solstice and 2007 Saturn Sky. While sales initially topped those of the Miata, they soon dipped and the cars disappeared for good when G.M. shuttered both brands.In 25 years, Mazda made few concessions to changing tastes and trends. The more powerful turbocharged 2004-5 Mazdaspeed MX-5 Miata was the sole deviation from the low-power recipe. Safety regulations dictated a larger and heavier Miata, particularly with the third-generation car that debuted in 2006. Mazda also truncated the name of that model at MX-5 in a bid to boost the car\u2019s masculinity. Buyers refused to call it anything other than Miata, and the full name was back for the following year, the same year that Mazda introduced an optional retractable hardtop to raise the car\u2019s all-season appeal.Even as the details changed, subsequent models remained true to the spirit of the original. Today\u2019s Miata weighs about 2,500 pounds. The lively steering, compliant ride and light-footed handling are intact. A considered succession of engineers preserved the continuity between generations. Takao Kajima, chassis engineer for the original car, served as the project manager for the second-generation and current models. Nobuhiro Yamamoto, a dynamics engineer during the development of the current car, is the top engineer for the fourth-generation Miata, expected to arrive next year as a 2016 model.Mazda has sold more than 920,000 Miatas globally, but the future of this enduring roadster is hardly guaranteed. Sales in the United States have declined from their peak in 1990 to about 5,000 a year. Twenty-five years of experience show that Mazda can develop a roadster that\u2019s as deft as the best European sports cars while sweating the details of cost-effective engineering, economies of scale \u2014 and keeping oil from dripping on the driveway.

{"Headline": "Democrats Use Pay Issue in Bid for Women\u2019s Vote", "Date": "2014-04-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Democrats, trying to recast the midterm election focus away from health care, are reaching out to the constituency that has delivered them the last two presidential elections, the Virginia governor\u2019s race and a bevy of close Senate contests: women.On Wednesday morning the Senate will vote on whether to take up legislation that would make it illegal for employers to retaliate against employees who discuss their salaries, expose employers to civil action for such retaliation, and require the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to collect pay information from employers. Democrats know the legislation will fail. That is part of the plan.\u201cFor the third time, Democrats bring this legislation before the Senate, hoping Republicans will finally do the right thing,\u201d said Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, the majority leader. \u201cIn any other circumstance, Republican senators would be up in arms over this type of economic discrimination. They should be up in arms over equal pay for women, too.\u201dRepublicans were dismissive of the tactic and pointed to the root problem for Democrats, an economy that for six years under Mr. Obama has seen women struggle and fall further behind. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate Republican leader who has found himself in a tough re-election fight with a female candidate, pointed to rising poverty rates for women and declining median incomes since Mr. Obama took office.\u201cDemocrats chose to ignore serious job-creation ideas so they could blow a few kisses to their powerful pals on the left,\u201d he said on the Senate floor.Democrats, to cut through the headwinds against them in the midterm election, must revive the gender gap that has sustained them in campaigns for a generation and expand their political pitch to a broader middle-class audience. Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, paints the effort as an assembly of the electorate: Pay equity reaches women, who are 53 percent of voters; a minimum-wage increase appeals to about 25 percent but energizes the Democratic base, especially poorer voters who tend not to come out in midterm elections; and a coming push on student loans is aimed at 40 million people either in higher education or struggling with student debt.\u201cIncome equity is a big umbrella,\u201d said Jennifer Duffy, Senate political analyst at the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, who gives Republicans a 50-50 shot at winning control of the Senate in November. \u201cYou can talk about a lot of things under it. They need something to hang their turnout efforts on, and this is it.\u201dPolling suggests Democrats are about where they were in 2010, a year they were drubbed on Election Day. That year, according to an exit poll conducted by Edison Research, Democrats held a six-point advantage with women. In February, in a New York Times/CBS News poll, that advantage was five percentage points.In 2008, Democrats held a smaller, four-point gender gap but prevailed because 53 percent of men and 57 percent of women voted for them; in 2010, 43 percent of men voted for Democrats compared with 49 percent of women, and Republicans won in a rout. \u201cYou have to speak directly to women voters,\u201d said Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, Democrat of New York. \u201cIf you\u2019re not fighting for paid family leave or equal pay for equal work or raising the minimum wage or affordable day care or universal preschool, you\u2019re not supporting women in the workplace.\u201dAll this election year, Democrats have struggled to find a message that could both energize their core supporters and resonate with independents. A four-month push to renew expired unemployment benefits culminated Monday night in passage of legislation that would renew them retroactively for more than two million long-term unemployed and keep them going to June. On Tuesday, House Republican leaders showed no sign that political pressure was building on them to act.Efforts to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour have resonated in some Democratic states, where legislatures have acted. But such a narrow issue \u2014 while it polls well \u2014 is not moving the electorate to the Democrats\u2019 side.\u201cThe Democrats are doing anything they can to try to change the subject from the nightmare of Obamacare and the joblessness that we experience in our country right now,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cIt\u2019s been almost amusing to watch them talk about anything and everything other than what the American people have on their mind.\u201dBrad Dayspring, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, compared the Democrats\u2019 campaign strategy to his own party\u2019s efforts in 2006 to overcome an unpopular president, George W. Bush, and an unpopular war in Iraq. Then as now, the president\u2019s party targeted key constituents with tailored legislation, like border security. Republicans trumpeted turnout operations and fund-raising, and tried to turn George Soros into an issue, just as Democrats are doing with the conservative billionaires Charles and David Koch.The result: Republicans lost 31 House seats, six Senate seats and control of Congress.Mr. Reid, citing polling that shows broad support for raising the minimum wage and extending unemployment benefits, evinced only a little concern. \u201cWe feel that we\u2019re doing O.K., that if the election were held today, we\u2019d be fine,\u201d he said.An article on Wednesday about efforts by Democrats to use the equal pay issue to gain more women\u2019s votes misidentified the target of criticism by Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, as the Senate prepared to vote on legislation meant to close the pay gap between men and women. When he referred to \u201cthe left\u2019s latest bizarre obsession,\u201d he was criticizing Democrats\u2019 attacks on David H. and Charles G. Koch, conservative billionaires whose political organizations have spent more than $30 million on ads so far to help Republicans win control of the Senate. He was not referring to the pay-equity issue.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Weakening Currency Could Mean Strength For Turkish Exporters", "Date": "2014-04-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byISTANBUL \u2014 In a country where the exchange rate is considered a key barometer of economic health, almost nobody is happy about the Turkish lira\u2019s decline in the last year.A rise in exports is the potential upside of a falling currency, and it could help blunt some of the shocks now rattling Turkey and threatening its role as a force for stability in the region.No doubt, the weakening of the lira has plenty of negative effects, like sharply higher prices for imported goods, including essentials like food. That is why one of the pressing questions for Turkey and many other emerging markets is whether gains in exports \u2014 and new jobs at companies like Ugur Tekstil \u2014 will be enough to offset the many disadvantages of a sagging currency.The lira has recovered somewhat from its record low against the dollar in January, but it remains about 15 percent below its value of a year ago. As with other emerging-market countries like Hungary and Argentina, Turkey\u2019s weak currency is symptomatic of an outflow of foreign investment amplified by concerns about the country\u2019s political stability.The lira got a lift last week after Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s Justice and Development Party won a decisive victory in local elections. But more turmoil could lie ahead: Turkey holds a presidential election in the summer and parliamentary elections next year.And Mr. Erdogan hardly reassured investors when on the heels of that party victory, he called for the central bank to cut interest rates. It was only after a surprise rate increase in January that the lira stopped sliding, as the suddenly higher yields on Turkish bonds made foreign investors think twice about withdrawing their money.This time, the central bank, widely perceived as susceptible to political pressure, has said it will cut rates at its own pace.Politics aside, Ugur Tekstil, the garment maker, is expecting a good year. Mr. Ugur\u2019s main customers often pay in euros, and the weaker lira makes it easier for him to compete against rivals from Asia.\u201cIt will definitely increase our market share,\u201d Mr. Ugur said in an interview at his officein an upscale neighborhood of Istanbul.In theory, Turkish exports should increase as the lira falls, creating jobs at companies that sell their products abroad and helping counteract the effects of an economic slowdown. Turkish exports rose 6.2 percent in February compared with a year earlier, to $13.2 billion.Those figures included an 8.6 percent rise in exports of knitted goods and an 8.8 percent increase in exports of rugs, according to government data. The textile industry employs an estimated two million people and is crucial to the country\u2019s economic health.Roughly 2,500 people, including subcontractors, work for Mr. Ugur at five factories in Turkey. The company is also benefiting from a gradually reviving European economy, which has prompted his retail clients to step up their purchasing. \u201cWe will need more people,\u201d Mr. Ugur said.Having a currency of its own puts Turkey at an advantage over troubled euro zone countries that faced some of the same weaknesses and made some of the same mistakes \u2014 like becoming too dependent on foreign credit and letting down their competitive guard. This is because Turkey\u2019s currency and interest rates do not rise and fall on the fortunes of richer countries in the way that, for example, Greece and Spain are yoked to Finland and Germany.A weaker lira should help ease Turkey\u2019s dangerously large trade deficit by encouraging exports and by raising the price of imported goods. If products from abroad become more expensive, Turks will buy fewer of them and the deficit will shrink. The trade deficit in February, $5.1 billion, was 27 percent lower than a year earlier.\u201cThe more the lira depreciates, the more money we make,\u201d said Mehmet Kutman, chief executive of Global Investment Holdings, a private equity firm in Istanbul that earns most of its revenue in foreign currencies. \u201cBut it\u2019s not good for the Turkish economy.\u201dAs the price of imports climbed, inflation surged to an annual rate of 8.4 percent in March, partly because a drought has reduced harvests, making household staples even more costly.At many Turkish banks, which have taken out loans in foreign currencies, payments are rising in terms of liras. And profits are under pressure at companies facing higher costs for imports and raw materials.The company imports most of its raw materials and sells most of its products in Turkey. The government sets drug prices and has not allowed them to rise in line with the increases in the cost of raw materials.\u201cThere are huge price pressures on the pharmaceutical market,\u201d said Ali Seyhun, the finance director at Ulagay. \u201cWe are selling everything in liras and paying for everything in euros. We won\u2019t make a profit this year.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inching Forward With Iran", "Date": "2014-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThere is no doubt that the negotiations between the major powers and Iran over its nuclear program have been productive. All the nations involved \u2014 the United States, Britain, France, China, Germany, Iran, even Russia \u2014 appear committed to reaching a deal that will go beyond November\u2019s interim agreement and produce a permanent one. The chief negotiators completed a third round of talks in Vienna on Wednesday and plan to meet again on May 13, after which they expect to begin drafting actual text. They hope to wrap it all up by July 20.As positive as that sounds, it would be na\u00efve to understate how hard it will be to remove the threat of Iran\u2019s producing a nuclear weapon and begin to ease three decades of hostility between Tehran and Washington.Meanwhile, hard-line forces on both sides have been working to undermine any deal. Israel and some members of Congress are insisting that Iran must abandon all nuclear enrichment activities, even for nonweapons purposes. That would be ideal, but it is unrealistic, and insisting on it would scuttle any chance of an agreement. The hard-liners know that, which puts them in the curious position of making a huge political fuss about Iran\u2019s nuclear program while blocking any realistic diplomatic solution. This could cause problems for President Obama as he tries to push talks forward.If the major powers and Iran can do that, they will create an opportunity for dealing with other important challenges, including Afghanistan, drug trafficking, Syria and Iran\u2019s support for extremist groups. The consequences of failure are equally enormous.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Minnesota Lawmakers Vote to Raise Base Wage", "Date": "2014-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMinnesota lawmakers voted to raise the minimum wage on Thursday, making it the fifth state to raise base wages this year with midterm elections approaching. While an effort by President Obama to increase the federal minimum wage has stalled in Congress, action has turned to the states. And in places like Minnesota, where Democrats have control of the State Capitol, the issue is seen as one that will appeal to voters in fall contests. Lawmakers in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland and West Virginia have approved minimum-wage increases this year.In St. Paul, legislators decided to increase the wage to $9.50 an hour from $6.15 by 2016 for large employers. The state\u2019s current rate is below the federal minimum wage and among the lowest in the country. The House approved the bill, 71 to 60. A day earlier, the Senate passed it, 35 to 31. Gov. Mark Dayton, a Democrat seeking re-election in November, has said he will sign the measure on Monday.\u201cWhen the minimum wage is so low, it\u2019s really hard to work your way up that economic ladder,\u201d State Representative Erin Murphy, the House majority leader, said, advocating for the wage increase on the House floor on Thursday. \u201cYou get stuck because you can\u2019t make ends meet. You can\u2019t make your way out.\u201dDuring a sharp debate that split along party lines, Republicans portrayed the wage increase as one more in a list of policies from the majority Democrats that have harmed the state\u2019s economy in the last two years. \u201cThis bill will have consequences,\u201d said State Representative Joe McDonald, a Republican, who added, \u201cFolks will be unemployed. They will be laid off. And businesses shall leave. We\u2019re not competitive enough.\u201dThe change is expected to affect about 350,000 Minnesota residents, state officials said. It raises wages in a gradual way over two years, and would allow increases for inflation after that. While Minnesota\u2019s rate is currently below the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, many workers now receive the federal base rate.Minnesota\u2019s increase falls short of Mr. Obama\u2019s $10.10 an hour goal for the federal minimum wage. For smaller Minnesota businesses, those with gross sales below $500,000, the base wage will rise to $7.75 by 2016.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Community Tug of War in Brooklyn", "Date": "2014-04-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf a building complex straddles the intersection of three community districts in New York, which community board should claim jurisdiction over the buildings\u2019 garbage collection, sidewalk modifications and other assorted concerns?When the development is the 22-acre magnet for controversy known as Atlantic Yards, the complex that includes the Barclays Center, what might otherwise be an arcane administrative riddle shape-shifts into an impassioned argument that touches on the delicate questions of neighborhood identity and the future of a fast-growing part of Brooklyn.As a local watchdog journalist, Norman Oder, wrote on his blog, Atlantic Yards Report: \u201cIs Atlantic Yards more like (and part of) Downtown Brooklyn, or is it, in part or in whole, a piece of Prospect Heights? Or even, in part, an appendage of Park Slope?\u201dOr as Frank Gehry, the architect originally commissioned to design the complex, once said, is Atlantic Yards essentially a new neighborhood, built \u201cpractically from scratch\u201d?For the members of these community boards, the issue has a personal resonance. Though many of them spent nearly a decade battling to keep Atlantic Yards from rising in the first place, they have come to feel possessive about it. If they must live with it, they argue, they should have some say over its impact.Geographically, the project appears to sit in Prospect Heights, most of which falls under Community Board 8. The top half of Atlantic Yards belongs to Community Board 2, which also covers Fort Greene to the north and Downtown Brooklyn to the northwest, among other neighborhoods. Community Board 6, which covers Park Slope, has a triangle of land that bites off part of the bottom half of the arena.This Frankensteinian patchwork, the precise reasons for which have been lost to history, did not matter much when the area was just a railyard and its environs. Now, with a sports arena and hundreds of thousands of square feet in offices, shops and apartments at stake, the situation seems untenable.The jurisdiction question has been simmering since last year, when the community boards discussed taking advantage of a City Charter provision that allows community districts to be redrawn every 10 years if City Hall initiates the process. A decade ago, when plans for Atlantic Yards had just been announced, redrawing the boundaries seemed premature to community board members. Since then, neither the Bloomberg nor the de Blasio administration has weighed in, leaving the question unsettled.Forest City Ratner, the project\u2019s developer, has remained neutral. Ashley Cotton, a spokeswoman for the developer, said all the districts would share local hiring and affordable housing opportunities regardless of what happens.Yet Community Board 2 members cited those benefits when it voted on April 9 to corral the rest of Atlantic Yards without consulting the other two boards \u2014 \u201csort of kicking Community Boards 6 and 8 in the shins,\u201d said Rob Perris, the district manager of Community Board 2.In short, \u201cwe\u2019re waiting for Solomon to appear,\u201d said Craig Hammerman, the district manager of Community Board 6.In this case, however, all parties agree that the baby must not be split.Over the past decade, the community boards have had to weigh in on nearly every question related to Atlantic Yards\u2019 impact, including traffic enforcement and liquor licensing for the Barclays Center, meaning extra meetings, extra phone calls and extra room for friction. Some residents say that the split between the three districts made it difficult to unify the opposition to the project in the first place.Sitting atop three districts also means the project receives most of its city services from three different directions, an arrangement that will only grow more complex when people begin moving into the 6,430 apartments slated for construction. Currently, a Sanitation Department team from one district cleans before Barclays Center shows and another cleans after; the streets are divided about equally between three teams.The development is not trisected in its policing: The boundaries of the 78th Police Precinct were redrawn two years ago to encompass all of Atlantic Yards. The rest of the precinct overlaps with Community Board 6, which has suggested that it could redraw its boundaries to match the precinct\u2019s in the interest of coordinating municipal services for the area more efficiently.Community Board 8 has let it be known that since, geographically speaking, Atlantic Yards lies in Prospect Heights \u2014 and may be just the first of many high-rise developments marching into the rapidly gentrifying area \u2014 it would like to take responsibility. Yet some in Community Board 2 have argued that the high-rises of the project are more in character with the towers that already dot its Downtown Brooklyn territory.At a recent meeting, the second vice chairman of Community Board 8 compared, in a semi-humorous spirit, Community Board 2\u2019s redistricting to Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea.The board wrote in a frosty letter to elected officials, including Mayor Bill de Blasio, that it \u201crejects\u201d Community Board 2\u2019s move, as well as any realignment of the boundaries that would \u201cdecimate\u201d Prospect Heights by splitting it down Vanderbilt Avenue, which could happen if the borders are redrawn to match the 78th Precinct\u2019s.Community Board 6 has refrained from combative remarks, and Mr. Hammerman said it would take no official position before consulting the mayor\u2019s office and the other boards.Then there are the less tangible considerations. The behemoth development could be considered its own neighborhood, attracting thousands of residents, workers and visitors and spawning its own mini-economy.But Gib Veconi, an advocate for Prospect Heights who waged a bitter campaign against Atlantic Yards, believes residents in his neighborhood will bear the brunt of the project\u2019s ill effects. Keeping the project under a single board would focus community participation \u2014 and, if need be, opposition \u2014 as Atlantic Yards and its successors are built, he said.\u201cThis project is going to evolve and all sorts of things are going to happen that nobody\u2019s even thought of yet,\u201d he said. \u201cBeyond that \u2014 my God, look at the pace of development in Brooklyn. How long does anybody expect things to stay the way they are?\u201dAn article in some editions on Wednesday about a dispute among three community boards about which has jurisdiction over the Atlantic Yards development in Brooklyn misstated the uses of the property before a complex was built there. The area included a working rail yard, residential buildings and businesses. It was not an abandoned rail yard.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "America Should Step Back from the East China Sea Dispute", "Date": "2014-04-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorSHANGHAI \u2014 The United States has been a destabilizing force in the dispute between China and Japan over the sovereignty of a small chain of islands in the East China Sea. Not only did Washington create the problem in 1971 by arbitrarily returning the administrative rights of the islands to Japan, but America\u2019s claim that its security alliance with Japan applies to the tiny islands has emboldened Tokyo to take a more aggressive stance toward Beijing.A peaceful resolution of the issue ultimately depends on the willingness of the Japanese government to acknowledge the dispute and pursue more reconciliatory policies toward China. But a major factor is whether Washington will shift its strategy to help rein in Japan and adopt a more reasonable stance that accommodates Beijing\u2019s concerns about its maritime interests and security environment. When Chinese-Japanese relations moved toward normalization after Richard Nixon\u2019s visit to China in 1972, Tokyo and Beijing agreed to shelve the disagreement over who owned the islands, called the Senkaku by Japan and the Diaoyu by China. The situation was largely ignored for decades. But Tokyo\u2019s decision to nationalize the islands in September 2012, prompted by the right-wing former governor of Tokyo, Shintaro Ishihara, was a major change to the status quo and a violation of the tacit understanding between Beijing and Tokyo to let sleeping dogs lie. China had no choice but to react strongly: Beijing sent its patrol boats to the territorial waters surrounding the Diaoyu and has since maintained regular patrols there aimed at asserting its claim to sovereignty. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, a tough-talking nationalist who\u2019s been in office since December 2012, takes an uncompromising position and denies that there is any question over the islands\u2019 sovereignty. This stance, coupled with a more active security policy and other confrontational policies toward China, shows how Japan has transformed under Mr. Abe into a more assertive power. This shift reminds Chinese people of Japanese aggression in the World War II era, which is a very sensitive issue in China.The United States has acted as Japan\u2019s enabler. Washington supports efforts in Tokyo to reinterpret the country\u2019s post-World War II pacifist Constitution to allow the military to act in conjunction with allies beyond Japanese territory. Washington encourages Mr. Abe to pursue a more active and assertive security policy, including the buildup of the Japanese military, which may lead to a further strengthening of Japan\u2019s already advanced air and naval forces. And Washington asserts that the United States-Japan security alliance applies to the East China Sea island dispute; the American military has intensified its cooperation with the Japanese military in the area. These policies suggest that the United States, while claiming to be neutral, not only supports the Japanese position over the islands but, more importantly, prods Japan to be more aggressive toward China. Beijing feels pressure to sustain, and even step up, its patrols in the East China Sea so as to resist the combined American-Japanese power.The immediate concern, before any long-lasting peace is addressed, is to prevent a minor clash from spiraling out of control. Beijing and Tokyo should give their patrol boats strict guidelines on how to avoid provoking each other. The Chinese and Japanese coast guards should establish a hotline and maintain close contact, so as to avert misjudgment and escalation when an incidental conflict threatens to occur. The two countries should strictly prohibit their citizens from landing on the islands as such actions would certainly invite like reactions from the other side.Washington is the key to helping establish the environment for a long-term agreement, which ultimately Japan and China have to reach on their own. In this case, for the United States, it is a matter of inaction, rather than action. Washington can help by avoiding a direct role in the dispute. It should not take sides on the sovereignty issue, nor attempt to serve as an arbitrator. Washington should refrain from pledging overt military support to Japan as the Abe administration may regard such support as a blank check to take an even stronger position against China. The most constructive thing the United States could do is to use its sway to get Tokyo to officially acknowledge the sovereignty dispute. The most efficient and realistic long-term way to solve the conflict is to reach an agreement that simply puts the sovereignty question aside. In other words, as they did in the early 1970s, China and Japan should agree to disagree, and carry on. Japan should take the first step and acknowledge that the sovereignty of the islands is in dispute. Were Tokyo to take this leap, Beijing could then suggest shelving the disagreement altogether. To maintain this status going forward, Beijing and Tokyo could establish a \u201cThree No\u201d formula: no entry into the disputed waters, no landings on the islands, and no flight over them.President Obama\u2019s visit to Tokyo this week is an opportunity to set an agreement in motion. Short of encouraging words from Mr. Obama, a Chinese-Japanese standoff in the East China Sea is likely to continue, undermining regional stability and constraining United States-China relations. The Diaoyu Islands, which are of little real strategic or economic use, are hardly worth disrupting relations among the world\u2019s three largest economies. It is time to put the issue back into a box. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Automation Alone Isn\u2019t Killing Jobs", "Date": "2014-04-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewBack in the 19th century, steam power and machinery took away many traditional jobs, though they also created new ones. This time around, computers, smart software and robots are seen as the culprits. They seem to be replacing many of the remaining manufacturing jobs and encroaching on service-sector jobs, too. Driverless vehicles and drone aircraft are no longer science fiction, and over time, they may eliminate millions of transportation jobs. Many other examples of automatable jobs are discussed in \u201cThe Second Machine Age,\u201d a book by Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, and in my own book, \u201cAverage Is Over.\u201d The upshot is that machines are often filling in for our smarts, not just for our brawn \u2014 and this trend is likely to grow. How afraid should workers be of these new technologies? There is reason to be skeptical of the assumption that machines will leave humanity without jobs. After all, history has seen many waves of innovation and automation, and yet as recently as 2000, the rate of unemployment was a mere 4 percent. There are unlimited human wants, so there is always more work to be done. The economic theory of comparative advantage suggests that even unskilled workers can gain from selling their services, thereby liberating the more skilled workers for more productive tasks.Nonetheless, technologically related unemployment \u2014 or, even worse, the phenomenon of people falling out of the labor force altogether because of technology \u2014 may prove a tougher problem this time around.Labor markets just aren\u2019t as flexible these days for workers, especially for men at the bottom end of the skills distribution. Through much of the 20th century, workers moved out of agriculture and into manufacturing jobs. A high school diploma and a basic willingness to work were often enough, at least for white men, because the technologies of those times often relied on accompanying manual labor.Many expanding economic sectors are not very labor-intensive, be they tech fields like online retailing or even new mining and extraction industries. That means it\u2019s harder for the rate of job creation to keep up with the rate of job destruction, because a given amount of economic growth isn\u2019t bringing as many jobs.Many of these labor market problems were brought on by the financial crisis and the collapse of market demand. But it would be a mistake to place all the blame on the business cycle. Before the crisis, for example, business executives and owners didn\u2019t always know who their worst workers were, or didn\u2019t want to engage in the disruptive act of rooting out and firing them. So long as sales were brisk, it was easier to let matters lie. But when money ran out, many businesses had to make the tough decisions \u2014 and the axes fell. The financial crisis thus accelerated what would have been a much slower process. Subsequently, some would-be employers seem to have discriminated against workers who were laid off in the crash. These judgments weren\u2019t always fair, but that stigma isn\u2019t easily overcome, because a lot of employers in fact had reason to identify and fire their less productive workers.

{"Headline": "Prices Soaring for Specialty Drugs, Researchers Find", "Date": "2014-04-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe findings echo the conclusions of two other reports released last week by major pharmacy benefit managers, which predicted that spending on so-called specialty drugs would continue to rise.\u201cFollowing several years of decline, 2013 was striking for the increased use by patients of all parts of the U.S. health care system,\u201d Murray Aitken, executive director of the IMS Institute, said in a statement. He noted that the spike came before the Affordable Care Act, which has helped provide health insurance to millions of new customers, fully went into effect.But even as consumers became more confident about spending money on health care last year, the report found that a divide is developing between those with medical conditions that can be treated with cheap generic drugs, and those with rare and often more serious diseases that can come with breathtaking price tags.More than half of prescriptions cost patients, on average, less than $5 in out-of-pocket costs in 2013, and 86 percent of them were filled with generic medicines. Nearly a quarter of all prescriptions \u2014 23 percent \u2014 required no out-of-pocket cost at all, an increase that the report\u2019s authors attributed mainly to a requirement in the new health care law that contraceptive drugs be covered free.On the other hand, those who need the costlier drugs paid disproportionately more. Only 2.3 percent of prescriptions accounted for 30 percent of all out-of-pocket costs, the report found.Drug companies have increasingly turned to treatments for smaller and more complex diseases as sales of dozens of blockbuster drugs have collapsed in recent years in the face of competition by cheaper generic versions.In 2013, drug companies debuted 36 new drugs, including 10 notable cancer treatments, the most in more than a decade, the report found. Other significant new drugs on the market included treatments for hepatitis C, multiple sclerosis and diabetes. Pharmaceutical companies began selling 17 drugs last year to treat so-called orphan diseases \u2014 those that affect fewer than 200,000 people nationwide. \u201cThe new drugs coming to market are more specialized, and more tailored to smaller populations of patients, which tends to make them more expensive because fewer people are ultimately going to take them,\u201d said Caroline F. Pearson, vice president at the health care consulting firm Avalere Health. More health plans, faced with more of these high costs, are shifting some of the burden to patients, she said. In 2013, Ms. Pearson said, 23 percent of employer-sponsored health plans placed specialty drugs in their own group, or tier, in which consumers are asked to pay a percentage of the drug cost, rather than a set co-payment. In 2006, just 5 percent of employer plans had a specialty tier. The trend is likely to continue: In the new plans offered to individuals through the health insurance marketplaces, Ms. Pearson said, specialty tiers are \u201cubiquitous.\u201dThe rising cost of specialty drugs contributed to a 3.2 percent increase in total prescription drug spending in 2013, to $329.2 billion, the IMS report found. In 2012, drug spending declined by 1 percent, driven by the arrival of several new generic drugs after the patent for the brand-name products expired. Fewer drugs lost their patent protection in 2013.Perhaps because of the improving economy, the IMS report also found that more patients were opting to visit the doctor, go to the hospital and fill prescriptions for drugs in 2013. Visits to specialists increased by 4.9 percent, the report said, and patients filled an average of 12 prescriptions a year, an increase of 2 percent over the previous year.Advertisement"}

But then he goes on to acknowledge what can be undeniable to anyone who impartially follows the conflict: Both Israel\u2019s and America\u2019s leaders are just not serious about a settlement that approximates the pre-1967 borders, which most of the international community believes should be the starting point for peace negotiations. He winds up by advising that Secretary of State John Kerry take a break from trying to resolve the conflict and to essentially leave the parties to their own devices; but this disingenuously assumes that the parties are on equal footing, which they are not. As long as the United States continues to fund Israel to the tune of $3 billion a year in cash and military assistance, it is complicit in Israel\u2019s illegal and humiliating occupation. The United States, thus, has a moral obligation to not walk away, but to force Israel, through the power of the purse, to accept a just, two-state solution.Andrew M. Alul, ChicagoMr. Cohen notes that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s \u201cinsistence on up-front Palestinian recognition of Israel as a Jewish state\u201d was \u201cnot a demand made of Egypt or Jordan.\u201d In referring to Israel\u2019s \u201cplans to build 700 new settlement units in Jerusalem\u201d and \u201cthe insatiable appetite of Israel\u2019s settlement enterprise,\u201d Mr. Cohen might also have noted that the negotiations which led to the agreements between Israel and Egypt and Israel and Jordan were not conditioned upon the cessation of settlement activity. He could have noted that such cessation was not even a condition for the negotiations between Mr. Netanyahu and Yasir Arafat, which led to the 1998 Wye River Memorandum.Jay A.

I would not be so quick, however, to disregard the importance of General Franco\u2019s intervention on the behalf of Jews during World War II. In fact, I am not so certain whether the 367 Spanish Jews, including my own father, who were sent from Salonika to Bergen Belsen would have been evacuated from the concentration camp in time if it hadn\u2019t been for the Spanish government. Whether Franco took the credit for the work and zeal of individual consulates and diplomats is beyond the point. The truth is that those 367 individuals were probably reunited with their loved ones because of Spanish intervention.Errikos Abravanel, Tel Aviv\u00a0Laws to fight climate changeRe \u201cGlobal warming scare tactics\u201d (Opinion, April 10): We write in support of the strong need for a solutions-based approach to climate change. As a recent landmark report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change highlighted, the world is seeing sobering signs of climate change\u2019s accelerating impacts, from longer, more intense droughts to stronger storms and rising seas. Yet in contrast to the slow pace of international negotiations to combat climate change, national legislation is advancing at a startling rate, a surprise to those who ascribe to the conventional wisdom that progress has waned.Over 450 laws have been passed since 1997 in 66 study countries covering 88 percent of global greenhouse gases released by human activities. This legislative momentum is happening on all continents, and is being led by big developing countries like China and Mexico.While optimistic, we must also be honest. These laws are not yet enough to limit the global average temperature rise to the 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels that scientists say we must not breach if we are to avoid the worst risks of climate change. Yet these actions are putting into place the legal frameworks necessary to measure, report, verify and manage greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 the cause of climate change.As the formal United Nations climate negotiations move toward Paris in 2015 \u2014 the scheduled conclusion of negotiations on a post-2020 framework \u2014 this accumulating legislation is creating a strong foundation on which such a global agreement can be built. Moreover, it is increasingly clear that not only is the agreement in Paris dependent on national legislation being in place in advance, implementation of the accord will only be effective through national laws, overseen by well-informed legislators from all sides of the political spectrum.With their formal responsibilities on legislation and oversight, legislators are a fundamental part of an effective strategy to tackle the world\u2019s environmental and sustainable development challenges. To maximize the chances of success, they must be at the center of all international processes and negotiations. Success in Paris to create a climate agreement, the follow-through to implement the accord and the fate of our planet depend on our actions.Adam Matthews, LondonThe writer is secretary general of Globe International, which groups legislators working to advance climate laws.Terry Townshend, LondonThe writer is Globe International\u2019s head of policy.Climate change is not just about the weather, but also about its impact on natural resources and their ability to renew each season. With fewer and smaller glaciers there\u2019s less fresh water, less cooling and less stability on tectonic plates. With fewer and smaller forests there\u2019s less oxygen, less carbon recycling and carbon capture. The thermal affects of global warming can sink a coastline, turn sunshine into a drought and rainfall into a flood. Unfortunately, climate change and its environmental impact are completely intertwined. Still, we do have many new technologies that can help avert and mitigate this challenge. What is still missing is political will and the financial glue necessary to create a new, globally inclusive economy, which can provide the economic stability for this transition.Mary K.

{"Headline": "Democrats Scramble to Stave Off Midterm Disaster", "Date": "2014-03-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical MemoWASHINGTON \u2014 If it were only President Obama\u2019s flagging poll numbers, the problem for Democrats of how to mobilize core supporters to vote this fall would be bad enough. Midterm elections for an unpopular president\u2019s party are almost always bleak.But it is not only that. The very structure of the 21st-century national Democratic coalition makes its November turnout predicament bad, perhaps historically so.\u201cThere\u2019s never been a worse coalition for the purpose of a midterm election,\u201d said David Wasserman of The Cook Political Report. The ability of Democrats to counter the problem will help determine how politically difficult Mr. Obama\u2019s last two years in the White House could become.Turnout for American presidential elections (roughly six in 10 eligible voters in recent contests) is always higher than for midterm congressional elections (fewer than half). But the rate of falloff from one to the next varies for different groups of voters.In 2012, exit polls showed, Mr. Obama won a second term by rolling up margins of 11 percentage points among women, 24 percentage points among voters ages 18 to 24, and 87 percentage points among blacks. Over the last four midterm elections, turnout by all three groups fell more from the previous presidential race than turnout by Republican-leaning men, whites and those over 65.Young voters have abandoned the midterm electorate at more than twice the rate of seniors. Hispanics, who favored Mr. Obama by a margin of 44 percentage points, have voted at just two-thirds the rate of whites. Unmarried women, the source of the Democratic advantage with women, vote less often than their married counterparts.\u201cI\u2019m worried this could be a disaster,\u201d said Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster.These patterns have not always hurt her party this badly. Retirees, for example, invariably cast ballots more often than younger voters. But as recently as the 2000 presidential race, they leaned Democratic.And as recently as 1976, the gender gap did not exist. Blacks and Hispanics have traditionally voted less often than whites, but their share of the electorate \u2014 and the Democratic base \u2014 is much larger today.Democrats have begun efforts to mitigate the damage, with their House and Senate campaign committees tripling investments in voter mobilization since the last election.\u201cWhen you\u2019re looking at historic trends, you don\u2019t agonize, you organize,\u201d said Representative Steve Israel, Democrat of New York, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.With its sophisticated voter identification and mobilization programs, the 2012 Obama presidential campaign produced a more Democratic-leaning electorate than many Republicans had thought possible. In 2014 battlegrounds like North Carolina and Colorado, vulnerable Senate Democratic incumbents hope to capitalize on the results of those efforts the way Terry McAuliffe did in winning the Virginia governorship last year.But \u201cjust because they find these people doesn\u2019t mean they have a message that will work\u201d to turn them out, said Zac Moffatt, a Republican strategist who was an aide to Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 campaign. Mr. McAuliffe, for instance, had less success mobilizing young voters than he did with African-Americans.Most of the crucial Senate races lie in battlegrounds so friendly to Mr. Romney that Mr. Obama did not contest them in 2012. Among those pivotal states are Arkansas, Alaska, Louisiana and Montana.About 70 percent of House Democrats\u2019 targeted races occur in four states Mr. Obama won (California, Illinois, New York and Florida). Only Florida was competitive enough to attract a full-blown Obama campaign.Even there, a recent special House election underscored the Democrats\u2019 turnout problem. The contested district, which includes much of St. Petersburg, has 2.4 percent more registered Republicans than Democrats. But Republicans outnumbered Democrats by eight percentage points among those who actually voted, early evidence that Republicans are more energized about November.Democrats have some offsetting assets. One is continued growth among the nonwhite population; exit polls from the 2010 midterm election showed that the white share of the electorate declined to 77 percent from 79 percent in 2006, even amid a House Republican landslide.Mr. Obama\u2019s party can try to motivate Hispanics by blaming Republicans for blocking immigration legislation, and women by blaming Republicans for blocking equal-pay and early childhood education legislation. While Republicans attack the new health care law to motivate their base, Democrats can warn young voters that repealing it would kick young adults under 26 off their parents\u2019 insurance plans.More broadly, Democrats can try to alarm supporters by exploiting the Republican Party\u2019s long-running image of being out of touch on economic problems and intolerant on issues like same-sex marriage. Those perceptions only increased during the government shutdown last fall. \u201cThe Republicans have given us a bunch of things to work with,\u201d said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster.Democratic leaders say Mr. Obama and his aides have done virtually everything they have asked. Going forward, he can raise money to help voter mobilization, use his megaphone to push popular priorities like a higher minimum wage, and rally key constituencies in the home stretch.President Ronald Reagan did similar things during the 1986 midterms, when his approval rating was 20 percentage points higher than Mr. Obama\u2019s now. Republicans lost the Senate anyway.Democrats see their biggest opportunity to stem the turnout decline among unmarried women. Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton is expected to help by campaigning this fall.Ms. Lake, the pollster, noted that direct marketing had proved more effective in mobilizing unmarried women than young voters. Often, she said, \u201cYoung people don\u2019t open their mail.\u201dNone of this points toward numerically large losses for House Democrats. With so few districts up for grabs, Mr. Wasserman forecasts gains of two to 12 seats for the Republican majority.Senate races pose the greater risk for Democrats. A net gain of six seats by Republicans would give them control, deepening the party\u2019s ability to thwart Mr. Obama in his final chapter.If Democrats do everything right, strategists say, they could lift turnout levels by one to four percentage points among various constituencies. That could tip some close races.An upturn in the economy, lifting Mr. Obama\u2019s popularity and brightening Democratic spirits, would yield much more. But there is little the president or anyone else can do about that now.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "India's Youth Challenge", "Date": "2014-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialOf the estimated 814 million citizens eligible to vote in India\u2019s general elections that began on April 7, some 150 million are first-time voters between the ages of 18 and 23. How they vote may well determine the results, scheduled to be announced May 16. But will a new government be able to fulfill the aspirations of India\u2019s young citizens?India is experiencing a youth bulge. Nearly two-thirds of Indians are under 35; half are under 25. By 2020, India will be the youngest country in the world, with a median age of 29 years, compared with a median age of 37 years in China at that point. India\u2019s large youth population, often called a \u201cdemographic dividend,\u201d could potentially make India the biggest consumer market and the biggest labor force in the world. India\u2019s youth came of age in the late 1990s and early 2000s during a period of relatively high economic growth, which put a television in the majority of Indian homes and made cellphones ubiquitous. Young Indians have grown up more connected to the world \u2014 beyond their village, their caste, their co-religionists or their income level \u2014 than any previous generation. They can see on their televisions how the rest of the world \u2014 and India\u2019s privileged classes \u2014 live. Unfortunately, most do not have the remotest chance of acquiring the skills and education that would raise their living to those levels, even assuming enough jobs were created to employ them. India\u2019s education system is simply not delivering: A recent report from Pratham, a nonprofit education advocacy group, found that half of India\u2019s 7-year-olds cannot identify letters, and one in five 10-year-olds cannot read sentences. Manufacturing is not expected to generate enough jobs; a recent report indicates more people will be working in agriculture in India in 2019 than in 2012. The new government will need to act quickly to demonstrate that it can do better than its predecessors. It will have to jump-start the faltering economy, provide access to affordable, improved education for boys and girls in all regions and help the private sector create tens, if not hundreds, of millions of decent-paying jobs. Unless it can do that, India\u2019s youthful demographic dividend could turn into a demographic liability.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jeremy Stein to Resign From Fed Board to Return to Harvard", "Date": "2014-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Jeremy C. Stein, a member of the Federal Reserve\u2019s board who has raised concerns about its stimulus campaign, will resign at the end of May and return to his previous role at Harvard.Mr. Stein, who joined the Fed in 2012, needed to return within two years to preserve his tenured professorship.Mr. Stein, an economist and noted academic, has helped to provide an intellectual rationale for the cautious evolution of the Fed\u2019s stimulus campaign, which has not succeeded in returning either unemployment or inflation to normal levels.He has argued that the Fed should temper its efforts to minimize unemployment because those policies encourage financial risk-taking, which can undermine long-term growth by destabilizing markets and causing new crises.His views remain controversial. Many of Mr. Stein\u2019s colleagues, including the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, have said that they see no signs of dangerous overheating in financial markets. Some critics say Mr. Stein is focused on the last crisis instead of the present problem: high unemployment.There is also a continuing debate about whether it ever makes sense to correct overheating in financial markets by raising interest rates. Many officials regard that as a crude tool, at best, because the effects are felt throughout the economy. Mr. Stein, however, sees this as a potential benefit, because the higher rates would potentially solve even problems that regulators did not notice.Mr. Stein\u2019s tenure will be among the shortest in recent Fed history; he had about four years left on his term. Frederic S. Mishkin, who resigned in 2008, was the last governor to serve less than two years.His departure could create a fourth vacancy on the seven-member board. Two nominees, Stanley Fischer and Lael Brainard, are awaiting Senate confirmation. Mr. Obama has not announced a nominee for a third vacancy, created last month when Sarah Bloom Raskin became deputy Treasury secretary.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Debate Over the Common Core", "Date": "2014-04-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetters To the Editor:First, decades of standards-based reforms have not improved high school achievement, according to trend data from the National Assessment of Education Progress. Therefore, the Common Core\u2019s pledge to graduate all students \u201ccollege and career ready\u201d rests on wordplay, not reality.Second, there is no evidence that higher standards will improve equity. States with and without high standards have enormous gaps in student achievement, much of that attributable to a child poverty rate of 22 percent.Third, some $5 billion has been pledged by philanthropies and the federal government to advance the Common Core. Our research shows that much of this is being filtered through schools, while benefiting for-profit and nonprofit service providers. An apt metaphor for what\u2019s taking place is not a circus, per Mr. Brooks, but rather a feeding frenzy. Ms. Kornhaber is an associate professor at Penn State College of Education, and Mr. Barkauskas and Ms. Griffith are graduate students there.To the Editor:David Brooks wonderfully encapsulates the reactionary response on both the left and the right to the Common Core. Whether one loves it, or loathes it, misses the larger point \u2014 that we are finally having a robust national debate concerning what our students should know.The era of accountability and choice is fading as curriculum and instruction come into greater focus. Through a strengthening of curriculum, standards and teacher practice, we may finally improve student performance. While hardly a panacea, the Common Core may help us examine more closely what we teach and how we teach it.Policy makers and researchers would be wise to build on this progress as turf battles over teacher evaluations, vouchers and charter schools continuously lead to impasses. The writer is a doctoral student studying educational policy at George Mason University.To the Editor:Speaking of a \u201ccircus,\u201d how about addressing the elephant in the room, which is that the Common Core standards have never been tested. No one disputes the fact that our educational system is broken. But what I find disturbing is that the same people who are trying to raise the rigor of our nation\u2019s academics based on metrics have developed a program without that same standard.If the goal is to make our kids better able to compete in the global economy, where are the metrics and models that say that the Common Core will have that result? States adopted the Common Core not because they believed in it but because it was required for federal funding, and to leave behind the flawed No Child Left Behind. Over the next 10 years, as we wait to see if the Common Core works, we risk doing a huge disservice to our kids, our teachers and our country.To the Editor:David Brooks caricatures opponents of the Common Core standards as hyperbolic talk-radio hosts or self-interested unionists. He doesn\u2019t mention that education experts from institutions as diverse as the Brookings Institution, the Hoover Institution and the Cato Institute have analyzed the Common Core and explained why politically imposed, uniform standards won\u2019t work.Mr. Brooks repeats the notion that the Common Core was \u201cstate-led\u201d and that adoption by the states was voluntary, conveniently ignoring that the Obama administration did not just \u201cencourage\u201d adoption, but coerced it by making big stimulus dollars hinge on adoption, as well as relief from the disastrous No Child Left Behind. Apparently, one man\u2019s \u201ccircus\u201d is another\u2019s \u201cinformed public.\u201d The writer is associate director of the Center for Educational Freedom at the Cato Institute.To the Editor:The Tea Party\u2019s attacks on the Common Core are little more than whim or fancy. As your article points out, the standards were created by our governors and chief state school officers, not the federal government. But who wrote them is hardly the point. What is important is that they serve to fix states\u2019 blatant dumbing down of standards, generally done for the political purpose of covering up the lack of quality education.One might have thought that the Tea Party, ever distrustful of government, would have applauded the standards, not only for promoting better quality instruction, but also for increasing transparency about the state of public education. That they are instead preoccupied with fears of a \u201cfederal takeover\u201d means that the one thing they clearly don\u2019t care about is the future of our children.

The other five members of the group are Britain, China, France, Germany and the United States.The permanent agreement is aimed at allaying foreign concerns that Iran will build atomic bombs with the enriched uranium from centrifuges it has constructed over the years, or from plutonium that can be harvested from a heavy-water reactor it has been building. Iran has repeatedly denied that it wants nuclear weapons but insists that it will never relinquish the right to nuclear power and technology.That theme was reinforced on Wednesday in Iran, where the conclusion of the talks in Vienna coincided with the celebration of the annual National Nuclear Day, held to exalt Iran\u2019s indigenous nuclear advances. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the country\u2019s supreme leader, used the occasion to denounce what he called longstanding American malevolence toward Iran and asserted that the Iranian nuclear program would never be curtailed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "National Front Wins Support and Elections", "Date": "2014-04-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 The vast exposition hall in the dilapidated southern French town of Perpignan was standing room only on a recent Saturday, and the crowd was chanting, as if for a sports star: \u201cMarine! Marine! Marine!\u201dWhen Marine Le Pen, the charismatic and complicated leader of the National Front, the largest far-right party in France, strode onto the stage, they shouted, cheered and then, with little prompting, soberly began to sing \u201cLa Marseillaise,\u201d the French national anthem.Long prominent as the daughter of the National Front\u2019s founder, Jean-Marie Le Pen, who is widely considered anti-Semitic and xenophobic, Ms. Le Pen now appears to be transforming the party from a fringe player in French politics into a far more central one. She has moderated her party\u2019s image and positioned it to seize on widespread economic insecurity, deep anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim sentiment, and disgust with the political establishment.\u201cWe have five million unemployed people \u2014 why do we allow in more immigrants?\u201d Ms. Le Pen said during a recent interview in her office.As much as anyone, Ms. Le Pen, 45, embodies a strain of conservative populism that has been gathering force across Europe for the past five years. That populism now has its best chance yet to rebalance the ideological debate in a number of countries and challenge the European Union\u2019s decades-long push for deeper integration.In mayoral elections on Sunday, the National Front won in 11 cities and towns, and National Front-leaning candidates triumphed in three more. The showing shook the traditional parties of the left and right, and raised expectations \u2014 or fears \u2014 that the National Front, along with far-right counterparts in countries including Britain, the Netherlands and Italy, could post strong gains in elections for the European Parliament in May.To a country struggling with unrelentingly high unemployment, intensifying global competition and questions about what it means to be French, Ms. Le Pen\u2019s message is nationalistic, anti-elitist, anti-European Union, protectionist and unabashedly anti-immigration.\u201cWe are free to welcome, or not welcome, those who want to come,\u201d she told the applauding crowd in Perpignan, which almost to a person appeared to be white.She and her staff describe the National Front now as \u201ca party of patriots.\u201d But unlike the Tea Party movement in the United States, her philosophy is not anti-government; it favors instead a government that supports what she and her followers view as a traditional French way of life for the people they consider the true French.\u201cWe want to assert our right to national priority,\u201d Ms. Le Pen said at the rally. \u201cPeople want to live like French people in France, not like Saudis or Qataris.\u201dAs for the European Union, she scoffs at it as \u201cthe Soviet Union of Europe.\u201dMs. Le Pen remains shadowed to some degree by her father\u2019s embrace of anti-Semitic themes. He once described the Nazi gas chambers as a \u201cdetail in the history\u201d of World War II.But since taking over the party in 2011, she has pursued a plan to expand the party\u2019s base, election cycle by election cycle, by emphasizing economic themes, trying to recruit more credible candidates and focusing on local elections and winning greater representation in the European Parliament.It is unclear whether the party\u2019s recent gains will last beyond this particular moment in French politics, when President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s Socialist Party and its main rival, the conservative Union for a Popular Movement, are especially weak.The National Front\u2019s appeal starts with Ms. Le Pen\u2019s informal, straight-talking manner, which reduces complex economic problems to a few deft phrases, invokes the glories of a France that now seems to be slipping away and promises that generous government benefits need not be cut, except for immigrants she considers undeserving.She has a commanding presence softened somewhat by her husky voice \u2014 she was a smoker for years and now uses an electronic cigarette \u2014 and seems to invite challenging questions. Her answers may not go deep, but unlike with many politicians, there is no fudge language. She takes as inspiration Joan of Arc, who helped to liberate France from English domination.If the European Parliament elections in May turn out as she predicts, she will seek to form a far-right bloc with like-minded deputies from elsewhere in Europe.Some analysts say they doubt that the National Front\u2019s appeal will continue to grow once the economy recovers.\u201cThese periods have always been great for extremes,\u201d said Pascal Lamy, who recently stepped down as head of the World Trade Organization and spent years at the European Commission. He noted that there had been a strong right-wing movement in France for the past century.But Ms. Le Pen does not fit into neat boxes. Along with wanting to sharply limit immigration and to withdraw from the common euro currency, she supports gay rights, though she does not back same-sex marriage. Twice divorced and now in a relationship with Louis Aliot, who ran unsuccessfully as a National Front candidate for mayor of Perpignan, she is a far cry from the image of a social conservative leader in the United States.She is comfortable retaining a large role for the state in social welfare policy, reflecting a broad French consensus about an expansive function for government.\u201cThe French are attached to public services \u2014 for them it is the guarantee of equality among citizens,\u201d she said.While many of her policy proposals are light on specifics, during her 2012 presidential campaign she backed reducing legal immigration to 10,000 people a year from 200,000, \u201csystematically expelling\u201d illegal immigrants and ending a government medical program for them.Mr. Lamy said he believed that her ideas would eventually be rejected. In the meantime, he said, her agenda \u201cwill animate the debate, which is welcome and which hasn\u2019t happed in the last 50 years.\u201dMany analysts say Ms. Le Pen appears generally determined to move the party away from the anti-Semitic and racist identity of its past. Last fall she expelled from the party a National Front candidate who posted on her Facebook page a photo of the justice minister, Christiane Taubira, who is black, alongside a chimpanzee, with language suggesting they were one and the same.At the same time, Ms. Le Pen cannot stop, and perhaps does not want to stop, people with more racist ideas from supporting her.She and her party appeal to people like Alain Soral, one of the more virulent anti-Semitic writers and speakers in France, though she tempers those allegiances by backing figures like the maverick Robert M\u00e9nard, who on Sunday won election as mayor of B\u00e9ziers with National Front support. Mr. M\u00e9nard was previously the head of Reporters Without Borders, an advocacy group.Yet Ms. Le Pen has repeatedly denounced the growth of Islam in France. In 2010, she described the overflow of the faithful from mosques into adjacent streets as \u201ca new occupation,\u201d language that in France clearly evokes the Nazi era.Hadrien Lenoir, who runs educational programs for SOS Racisme, a nonprofit organization that tracks racial attacks on Jews and Muslims, said that Ms. Le Pen made \u201chuge efforts\u201d to avoid racist speech, but that such language still came out from members of the party.\u201cNobody in the far right today will talk about blacks and Arabs,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will talk of Islam, and the idea that those people have a cultural heritage that is incompatible with French society.\u201dJean-Yves Camus, director of the Observatory of Radical Politics at the Jean Jaur\u00e8s Foundation, said that even if Ms. Le Pen did not succeed in becoming president, she was pushing the entire political discussion to the right, legitimizing her ideas in France and elsewhere in Europe.\u201cThe big mistake of the French right is that each time the National Front wins votes, the right adopts the National Front\u2019s themes,\u201d Mr. Camus said.As the rally in Perpignan ended, people thronged to the stage to greet Ms. Le Pen in person.Matthieu, 25, an unemployed man wearing black jeans and a black jacket who declined to give his last name, looked at Ms. Le Pen admiringly as she held a baby in one arm.\u201cShe\u2019s still so sincere \u2014 she\u2019s a person of conviction,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to go back and revive national patriotism a bit.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Palestinian Teaches Tolerance via Holocaust", "Date": "2014-04-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInternational EducationJERUSALEM \u2014 Mohammed S. Dajani Daoudi is an unlikely advocate for peace between Palestinians and Israelis. He trained as a guerrilla with the Palestine Liberation Organization, was banned from Israel for 25 years because of his prominent role in Yasir Arafat\u2019s Fatah group, and still refers to Israelis as \u201cmy enemy.\u201dBut Mr. Dajani, now the library director and a professor of American studies at Al-Quds University, in East Jerusalem, has become a prominent activist for tolerance.In 2007, he founded Wasatia (\u201cmoderation\u201d in Arabic), a group that promotes the Muslim tradition of compromise and nonviolence. His chosen path has already led him to a lonely stand opposing an academic boycott of Israel supported by most of his Palestinian peers.Recently, he traveled into further isolation by leading an effort to teach Palestinians at universities in the West Bank about the Holocaust, which is not part of the curriculum in Palestinian schools. In addition to a series of seminars on the topic, in March he took what is thought to have been the first group of students from the Palestinian territories to visit the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum, in Poland.Referring to the trip, Mr. Dajani said in an interview, \u201cIt helped emphasize the human story of the Holocaust, to study the meaning of the historical narrative as related to our conflict, to heighten empathy, awareness, and sensitivity.\u201d The visit was part of a study program on conflict resolution involving students and scholars from Wasatia and Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, in Israel. The program is organized by the Friedrich Schiller University of Jena, in Germany, and paid for by the German Research Foundation.Titled \u201cHearts of Flesh \u2014 Not Stone,\u201d a reference to a passage in the Book of Ezekiel, the program also involves sending a group of Israeli students to a Palestinian refugee camp in Bethlehem. German doctoral students in social psychology are surveying the Israeli and the Palestinian participants to see how they react to the visits.Al-Quds University does not officially approve Mr. Dajani\u2019s involvement in the program, a point it emphasized after an article about the trip to Poland appeared in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz.\u201cThe university lecturer and the students involved acted in their personal capacity and were not representatives of the university,\u201d Al-Quds University said in a statement.Some Palestinians outright condemned the trip. Abdullah Dweikat, a local news commentator, lambasted the \u201cpilgrimage\u201d to Auschwitz-Birkenau. \u201cLet us first pay attention to our martyrs and their families,\u201d he wrote on the website for Al-Watan, a television station in Ramallah.Students involved in the project were not immune to such thinking. Responding to peer pressure, undergraduates from Bir Zeit University opted to skip the trip as they were preparing to depart, Mr. Dajani said. Students who did go declined to comment.Mr. Dajani said he was somewhat surprised by the anger the trip engendered. \u201cI find it difficult to understand why anyone would oppose such a visit since students learned much more than they would sitting in a classroom,\u201d he said.Yet he knew that the project was dealing with a sensitive subject for Palestinians, in part because of the misinformation that exists about the Holocaust. \u201cThe few books in Arabic about the Holocaust are tarnished with bigotry,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople have not been able to deal with this sensitive issue because they believe it is at the core of the establishment of the state of Israel, which, in other words, is the source of the Palestinian Nakba,\u201d he added, using the Arabic term for \u201ccatastrophe\u201d by which Palestinians refer to the creation of the Jewish state, in 1948.Mr. Dajani said his eagerness for Palestinian and Israeli students to learn about their historical sufferings resulted from his own journey, which he began as someone dedicated to pursuing armed struggle against the Zionist enemy.Born in 1946, Mr. Dajani is a member of one of Jerusalem\u2019s historic Arab clans. The honorific \u201cDaoudi\u201d was added to the family name after an ancestor was appointed keeper of the Tomb of King David, on Mount Zion, in medieval times. He had planned to study engineering in Lebanon, but his plans changed after the 1967 Middle East war. He was recruited into the ranks of the Fatah guerrillas, where he received military training but never fired a shot in battle. Mr. Dajani eventually became head of the organization\u2019s English-language propaganda arm.Banned from Jerusalem, where his family lived, because of his Fatah activities, he pursued an academic career that took him to the United States, where he acquired a Ph.D. in government from the University of South Carolina and a Ph.D. in political economy at the University of Texas at Austin. In 1993, he was teaching at a university in Jordan when his ailing father finally secured a permit from the Israelis for him to return home.Mr. Dajani began to regard Israelis differently after he accompanied his father for cancer treatment at a hospital in Israel and also witnessed the care given to his dying mother by Israeli doctors and even soldiers.\u201cI became confused about my enemy, who did their best to help my father and my mother,\u201d he said. \u201cI started to see the other side of my enemy, which is the human side.\u201dThe Holocaust course is not the first time he has pushed curricular boundaries. At Al-Quds University, Mr. Dajani has established the somewhat radical idea of an American-studies program. He concentrates not on the history, politics, or culture of the United States, but instead tries to teach his students \u201cwhat made America become great.\u201d\u201cI teach about religious freedom, about multiculturalism, pluralism,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are things I extracted from the American experience, and these are the things that I wanted my students to learn.\u201d These are deeply unfashionable sentiments in a Palestinian context, where America is regarded with suspicion because of its backing for Israel, and American values are seen by many as secular Western implants alien to Arab culture and inimical to Islam.But the only way for Palestinians to advance, Mr. Dajani said, is to acquire the skills of critical thinking and risk-taking that characterize their neighbors, and the only way to engage with Israelis is to understand their deepest fears \u2014 and vice versa.Such thinking has earned him supporters.\u201cHe is very unique,\u201d said Shifra Sagy, a professor of psychology and chairwoman of the Martin-Springer Center for the Study of Conflict Management and Negotiation at Ben-Gurion University, who took the Israeli participants in the \u201cHearts of Flesh\u201d program to the refugee camp. \u201cOther Palestinians are very cautious to do such projects, especially ones that concern the Holocaust. But any cooperation now between Israeli and Palestinian academics is very difficult.\u201dUltimately, Mr. Dajani said, Palestinians cannot begin to understand Israelis unless they learn about the impact of the Holocaust.\u201cIt is my role as a professor to open the minds of my students to knowledge and to learning without any restriction or prohibition,\u201d Mr. Dajani said. \u201cI would like Palestinians to explore the unexplored and to meet these challenges, even though you might find that within their community there will be a lot of pressure on them not to do it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Housing Squeeze Leaves Out the Locals in Macau", "Date": "2014-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInside AsiaMACAU \u2014 With the world\u2019s gambling capital racing to open more than 17,000 new hotel rooms in the next three years to keep pace with a flood of Chinese visitors, only about 4,000 affordable homes for locals are expected to be built in the same period.An average apartment costs more than $500,000 in Macau, a special administrative region of China that has emerged as gambling leader and as one of the world\u2019s costliest places to buy property. Its property prices exceed even those in nearby Hong Kong, where prices are among the highest in the world.Prices in Macau are forecast to rise 10 percent to 20 percent this year, and the situation looks set to worsen as new resorts open.For residents like Dengbao Xian, a 50-year-old taxi driver, soaring property prices mean owning a home in Macau looks impossible.\u201cBuying a flat? Not a chance, even if you work for your entire life,\u201d he said, as he drove past the glitzy front of MGM\u2019s metallic casino tower.Population growth in the tiny territory is expected to jump 20 percent to 700,000 by 2016, according to government estimates.\u201cFour years ago you could buy a flat with 1 million patacas. Now you can\u2019t even buy a parking space,\u201d said Cherrie Choi, a sales director at one agency, Centaline Property. That price is equivalent to about $123,000.Some residents are choosing to buy in Hong Kong, where investment returns are twice those in Macau. Others are buying in neighboring provinces on the Chinese mainland and some, including many retirees, are giving up on the city and moving as far away as Thailand.In March, more than 400,000 people competed for 1,900 affordable housing units, with locals lining up outside Macau\u2019s public housing bureau at 4 a.m., the local media reported.\u201cIt\u2019s really the biggest problem in Macau. Right now the rents and prices of flats have shot up way beyond people\u2019s financial capabilities,\u201d said the lawmaker Jos\u00e9 Pereira Coutinho, who accuses the government of not doing enough to reverse the situation because of its ties with tycoon developers.Property prices have more than tripled since 2009, according to government data. The rise is in tandem with Macau\u2019s gambling revenue, which totaled $45 billion last year, nearly three times as much as that of Las Vegas, Australia and Singapore combined.Macau\u2019s economy relies on gambling, with taxes from such businesses accounting for more than 80 percent of government revenues.With unemployment at 1.7 percent, about 40,000 new workers will be required as new properties open over the next three years, increasing demand for housing and exacerbating tension among protectionist labor unions worried about job security. Analysts estimate that new casinos opening in 2015-17 will require 12,600 new dealers, yet only about 700 are available per year.Macau laws dictate that only locals can work as dealers, and the government is under pressure from residents who regularly protest to try to ensure that these restrictions remain.A lack of a long-term plan for affordable housing is widening inequality, lawmakers and property consultants say, to such a degree that even foreign executives in the casino industry are finding Macau prohibitively expensive.\u201cI have great empathy for the local Macau residents,\u201d said Linda Switzer, vice president of retail at MGM Macau, who said her monthly rent had jumped from a low of 8,000 patacas to 33,000 patacas in seven years.The government said it would continue to \u201cbe mindful\u201d of outside economic changes that affect the local property market and deploy measures like increasing land supply and expanding public housing. Two of Macau\u2019s largest property developers, Shun Tak Holdings and Polytec Asset Holdings, declined to comment for the story.For now, new housing developments are limited to the luxury segment. Projects such as the Fountainside \u2014 featuring 3,000-square-foot villas and landscaped gardens \u2014 are springing up across the crammed peninsula to cater to wealthy buyers looking for a places to park their gambling winnings.With the majority of properties lying idle once purchased and a lack of affordable housing projects in the pipeline, locals are feeling increasingly marginalized. \u201cOne of the sayings in Macau is that since I can\u2019t afford to buy a house, I might as well buy a car,\u201d said Larry So, a Macau-based political analyst.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Unpaid Interns Gain the Right to Sue", "Date": "2014-04-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThousands of interns poised to flood New York City\u2019s offices and institutions this summer may be unpaid. But come June, their legal standing will be improved.The legislation, which passed unanimously in the City Council and takes effect in June, was prompted by a sexual harassment suit brought last year by an unpaid intern in the New York office of a Chinese news agency, Phoenix Satellite Television, who said she was harassed and groped by her supervisor. The harassment claim was thrown out by a federal judge, who found that the intern did not qualify as an employee because she was not being paid, and thus did not have the standing to sue under New York State and City human rights laws, which prohibit discrimination against workers.The bill signed on Tuesday, introduced by Gale A. Brewer, a former city councilwoman and now the Manhattan borough president, broadens the city law to cover unpaid interns in many instances. \u201cThe notion that someone would be an intern in the private sector and not have this support is outrageous,\u201d Ms. Brewer said at the bill-signing in City Hall. This is the third piece of legislation signed by Mr. de Blasio since he took office in January, and it comes amid a broader debate about the legal and moral implications of unpaid or low-paid internships \u2014 for many young people the only way to break into cutthroat industries like media, fashion and entertainment. Cond\u00e9 Nast, the magazine publisher, recently settled a suit brought by former interns who protested being paid below minimum wage; recently, a federal judge ruled against Fox Searchlight Pictures for paying no wages to interns on the set of the film \u201cBlack Swan.\u201d In the case of Cond\u00e9 Nast, the publisher chose to end its internship program, drawing objections from those who said the program offered valuable experience and professional contacts, low compensation aside.In a still-sluggish economy, some workers have said they felt compelled to take an unpaid internship in hopes of gaining paid employment later on. \u201cThe reason people are so concerned with interns being treated properly is that there are more of them,\u201d said Lynne Bernabei, a lawyer who represented Lihuan Wang, the plaintiff in the harassment suit.James Vacca, a Bronx city councilman who sponsored the intern bill, said the legislation was intended to put unpaid interns on equal footing with the paid employees they work with. He read aloud an email from Ms. Wang, who has since returned to her native China, saying the bill would \u201cclose the loophole\u201d in the city\u2019s law. Still, some former interns warned that the measure did not go far enough. During a public-comment period, members of a group called Intern Labor Rights asked Mr. de Blasio on Tuesday to broaden the legislation so that it covered a wider variety of uncompensated internships.\u00a0They said the burden would be on unpaid workers to show that they fit the definition of intern as laid out by the bill.\u201cThe language simply doesn\u2019t cover as many people as it should,\u201d said Greg Riestenberg, a graphic designer and one of the group\u2019s organizers. \u201cI just hope that the bill starts a discussion and this is not the end, and that we\u2019re not backslapping just about the good intentions.\u201dKiran Nazish contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Today, it is burdened with a different, less tractable kind of poverty.\u00a0TWIN BRANCH, W.Va. \u2014 When people visit with friends and neighbors in southern West Virginia, where paved roads give way to dirt before winding steeply up wooded hollows, the talk is often of lives that never got off the ground.\u201cHow\u2019s John boy?\u201d Sabrina Shrader, 30, a former neighbor, asked Marie Bolden one cold winter day at what Ms. Bolden calls her \u201clittle shanty by the tracks.\u201d\u201cHe had another seizure the other night,\u201d Ms. Bolden, 50, said of her son, John McCall, a former classmate of Ms. Shrader\u2019s. John got caught up in the dark undertow of drugs that defines life for so many here in McDowell County, almost died of an overdose in 2007, and now lives on disability payments. His brother, Donald, recently released from prison, is unemployed and essentially homeless.\u201cIt\u2019s like he\u2019s in a hole with no way out,\u201d Ms. Bolden said of Donald as she drizzled honey on a homemade biscuit in her tidy kitchen. \u201cThe other day he came in and said, \u2018Ain\u2019t that a shame: I\u2019m 30 years old and carrying my life around in a backpack.\u2019 It broke my heart.\u201dMcDowell County, the poorest in West Virginia, has been emblematic of entrenched American poverty for more than a half-century. John F. Kennedy campaigned here in 1960 and was so appalled that he promised to send help if elected president. His first executive order created the modern food stamp program, whose first recipients were McDowell County residents. When President Lyndon B. Johnson declared \u201cunconditional war on poverty\u201d in 1964, it was the squalor of Appalachia he had in mind. The federal programs that followed \u2014 Medicare, Medicaid, free school lunches and others \u2014 lifted tens of thousands above a subsistence standard of living.But a half-century later, with the poverty rate again on the rise, hardship seems merely to have taken on a new face in McDowell County. The economy is declining along with the coal industry, towns are hollowed out as people flee, and communities are scarred by family dissolution, prescription drug abuse and a high rate of imprisonment.Fifty years after the war on poverty began, its anniversary is being observed with academic conferences and ideological sparring \u2014 often focused, explicitly or implicitly, on the \u201cculture\u201d of poor urban residents. Almost forgotten is how many ways poverty plays out in America, and how much long-term poverty is a rural problem.McDowell County is in some ways a place truly left behind, from which the educated few have fled, leaving almost no shreds of prosperity. But in a nation with more than 46 million people living below the poverty line \u2014 15 percent of the population \u2014 it is also a sobering reminder of how much remains broken, in drearily familiar ways and utterly unexpected ones, 50 years on.A Scarred LandscapeMuch of McDowell County looks like a rural Detroit, with broken windows on shuttered businesses and homes crumbling from neglect. In many places, little seems to have been built or maintained in decades.Numbers tell the tale as vividly as the scarred landscape. Forty-six percent of children in the county do not live with a biological parent, according to the school district. Their mothers and fathers are in jail, are dead or have left them to be raised by relatives, said Gordon Lambert, president of the McDowell County Commission.Beginning in the 19th century, the rugged region produced more coal than any other county in West Virginia, but it got almost none of the wealth back as local investment. Of West Virginia\u2019s 55 counties, McDowell has the lowest median household income, $22,000; the worst childhood obesity rate; and the highest teenage birthrate.It is also reeling from prescription drug abuse. The death rate from overdoses is more than eight times the national average. Of the 115 babies born in 2011 at Welch Community Hospital, over 40 had been exposed to drugs.Largely as a consequence of the drug scourge, a problem widespread in rural America, the incarceration rate in West Virginia is one of the highest in the country.\u201cWhole families have been wiped out in this county: mother, father, children,\u201d said Sheriff Martin B. West.\u201cThese are good people, good families,\u201d Sheriff West, an evangelical pastor, said of his lifelong neighbors. \u201cBut they get involved with drugs, and the next thing you know they\u2019re getting arrested.\u201dThe sheriff\u2019s wife, Georgia Muncy West, has a historical link to the war on poverty. Her parents, Alderson and Chloe Muncy, were the first beneficiaries of the modern food stamp program, traveling to Welch to collect $95 in coupons. Ms. West, one of 15 children, said that unlike many current families, hers remained intact even through the leanest times. She went to work the Monday after she graduated from high school, sent her two children to college and served on the county school board.As coal mining jobs have declined over half a century, there has been a steady migration away from the mountains. McDowell County\u2019s population is just 21,300, down from 100,000 in the 1950s. Those who stayed did not have the education or skills to leave, or remained fiercely attached to the hollows and homes their families had known for generations.Alma and Randy McNeely, both 50, tried life in Tennessee. But they returned to McDowell County to be close to their large extended family.The couple married when they were 16. In a family photo album, Ms. McNeely appears in her white wedding dress as if headed to the junior prom. Turning the album\u2019s pages for a visitor, she apologized for its lack of captions. \u201cMama couldn\u2019t write, so, you know, there ain\u2019t no names in it,\u201d she said.Ms. McNeely, whose long, dark hair is gathered behind, is known as Maw for being a surrogate mother to many in Hensley, a dot of a community. Her home is a few small rooms under a metal roof, clinging to a hillside.Her husband worked in sawmills before a back injury in 1990. His disability payments, some $1,700 a month, are the family\u2019s only income.After marrying, the couple had two children. Their daughter, Angel, gave birth at 14 and was expelled from a Christian school, her mother said. Now, Ms. McNeely is raising Angel\u2019s daughter, Emalee Short, who is 15.A high school sophomore, Emalee dreams of being a veterinarian or maybe a marine biologist. The house and yard ring with the yelps of a dozen Chihuahuas and other small dogs, some of them strays dropped off by neighbors.A confident teenager in a \u201cTwilight\u201d T-shirt, Emalee is enrolled in Upward Bound, the federal program that offers Saturday classes and summer school for bright students aspiring to college. \u201cI want to be one of the ones who gets out of here,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want people to talk about me\u201d \u2014 meaning the recitation of damaged young lives that is a regular part of catching up.Another photo in the album shows Randy Jr., the McNeelys\u2019 son, known as Little Man. Little Man dropped out of high school six months shy of graduation, \u201cwith me sitting here crying,\u201d Ms. McNeely said. He has been in and out of jail but is one of the lucky ones who have found work, at a junkyard run by a family friend.Although Ms. McNeely encourages her granddaughter to aim for college, which would mean leaving McDowell County, she said that \u201cher other mommy and daddy\u201d \u2014 meaning Emalee\u2019s biological parents \u2014 \u201cand all her aunts and uncles, they don\u2019t want her to go.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re scared she\u2019s going to get hurt,\u201d Ms. McNeely said.Food Stamps and CoalMany in McDowell County acknowledge that depending on government benefits has become a way of life, passed from generation to generation. Nearly 47 percent of personal income in the county is from Social Security, disability insurance, food stamps and other federal programs.But residents also identify a more insidious cause of the current social unraveling: the disappearance of the only good jobs they ever knew, in coal mining. The county was always poor. Yet family breakup did not become a calamity until the 1990s, after southern West Virginia lost its major mines in the downturn of the American steel industry. The poverty rate, 50 percent in 1960, declined \u2014 partly as a result of federal benefits \u2014 to 36 percent in 1970 and to 23.5 percent in 1980. But it soared to nearly 38 percent in 1990. For families with children, it now nears 41 percent.Today, fewer than one in three McDowell County residents are in the labor force. The chief effort to diversify the economy has been building prisons. The most impressive structure on Route 52, the twisting highway into Welch, is a state prison that occupies a former hospital. There is also a new federal prison on a mountaintop. But many residents have been skipped over for the well-paying jobs in corrections: They can\u2019t pass a drug test.Sheriff West, a former coal miner who presided over a magistrate court before he was elected sheriff in 2012, said the region\u2019s ills traced back to many failures by elected officials, including local politicians who governed by patronage and state leaders in Charleston, the capital, who took the county\u2019s solidly Democratic voters for granted and never courted them with aid.While government programs have kept millions of people, especially the elderly, from falling into poverty, rates remain high for many groups of Americans, including children, blacks and Hispanics.The sheriff and other members of McDowell County\u2019s small elite are not inclined to debate national poverty policy. They draw conclusions from what is in front of them.\u201cOur politicians never really did look ahead in this county for when coal wouldn\u2019t be king,\u201d Sheriff West said. \u201cTherefore, we\u2019ve fallen flat on our face.\u201dReturning for NeighborsNot everyone with an education and prospects has moved away. McDowell County has a small professional class of people fighting long odds to better a place they love. Florisha McGuire, who grew up in War, which calls itself West Virginia\u2019s southernmost city, returned to become principal of Southside K-8 School.For Ms. McGuire, 34, the turning point in the town\u2019s recent history was the year she left for college, 1997, when many of the 17-year-olds who stayed behind graduated from beer and marijuana to prescription pill abuse.Many of the parents of the children in her school today are her former classmates. In some, emaciated bodies and sunken eyes show the ravages of addiction. \u201cI had a boy in here the other day I went to high school with,\u201d she said. \u201cHe had lost weight. Teeth missing.

On her first morning at Concord University in Athens, W.Va., about 50 miles from War, her roommate called her to breakfast. Ms. McGuire replied that she didn\u2019t have the money. She hadn\u2019t realized her scholarship included meals in a dining hall.\u201cI was as backward as these kids are,\u201d she said in the office of her school, one of few modern buildings in town. \u201cWe\u2019re isolated. Part of our culture here is we tend to stick with our own.\u201d In her leaving for college, she said, \u201cyou\u2019d think I\u2019d committed a crime.\u201dAs the mother of a 3-year-old girl, she frets that the closest ballet lesson or soccer team is nearly two hours away, over the state line in Bluefield, Va. But she is committed to living and working here. \u201cAs God calls preachers to preach, he calls teachers to certain jobs,\u201d she said. \u201cI really believe it is my mission to do this and give these kids a chance.\u201dMs. McGuire described War as almost biblically divided between forces of dark and light: between the working blue- and white-collar residents who anchor churches, schools and the city government, and the \u201cpill head\u201d community. As she drove down the main street, past municipal offices with the Ten Commandments painted in front, she pointed out the signs of a once-thriving town sunk into hopelessness. The abandoned American Legion hall. A pharmacy with gates to prevent break-ins. The decrepit War Hotel, its filthy awning calling it \u201cMiner\u2019s City,\u201d where the sheriff\u2019s department has made drug arrests.When coal was king, there were two movie theaters and a high school, now closed. \u201cEverybody worked,\u201d Ms. McGuire said.She turned up Shaft Hollow, where many people live in poorly built houses once owned by a coal company, their roofs sagging and the porches without railings. At the foot of Shop Hollow, a homemade sign advertised Hillbilly Fried Chicken. Another pointed the way to the True Light Church of God in Jesus Name. \u201cThis is one of the most country places, but I love these people,\u201d Ms. McGuire said. She said it was a bastion of Pentecostal faith, where families are strict and their children well behaved.\u201cSomeone from Indiana or Pennsylvania, they\u2019re not going to come to McDowell County and live in a house trailer on top of a mountain,\u201d said Bob Brown, a union official.\u201cIt\u2019s important we care about places like this,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are kids and families who want to succeed. They want life to be better, but they don\u2019t know how.\u201dAn article last Sunday about poverty in southern West Virginia misstated the given name of Alma and Randy McNeely\u2019s daughter, who gave birth at age 14.

{"Headline": "Russia Plotting for Ukrainian Influence, Not Invasion, Analysts Say", "Date": "2014-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 The separatist demonstrations again churning through eastern Ukraine have raised fears of a Crimean-style invasion by the 40,000 Russian troops coiled just over the Russian border. But Moscow\u2019s goals are more subtle than that, focused on a long-range strategy of preventing Ukraine from escaping Russia\u2019s economic and military orbit, according to political analysts, Kremlin allies and diplomats interviewed this week. Toward that end, the Kremlin has made one central demand, which does not at first glance seem terribly unreasonable. It wants Kiev to adopt a federal system of government giving far more power to the governors across Ukraine.\u201cA federal structure will ensure that Ukraine will not be anti-Russian,\u201d said Sergei A. Markov, a Russian political strategist who supports the Kremlin.Russian officials have said they envision a system in which regions elect their own leaders and protect their own economic, cultural and religious traditions, including the forging of independent economic ties with Russia.But many experts sharply dismiss the Russian plan as a stalking horse intended to undercut Ukrainian independence. \u201cIt is another way to dismantle and subjugate Ukraine,\u201d said Lilia Shevtsova, an analyst at the Carnegie Moscow Center. \u201cIt means Moscow could grab and peel off any part of Ukraine at any time.\u201dPresident Vladimir V. Putin of Russia \u201cwants Ukraine to be, one, absolutely neutral and, two, dependent on Moscow,\u201d said Vladimir A. Ryzhkov, an opposition politician. \u201cIf you have a weak central government and strong governors, you can play directly with the governors over the head of Kiev.\u201dThe United States, while supporting decentralization, has opposed giving too much power to the regions.Many analysts said the question looming over Ukraine was not simply East versus West. The reality of Russian power is such that Ukrainians must perform a delicate balancing act, giving Mr. Putin enough influence to satisfy his demands while preserving their independence. This will center on the constitutional question of federalism, and will bear close watching, analysts said.(Russia\u2019s only other oft-stated demand, a simpler one, is preserving Russian as an official language \u2014 as it is now in regions where it is widely spoken.)Russian officials are clear about their goals. \u201cA centralized state will only be good for radicals,\u201d said Sergei A. Zheleznyak, a deputy speaker of Russia\u2019s Parliament targeted for United States sanctions in March after pushing for the annexation of Crimea, using the shorthand favored by Russian officials to write off much of the Kiev government.If Mr. Putin believes he is not getting his way on the Constitution, he can be expected to take action before the Ukrainian presidential election scheduled for May 25, when a new government and a new constitution will be cemented, according to a broad range of analysts.Some analysts are pointing to events surrounding the May 9 anniversary of the defeat of Germany in World War II, when huge, emotional crowds fill the streets, as a possible catalyst for Russia to push the solution it wants.While what the Kremlin will choose to do in the weeks ahead is impossible to predict, analysts cited three potential outcomes.In the first, Russia either manages to sway the presidential election with a candidate it favors, or it succeeds in putting in place the federal constitution it seeks in order to hold veto power over foreign economic and military policy.So far, no candidate is allied with Moscow outright. But the two main possibilities are Mikhail Dobkin, the candidate of the Party of Regions, the party long a Moscow favorite, and Yulia V. Tymoshenko, who forged a close working relationship with Mr. Putin when she was prime minister. Ultimately, no Ukrainian leader is likely to risk openly hostile relations with Mr. Putin, given that roughly one-third of the country\u2019s exports go to Russia.The second outcome is a kind of Crimea Annexation Part II, with residents of the east and south voting in a referendum on whether to join Russia. Protesters in Donetsk last weekend already announced that they would hold such a referendum on May 11, though Moscow did not immediately endorse the proposal.What worries Ukrainian officials is that the Kremlin could change course and demand a referendum if it deems any new constitution insufficient. That, in turn, could lead to a military incursion. This second outcome would undoubtedly destabilize Ukraine and thwart a full Western embrace, but it holds significant risks for Moscow.First, there is no guarantee that Russia could take over large portions of eastern Ukraine without a fight, as it did in Crimea. In addition, an incursion would almost certainly prompt much more severe American and European sanctions, badly damaging an already stagnating Russian economy. The United States said Monday that Russian interference in Ukraine would be considered a \u201cserious escalation\u201d that could prompt more sanctions.Trying to bite off a chunk of Ukraine itself could also prove unpopular among Russians, and western Ukraine could emerge as a solid, anti-Russian ally of the West not terribly far from Russia\u2019s borders.There is also strong reason to believe that in a fair vote, the referendum would result in defeat. There has been no significant groundswell for joining Russia, as there was in Crimea, which was part of Russia until 1954 and is home to a significant population of Russian military veterans.Perhaps most important, the oligarchs in eastern Ukraine, several of whom now govern the region, remain mostly opposed to becoming part of Russia.The third and least likely outcome is a full-scale invasion. Domestic support for Mr. Putin soared after the annexation of Crimea and the Sochi Olympics. But the financial cost of an invasion, and the potential for Russians coming home in body bags, could quickly reverse his roughly 70 percent approval rating.Nevertheless, analysts said, an invasion cannot be ruled out. If Mr. Putin is driven solely by the emotional desire to recreate the Russian empire, or if Russian speakers are killed in significant numbers, he may feel he has no choice but to respond with force.Ukraine is even more problematic because of its strategic position between Russia and Europe and its historical, cultural and religious ties to the Russian empire. Mr. Putin had envisioned Ukraine as the cornerstone of a budding Eurasian customs unit that would recreate the Russian empire in breadth and strength, acting as an anti-Western alternative to the European Union.Still, most doubt the crisis will come to a military solution. Sergei Karaganov, dean of the School of International Economics and Foreign Affairs here and an occasional Kremlin consultant, said Russia had all manner of economic and other leverage, starting with gas supplies, that it could use before resorting to force. Mr. Karaganov is often credited with initiating the doctrine that Moscow should champion the interests of millions of ethnic Russians and Russian speakers left outside the borders when the Soviet Union collapsed.\u201cThere are people who want to reunite with Ukraine,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think that is the majority, even in the Kremlin.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Internet and biotechnology stocks were among the day\u2019s biggest gainers.The Fed\u2019s policy makers were unanimous in wanting to remove the thresholds they had been using to gauge the need for a policy tightening, according to minutes of a meeting last month that shed little new light on what might eventually prompt an interest rate rise.\u201cPeople are taking solace in the idea that the Fed may be more accommodative than previously thought, for longer than previously thought,\u201d said Steve Sosnick, equity risk manager at Timber Hill/Interactive Brokers Group. \u201cThat\u2019s giving the lift to stocks.\u201dThe Dow Jones industrial average rose 181.04 points, or 1.1 percent, to close at 16,437.18. The S.&P. 500 gained 20.22 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,872.18. The Nasdaq composite index jumped 70.91 points, or 1.7 percent, to 4,183.90.Alcoa shot up 47 cents, or 3.8 percent, to $13 a share. The stock ranked as one of the S.&P. 500\u2019s top performers after the aluminum producer\u2019s earnings, excluding restructuring charges and other special items, exceeded analysts\u2019 expectations.S.&P. 500 companies\u2019 first-quarter earnings are projected to have increased just 1 percent from a year ago, Thomson Reuters data showed, down sharply from the beginning of the year, when profit growth was estimated at 6.5 percent.Stocks had advanced in the previous session to break a three-day losing streak, as investors bought beaten-down social media and Internet shares.Despite the sell-off, the benchmark S.&P. 500 managed on Tuesday to stay above its 50-day moving average of around 1,840. The index has successfully defended the 1,840 mark several times over the past month.The Nasdaq biotechnology index rose 4.1 percent to close at 2,455.83 on Wednesday, while the Global X Social Media Index exchange-traded fund gained 3.3 percent, to 19.11.\u201cIn recent days, in general, large caps outperformed small caps, and low-beta companies outperformed those with higher betas,\u201d U.S. Bank Wealth Management\u2019s equity research team said in a note to clients. Low beta refers to less volatile stocks that also offer less potential return.\u201cWhile investor sentiment remains fragile, we continue to maintain a constructive outlook for equities, believing that the path of least resistance is still up,\u201d the U.S. Bank research team added. In the latest snapshot of the economy, Commerce Department data showed that wholesale inventories rose at a slower pace of 0.5 percent in February, in line with expectations, after a revised gain of 0.8 percent in January. That data appeared to support economists\u2019 views that restocking inventories did not help the economy in the first quarter.Going against the day\u2019s sharp advance, shares of Intuitive Surgical slid $33.20, or 6.8 percent, to $456.64 after the company estimated that its first-quarter revenue would be well below analysts\u2019 expectations, mainly because of a 60 percent drop in sales of its flagship da Vinci robot system.Shares of the Blackstone-backed hotel chain La Quinta Holdings made a subdued market debut as investors took the view that the stock was fully priced in a crowded market for initial public offerings. The stock closed up 12 cents, or 0.7 percent, at $17.12.In the bond market, interest rates showed little change.

{"Headline": "Growth in Global Trade Is in Ideas, Not Stuff", "Date": "2014-04-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWorld ViewMost of us have a mental image of what globalization looks like. It\u2019s garment workers in an overcrowded Bangladeshi factory, making clothing that will end up on sale at a discount store in a strip mall. It\u2019s container ships stuffed with consumer electronics from China headed for American ports, or tankers full of Middle Eastern oil fulfilling the world\u2019s demand for energy.The researchers aimed to capture the full range of \u201cglobal flows,\u201d as they call them, that collectively represent the world\u2019s interconnections. That includes not just trade in goods and services, but also the flow of money across national borders and of information through digital connectivity.What it shows is a world in which the fastest-growing forms of interconnection are not the ones that fit a lot of those preconceptions.\u201cWe focus a lot on the cheap goods from Vietnam and Bangladesh going to Walmart,\u201d said Susan Lund, one of the authors. \u201cIn fact, the growing and larger share of global trade right now is about knowledge-intensive goods and services.\u201dThat insight by itself isn\u2019t particularly new, of course. People who study international economics and globalization have noted the shift for many years. The McKinsey study, though, adds some useful approaches to quantifying the ways it now occurs.Economists have a habit of looking at the world in terms of aggregates. The trade deficit numbers that the United States government releases each month treat an American company buying engineering services from a French consulting firm the same as it does an American buying a bottle of French wine. But the impact on the economy and society is very different \u2014 the wine represents a story of simple commercial transactions in which people in one country buy goods and services from people in another.But it is those complex, long-lasting and knowledge-intensive forms of international connection, like the engineering example, that are increasing the fastest.Global trade in knowledge-intensive goods \u2014 airplanes, pharmaceuticals, advanced electronics \u2014 rose at a nearly 8 percent annual rate from 2002 to 2012, compared with 6 percent for both capital-intensive but lower-tech goods (like petroleum and agricultural products) and labor-intensive goods (like textiles and toys).The same pattern is evident in the services sector. The sharpest growth, at 7 percent a year from 2002 to 2012, is in international trade of knowledge-intensive services \u2014 engineering and programming, royalties for intellectual property, and so forth. Less knowledge-intensive services, like travel and transportation (think spending on hotels and airline tickets), are growing more slowly.Finally, the McKinsey researchers looked at financial flows. The amount of money crossing global borders has plummeted since the financial crisis, as banks around the world have drastically cut back on international lending.Foreign direct investment is also down from its 2007 peak, but not nearly so sharply. It is already back to its 2006, pre-crisis level of $1.8 trillion. The change in the composition of international financial flows has big implications for globalization.When an American hedge fund buys Brazilian bonds, it counts the same for purposes of financial flows and current account data as if an American company builds a factory in Brazil. But in terms of the true economic interconnection it signifies, the two are different worlds.The hedge fund managers could change their minds on a moment\u2019s notice and dump the bonds, while the builder of a factory is building a partnership that will most likely last years and involve the transfer of knowledge back and forth.It makes sense that foreign direct investment has held up, Ms. Lund said, \u201cbecause that reflects long-term corporate strategy.\u201d\u201cIt reflects a desire to be close to consumers in emerging markets or create long global supply chain, and that has continued despite the financial crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cIf that reduces the volatility of financial flows, that\u2019s a silver lining.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Credit Dries Up, Smaller Companies in China Feel the Pinch", "Date": "2014-04-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Hunan Xinwei Bags Company, a manufacturer of knapsacks and handbags, is struggling to survive. The Chinese economy is slowing. Wages are rising amid a shortage of blue-collar workers. And competition from countries like Vietnam is growing.But what has really hurt Hunan Xinwei in recent months has been a credit squeeze facing small and medium companies all over China. Exorbitant interest rates and a scarcity of loans at any rate have turned the financing of everything from raw materials to equipment into a crippling challenge for businesses and individuals without political connections to borrow at regulated rates from the state-controlled banking system.\u201cThe current monthly interest rate that people like me are paying is around 3 percent,\u201d compared with just 0.5 a month for regulated loans, said Yin Haibian, president of Hunan Xinwei. The credit troubles stem from the central bank\u2019s efforts to break the country\u2019s addiction to the debt-fueled investments in infrastructure and real estate, part of a host of reforms underway. But the government is reining in credit at a time when concerns are mounting about the health of the economy, putting Beijing in a difficult position.As growth wanes, the credit problems affecting companies like Hunan Xinwei \u2014 and other short-term economic stresses \u2014 will test China\u2019s commitment to long-term reforms. If the short-term costs are too high, the government may yet retreat to the time-tested approach of ever greater investments in infrastructure and real estate.\u201cThe underlying economic situation is distorted. They need economic reform,\u201d said Tao Wang, a China economist at UBS.A welter of statistics in recent weeks has prompted worries that China, the largest single contributor to global economic growth, may finally be facing a broad, long-term slowdown.Real estate investment is weakening as price increases have begun to slow after more than a decade of credit-fueled leaps with few interruptions. Investments in new factories have also weakened. And exports, long a source of strength, have settled to a slower pace as rising wages have begun driving some industries, like shoemaking and garment manufacturing, offshore.On Tuesday, China\u2019s central bank announced that the broadly measured money supply grew 12.1 percent in March, compared with a year earlier. That would be a brisk pace for most countries, but it was the slowest in China since comparable record-keeping began in 1997.A series of senior Chinese officials have said that they saw no need for further stimulus beyond recently announced measures like accelerating railroad construction and redeveloping shantytowns at the edges of big cities. But a growing number of economists are calling for the government to start spending money on a greater scale to sustain short-term growth, even at the risk of continuing the rapid buildup of debt in the economy.Railroad construction and shantytown redevelopment \u201cshould provide tailwind for a growth recovery in the coming months, but this is no easy task and more substantial loosening measures are needed in our view,\u201d Goldman Sachs economists said in a statement on Tuesday.At first glance, it seems extraordinary that anyone in China would have trouble finding credit, given how much money is already sloshing around the country. China\u2019s broadly measured money supply passed that of the United States in August 2009, and it has been soaring ever since. China now has two-thirds more money than the United States, swirling through an economy that is a little over half the size of the United States\u2019.But after allowing the country\u2019s money supply to swell sharply, the central bank has begun tapping the brakes on credit. Regulators have also begun to scrutinize more closely the activities of lending trusts, a semi-regulated sector of shadow banking that had been a fast-growing source of loans for small and medium businesses.The first to run into trouble have been entrepreneurial companies. Many struggled for financing even when the economy was experiencing double-digit growth and now find themselves almost completely excluded from a tightening credit market.The central bank has been gradually pushing up open-market interest rates, in the hope that competition will start playing a greater role than political influence in deciding who can borrow money. That policy could help small and medium businesses obtain loans in the long term, but it has had the short-term effect of pushing up borrowing costs.One reason, he said, was that virtually all of the lending was going to China\u2019s biggest banks and biggest state-owned enterprises, and to the mainland operations of multinationals, rather than the small and medium enterprises that are more vulnerable to the economic headwinds. The schism in the credit environment is echoed more broadly in this vast economy. Even as certain sectors struggle, large areas of strength endure.At the opening on Tuesday of the Canton Fair, China\u2019s main international trade exhibition, throngs of buyers from around the world showed up to haggle with vendors from all over the country. In some categories, like household tools, China still dominates global supply and is starting to benefit as demand in the West begins to recover.Leo Ma, the export manager for paint rollers at the JOC Great Wall Corporation, a partly state-owned industrial conglomerate based in Shanghai, was untroubled by a recent weakness in orders and said that his business expected annual growth of more than 30 percent to continue in the years ahead. \u201cAfter Chinese New Year this year, as in past years, there is a bit of a lull,\u201d he said.But China\u2019s knapsack and handbag industry, with dozens of small, fiercely competing companies, illustrates many trends now buffeting the country. Blue-collar wages have more than quintupled in the last decade as far more young people attend universities and as the \u201cone child\u201d policy has begun to reduce the number of young workers. Borrowing money to finance inventories of raw materials has become a costly ordeal.All of the top international companies are reducing the proportion of bags they buy from factories in China and shifting production to less-expensive countries like Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines, said Tatiana Olchanetzky, a leading handbag manufacturing consultant who moved last summer to Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam after 18 years of living in Hong Kong and focusing on southern China. Within China, customers have become very conscious of labels, forcing companies like Hunan Xinwei to develop their own brands. \u201cBusiness lately has been very, very tough,\u201d said Mr. Yin, Hunan Xinwei\u2019s president.Hilda Wang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obamacare Bashing or Bust", "Date": "2014-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThursday, President Obama delivered a compendium of positive news about the Affordable Care Act:\u25a0 Eight million people have signed up for private health insurance.\u25a0 Thirty-five percent of those signing up are under 35 years old.\u25a0 The Congressional Budget Office now estimates that the cost of the law will be $100 billion lower than expected and will significantly shrink the deficit over the next 10 years.\u201cThis thing is working,\u201d the president said. But it rang more as a lamentation than a proclamation. The health care law is a staggering achievement by this president and the Democrats and is likely to be viewed by history as such, but Republican opposition to it has been so vociferous and unrelenting that the president has been hard pressed to find a message that can overcome it.Republicans repeat the same complaints, regardless of their veracity: Obamacare is bad for the economy and bad for Americans; it\u2019s an unwelcome expansion of government by an overreaching president; it\u2019s failing and will never work.As Obama said Thursday:He continued: \u201cI know every American isn\u2019t going to agree with this law, but I think we can agree that it\u2019s well past time to move on as a country. ...\u201dThe president smartly articulated the frustration that much of the opposition to the law in public opinion polls is \u201cattached to general opinions about me or about Democrats and partisanship in the country generally.\u201dThe Republican plan is simply to hold tight to last year\u2019s disapproval and drag it forward to this year\u2019s election. And that just might work. Democrats have so fumbled the selling of the health care law\u2019s advantages, both moral and economic \u2014 faltering and stammering when they should have been steadfast and resolute \u2014 that they have acquiesced the debate to Republican opposition.Rather than fight back with facts, too many Democratic politicians tucked their tails and ran away from the law, or, worse yet, joined the attack.In addition to the effectiveness of Republican attacks and the anemia of Democratic support for the law, the demographics of midterm voters also bode well for Republicans.\u201cThe party of a re-elected president tends to get walloped in the following midterm election. Since 1912 (that\u2019s when the House expanded to 435 seats), the president\u2019s party has lost an average of 29 House seats in the following midterm election.\u201dThe health care law is working, insuring millions of Americans at far less a cost than what was previously estimated. But this civic victory may well contribute to a political defeat in November, unless Democrats can upend historical precedent and change the profile of the people who vote in off-year elections.Our elections have been severely altered by a corporatist Supreme Court, maleficent voter ID laws and gerrymandering run amok. In the face of it all, can Democrats gather the gumption to say, \u201cEnough\u201d? Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pay Gap Is Because of Gender, Not Jobs", "Date": "2014-04-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Upshot Are women paid less than men because they choose to be, by gravitating to lower-paying jobs like teaching and social work?\u201cThere is a belief, which is just not true, that women are just in bad occupations and if we just put them in better occupations, we would solve the gender gap problem,\u201d Dr. Goldin said.Rearranging women into higher-paying occupations would erase just 15 percent of the pay gap for all workers and between 30 and 35 percent for college graduates, she found. The rest has to do with something happening inside the workplace.Take doctors and surgeons. Women earn 71 percent of men\u2019s wages \u2014 after controlling for age, race, hours and education. Women who are financial specialists make 66 percent of what men in the same occupation earn, and women who are lawyers and judges make 82 percent.Other occupations have managed to narrow or even close the pay gap. As pharmacists, women make 91 percent of what men make and as computer programmers they make 90 percent. Male and female tax preparers, ad sales agents and human resources specialists make equivalent salaries.So what\u2019s the difference?Instead, she said, the trick is workplace flexibility in terms of hours and location.Occupations that most value long hours, face time at the office and being on call \u2014 like business, law and surgery \u2014 tend to have the widest pay gaps. That is because those employers pay people who spend longer hours at the office disproportionately more than they pay people who don\u2019t, Dr. Goldin found. A lawyer who works 80 hours a week at a big corporate law firm is paid more than double one who works 40 hours a week as an in-house counsel at a small business.Jobs in which employees can easily substitute for one another have the slimmest pay gaps, and those workers are paid in proportion to the hours they work.Pharmacy is Dr. Goldin\u2019s favorite example. A pharmacist who works 40 hours a week generally earns double the salary of a pharmacist who works 20 hours a week, and as a result, the pay gap for pharmacists is one of the smallest.Pharmacy became such an equitable profession not because of activism but because of changes in the labor market (fewer self-owned pharmacies and more large corporations) and changes in technology (storing patient records on computers where they are easily accessible by any pharmacist).In other jobs, workers have made these changes themselves. Conventional wisdom is that in jobs like surgery, employees cannot easily substitute for one another and must be on call.But in one type of medicine, obstetrics, doctors have figured out another way. No longer are many obstetricians on call around the clock. If a baby arrives in the middle of the night, a doctor working an eight-hour shift at the hospital is likely to handle the delivery instead of the doctor who cared for the mother for 40 weeks.\u201cSomehow in obstetrics we have convinced people that it doesn\u2019t matter which one you\u2019re going to get,\u201d Dr. Goldin said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the way that it has to be.\u201dWhat all this data presumes is that women with children are the ones who want the flexibility to work remotely or at odd hours. Maybe more workplaces would change more quickly if men placed more value on that, too.The Upshot provides news, analysis\nand graphics about politics,\npolicy and everyday life.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Capitalism and the Dalai Lama", "Date": "2014-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWHAT can Washington, D.C., learn from a Buddhist monk?In early 2013, I traveled with two colleagues to Dharamsala, India, to meet with the Dalai Lama. His Holiness has lived there since being driven from his Tibetan homeland by the Chinese government in 1959. From his outpost in the Himalayan foothills, he anchored the Tibetan government until 2011 and continues to serve as a spiritual shepherd for hundreds of millions of people, Buddhists and non-Buddhists alike. Very early one morning during the visit, I was invited to meditate with the monks. About an hour had passed when hunger pangs began, but I worked hard to ignore them. It seemed to me that such earthly concerns had no place in the superconscious atmosphere of the monastery.Incorrect. Not a minute later, a basket of freshly baked bread made its way down the silent line, followed by a jar of peanut butter with a single knife. We ate breakfast in silence, and resumed our meditation. This, I soon learned, is the Dalai Lama in a nutshell: transcendence and pragmatism together. Higher consciousness and utter practicality rolled into one.There was no dissonance, though, because the Dalai Lama\u2019s teaching defies freighted ideological labels. During our discussions, he returned over and over to two practical yet transcendent points. First, his secret to human flourishing is the development of every individual. In his own words: \u201cWhere does a happy world start? From government? No. From United Nations? No. From individual.\u201dBut his second message made it abundantly clear that he did not advocate an every-man-for-himself economy. He insisted that while free enterprise could be a blessing, it was not guaranteed to be so. Markets are instrumental, not intrinsic, for human flourishing. As with any tool, wielding capitalism for good requires deep moral awareness. Only activities motivated by a concern for others\u2019 well-being, he declared, could be truly \u201cconstructive.\u201dTibetan Buddhists actually count wealth among the four factors in a happy life, along with worldly satisfaction, spirituality and enlightenment. Money per se is not evil. For the Dalai Lama, the key question is whether \u201cwe utilize our favorable circumstances, such as our good health or wealth, in positive ways, in helping others.\u201d There is much for Americans to absorb here. Advocates of free enterprise must remember that the system\u2019s moral core is neither profits nor efficiency. It is creating opportunity for individuals who need it the most.The solution does not lie in the dubious \u201cfair share\u201d class-baiting of politicians. We need to combine an effective, reliable safety net for the poor with a hard look at modern barriers to upward mobility. That means attacking cronyism that protects the well-connected. It means lifting poor children out of ineffective schools that leave them unable to compete. It entails pruning back outmoded licensing laws that restrain low-income entrepreneurs. And it means creating real solutions \u2014 not just proposing market distortions \u2014 for people who cannot find jobs that pay enough to support their families.In other words, Washington needs to be more like the Dalai Lama. Without abandoning principles, we need practical policies based on moral empathy. Tackling these issues may offend entrenched interests, but this is immaterial. It must be done. And temporary political discomfort pales in comparison with the suffering that vulnerable people bear every day.At one point in our summit, I deviated from the suffering of the poor and queried the Dalai Lama about discomfort in his own life. \u201cYour Holiness,\u201d I asked, \u201cwhat gives you suffering?\u201d I expected something quotably profound, perhaps about the loss of his homeland. Instead, he thought for a moment, loosened his maroon robe slightly, and once again married the practical with the rhapsodic. \u201cRight now,\u201d he said, \u201cI am a little hot.\u201dArthur C.
