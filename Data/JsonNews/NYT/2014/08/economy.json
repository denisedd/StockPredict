{"Headline": "Sharon Sloane of Will Interactive: See Yourself as Others See You", "Date": "2014-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCorner OfficeQ. What were some early lessons for you?A. I was fortunate to have two incredible parents. My mother was probably the kindest, sweetest person to ever walk the earth and devoted her life to helping others. My father was brilliant, kind and warm. His family was very poor, and he lost his mother when he was 8, so he began working at that age, whatever he could do, to support his three younger siblings and put food on the table. He was very much a self-made man, and he became quite successful.He just had this extraordinarily positive attitude about life. He had many inventions and patents and built successful businesses. So I grew up in this very entrepreneurial setting. Conversations around the kitchen table often included figuring out margins and price points. He also talked about the importance of not depending on anyone else for your livelihood. You want to be the person who signs the paycheck, not the one who\u2019s waiting to see if you\u2019ll get one. What were your career plans in college?I studied education, and then got a master\u2019s degree in counseling, which probably has served me better than an M.B.A. The therapist is always in. Tell me about your leadership style.One approach, which my father taught me, is what\u2019s called the \u201cplatinum rule.\u201d It means, do unto others as they would have you do unto them. It recognizes that not everybody is motivated by the same thing. You can\u2019t necessarily fulfill everyone\u2019s wishes, but it\u2019s crucial to understand what makes them tick. Given your background in counseling, do you have good techniques for having difficult conversations?I\u2019ve learned that you\u2019ve got to get \u201con the balcony\u201d \u2014 you have to take yourself out of the situation and look at it as if you\u2019re viewing other people playing your role. You have to be able to walk in someone else\u2019s shoes and really empathize with them. But it\u2019s also just as important to see yourself as others see you. If you can do that, it gives you a 360-degree view, and then you have more understanding. It doesn\u2019t make a hard job easier, but it gives you a framework. Other insights about leadership?This isn\u2019t about leadership, per se, but I have noticed a lot more ethical misconduct and loss of integrity among people we do business with. I\u2019ve had to really learn how to deal with that.You\u2019ve seen it firsthand, I take it. If I didn\u2019t see certain things with my own eyes, I wouldn\u2019t have believed they happened \u2014 people not living up to contract terms, or misrepresenting their roles or intentions. I hadn\u2019t encountered this until the last few years. I think the economy is part of it. When things get hard, sometimes the worst side of people comes out and they\u2019re looking for a scapegoat or to protect themselves. People I know in all kinds of different businesses are saying the same thing. How do you hire? What are you looking for?We really look for \u201cbeam holders.\u201d Please explain.A beam holder is someone who feels personally responsible for the welfare and growth of the company and will do whatever it takes. If things are falling apart in another department, they\u2019ll reach out to help hold up the ceiling.It also means that I\u2019d be looking for you to go the extra mile. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean working 80 hours a week. It means that I want to be able to talk with you and have you talk with me about everything that\u2019s really important here, even if the work we\u2019re talking about is not your responsibility, because I want you to be personally invested in our success. If that means answering emails on the weekend, then I know you\u2019re going to do that. I\u2019m not going to abuse it, but you\u2019re going to be there for me, and by the same token, I\u2019m going to be there for you.We also give what we call mission-type orders here. I will be very clear with what the goal is, what the objective is. Then I\u2019m basically going to give you the latitude to do it. If you need my help or have a problem, come see me. Otherwise, I bless you. So I look for people who can take mission-type orders and succeed.I\u2019ll also ask what\u2019s important in your life. People certainly can prepare for that, but it\u2019s also the way they answer it. I\u2019m pretty good at picking up the memorized scripts. That\u2019s part of my background. What advice would you give to graduating college students?Try to find your passion and follow it, because I feel really sorry for people who dread going to work every day. Another thing is to be patient. You have to earn your stripes. I think there is a tendency, especially with this younger generation, that if they are bright, they think they\u2019re going to burst onto the scene. It takes time.The third thing is that you\u2019re going to have some failures and defeats. Learn from them. My favorite expression is, examined experience is the best teacher.I do something every day that I call \u201cchair time.\u201d It\u2019s my time at home at the end of the day. I just sit quietly, turn my phone off, and I let the day wash over me. What really happened today? Sometimes it\u2019s realizing that maybe something was said that I didn\u2019t really pick up on, or connecting a couple of dots.My mother used to do that, too. I remember she would sometimes be sitting in the living room after a busy day. I\u2019d say, \u201cMom, are you O.K.?\u201d She\u2019d say: \u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m just thinking about the day.\u201d We have to be comfortable with silence, and I don\u2019t think a lot of people are.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Labor Costs Climbed 0.7% In Quarter, a Sign of Health", "Date": "2014-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Labor costs recorded their biggest gain in more than five and a half years in the second quarter, and a gauge of trends in the jobs market fell last week to an eight-year low, bolstering the economy\u2019s outlook.Economists cautioned against reading too much into the rise in the employment cost index, but they said a tightening jobs market suggested coming gains for wage growth.\u201cMost members of the Federal Reserve appear to believe it will be a lot later and not very rapidly, but I am not that sure,\u201d said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa.The index is one of the favorite labor market gauges of the Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, and is being closely watched for clues on the timing of the first interest rate increase from the Fed.\u201cWe do expect to see a steady inflection higher in wage growth going forward that we think will call into question the Fed\u2019s contention,\u201d said Ted Wieseman, an economist at Morgan Stanley in New York.While overall claims increased 23,000 to 302,000 last week, that reflected difficulties smoothing out volatility from the data around this time of the year because of shutdowns at automobile plants for retooling.\u201cThe pace of layoffs is slowing, reflecting the need on the part of companies to retain more workers in the context of improving economic activity,\u201d said Anthony Karydakis, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak in New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sharing the Family Genes", "Date": "2014-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe 2015 Subaru Legacy.The 2015 Subaru Legacy shares its underpinnings and powertrains with the vastly more popular Outback \u2014 the crossover outsells the sedan by a large margin \u2014 so it also benefits from that model\u2019s significant improvements in fuel economy, handling and all-around civility that came with this year\u2019s redesign.Pricing for the Legacy begins at $22,490, including a $795 destination charge, for a 4-cylinder with a continuously variable automatic transmission. The fanciest 4-cylinder is the Limited model priced at $27,290. A 6-cylinder is available only in a Limited trim with a price of $30,090. The model I tested was the intermediate-level Premium version. The window sticker read $29,785, reflecting a $2,195 package that included a sunroof, keyless entry and navigation system, and $300 for the equipment that make it a Partial Zero Emissions Vehicle.In addition to its revised styling, the 2015 Legacy is about 1.6 inches longer. The interior has a fresh upscale look, with some pleasing-to-the-touch surfaces like the door handles. There\u2019s no mystery about the basic controls: knobs and buttons. All-around vision is good. Subaru has resisted the styling trend that calls for scrunched-down windows and peek-a-boo visibility. There is enough room for four six-foot adults, and a 15-cubic-foot trunk \u2014 a slight increase over last year \u2014 provides plenty of cargo capacity.The new Legacy earned a rating of Top Safety Pick+ in crash tests carried out by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The group also gave the optional anticollision system, called EyeSight, a performance rating of Superior.\u00a0EyeSight uses cameras to spot objects in the vehicle\u2019s path and then automatically applies the brakes. On the road, this much-improved Legacy is a series of pleasant surprises. First, increases in soundproofing mean that the chorus of wind, road and engine noises that troubled the previous Legacy is finally under control. Improvements to the 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine and C.V.T. translate to far lower levels of noise and vibration than we have come to expect from such powertrains.The improvements to ride and handling take a little longer to discover. While it is instantly clear that the Legacy does a good job of reducing the impact of broken surfaces and that the body feels solid, it takes a little time, and some increasingly bold driving, to discover how well the Legacy handles. It\u2019s not a sport sedan, but it moves a lot closer to the capabilities of the Honda Accord and Ford Fusion.The steering is quicker than the last generation, though it still lacks feeling, and the brake pedal is too soft. Nevertheless, the compromise between ride and handling is impressive.The 4-cylinder is rated at 175 horsepower and it has to deal with a curb weight of 3,455 pounds. Happily, the continuously variable transmission responds very quickly, and because it isn\u2019t limited to a fixed number of gears it fills in weak spots in the engine\u2019s r.p.m. range. Subaru estimates that it will take a so-so 8.8 seconds to reach 60 miles per hour. Particularly for a car that has all-wheel drive, the fuel economy is quite good, with a federal rating of 26 miles per gallon city and 36 m.p.g. highway. That\u2019s 2 more m.p.g. in town, and 4 more on the highway, than last year\u2019s 4-cylinder model.Where the Legacy has not been able to keep up with competitors like the Honda Accord, Hyundai Sonata and Toyota Camry is sales. Last year Subaru sold about 42,000 Legacys, about 10 percent of the segment-leading Camry\u2019s sales. In the midsize segment the Legacy has been invisible. Shoppers who can see beyond the sheet metal might be able to change that.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Real Middle East Crisis Is Economic", "Date": "2014-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWhile Iraq\u2019s chaos has many sources, the president is nevertheless on to something; and it\u2019s not just Iraqi Sunnis, but the entire Middle East that is detached from the global economy.Today (using constant dollars), Egypt\u2019s G.D.P. has increased four-fold to $1,566, whereas China\u2019s has increased thirty-fold to $3,583. Similarly, Iran and South Korea had roughly the same per-capita G.D.P. in 1965; now South Korea\u2019s is $24,000, whereas Iran\u2019s is only $3,000.The economies of the Middle East are not only detached from the world\u2019s, but from one another. Most exports in North America, Europe and Asia remain within those regions. Two-thirds of exports to Europe are also from Europe. In the Middle East, only 16 percent of exports to the region as a whole are from other Middle Eastern states.But while Gazans hope for an end to their blockade, and Iranians for an end to sanctions, neither step would provide a silver bullet. Economic malaise is endemic to the region, even in places not suffering from blockades or sanctions.This should concern Western policy makers. The distinction between economic and political problems is false. Like anywhere, economics and politics are inextricably linked. And economic progress is the key to easing the chronic instability that threatens American interests in the region.Among oil importers, bloated public sectors are at the heart of socioeconomic woes. In places like Egypt, where the public sector employs around 30 percent of workers, post-revolution governments in search of quick economic fixes have further increased the public work force and salaries. Generous government subsidies, particularly on fuel, encourage overconsumption and favor inefficient, energy-intensive industries. Together with the large public-sector wage bills, these subsidies strain government finances, resulting in deficits, which increase the cost of credit.These policies, together with obstacles to doing business, inhibit the sort of private-sector activity that would boost growth and employment. Across the region, unemployment \u2014 especially among youth \u2014 is in many cases higher than it was at the outbreak of the Arab uprisings, and economic growth is too slow to reverse the trend.These problems aren\u2019t limited to the oil importers. The International Monetary Fund has warned that oil exporters\u2019 years of massive surpluses are nearing an end, as a result of heavy spending and growing populations. This makes them increasingly vulnerable to a decrease in oil prices, which looks increasingly likely as new sources come online internationally.These economic problems can be fixed, however. In contrast to the region\u2019s political dilemmas \u2014 which often seem intractable \u2014 the West is not only able to help, but regional leaders are open to receiving help. Jordan offers an example: Amid the chaos of the Arab uprisings, Amman quietly implemented tough reforms with the assistance of the United States and the I.M.F.Oil importers need to replace costly fuel subsidies with targeted assistance to the poor and the creation of social safety nets. They also need to ease their dependency on external aid, reduce corruption, and make regulatory changes to encourage private-sector growth. Exporters need to reduce spending and diversify their economies. And both need to shrink their public sectors and modernize their educational systems.The United States and its allies should not only provide advice in overcoming these challenges but also incentivize regional governments to take it. That means working with regional allies that are seeking to diversify and modernize their economies, and coordinating economic aid and tying it to progress on reform, including the political steps necessary to make reforms successful.America should also promote greater economic integration by cooperating with wealthy oil producers to invest in the prosperity of their poorer neighbors, and by offering Middle Eastern states better access to Western markets, especially the European Union.Exhortations for the United States to \u201cdo more\u201d overseas are often criticized as veiled calls for the use of military force. But integrating economic statecraft into diplomacy would help broaden America\u2019s international role beyond the security sphere in a way that promotes long-term peace and stability.It would be na\u00efve to think that economic growth will solve all of the Middle East\u2019s thorny dilemmas; but it would be equally na\u00efve to believe that they can be solved without it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Test for Ukraine in a City Retaken From Rebels", "Date": "2014-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySLOVYANSK, Ukraine \u2014 When Denis Bigunov, a civil servant, recently returned to work after a long break, he found three prisoner\u2019s hoods wrapped in masking tape stashed in his office at City Hall, sinister mementos left behind by the pro-Russian rebels who controlled this eastern Ukrainian city for nearly three months.He donated the hoods to the local history museum \u201cto remind people what really happened\u201d here after masked gunmen seized control on April 12 and, cheered on initially by many residents, began a brutal drive to create a new order rooted in fanatical loyalty to Russia.\u201cWe can\u2019t just liberate these places by force of arms but need to change people\u2019s thinking,\u201d said Anton Gerashenko, an Interior Ministry official from Kiev who visited Slovyansk last week. He came to preside over the exhumation of corpses from a mass grave that he said had been left behind by the rebels before they fled south on July 5 to the city of Donetsk, which is still held by separatists. After a day of digging, workers equipped with a bulldozer and shovels unearthed 14 decomposing bodies, each wrapped in a flimsy white shroud. As it struggles to secure the consent, if not yet the trust, of Slovyansk\u2019s largely ethnic Russian population, Ukraine has found that its best weapon has been provided by the rebels themselves \u2014 a legacy of violent thuggery and chaos that alienated just about everyone.\u201cIt was a horror, a total horror,\u201d said Arkady Glushenko, the chief surgeon at the Lenin Hospital, the city\u2019s biggest. \u201cNobody wants a repeat of that.\u201dAnother powerful tool in the hands of the Ukrainian authorities is the fear many residents have of retribution for their collaboration with the toppled pro-Russian leadership.The new authorities, promising anonymity, have set up a hotline for residents to inform on rebel collaborators, and they have printed fliers warning that a new law mandates up to 15 years in jail for separatism. \u201cOf course people are afraid,\u201d Dr. Glushenko said. \u201cThey are frightened of being punished.\u201dWhen the rebels first seized Slovyansk in April, they hoisted Russian flags, arrested the elected mayor, hunted down traitors and proclaimed the city a \u201cgreat symbol of the struggle for human dignity.\u201d Thousands of residents thronged a large square in front of City Hall to welcome the pro-Russian putsch, chanting \u201cRussia, Russia\u201d and posing for photographs with gunmen they hailed as their saviors from the fascists who had seized power in Kiev with the February ouster of President Victor F. Yanukovych, a Russian-speaker from Donetsk.After pro-Russian gunmen fled as the Ukrainian military advanced, many of the same people rushed into the same square to greet Ukrainian military trucks as soldiers handed out free food. Virtually nobody now admits to having supported the separatists.\u201cThey are happy to welcome whoever gives them food,\u201d said Konstantin Batozsky, an aide to the Kiev-appointed governor of the Donetsk region, which includes Slovyansk.The Ukrainian authorities have restored electricity, water, salaries to municipal workers and pension payments to the older Ukrainians, who now make up around half the city\u2019s shrunken population of roughly 80,000, around two-thirds the number who lived here before the rebels took control.They have also flooded the city with troops, some of them poorly trained irregulars, and strengthened the local police force \u2014 its loyalty somewhat suspect \u2014 with officers from western regions of Ukraine where anti-Russian sentiment is strong.Ukraine has been helped in an odd way by Russia, whose tightly controlled news media has issued a series of hair-raising stories alleging Ukrainian atrocities that have made locals only more wary of bucking the new authorities. LifeNews, a Russian television channel, broadcast a report titled \u201cWitch Hunting,\u201d saying that Slovyansk was being turned into a huge prison camp like Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, where the United States detains terrorists. Channel One, in a particularly gruesome piece of propaganda, reported that Ukrainian troops had crucified a 3-year-old boy in front of his mother in the central square.Even locals who detest the Ukrainian government in Kiev, the capital, dismiss the crucifixion story as a grotesque lie. Until the Russian TV report, nobody here had ever heard of any such incident.True or not, Russian propaganda has helped halt open resistance to the new Ukrainian order. Residents who actively supported the rebels have nearly all fled.\u201cYou would have to be an idiot to stay here,\u201d Lybova Nazarayeva, the director of an orphanage that suffered heavy damage when Ukrainian forces began shelling a rebel base next door, said of the pro-Russian residents. \u201cYou would only get killed or arrested. They all left for Donetsk.\u201d Loudspeakers atop City Hall, used by the rebels to play Soviet-era martial music, now blast Ukrainian state radio. Big posters have gone up across the city proclaiming that \u201cSlovyansk is Ukraine.\u201d But long-closed Soviet-era factories that once dominated the local economy are still rotting away and many other businesses have shut, their premises scarred by shrapnel and bullets. There is no mood of joyous celebration at what Ukrainian officials trumpet as the city\u2019s \u201cliberation.\u201dAnger and animosity bubbles just below the calm surface. In each workplace, everyone knows who did what during rebel rule, creating poisonous currents of suspicion.Nikolai Mishkin, a technician at a communal heating plant here, said his boss had worked zealously with the rebels, even inviting them to store their armor in the plant\u2019s courtyard and climb its brick chimney to scout Ukrainian military positions. \u201cHe was very aggressive in his enthusiasm,\u201d Mr. Mishkin said, adding that he had not seen his boss since Ukraine\u2019s forces arrived.The only prominent figure who is known to have been arrested so far by the Ukrainians is Nelly Schtepa, the former mayor, who initially supported the pro-Russian gunmen but then spent nearly three months locked up by the rebels in City Hall. She is now being held by Ukrainian authorities in Kharkiv, the largest city in eastern Ukraine, awaiting trial on charges of separatism.Interviewed last week by monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Ms. Schtepa admitted making statements that supported the rebel cause but said she had been forced to do so by her rebel captors, who she said had beaten and tortured her. A rebel-designated \u201cpeople\u2019s mayor\u201d who replaced her is missing and is widely believed to have escaped to Donetsk.The organization for security said the Kharkiv detention center where Ms. Schtepa was being held now was clean and well-kept, unlike the filthy City Hall cellar where she and many other prisoners had been held. Rebels also used that basement for target practice, leaving the floor littered with spent cartridges.The new police chief of Slovyansk, Igor Ribalchenko, said investigators had started collecting information about residents suspected of actively supporting the rebels but added that the widespread collaboration of ordinary people would not be punished.\u201cMost people were simply afraid because there were armed terrorists walking around\u201d and they had no choice but to obey, he said. He said that eight police officers who had openly sided with the rebels had fled. An Interior Ministry commission is investigating the rest of the 300-member force. The police chief added that he saw no need for a sweeping purge of the force, despite the fact that its officers put up no resistance when rebels seized the city and then helped them solidify their power.This cautious stand has infuriated people like Victor Butko, the owner of a printing business and editor of a small local newspaper shut by the rebels. Grabbed by pro-Russian gunmen before the arrival of Ukrainian troops, he was held for days in a fetid cellar beneath the local headquarters of the state security service.Passing three police officers guarding the mass grave left by the rebels last week, Mr. Butko cursed them for not resisting the separatists, shouting: \u201cYou are to blame for all this. You all did nothing. You should have picked up your guns and shot them.\u201dThe officers looked at their feet nervously.As some residents who fled during the rebel occupation trickle back home, a semblance of normal life slowly returns. But, Mr. Butko predicted it would take a generation before Slovyansk shook off its flirtation with Russian nationalism. \u201cThe biggest problem here is not economics or anything physical,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is moral. The problem here is in people\u2019s heads.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Home and Jobs Data Suggests Momentum ", "Date": "2014-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Sales of existing homes in the United States rose in July to a 10-month high, and the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell last week, signaling strength in the economy early in the third quarter.The growth outlook was further buoyed by other reports on Thursday showing that in August, factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region hit its highest level since March 2011 while a gauge of future economic activity increased solidly last month.\u201cThe economy is beginning to fire on more cylinders,\u201d said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics in West Chester, Pa.The National Association of Realtors said existing-home sales increased 2.4 percent, to an annual rate of 5.15 million units. That was the highest reading since September and confounded economists\u2019 expectations for a pullback.It was the fourth consecutive monthly gain in sales, confounding economists, who had expected a decline.In a further encouraging sign, the share of first-time buyers rose for a second consecutive month and more houses came onto the market, which should temper price increases. Earlier stages of the housing recovery were driven by investors.Housing activity stagnated in the second half of 2013, weighed down by a run-up in mortgage rates and home prices, but it now appears to be regaining its footing. A report on Tuesday showed a surge in home construction in July.\u201cWe are moving back to a more normal market where it\u2019s driven by the fundamentals of confidence in the economy,\u201d said Budge Huskey, chief executive of Coldwell Banker Real Estate in Madison, N.J.In a separate report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 14,000 to a seasonally adjusted 298,000 for the week ended Aug. 16. That pointed to a sustained improvement in labor market conditions.The four-week average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 4,750, to 300,750. At that level, it is consistent with solid job growth, and claims are back to prerecession levels.The jobless claims report covered the period during which the government surveyed employers for August\u2019s nonfarm payrolls data. The four-week average of claims fell 8,500 between the July and August survey periods, suggesting another month of relatively strong job gains.Nonfarm payrolls increased by 209,000 in July, marking the sixth consecutive month that job growth topped 200,000, a sign of strength last seen in 1997.The firming jobs picture has caught Federal Reserve officials by surprise. Minutes of the Fed\u2019s July policy meeting published on Wednesday showed that officials viewed the improvement in labor market conditions as \u201cgreater than anticipated\u201d and hinted that it could lead to an early interest rate increase.In a third report, the financial data firm Markit said its preliminary manufacturing purchasing managers index for the United States rose to 58 this month, the highest point since April 2010, from 55.8 in July.That show of strength was corroborated by a separate report from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank, which showed that its business activity index increased to 28.0 this month, the highest point since March 2011, from 23.9 in July. Any reading above zero indicates expansion in the region\u2019s manufacturing.\u201cOver all, today\u2019s Philly Fed and Markit manufacturing surveys indicate continued healthy growth in the manufacturing sector in August,\u201d said Dean Maki, chief United States economist at Barclays in New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russia Responds to Western Sanctions With Import Bans of Its Own", "Date": "2014-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Russia retaliated on Thursday for Western sanctions against Moscow, announcing that it was banning imports of a wide range of food and agricultural products from Europe and the United States, among others. The move raised the level of confrontation over Ukraine with measures that seemed likely to affect Russian consumers at least as much as European farming.Dmitri A. Medvedev, the prime minister, announced that Russia would ban all beef, pork, fish, fruit, vegetables and dairy products from the European Union, the United States, Canada, Australia and Norway for one year.\u201cWe hoped until the very last that our foreign colleagues would realize that sanctions are a dead end and that nobody needs them,\u201d Mr. Medvedev said. \u201cThings have turned out in such a way that we have to implement retaliatory measures.\u201dRussia was still considering various measures involving aviation, including a ban on flights over Siberia, which would affect routes used by European and American airlines that fly to Asia, he told a cabinet meeting broadcast live on state-run satellite news channels.But while Russians rich enough to savor fine European food at home may lament, at least in private, the gradual disappearance of such fare from shelves after Thursday\u2019s announcement, Europe\u2019s farmers and food producers, at least initially, suggested the effect of the ban was likely to be limited.The president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, indicated that the greatest impact to Europe might be the atmosphere of uncertainty that the tensions over Ukraine have generated. \u201cOur risks to the recovery were on the downside to begin with, and certainly one of these risks will be the geopolitical developments,\u201d he said at a news conference in Berlin on Thursday. \u201cThe recovery remains weak, fragile and uneven.\u201dAfter the United States, Russia is the biggest market for European agricultural exports, worth about 11.8 billion euros last year, or roughly $15.7 billion, according to Eurostat, the European Union\u2019s statistics agency. That is about 10 percent of European agricultural trade; the vast majority of that commerce stays within the 28-nation bloc.In the past two years, myriad bans imposed by Russia \u2014 usually citing health and hygiene problems with European and North American products \u2014 have already driven food trade with Russia from peak levels. German pork exports, for instance, totaled 83,000 tons in the first four months of 2013, but fell \u201cdrastically,\u201d to just 9,000 tons over the same period this year, the German Farmers\u2019 Association said.A blanket ban on European pork imports last February has driven prices in Russia \u201csignificantly higher,\u201d the association added in a statement, meaning that the Russian consumer is bearing the brunt of the move.Economic analysts suggested that the additional measures announced by Moscow on Thursday could have an immediate but moderate impact on the Russian economy while the country seeks alternative suppliers in Latin America, Africa and Turkey.\u201cEven if Russia says it will try to find additional sources of supply, it will be difficult in the short term,\u201d said Ivan Tchakarov, the chief economist at Citibank for Russia. \u201cConsumers will feel some pinch but I don\u2019t think it will be a massive impact.\u201d\u201cThe key question is what the effect on inflation will be,\u201d he added. The bank is estimating that price increases could add one or two points to the inflation rate for 2014, currently running around 6.5 percent.In announcing the likely ban on Wednesday, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia seemed keenly aware of the danger of price rises, saying that they should be avoided if possible. But no matter the fallout on the urban, Brie-eating elite \u2014 who do not like Mr. Putin much anyway \u2014 the Kremlin move was viewed as another way for the president to enhance his already substantial support base.In an opinion poll conducted Aug. 1 to 4 by the Levada Center, Mr. Putin\u2019s approval rating hit 87 percent, having risen steadily since the annexation of Crimea last March. The last boost in support appears to be fueled by his confrontation with the West, with the idea that he is restoring Russia to its rightful place in the world.Analysts considered the choice of food and agriculture products an obvious one after Western nations imposed three rounds of sanctions and ordinary Russians were waiting to hear what the Kremlin\u2019s response would be.\u201cThe consensus of 80 percent of Russians is that we have to reply, that we will fight,\u201d said Igor Yurgens, the economist who runs the Institute of Contemporary Development, noting it was part of a patriotic wave rolling over the country.In addition, people living in rural areas who make their living from agriculture or food processing or some related industry make up about 30 percent of Russia\u2019s population, he said. They are an important support base for Mr. Putin and have been pushing the substitution of local products for imported ones.Giant supermarket chains and restaurants scrambled to line up new supplies, and consumers dependent on goods like lactose-free milk imported from Finland worried about whether it could be produced locally. Some products, including baby food and wine, were purposely left out of the ban.But nationalist Russian leaders crowed that another victory over Western products was at hand.\u201cWe should have started to protect the market much earlier,\u201d said Gennadi Zuganov, the head of the Communist Party, now part of the loyal opposition. \u201cWe have everything we need to make it.\u201dWestern experts read Thursday\u2019s blanket ban as an alarming signal that hard-liners close to Mr. Putin were gaining influence.\u201cIt is a complete mystery to me what Putin is thinking with this move,\u201d said Wolfram Schrettl, professor of economics at the Free University in Berlin and an expert on Russia and Eastern Europe. \u201cIt is an own goal,\u201d he said, using the soccer term for when a team scores for its opponent by putting the ball in its own net. \u201cWestern agriculture can certainly bear the effects.\u201dIn Russia, he predicted, \u201cit will look soon like the Soviet Safeway \u2014 empty shelves.\u201d Brazil, for instance, may be ready to increase deliveries of chicken to make up for the absence of such supplies from the United States. \u201cBut it is awkward, and requires extreme efforts.\u201dIn Europe, the effect may be the opposite. Albert Jan Maat, chairman of the Dutch Federation of Agriculture and Horticulture, warned that the Russian ban could spur a glut of farm products in Europe, causing prices to drop. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking of either removing products from the market or temporarily storing them,\u201d he said.In other quarters, the Russian ban was met less with alarm than derision. In Poland, after Russia announced its first ban on some fruit and vegetable imports last week, a campaign for Poles to \u201ceat apples\u201d and \u201cdrink cider,\u201d drew an immediate and immense response with journalists, celebrities and even President Bronislaw Komorowski signing up and posting selfies eating apples on social media.Apple eating aside, reactions in Poland to Russia\u2019s retaliatory actions have been increasingly critical. \u201cAll of this might be just a part of Putin\u2019s game,\u201d the agriculture minister, Marek Sawicki, told reporters. \u201cHe will try to divide Europe.\u201dMr. Sawicki confirmed that Poland would seek compensation in Brussels, as might Finland and perhaps the Baltic nations, where ports, for instance, might suffer as a result of the ban.Any such compensation would most likely come as emergency payments from the vast well of joint European Union funding known as the Common Agricultural Policy. But Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Vincent, a spokesman for the European Commission, said it was \u201cway too early\u201d to make such payments.Echoing the German farm association, it added, \u201cThe biggest impact, we believe, will be on Russian citizens who will be burdened by higher prices for all food products, especially meat and poultry.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misidentified the source for the statement that Russia currently accounts for 7 percent of United States poultry export volume. It is the National Chicken Council, not the International Trade Center.Neil MacFarquhar reported from Moscow, and Alison Smale from Berlin.

{"Headline": "Tug of War Between Republicans Seeking Same Base Support", "Date": "2014-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Texas TribuneFORT WORTH \u2014 One week before a grand jury in liberal Travis County indicted Gov. Rick Perry on two felony counts, he and United States Sen. Ted Cruz were in friendlier territory, speaking at a conference hosted by a conservative blog here in the largest reliably Republican community in Texas.Mr. Perry walked onto the stage of the RedState Gathering to warm applause, his regard among conservative activists having been bolstered by his recent activity related to the border, particularly his decision to send National Guard troops there in response to an influx of migrants.\u201cIf Washington won\u2019t act to secure the border, as governor of Texas, I will,\u201d Mr. Perry said.Eight hours later, Senator Ted Cruz walked into the same hotel ballroom, greeted with the kind of rapturous cheers fitting a military commander returning home from a combat victory. Mr. Perry\u2019s presidential ambitions have since been overshadowed by the news Friday of his indictment related to a 2013 veto of funding for the state\u2019s anti-corruption prosecutors. Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who oversees the public integrity unit, refused Mr. Perry\u2019s calls to resign after she pleaded guilty to drunken driving, prompting the governor\u2019s veto.Mr. Perry was indicted on counts of abuse of official capacity and coercion of a public servant. His office has said he has only acted within his authority as governor, and Mr. Cruz called the indictment politically motivated.Even before his recent legal troubles, Mr. Perry was already operating in Mr. Cruz\u2019s shadow, as most conservative activists in attendance made clear they would rather see the freshman senator vie for the White House in two years than the three-term governor.\u201cWhen I look at you, I imagine you would be just like one of the founding fathers of this country,\u201d a female attendee told Mr. Cruz after his speech.The dynamic underscored a growing tension in Texas politics. As the state\u2019s two highest-profile Republicans are contemplating bids for the White House, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Perry are at the start of a period where they are likely to be constantly jockeying for favor among the same audiences. The legal troubles that have surfaced for Mr. Perry could scuttle his hopes of running again for president before they gain traction.\u201cThis will \u2014 depending on how it plays out and how long it lasts \u2014 will certainly be detrimental to that nascent campaign for the presidential nomination in 2016,\u201d said Cal Jillson, a political-science professor at Southern Methodist University said. (S.M.U. is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune.)While Mr. Cruz is vying for the favor of Tea Party voters, Mr. Perry could still be a powerful draw to a segment of conservatives more interested in a candidate with executive experience, Mr. Jillson said.\u201cHe\u2019s going as an experienced executive, governor of the second largest state in the country with an economic success story to tell,\u201d Mr. Jillson said. \u201cAnd the immigration issue brings him to attention among conservatives.\u201dIn Mr. Cruz\u2019s speech, he promoted recent conservative victories in Washington, including the Democrats\u2019 failure to pass gun control legislation after the mass shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., as signs of a shift in the relationship between grass-roots conservatives and elected officials.\u201cI\u2019m convinced the biggest divide we\u2019ve got in politics in this country is not between Republicans and Democrats,\u201d Mr. Cruz said. \u201cIt is between entrenched politicians in both parties and the American people.\u201dMr. Perry\u2019s speech was reminiscent of ones he gave during his 2012 bid for president in the way it focused on the robust Texas economy, and his belief that the federal government should follow the lead of Texas and other conservative states by lowering taxes and balancing budgets.\u201cYou all know I brag a lot about Texas,\u201d Mr. Perry said. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of been part of my job description for the last 13-plus years. But frankly, we have a lot to be proud of.\u201d Bob Guzzardi, a conservative activist from Ardmore, Pa., told Mr. Perry after his speech that he hoped a man with his message would run for president. Asked about it a day later, Mr. Guzzardi stopped short of saying he would support Mr. Perry in a second presidential run.\u201cI liked the emphasis of what he is talking about, but frankly, I\u2019m more of a Ted Cruz guy,\u201d Mr. Guzzardi said.Kathleen Wazny of Denton echoed a similar sentiment, praising Mr. Perry\u2019s record and noticing an improvement in his delivery from his first presidential run. Yet there was no question whom she hopes to support in 2016. \u201cCruz has been in Washington, and he\u2019s seen the petty politics there,\u201d Ms. Wazny said. \u201cRunning the chessboard in Washington is very different from running the chessboard in Austin.\u201dThe enthusiasm gap even extended to Erick Erickson, editor in chief of RedState.com and the conference M.C., who seemed to favor Mr. Cruz in his introductions. While he praised Mr. Perry as \u201ca man who, while the president is at the golf course, is leading the nation at the border,\u201d he compared the excitement around Mr. Cruz to that of the Beatles and introduced him as \u201cthe leader of the conservative movement in the United States of America.\u201d As Jeff Tucker of Round Rock and Michael Pemberton of Radcliff, Ky., poured themselves cups of coffee ahead of another day of RedState panel discussions and speeches, they compared impressions of the day before. Mr. Pemberton described Mr. Perry as more passionate but said that Mr. Cruz\u2019s arguments were sharper.\u201cI think of the two of them, together, they make one great politician,\u201d Mr. Pemberton said. He then wondered aloud: Could the two Texas leaders possibly run on the same ticket? \u201cI\u2019ve thought a lot about that,\u201d Mr. Tucker admitted.But who should be at the top of the ticket? The two men considered the question for a moment. \u201cProbably Ted Cruz,\u201d Mr. Tucker said, his friend nodding in agreement. \u201cHe fights those guys. He doesn\u2019t back down.\u201dabatheja@texastribune.orgJim Malewitz contributed to this report from Austin.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Africa\u2019s Slide Toward Disaster", "Date": "2014-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe summit seeks to highlight Africa\u2019s development successes and promote trade and investment on a continent rich in oil and natural resources. Justice and the rule of law aren\u2019t on the agenda. But they should be, unless American C.E.O.s want to see their investments evaporate.Another of our African partners, Uganda, may also soon implode. In the two decades since I first worked as a development consultant there, I have watched with horror as a promising country descended into tyranny. President Yoweri Museveni and his henchmen have conned the West out of billions of foreign aid dollars, using these funds to rig elections, torture critics and perhaps worse. The Ugandan Army needlessly prolonged the war against rebel leader Joseph Kony, commander of the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army, while looting its own bloated defense budget.Kampala has so prodigiously looted American aid, mainly earmarked for public health, that rates of malaria are now significantly higher than they were in the 1990s. Women at Mulago Hospital, Uganda\u2019s largest, are more likely to die in childbirth today than they were during Idi Amin\u2019s presidency in the 1970s. Some critics of Mr. Museveni\u2019s government languish in jails where, their lawyers say, they are tortured or killed.Mr. Museveni long assured the West that he would never pass a vicious anti-homosexuality bill, imposing life sentences on some \u201coffenders,\u201d that had languished in Parliament since 2009. But in February, with his popularity plunging because of staggering unemployment, corruption and collapsing public services, he signed it into law with great fanfare. When the United States and other donors threatened (and later imposed) sanctions, Mr. Museveni informed them that the law would be contested in the Ugandan Constitutional Court. On Friday, the court struck down the law; one of the petitioners, Fox Odoi, was the Ugandan president\u2019s onetime legal adviser. Thus Mr. Museveni may have quietly supported the challenge in order to dupe the West yet again, this time into trusting the integrity of Ugandan justice.Meanwhile, the Obama administration is ignoring graver abuses stemming from Mr. Museveni\u2019s long assault on the rule of law. This not only undermines Uganda\u2019s struggle for L.G.B.T. rights, but may also be leading the country to civil war. Signs of stress in the Ugandan Army are emerging, with members of its elite special forces, commanded by President Museveni\u2019s son, Lt. Col. Muhoozi Kainerugaba, having reportedly defected to parts unknown, and with army barracks having been the targets of numerous attacks in recent weeks.It may be too late to prevent another African country from self-destructing. But President Obama and other Western leaders should learn from this pattern of atrocities, particularly since some currently peaceful countries like Ethiopia, Rwanda and Kenya are also imperiled by a culture of impunity. The West must use all means, including aid cuts, trade sanctions, travel bans and forceful public statements, to punish governments that abuse their own people \u2014 before it\u2019s too late. The best guarantee of peace and prosperity is justice. Indifference to it, as the agenda of the U.S.-Africa summit appears to reflect, is creating the very disasters its delegates wish to avoid.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In the Grip of Ebola", "Date": "2014-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMONROVIA, Liberia \u2014 LIBERIANS have begun calling the days between July 27 and Aug. 3 \u201cthe dark week\u201d \u2014 173 new Ebola virus cases and 94 new deaths. How much darker things may get is anybody\u2019s guess. In Johnsonville, a swampy town outside Monrovia, three dozen corpses in body bags were dumped in shallow holes marked by wooden headstones last week. Afterward, white gloves and other protective garments lay scattered everywhere \u2014 abandoned by a doctor and his burial team as the community, bewildered with fright, chased them away. Meanwhile, in Monrovia, the government seemed overwhelmed and panic-stricken. Only on Wednesday did it declare a full state of emergency, letting the military quarantine large areas. Fear, misinformation and flat-out denial have been far too common since March, when West Africa\u2019s Ebola outbreak reached Liberia. Among the government\u2019s first reactions was to limit journalists\u2019 coverage of it. That, in my view, is a major reason the virus has spread as fast as it has. My first sight of an Ebola case came late in June, and only after I insisted that I be allowed to cover one of the many burials rumored to be taking place. When an assistant health minister finally said yes, I went to Paynesville, outside Monrovia, to the ELWA (Eternal Love Winning Africa) Hospital, where the aid workers included a physician, Kent Brantly, and a missionary, Nancy Writebol, the two Americans now back in the United States being treated themselves for Ebola. As I entered the compound I saw men in white protective suits. One, who was to walk me through the burial ritual, whispered that he and his team were about to bring the body out. But a mourner told him, \u201cMy uncle did not have Ebola; he died from high blood pressure.\u201d Confusion reigned until Dr. Brantly emerged and made it clear that the corpse being readied was not the Ebola victim\u2019s. So the workers took off their protective suits, and the head of the burial team said it was too late to inter the Ebola victim: Neighbors of the burial site were chasing them away, fearing that the participants were contaminated. The next day, I went back. It was a sad sight. Only three male relatives had come to mourn the victim, a man in his 20s. White-clad men brought out his body, zipped in a bag on a stretcher that they placed on the ground. An ambulance driver sprayed the bag, which another man in white then unzipped to let the relatives glimpse the corpse; one took a picture of it.I was scared, so I filmed the burial from afar. FrontPageAfrica published my reporting and the images I took on our website and social media platforms.Those were, I believe, the first images of the Ebola outbreak to circulate in Liberia, and the impact was huge; at last, people began to believe that this disease was real.Officials say the outbreak seems to have spread to Liberia five months ago, when a woman from the rural north who had treated a sick relative traveled to Monrovia, where she vomited in a taxi and later died. The driver helped clean her up, coming into contact with the virus. The victim had also come into contact with her husband, her 2-year-old child, a motorcycle rider and others.The next thing we knew, the number of cases, and of deaths, was swelling. They are now in the hundreds. But the government strictly warned journalists not to go near an Ebola case. \u201cI beg you,\u201d the health minister, Walter Gwenigale, warned us at a news conference, \u201cdon\u2019t get contaminated by trying to do investigative reporting by going near people that may be sick. We will give you the information.\u201d But the effect was to quarantine information about the disease, rather than spread information about how people could protect themselves. For an early hint, we journalists had to turn to the United States Embassy\u2019s April 4 advisory to American citizens, warning against contact with blood, body fluids or contaminated items.In May, the rate of infection slackened but then rose again, prompting calls to close the borders with Guinea and Sierra Leone. The authorities refused, saying the economy would suffer. The craziest justification I heard was that the price of pepper would go up. Ignorance ruled. Conspiracy theories sprouted that the government was faking the outbreak to draw foreign aid. Some Liberians, paralyzed by terror of the disease, stayed home rather than go to the hospital. Some kept to the ritual of bathing their dead; pastors laid hands on the sick. This only led to more deaths.Then, on July 25, came news of the death, in Nigeria, of a Liberian-American government consultant who had traveled while showing symptoms of the disease. At last, I saw some seriousness from President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf about enforcing measures to contain the outbreak; she declared that the consultant, Patrick Sawyer, had knowingly put other countries at risk. She declared a national emergency, ordered schools closed and then raised the level of emergency to the equivalent of a state of war.Such measures are welcome, but far too late. The Peace Corps is leaving Liberia. Airlines are cutting back service. We see no end to the outbreak.Meanwhile, we watch the case of the two American aid workers, who have been flown out for intensive treatment. If it works, we can only hope the West will quickly share its methods with us in Africa, where the risk to the world is greatest.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Massachusetts May Shut Down Casinos Before Even One Opens ", "Date": "2014-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBOSTON \u2014 With the casino industry showing signs of retrenchment, voters in Massachusetts may do something that voters nowhere else have done, at least in the last century: slam on the brakes on casino gambling. Massachusetts was one of the last states to climb aboard the casino craze, approving legislation in 2011 to allow three casinos and a slots parlor. Now it may be the first to reverse itself, with voters deciding in November whether to repeal the law before a single casino has been built.The stage is set for a multimillion-dollar campaign pitting the casino industry and its allies in organized labor against a coalition of grass-roots activists, religious leaders and mom-and-pop businesses. The two sides have already squared off in several town-by-town referendums across much of Massachusetts over the last year, fighting each other to a near draw. Now they are laying the groundwork for an all-out, statewide donnybrook that will burst into public view in September in television ads and on doorsteps as both sides try to secure support, house by house.\u201cIf Massachusetts votes to repeal casinos, this could represent a turning of the tide,\u201d said Richard McGowan, who teaches business at Boston College and specializes in casino gambling. \u201cBut even if the casinos win, the fact that they\u2019re even having this vote says to the industry that maybe they should think twice about how many casinos they\u2019re opening.\u201d\u201cNo state has ever repealed expanded gaming legislation since the modern industry of gambling started in 1931 with Nevada,\u201d said Clyde W. Barrow, a political scientist at the University of Texas-Pan American who studies gambling.Why is Massachusetts having second thoughts?When the legislature voted to allow casinos, the state was limping through a nationwide recession. And Massachusetts gamblers continued to plunk their money down in other states.But since then, the economy has improved. Red flags have been raised about the overall health of the casino industry. And the tortuous process of awarding casino licenses here has dragged on for three years, with no tangible benefits.The Massachusetts Gaming Commission has designated only one of the three casinos, MGM Resorts International in Springfield. But it has not formally issued the license because that would force MGM to start paying millions of dollars in obligations, and the company wants to hold off until after the November vote. The commission has awarded the sole slots parlor license to Penn National Gaming in Plainville. Construction has begun there, but if the repeal measure is defeated, the slots parlor is not due to open until next year.\u201cA lot of the negative attitude toward casinos has been driven by the gaming commission\u2019s performance,\u201d Mr. Barrow said. \u201cMassachusetts has already taken longer than any state in history on its licenses.\u201dThe process of awarding a license for the Boston area, the last untapped big market in the Northeast and by far the most lucrative in Massachusetts, has been especially convoluted and is still underway; the gaming commission is to name the winner by Sept. 12. That hard-fought contest is between a $1.6 billion proposal by Wynn Resorts, for a casino on chemically contaminated land in Everett, and a $1.3 billion proposal by Mohegan Sun at the fraying Suffolk Downs thoroughbred racetrack in nearby Revere.The commission chairman, Stephen P. Crosby, was accused of conflicts of interest, and although he said he could be impartial, he eventually recused himself from all decisions involving the Boston-area license.Polls here show that support for casinos, favored late last year by a ratio of two to one, has ebbed. More people still back them than oppose them, but support has dropped to about 50 percent, with 8 percent to 10 percent undecided. Even Gov. Deval Patrick, who helped push through the casino legislation, has said he would vote against a casino near his home.Despite this grim environment, casino advocates here express confidence that they will prevail. They say Atlantic City\u2019s woes are not relevant because New Jersey put 12 casinos in one place; Massachusetts has planned just three, in three separate regions.Their chief argument is that casinos will fuel an economic boon, providing 6,500 construction jobs and 10,000 permanent jobs, virtually all of them unionized, with benefits and an average yearly salary of about $45,000 (more with tips). The casinos have pledged millions of dollars annually to their host and surrounding communities, thanks to the \u201crepatriating\u201d of cash that Massachusetts residents will no longer be dropping in other states.Because MGM is delaying construction of its casino in Springfield until after the November vote, the pro-casino campaign is focusing on the slots parlor in Plainville, where construction is underway and television ads are being shot. Penn National is so confident of the outcome of the vote that it will have spent $100 million there by November.\u201cWe want voters to understand this project is real,\u201d said Jay Snowden, Penn National\u2019s chief operating officer, as he looked out the other day on 200 workers; soon, 1,000 workers will be on the site. \u201cIf Massachusetts votes to repeal the law, these jobs all go away the next day,\u201d he said.The campaign to repeal casinos maintains that the promise of jobs and prosperity is hollow. It says casinos will not bring a net gain of jobs but a net loss, that people will spend their discretionary income at the casinos and sap local businesses, forcing them to lay off workers.\u201cMaybe Massachusetts is unique,\u201d Scott Harshbarger, a former state attorney general, said last month at the start of the anti-casino drive in Springfield. \u201cMaybe in fact we will be the first state in the nation and first city to actually see real economic development come from casinos. But it\u2019s hard to believe.\u201dWhat critics do believe is that casinos will destroy their communities with more crime, traffic and addiction and that Massachusetts should not rely on a predatory industry to improve its economy because it will only fail.Still, Darek Barcikowski, the campaign manager for the repeal group, is optimistic. He said his side had been outspent 100 to 1 on the casino referendum in East Boston in November and still pulled off a surprising victory.\u201cWe prevailed on the doorsteps and on phones and by reaching out to neighbors,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are putting that organization in place again, all across the state.\u201dThe pro-casino side is doing the exact same thing.Advertisement"}

United States refinery production in recent weeks reached record highs and left supply depots flush, cushioning the impact of all the instability surrounding traditional global oil fields.Most of the price of gasoline is determined by the world price of crude, now hovering around $100 a barrel. Turmoil in major producer countries like Iraq and Libya does matter.

Sheffield, chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources, one of the most aggressive producers in the Eagle Ford shale field. \u201cIt would be another shock to the world economy at a time when we don\u2019t need it.\u201dThe United States now accounts for 10 percent of the world\u2019s oil production. As it sharply curtails imports from countries like Angola and Nigeria, those producers are then compelled to sell their oil to China and other Asian markets at steep discounts, compounding the impact of American production on world markets.The change can be seen just down the road from the gas station here, where a pipeline that once brought foreign oil from the gulf port of Corpus Christi to Valero\u2019s Three Rivers refinery has been reversed, sending Texas crude to other refineries along the coast for processing into diesel and other products for export to Europe, Africa and Latin America.\u201cSoftening oil prices was inevitable,\u201d said Sadad Ibrahim al-Husseini, former head of exploration and development at Saudi Aramco, referring to the increase in American output. He added that \u201cgeopolitical turmoil has been a limited factor in recent weeks\u201d largely because shifting conditions in \u201cEgypt, Syria, Iraq and Ukraine have not actually disrupted any major oil export streams.\u201dGlobal oil markets only faintly resemble those of the summer of 2008 when oil prices soared to over $147 a barrel, the all-time nominal record, caused by a combination of unrest in Venezuela and Nigeria, a steady decline in United States production, and soaring consumption in China, India and much of the developing world. The average price of a gallon of regular gasoline in the United States hit $4.11 that July.Prices quickly collapsed after the 2008 financial crisis, but had stabilized by 2011. One reason is that growth in demand for oil, particularly in the United States and Europe, slackened because of the weak economy and increasingly efficient vehicles. North American supplies continued to grow, while Saudi Arabia and Iraq increased production to compensate for the loss of Libyan supplies and Iranian exports pinched by Western sanctions.Last summer, oil and gas prices rose for a time as President Obama considered an attack on Syria and disgruntled Libyan guards blocked major oil ports, but prices quickly retreated. Rising production in Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Canada and especially the United States served as a cushion.Again prices began to rise this year in early June, as Islamic fighters advanced in Iraq and tensions rose in Ukraine. Prices began to retreat again just in time for the Fourth of July weekend.In a recent report, the AAA auto club predicted that prices would continue to slide through the end of the summer unless a major hurricane hits Gulf of Mexico fields and refineries, or there are other unexpected refinery disruptions.Dangers remain abroad, of course. The terrorist offensive in Iraq has not yet touched the country\u2019s most productive southern oil fields and exports so far, although future production is in doubt with Western companies removing personnel for security reasons. Sanctions on Russia for its intervention in Ukraine may impede Western financing and technology for future drilling in the Arctic. And while several Libyan oil ports recently reopened, militia violence is escalating.But that hasn\u2019t stopped Alejandro Alvarado, a restaurant cook in the town of San Diego, Tex., from appreciating the lower prices he is paying at the pump. \u201cWhen you save on a gallon of gas, it helps pay for the cellphone bill,\u201d he said while pumping fuel the other day. \u201cIt helps us buy school clothes and shoes for our four kids.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "$506 Billion Is Forecast for U.S. Deficit, a Slight Rise", "Date": "2014-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The federal government is expected to finish its fiscal year with a relatively modest budget deficit as the gap between revenue and spending continues a sharp decline, the Congressional Budget Office said Wednesday.Both figures are significantly lower than the $680 billion deficit during the previous fiscal year. This would also be the fifth consecutive year the deficit has declined as a share of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product, from 9.8 percent in the 2009 fiscal year to a projected 2.9 percent during the current fiscal year. That is below the average deficit of 3.1 percent of economic output over the last four decades.\u201cThe C.B.O.\u2019s latest budget projections highlight the extent of the improvement in America\u2019s fiscal position in recent years,\u201d wrote Paul Dales, senior United States economist at Capital Economics. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to forget that just two years ago the deficit was expected to be between 5 percent and 6 percent of G.D.P. for the following decade.\u201dAnd the report highlighted the outsize role of the Federal Reserve, which has helped improve the fiscal picture by holding down interest rates and by shipping the profits from its investment holdings to the Treasury Department. Even with smaller annual deficits, however, the budget office said it expected the accumulated federal debt held by the public to reach 74 percent of gross domestic product by the end of this year, the highest ratio of debt to G.D.P. since 1950. A decade from now, in 2024, it projected that the ratio would stand at 77.2 percent.Douglas Elmendorf, director of the budget office, said at a news conference that policy changes remained necessary because the deficit was expected to resume growing faster than the economy in the coming years. The new budget office projections included a lower estimate of economic growth during the current calendar year, and of the economy\u2019s sustainable growth rate in future years. It now expects the economy to expand by just 1.5 percent from the fourth quarter of 2013 to the fourth quarter of 2014, down from a prediction of 3.1 percent in February. But the budget office continued to predict faster growth next year. Like other economic forecasters, it has routinely predicted faster growth next year in every year since the end of the recession, so far without success.Mr. Elmendorf said the budget office was more confident in this forecast. \u201cAt this point, the underlying financial conditions have improved,\u201d he said, \u201cso we think there is a stronger case for the pickup in economic growth than we have written down.\u201d Advertisement"}

Comes from the same place, the songs are really catchy, can really pack the stadiums, though it\u2019s not quite Nirvana.\u201cTed Cruz? He\u2019s Stone Temple Pilots. Tries really hard to sound like Pearl Jam, never gonna sound like Nirvana. Really good voice, great staying power \u2014 but the whole is not greater than the sum of its parts.\u201dI met Kennedy (a gabby 41-year-old whose actual name is Lisa Kennedy Montgomery) in Midtown Manhattan at Fox News headquarters, where she hosts a Fox Business Network program called \u201cThe Independents.\u201d By cable TV standards, the show, which is shown four times a week, is jarringly nonpartisan, for the simple reason that she and her co-hosts \u2014 the Reason magazine editor in chief Matt Welch and the entrepreneur Kmele Foster \u2014 are openly contemptuous of both parties. Kennedy spent most of the Bill Clinton \u201890s as MTV\u2019s most vocal Republican, but then she soured on the G.O.P., a political shift that solidified during the spending and warring and moralizing excesses of the George W. Bush years. Sometime after the elephant tattoo on her left hip \u201cgot infected and started looking more like a pig,\u201d Kennedy began thinking of herself as a libertarian instead. She, Welch and Foster take turns on the show bashing not only \u201cObamacare\u201d but also the N.S.A., neoconservatives and social scolds. It\u2019s not a hospitable forum for G.O.P. talking points. \u201cThere are some libertarian-leaning Republicans who are afraid to be on our show,\u201d Kennedy told me. Libertarianism\u2019s Nirvana, a k a the former congressman and former presidential candidate Ron Paul, has been on \u201cThe Independents\u201d more than once. But Pearl Jam \u2014 a k a Ron Paul\u2019s son Rand, a one-term Republican senator who may well run for the presidency in 2016 \u2014 has yet to appear.A few weeks after our conversation, I saw Kennedy onstage in a hotel ballroom, wearing purple spandex, gyrating to the soundtrack of \u201cFlashdance\u201d and hollering into a microphone, \u201cAre you hungry for more liberty?\u201d She was the M.C. for the Competitive Enterprise Institute\u2019s annual dinner, which, as Welch put it to me, \u201cin the tallest-dwarf category is considered to be one of D.C.'s best annual galas.\u201d The C.E.I. is a 30-year-old organization that routinely sues federal agencies, often when new and onerous regulations are posted in the Federal Register. Tonight\u2019s banquet had advertised itself as having an \u201880s theme, and so several of the 800 attendees arrived dressed as pop icons of that decade. After being introduced by Kennedy, the institute\u2019s president, Lawson Bader, strode to the stage wearing the decidedly pre-1980s Scottish formal attire of black jacket and kilt. Announcing pending lawsuits against the Affordable Care Act and the N.S.A., Bader thundered, to righteous applause, \u201cC.E.I. will continue to push back!\u201dBetween dinner courses, Kennedy informed the audience that there was to be a contest, with a prize awarded to the attendee who had recently flouted the most egregious law or regulation. My tablemates \u2014 among them Welch; a longtime member of the libertarian Cato Institute; a French academic; and a woman dressed as Cyndi Lauper \u2014 each scribbled their infraction on a piece of paper. One had smoked a joint on the sidewalk with a stranger, while another had traveled to Cuba without authorization.At the night\u2019s conclusion, Kennedy announced the winner. It was a woman who, despite her lack of veterinary certification, had illegally massaged a pug.Meanwhile, the age group most responsible for delivering Obama his two terms may well become a political wild card over time, in large part because of its libertarian leanings. Raised on the ad hoc communalism of the Internet, disenchanted by the Iraq War, reflexively tolerant of other lifestyles, appalled by government intrusion into their private affairs and increasingly convinced that the Obama economy is rigged against them, the millennials can no longer be regarded as faithful Democrats \u2014 and a recent poll confirmed that fully half of voters between ages 18 and 29 are unwedded to either party. Obama has profoundly disappointed many of these voters by shying away from marijuana decriminalization, by leading from behind on same-sex marriage, by trumping the Bush administration on illegal-immigrant deportations and by expanding Bush\u2019s N.S.A. surveillance program. As one 30-year-old libertarian senior staff member on the Hill told me: \u201cI think we expected this sort of thing from Bush. But Obama seemed to be hip and in touch with my generation, and then he goes and reads our emails.\u201dEarly polls show young voters favoring Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2016, but their support could erode as they refamiliarize themselves with her, just as it did in 2008. Clinton has been even slower than Obama to embrace progressive social causes, while in foreign policy, she associates herself more with her former Senate colleague John McCain than with noninterventionists. Nor is Clinton likely to quell millennial fears about government surveillance. Welch says: \u201cHillary isn\u2019t going to be any good on these issues. She has an authoritarian mind-set and has no interest in Edward Snowden, who\u2019s a hero to a lot of these people.\u201dAfter eight years out of the White House, Republicans would seem well positioned to cast themselves as the fresh alternative, though perhaps only if the party first reappraises stances that young voters, in particular, regard as outdated. Emily Ekins, a pollster for the Reason Foundation, says: \u201cUnlike with previous generations, we\u2019re seeing a newer dimension emerge where they agree with Democrats on social issues, and on economic issues lean more to the right. It\u2019s possible that Democrats will have to shift to the right on economic issues. But the Republicans will definitely have to move to the left on social issues. They just don\u2019t have the numbers otherwise.\u201d A G.O.P. more flexible on social issues might also appeal to another traditionally Democratic group with a libertarian tilt: the high-tech communities in Silicon Valley and elsewhere, whose mounting disdain for taxes, regulations and unions has become increasingly dissonant with their voting habits.Hence the excitement about Rand Paul. It\u2019s hardly surprising that Paul, in Ekins\u2019s recent survey of millennial voters, came out ahead of all other potential Republican presidential candidates; on issues including same-sex marriage, surveillance and military intervention, his positions more closely mirror those of young voters than those of the G.O.P. establishment. Paul\u2019s famous 13-hour filibuster last year, while ultimately failing to thwart the confirmation of the C.I.A. director John Brennan, lit afire the Twittersphere and compelled Republican leaders, who previously dismissed Paul as a fringe character, to add their own #StandWithRand endorsements. Paul has also gone to considerable lengths to court non-Republican audiences, like Berkeley students and the National Urban League. In a presidential field that could include Cruz, Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Chris Christie and Paul Ryan, Paul \u2014 who has called himself \u201clibertarian-ish\u201d \u2014 is by far the candidate most associated with the movement.It\u2019s nonetheless with some awkwardness that libertarians consider their sudden assimilation into the mainstream. Partisan gunslingers like Glenn Beck have recently called themselves libertarians, to the great annoyance of others in the movement. When I asked Kennedy if some of these new libertarians were former ideologues now rebranding themselves so as to broaden their appeal, she replied crisply, \u201cYes.\u201d But she added that \u201cthe idea of having a really specific litmus test is ridiculous. It\u2019s just another form of groupthink.\u201d Still, even Rand Paul prompts notable skepticism among the die-hards. \u201cWhen he talks about \u2018Let\u2019s stop nation-building and let\u2019s start building bridges in Detroit,\u2019 a lot of libertarians roll their eyes,\u201d Welch told me. \u201cBut he\u2019s done more to advance and popularize libertarian ideas in Washington than anyone else. In terms of changing the national debate, I think Rand has gone farther than his father.\u201dDuring the father\u2019s two runs for president as a Republican, in 2008 and 2012, libertarian activists gave him momentum far beyond his popular appeal, packing caucus halls and organizing rallies. But it\u2019s an open question whether these same activists will get off the sidelines and support his son, whose libertarian bona fides are less sure but whose chance of victory is far greater. And if they do, it\u2019s unclear whether G.O.P. establishment figures can put aside their longtime distrust of libertarianism and welcome Paul\u2019s bid to expand the party\u2019s base. If this is indeed the libertarian moment, do either libertarians or Republicans intend to seize it?His embrace of libertarianism coincided with a rejection of party ideology and collectivist thinking. As a graduate student during the 1980s and early 1990s at Temple and the State University of New York at Buffalo, Gillespie encountered the politically correct tunnel vision of what he calls \u201cthe professoriate,\u201d which turned him away from liberalism for good. At the same time, Gillespie was unimpressed by Ronald Reagan, who declared a new \u201cwar on drugs,\u201d raised the national drinking age to 21, raised all sorts of taxes, preserved Social Security which Gillespie regards as federally mandated generational theft) and in general claimed to champion American individualism while squashing it every chance he got.\u201cI was never conservative,\u201d he told me as we sipped our gin. \u201cRepublicans always saw libertarians as nice to have around in case they wanted to score some weed, and we always knew where there was a party. And for a while it made sense to bunk up with them. But after a while, it would be like, \u2018So if we agree on limited government, how about opening the borders?\u2019 No, that\u2019s crazy. \u2018How about legalizing drugs? How about giving gays equal rights?\u2019 No, come on, be serious. And so I thought, There\u2019s nothing in this for me.\u201dGillespie likes to point out that unlike the words \u201cDemocrat\u201d and \u201cRepublican,\u201d \u201clibertarian\u201d should be seen as a modifier rather than a noun \u2014 an attitude, not a fixed object. A cynic might assert that this is exactly the kind of semantic cop-out that relegates Gillespie\u2019s too-cool-for-school sect to the margins. Not surprisingly, he begged to differ. \u201cIt\u2019s wedded to an epistemological humility,\u201d he told me, \u201cthat proceeds from the assumption that we don\u2019t know as much as we think we do, and so you have to be really cautious about policies that seek to completely reshape the world. It\u2019s better to run trials and experiments, as John Stuart Mill talked about. The whole point of America \u2014 and this is an admixture of Saul Bellow and Heidegger and Jim Morrison lyrics \u2014 is that it\u2019s in a constant state of becoming, constantly changing and mongrelizing. We\u2019re doing exactly what free minds and free markets allow you to do. Part of why I\u2019m a libertarian is that if you restrict people less, interesting stuff happens.\u201dContinuing his riff with beatnik locomotion, he added: \u201cIt\u2019s like what happens in garages. Rock bands form in garages. Computer companies. And O.K., occasionally serial murders. But as long as you\u2019re not just parking your car there, garages are always interesting.\u201dBeyond avoiding adventurism overseas, defining the libertarian agenda gets even trickier. Virtually all libertarians enthusiastically favor marijuana legalization, but they become more subdued when the subject turns to cocaine and heroin. They are united against most benefit programs but divided on whether to champion the outright abolition of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. On immigration policy, the purist stance would call for completely open borders, which Gillespie and a few others in the movement advocate, though not quite literally, and so down the slippery slope the ideal skids, into a murky world of armed deportation agents and registration systems and random drug testing. (Libertarian-leaning elected officials often say that there can be no open borders as long as the welfare state exists for immigrants to drain. Gillespie is among those who consider this a dodge.)The so-called cultural issues have traditionally been a safe haven of libertarian concurrence and, as well, a showcase for the movement to demonstrate how it would apply laissez-faire principles to personal freedoms. One of the more pugnacious advocates of this across-the-board approach is Cathy Reisenwitz, a 28-year-old Washington-based journalist who has a tattoo under her right biceps that reads, \u201cI Own Me.\u201d (\u201cWhat does that mean, \u2018I own myself?\u2019 \u201d David Frum, a former speechwriter for George W. Bush and Republican commentator, sputtered in exasperation when we spoke later. \u201cCan I sell myself? If I can\u2019t, I don\u2019t own myself.\u201d) Reisenwitz, a former staff member at Reason, writes a blog called Sex and the State that, she told me, \u201cthoroughly disassociates culture wars from free markets \u2014 I disavow them 100 percent.\u201d When I asked her where she stood on abortion, Reisenwitz replied, \u201cI do not support any legislative restrictions on health care.\u201d She also espoused purity on same-sex marriage, telling me, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to say, \u2018Government should be out of marriage,\u2019 and you\u2019re creating petitions and submitting bills, awesome. But in the meantime, if government is going to be involved in marriage as an institution, it should be available for everyone.\u201dBut libertarian consistency on even these social issues is in the eye of the beholder. In 1968 Ayn Rand flatly declared: \u201cAn embryo has no rights. . . . Abortion is a moral right.\u201d Twenty years later, however, the Libertarian Party proffered as its presidential candidate Ron Paul, an OB-GYN who has argued that the movement\u2019s bedrock nonaggression principle should apply above all to the most defenseless, the unborn. Today one of the more fluent anti-abortion journalists is also a self-identified libertarian: Mollie Z. Hemingway, senior editor at The Federalist, differs significantly from Reisenwitz on the subject of marriage, on the basis of what Hemingway maintains are libertarian grounds.Even acceptance of same-sex marriage, an ostensibly pro-freedom position that has become nearly nonnegotiable for younger voters, is a stance that some self-described libertarians will not sign onto. When I asked Hemingway what she thought of extending rights to gay couples, she replied carefully: \u201cWell, I have always thought that government should be so small that it doesn\u2019t have a role in giving benefits. It\u2019s interesting to me that libertarians see government redefining the institution as something that will maximize liberty. And I am very skeptical about that.\u201d She added that while \u201cpeople should be free to organize their own lifestyle,\u201d the state had a unique interest in protecting heterosexual marriage, because it was \u201cthe relationship that\u2019s ordered to producing children.\u201dThis was a familiar point \u2014 but for social conservatives like Rick Santorum, not for libertarians. When I pressed her on it, Hemingway said: \u201cDo I think the state should change the definition of marriage to allow same-sex couples? I think people should be free to organize their own lives however they wish. I\u2019m skeptical about the way we\u2019re accomplishing this. I don\u2019t know. I feel like I need to think about it more.\u201dWhy has the libertarian takeover not come to pass? With charming understatement, the authors of the 1971 magazine article pointed out a small complication to this otherwise-unstoppable tidal wave they predicted. \u201cAt present,\u201d they wrote, \u201cthe only areas of disagreement within the libertarian movement are whether the movement should strive for anarchy or for limited government, and whether it should work through revolution or within the system.\u201d That tension has not gone away. During my travels with libertarians, I met many who cheerfully identified themselves to me as \u201canarcho-capitalists,\u201d and I sat in on one speech \u2014 by Bill Buppert, a blogger and the author of a book called \u201cZeroGov\u201d \u2014 that featured applause lines like \u201cany tax rate above zero percent is immoral\u201d and \u201cthere are no good cops out there.\u201d I also encountered Beltway libertarians who revolt at the ballot box, like Gene Healy, a Cato Institute vice president, who told me, \u201cUsually I just vote for whoever the Libertarian Party throws up, even if it\u2019s a guy living in his car.\u201dEven if libertarians willingly engage the political process, there\u2019s little to guarantee that the process will engage them back. Each party would be only too happy to receive the libertarian vote as long as it doesn\u2019t have to do much of anything to earn it. But not since the days of the Vietnam War and Nixon\u2019s imperial presidency have libertarians seen much profit in an alliance with the big-government Democrats. Instead, ever since a newly inaugurated President Reagan declared, \u201cGovernment is the problem,\u201d politically practical libertarians have been more apt to cast their lot with the G.O.P.And yet, the relationship between the libertarian movement and the Republican Party is a fraught one, to say the least. The G.O.P.'s traditional \u201cthree-legged stool\u201d is propped up by not only libertarian advocates of free markets but also by hawks, who believe in a well-financed and forward-leaning military, and by social conservatives, who believe that the government should play a role in preserving family values. Neither of the other legs feels supported by libertarians, and with cause. It\u2019s hard to know whether Republicans in one or both of these other camps can ever make peace with a movement that they have spent a generation deriding. In a 1997 Weekly Standard article titled \u201cThe Libertarian Temptation,\u201d David Frum belittled its followers as feckless hedonists who \u201cclaim that snorting cocaine is some sort of fundamental human right.\u201d When I recently asked Frum if his feelings toward libertarianism had mellowed, he assured me that they had not.\u201cIt\u2019s a completely closed and airless ideological system that doesn\u2019t respond well to reality,\u201d he said. \u201cLibertarians are like Marxists in that they have prophets like von Mises and Hayek, and they quote from their holy scripture, and they don\u2019t have to engage.\u201dIn practice, whenever a Republican politician has behaved more like a libertarian than a party loyalist, the party has made him pay for it. Despite the fact that Ron Paul served nearly two decades in the House and established seniority on the Financial Services Committee, in late 2010 the incoming speaker, John Boehner, reportedly sought to deny Paul a subcommittee chairmanship (owing to Paul\u2019s views on monetary policy) before eventually buckling to the outcries of Paul supporters. On the House floor, Paul typically sat with a fellow outcast, the antiwar Republican Walter Jones. During the G.O.P. presidential primaries of 2008 and 2012, the other candidates treated him with amused derision.Since Paul vacated the Capitol, the libertarian movement\u2019s latest Republican congressional hero has been Justin Amash, a 34-year-old Arab-American and two-term House member from Grand Rapids, Mich., whose office wall sports adjoining posters of Ayn Rand and Mickey Mouse. Amash is the founder of the House Liberty Caucus, consisting of about 30 libertarian-inclined Republicans (and occasional Democratic visitors like Jared Polis). The caucus serves as a de facto competitor to the House\u2019s conservative think tank, the Republican Study Committee, which Amash considers suspect in part because of its support for big military budgets. Even by the standards of his 2010 Tea Party class, G.O.P. leaders have viewed Amash as the antithesis of a team player for voting against Republican budgets that in his view did not cut deeply enough and for siding with liberal Democrats to end the war in Afghanistan. Last year Amash horrified military hawks and the intelligence community by introducing an amendment to defund the N.S.A.'s domestic phone-surveillance program, which came within a dozen votes of passage. Having already stripped the video-game-obsessed congressman of his seat on the Budget Committee, senior Republicans have now invested heavily in Amash\u2019s primary opponent in hopes of vaporizing his presence in Congress altogether.One afternoon in late May, I had lunch in Chinatown with Amash, just a couple of hours after House Republican leaders gutted another of his anti-N.S.A. bills. He nonetheless wore a defiant smile. The public was on his side, Amash said, and not just Republicans \u2014 and for precisely this reason, he added, G.O.P. leaders \u201cview us as a threat to the established order.\u201dStill, the anti-abortion and border-security-advocating Amash is hardly a radical libertarian. For the most part, his views are inseparable from those of Rand Paul. And so I asked him, \u201cGiven how leaders in your party have reacted to your legislative proposals, how do you think they\u2019re going to react if Paul runs for president?\u201d\u201cI believe very strongly that he could be the nominee,\u201d Amash said. \u201cHe just needs to get his message out there and push back against the caricature that some of the political establishment will make of Senator Paul. They\u2019re doing it because they\u2019re afraid of him.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dBecause, Amash said, Paul shared his ability to appeal to all kinds of people, not just big donors and not just entrenched Republicans. \u201cHe destroys their system,\u201d he said with a thin smile.It was not the kind of message that a Republican presidential aspirant typically delivers to an all-white audience. But as he continued with his off-the-cuff remarks, I began to see what the Kentucky senator was up to. After observing, \u201cWe\u2019re a pro-coal state, and I\u2019m a pro-coal senator,\u201d Paul then told the attendees, \u201cbut I\u2019m not for no regulations on coal,\u201d even going so far as to suggest that today\u2019s environment was better than a century ago \u201cand some of that\u2019s through government regulation.\u201d He assured the audience that he was all for affordable health care, just not the Affordable Care Act \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s really about freedom versus coercion.\u201d And as his bedrock economic principle, Paul said, \u201cWe can grow as a country, but government needs to be minimized and the private market needs to be maximized.\u201d But he was careful to say, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean no government.\u201dDespite Amash\u2019s claim that Paul \u201cdestroys their system,\u201d nothing about his rhetoric sounded remotely worrisome to the Republican establishment. At the same time, the political artfulness of his oratory was hard to miss. Rand Paul was road-testing a kinder, gentler libertarianism to a mass market \u2014 in effect triangulating (to use the term associated with Bill Clinton, whose moral lapses Paul frequently cites) Republicans, Democrats and libertarians. It is a maneuver that, if successful, could amount to a considerable triumph for the movement. By calling for significantly reduced sentences for drug offenders, Paul has slyly redefined the terms of the marijuana debate with a libertarian tilt. Though a self-proclaimed \u201ctraditionalist\u201d on marriage, his seeming contentment with judicial trends on the subject is far more in keeping with Democrats than with others in the G.O.P. presidential field. And if Paul\u2019s foreign-policy addresses have more in common with the realism espoused by Robert Gates, a former defense secretary, than with his father\u2019s laissez-faire approach to the outside world, his worldview nonetheless marks a clear break from the hawkishness that still predominates within the Republican Party.The hawks have taken notice. Dick Cheney dusted off the word \u201cisolationism\u201d \u2014 which, in foreign-policy-speak, is essentially a synonym for \u201cwild-eyed extremism\u201d \u2014 in describing Paul\u2019s aversion to a renewed military presence in Iraq. Rick Perry made a similar charge in a Washington Post op-ed titled, \u201cWhy Rand Paul Is Wrong on Iraq.\u201d Senator John McCain has been particularly caustic, saying that a Rand Paul foreign policy would constitute a dangerous retreat into a \u201cfortress America\u201d and dismissing Paul\u2019s drone filibuster as a stunt intended to \u201cfire up impressionable libertarian kids in college dorms.\u201d Paul, in turn, has enthusiastically ripped into each denouncer.\u201cI think that Senator Paul has been very clever in trying to couch his foreign policy in terms that would appeal to most Republicans,\u201d said the conservative writer Ramesh Ponnuru, who, like David Frum, has qualms about the libertarian movement. \u201cBut at the end of the day, he\u2019s a hard-core anti-interventionist, and Republican voters aren\u2019t.\u201d Ponnuru\u2019s latter assertion will be tested in the 2016 primaries, which could include, in descending order of hawkishness, Rubio, Perry, Cruz and then Paul (with foreign-policy stances by Christie, Bush and others yet to be articulated).Over the past year, Paul has drawn a great deal of attention as the only likely Republican presidential candidate to venture into the hostile territory of college campuses and Latino and African-American groups. (Following the Rotary Club talk in Shelbyville, I watched Paul dedicate a plaque to the memory of an African-American doctor and civil rights activist. An 89-year-old black woman named Frances Marshall looked on with pronounced skepticism, telling me, \u201cActions speak louder than words.\u201d)Less noticed is how Paul has taken pains to mollify the Republican base. He reminds audiences like the one in Shelbyville that he is \u201cpro-life.\u201d His assaults on the Affordable Care Act are frequent. Faced with criticisms that he is anti-Israel, Paul three months ago introduced a bill he called the Stand With Israel Act, in which the Palestinian government would not receive any further foreign aid unless it recognized Israel as a state. (\u201cIt was complete pandering,\u201d the libertarian Hill staff member told me.) Still, the vitriol aimed at Paul by McCain, Cheney and others in his party defies Reagan\u2019s 11th Commandment \u2014 \u201cThou shalt not speak ill of thy fellow Republican\u201d \u2014 and harks back to the enduring animus between hawks and libertarians.I asked Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, what he made of this rift. \u201cI think most people share my view about Rand as being pure-hearted in his views and intentions,\u201d he replied diplomatically. \u201cI just think he has some different opinions that not everyone shares. There\u2019s going to be disagreements within our party. Look at how the Democrats are lambasting the president over his pathetic approach to the border. Look, if Rand Paul was such an outsider, I wouldn\u2019t have him speaking at three of our national events. I see Rand Paul as someone who will build a lot of bridges in our party. Last year, he and I did a listening session with libertarians in New Hampshire. Libertarianism is certainly growing in the country, and I think it\u2019s an opportunity for the Republican Party to grow as well. And I see our party as being very welcoming to the libertarian movement and to Rand Paul. That doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t have disputes.\u201d\u201cI think a plurality of Americans don\u2019t consider themselves to be either Republicans or Democrats,\u201d Paul said, citing young people and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs in particular. \u201cI also think there was a time, maybe 30 years ago, when \u2018libertarian\u2019 was a term that scared people. Now I think it seems more like a moderate point of view. So I think the term is something that is definitely attracting, not repelling people.\u201dPaul qualified that observation by noting that the word itself encompassed a spectrum of positions. \u201cWhat I try to point out when people say, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re an isolationist,\u2019 I say, \u2018No, there\u2019s two poles: One is that we\u2019re nowhere any of the time, the other is we\u2019re everywhere all the time.\u2019 Right now we\u2019re much closer to the latter extreme pole \u2014 and that\u2019s also coming from my party, the neoconservatives. So, really, libertarianism might be more like foreign-policy realism. There may be some libertarians who say, \u2018By golly, we\u2019re not going anywhere unless they attack us.\u2019 I think I consider myself to be more moderate on the foreign-policy spectrum.\u201d\u201cDo you think some political forces in Washington, like big defense contractors, hear your views on the defense budget and regard you as an existential threat?\u201d I asked.\u201cI don\u2019t think you should ever make a decision on what weapons systems we use based on the bottom line of those who make the weapons systems,\u201d he said. \u201cThat makes some people fearful.\u201d Grinning, he added, \u201cBut it should make other people feel hopeful.\u201dDuring our conversation, Paul made a point of characterizing libertarianism as being \u201cmoderate\u201d rather than liberal on social issues. Movement leaders would likely object, but Paul\u2019s preoccupation is with swaying the center-right.\u201cThe party can\u2019t become the opposite of what it is,\u201d he told me. \u201cIf you tell people from Alabama, Mississippi or Georgia, \u2018You know what, guys, we\u2019ve been wrong, and we\u2019re gonna be the pro-gay-marriage party,\u2019 they\u2019re either gonna stay home or \u2014 I mean, many of these people joined the Republican Party because of these social issues. So I don\u2019t think we can completely flip. But can we become, to use the overused term, a bigger tent? I think we can and can agree to disagree on a lot of these issues. I think the party will evolve. It\u2019ll either continue to lose, or it\u2019ll become a bigger place where there\u2019s a mixture of opinions.\u201dIn effect, Paul was saying that the way for Republicans to win was to become more libertarian \u2014 though only up to a point. Purity was the movement\u2019s game, not his. Paul reminded me that he worked on his father\u2019s 1988 Libertarian Party presidential campaign and felt a great deal of sympathy for anyone trying to take on the major parties. \u201cI also gathered signatures to get him on the ballot,\u201d he said. \u201cI know what a thankless job that is. Anybody who stands in a parking lot is thought to be an extremist.\u201dBut later, with an irritated edge to his voice, Paul added: \u201cSome people are purists, and I get grief all the time \u2014 all these libertarian websites hating on me because I\u2019m not as pure as my dad. And I\u2019m putting restrictions on foreign aid instead of eliminating foreign aid altogether. And I\u2019m like: \u2018Look, guys, I\u2019m having trouble putting these restrictions on, much less eliminating them! So give me a break!\u2019 \u201dWith deadpan aplomb, Gillespie then said, \u201cIf we can have 20 different types of Pop-Tarts, maybe we can have more than two types of political identification.\u201dAfter the speech was over and Gillespie gamely posed for a few pictures with admirers, I cornered him and asked him if he was suggesting that libertarians leave the G.O.P.-flavored Pop-Tarts on the shelf. Gillespie said it all depended on Republicans. \u201cThis is the fundamental question for the Republican Party,\u201d he said. \u201cAre they going to embrace the libertarian elements of Rand Paul and Justin Amash? Because that\u2019s their only way out. They\u2019re at 25 percent self-identification, and it\u2019s not going to climb back up if they keep re-electing the old horses. Libertarians don\u2019t need them. We\u2019re already alienated and out of the mainstream. We don\u2019t need the Republican Party in the way that they need the energy and the vision of libertarians.\u201dBut, I wanted to know, would libertarians be willing to meet the G.O.P. somewhere in the middle? Among the 1,700 or so attendees, I had seen guns and Bitcoins and slogans like \u201cLiberty: Too Big to Fail\u201d and \u201cI Do Not Consent to Searches.\u201d What I had not seen or heard was any show of support for Rand Paul. The crowd here at PorcFest, many of them young, all of them passionate, represented just the sort of army that Paul would need in the early primary states and beyond \u2014 the same sort of army, in fact, that powered his father\u2019s improbable showing in previous elections. But they still talked more about the father than the son.Gillespie acknowledged that the answer remained unclear. \u201cI think that if a major-party candidate articulates 75 percent of the catechism,\u201d he said, \u201cboth self-identified libertarians and people who don\u2019t realize they\u2019re libertarians would vote for him.\u201d But then again, he said, it might take \u201ca hundred years or something\u201d for his movement to find its true expression in a political party. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone from a movement that didn\u2019t exist, then we all believe in this roughly similar thing, then we have a dalliance with the G.O.P., then we realize, no, we\u2019re totally separate. And then we find out, no, we really need to activate politically in a conventional two-party system,\u201d he said, his tone betraying little concern for the pace of this process. \u201cAnd it may be we\u2019re still some years away from that. I don\u2019t know.\u201dOur libertarian moment, in other words, might very well pass unexploited. But it remained, for Gillespie and his fellow travelers, a moment to savor: Pop-Tarts washed down with Green Hat gin. Interesting stuff was happening in the garage called America, and you could try to change the system, or you could also elect to be boring. Either way, you were at perfect liberty.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Future of Export-Import Bank Is Wild Card in Key Senate Races", "Date": "2014-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In North Carolina, Senator Kay Hagan, a Democrat, is siding with big business in her support of the Export-Import Bank of the United States and attacking Thom Tillis, her Republican challenger who opposes the bank but is endorsed by big business.Joni Ernst, the Republican Senate candidate in Iowa, propelled to a primary victory by strong Tea Party backing, is breaking with conservative activists who have made opposition to the bank a test of ideological commitment. She says the federal lender helps manufacturers and creates jobs in her state.In Louisiana, a third state crucial to determining control of the Senate in the midterm elections, Representative Bill Cassidy, the leading Republican candidate, is caught between Senator Mary Landrieu, the Democratic incumbent who supports the bank and has faulted Mr. Cassidy for waffling on it, and a conservative opponent strongly opposed to the bank.In an election cycle where no single issue is animating voters, the relatively obscure lender, which provides loans and loan guarantees to foreign buyers of American products, has become an unlikely source of prominent campaign friction.The fight over whether to reauthorize the bank, which Congress must do by the end of September to sustain its operations, has roiled Capitol Hill in unexpected ways, creating a divide between the Tea Party movement and establishment Republicans. It also is providing an avenue for Democrats to showcase their support for American companies and to try to drive a wedge between business interests and Republican candidates.\u201cOur candidates have been leaning heavily into this, and this really goes to the heart of making the economy work,\u201d said Matt Canter, deputy executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.Republicans who are pushing back say the agency is an example of corporate welfare and \u201ccrony capitalism,\u201d a view held by conservative organizations like the Heritage Foundation, putting these groups at odds with business lobbies like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\u201cThe Export-Import Bank is set up to play political favorites and give huge taxpayer handouts to big, billion-dollar corporations, a glaring example of what\u2019s wrong with Washington,\u201d said Daniel Keylin, a spokesman for Mr. Tillis, the speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives. He said Mr. Tillis would not support the bank unless major changes were made on behalf of small business.The political glare on the agency, established during the Depression, is a relatively new development considering that it was renewed in 2012 by wide bipartisan margins in both the House and Senate. But in recent months it has become a new cause of the right, imperiling its chances for staying in business after Sept. 30, as conservatives inside and outside Congress push for its elimination.But the Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, which both see the bank as a crucial asset for American businesses like Boeing, General Electric and Caterpillar, have mounted a lobbying campaign this month to persuade lawmakers to rescue the bank.President Obama joined in the push in his radio address on Saturday, urging business owners to press members of Congress who are home on recess to reauthorize the bank.\u201cIf Congress fails to act, thousands of businesses, large and small, that sell their products abroad will take a completely unnecessary hit,\u201d said the president, noting that the bank charter had been renewed 16 previous times with little dispute.\u201cThis has become a very controversial issue,\u201d said Jack Howard, senior vice president for congressional and public affairs at the chamber, who added that he was encouraged by the results so far of the advocacy campaign.The fight has also highlighted a balancing act for the chamber, which in some cases finds itself working on behalf of candidates like Mr. Tillis who differ with the organization on the bank, while the Democratic opponent \u2014 Ms. Hagan in this case \u2014 is a strong advocate.In another race, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader whose re-election bid has been a priority of the chamber, told Politico recently that he would not vote to reauthorize the bank.Chamber officials say there is no disconnect.\u201cWe are not a single-issue organization,\u201d said Blair Latoff Holmes, a chamber spokeswoman, noting that the organization considers a broad array of issues and a candidate\u2019s voting history in making endorsements. \u201cOver all, if you look at the Democrats\u2019 position on issues such as tax rates, regulations, energy and the E.P.A., unions, free speech and trial lawyers, you can see why the chamber supports the members that we do.\u201dThe chamber picked up backing for the bank from one candidate it supported in a tough primary earlier this year when Ms. Ernst came out in support of reauthorization, despite the decision drawing fire from many of her fellow conservatives. Democrats characterized her position as part of an effort to move toward the center following her primary win, but Ms. Ernst told CNBC in an interview that the bank was important to Iowa businesses.\u201cAs long as other countries offer that opportunity to their exporters, I think that is something we need to offer to our industry also,\u201d she said in the television interview.In Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu, emphasizing her record of aiding the oil and gas industry and other state business interests in her difficult re-election fight, has sought to put pressure on Mr. Cassidy, a Republican House member, to take a stand on the bank\u2019s future.Rob Maness, a retired Air Force colonel and a Tea Party favorite running as a conservative alternative to Mr. Cassidy, is opposed to the bank. Mr. Cassidy has not said explicitly that he would vote against the bank. But in a recent statement he pointed out that the Congressional Budget Office found the agency would cost taxpayers $200 million annually if private sector accounting methods were used and that it mainly aids profitable, large corporations.\u201cAll of this calls into question whether the Export-Import Bank is worth the cost to taxpayers,\u201d Mr. Cassidy said. \u201cVery serious reforms are required before considering reauthorization.\u201dThe fate of the bank, which says it makes a profit and supported more than 200,000 jobs with $37.4 billion in transactions last year, will be one of the central issues in Congress in September.While Mr. McConnell is opposed, House Speaker John A. Boehner is sympathetic to the push for the bank. Its supporters are hopeful they can win a temporary reprieve for the agency as part of a short-term term agreement to keep the government funded after Oct. 1, and then push for a longer-term solution after the election.Given the difficulty such funding measures have faced in the recent past and some of the conservative muscle lined up against the bank, supporters know they have their work cut out for them.\u201cIt is going to be a heavy lift,\u201d said Mr. Howard, the chamber vice president.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Muddled Road to Overhauling Corporate Taxes", "Date": "2014-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEvery loophole has its lover.That\u2019s why, despite the furor that has erupted over American companies adopting foreign headquarters to reduce their taxes, it is proving so difficult to fix a corporate tax system that most everyone agrees is badly broken.Businesses complain that the high federal tax rate of 35 percent on corporations is what propels them to exploit every opportunity to shave their tax bill. And Washington is listening: Lowering that nominal rate in exchange for pruning the crop of special-interest deductions is a principle embraced by President Obama and Paul D. Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican who is chairman of the House Budget Committee.Manufacturers cherish faster write-offs for equipment purchases; retailers cling to the deduction for advertising. And oil and gas companies insist the industry\u2019s health depends on the deduction for drilling expenses.To Senator Levin, Washington\u2019s first priority should be what he labels \u201cunjustified corporate tax loopholes,\u201d deductions that he says do absolutely nothing to encourage economic productivity, but exist solely to reduce taxes.Whether you agree that the government should subsidize gas exploration or encourage companies to invest in new machinery, Mr. Levin said, supporters can at least make a case that these deductions help the economy. Inversions, the label applied to the foreign takeovers that have captured the public\u2019s attention partly because many Americans perceive them as unpatriotic, are mere tax dodges, he said.With Capitol Hill stalemated, that flash of support has encouraged the Obama administration, with a push from congressional Democrats, to pursue a way to curb inversions without legislation. But even on this issue, John A. Boehner, the speaker of the House who has won Republican support to sue the president for supposedly circumventing Congress, warned the White House to work with lawmakers on ending the exodus of taxpaying corporations.Inversions are just one of the loopholes that critics consider particularly egregious examples of gaming the system.At the top of the list is the rule that allows American multinationals to avoid paying taxes on profits until they are brought back to the United States. Microsoft, Google and Abbott Labs, for example, have managed to escape taxes on billions of dollars in foreign profits that are nonetheless invested in United States Treasury bonds and other government securities. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the exemption on profits that are supposedly vacationing abroad costs the federal government $50 billion a year, about 1.7 percent of total revenue.Another target involves the tax on executive stock options. Facebook is the classic example. Its co-founder, Mark Zuckerberg, had options to buy stock at 6 cents a share, which he cashed in when each share was worth $40. The options earned Mr. Zuckerberg about $5 billion, but he wasn\u2019t the only one to benefit. Even though Facebook did not actually pay out that $5 billion, the company was nonetheless able to deduct Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s windfall as a business expense. According to the Senate\u2019s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, this kink in the tax law permitted Facebook to take an estimated $16 billion tax deduction when the company went public and avoid paying any taxes for several years.In the end, the fight over taxes is mostly about money. What proportion of the nation\u2019s tax bill should corporations pay? When the corporate tax was first passed in 1909, it amounted to 1 percent of a corporation\u2019s income. Over the years, corporate taxes accounted for an increasing share of the cash dropped into the government\u2019s piggy bank.In the 1950s, corporations paid for about a quarter of total federal spending, but it has generally dropped since, accounting for about a fifth in the 1960s and about 13 percent in the \u201870s. That proportion has seesawed since then and now covers about 7 percent of the country\u2019s bills.Those who believe corporations pay too much worry that the tax burden is putting American companies at a disadvantage in the world economy. \u201cWe\u2019ve been down this road before, and we know companies will continue to do this as long as our tax rates remain the highest in the world,\u201d Representative David Camp, a Republican from Michigan and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said in a statement. Mr. Camp, who is retiring from Congress this year, spent three years drafting a sweeping tax overhaul that was vilified by members of both parties as soon as it was released in February.Those in the too-little camp maintain that many corporations already pay far less than their fair share. They point out there is little historical evidence that high rates have led to job loss or a sluggish economy. \u201cThe idea that lowering the corporate tax rate will lead to more investment is fundamentally wrong,\u201d said Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel-prize winning economist who has carved out a strong position as a liberal critic of Democratic and Republican government actions.This deep split means that even if lawmakers can agree on which deductions should be eliminated, they will still be divided on the question of who should benefit.Elaine C. Kamarck, the co-chairwoman of a bipartisan coalition of businesses and organizations that support a tax overhaul, says the only way a tax bill will pass is to use any savings derived from closing corporate loopholes solely to lower the overall corporate tax rate. The companies that have joined the coalition, which include Boeing, AT&T, Verizon, Walmart and Walt Disney, have agreed to put every loophole on the table, she said, because they believe \u201ca low enough basic tax rate is worth giving up exemptions.\u201dMany Democrats and advocates of a more progressive tax system recoil at the insistence any package be revenue-neutral. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous to say \u2018We can\u2019t close this loophole unless we give all this money back,\u2019\u201d said Robert S. McIntyre, director of Citizens for Tax Justice, who compared it to catching a robber leaving the bank but letting him keep the money. \u201cEverybody says we have the highest corporate tax in the world, but many corporations pay hardly anything.\u201dLobbyists for various interest groups have become experts at tax jujitsu, using the push for a full-scale overhaul by supporters against them. The view that nothing should be fixed until everything can be fixed has repeatedly derailed efforts to eliminate even the most deplored loopholes. That wait-for-reform argument has also greeted recent bills to prevent companies from moving their headquarters abroad for a tax break.That is precisely why Mr. Levin said he and his co-sponsors decided to simply call for a two-year moratorium on inversions. But even that will be a battle.\u201cThe whole issue is do we wait for tax reform,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich I think is an excuse for inaction.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Is Seen as Frustrating His Own Party", "Date": "2014-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The meeting in the Oval Office in late June was called to give President Obama and the four top members of Congress a chance to discuss the unraveling situation in Iraq.But Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, wanted to press another point.With Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, sitting a few feet away, Mr. Reid complained that Senate Republicans were spitefully blocking the confirmation of dozens of Mr. Obama\u2019s nominees to serve as ambassadors. He expected that the president would back him up and urge Mr. McConnell to relent.Mr. Obama quickly dismissed the matter.\u201cYou and Mitch work it out,\u201d Mr. Obama said coolly, cutting off any discussion.Mr. Reid seethed quietly for the rest of the meeting, according to four separate accounts provided by people who spoke with him about it. After his return to the Capitol that afternoon, Mr. Reid told other senators and his staff members that he was astonished by how disengaged the president seemed. After all, these were Mr. Obama\u2019s own ambassadors who were being blocked by Mr. McConnell, and Secretary of State John Kerry had been arguing for months that getting them installed was an urgent necessity for the administration.But the impression the president left with Mr. Reid was clear: Capitol Hill is not my problem. To Democrats in Congress who have worked with Mr. Obama, the indifference conveyed to Mr. Reid, one of the president\u2019s most indispensable supporters, was frustratingly familiar. In one sense, Mr. Obama\u2019s response was a reminder of what made him such an appealing figure in the first place: his almost innate aversion to the partisan squabbles that have left Americans so jaded and disgruntled with their political system. But nearly six years into his term, with his popularity at the lowest of his presidency, Mr. Obama appears remarkably distant from his own party on Capitol Hill, with his long neglect of would-be allies catching up to him.In interviews, nearly two dozen Democratic lawmakers and senior congressional aides suggested that Mr. Obama\u2019s approach has left him with few loyalists to effectively manage the issues erupting abroad and at home and could imperil his efforts to leave a legacy in his final stretch in office.Grumbling by lawmakers about a president is nothing unusual. But what is striking now is the way prominent Democrats\u2019 views of Mr. Obama\u2019s shortcomings are spilling out into public, and how resigned many seem that the relationship will never improve. In private meetings, Mr. Reid\u2019s chief of staff, David Krone, has voiced regular dismay to lawmakers and top aides about White House operations and competency across a range of issues, according to several Democrats on Capitol Hill.\u201cMaybe if something isn\u2019t working, you\u2019d say, \u2018What can I do better?\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, expressing dismay that the president seemed to have little interest in taking a warmer approach with Democrats. \u201cMaybe we wanted something different. But it kind of is what it is.\u201dAsked to characterize his relationship with the president, Mr. Manchin, a centrist Democrat who has often been a bridge builder in the Senate, said: \u201cIt\u2019s fairly nonexistent. There\u2019s not much of a relationship.\u201dFew senators feel a personal connection to the president. \u201cIn order to work with people, you need to establish the relationship first before you ask for something,\u201d said Senator Angus King of Maine, an independent member of the Democratic caucus. \u201cAnd I think one of the things the White House has not done well and the president has not done well is the simple idea of establishing relationships before there is a crisis.\u201dSenator Claire McCaskill, the Missouri Democrat who was an early supporter of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidential bid, said that if her fellow Democrats were hoping for Mr. Obama to transform into a Lyndon B. Johnson late in his second term, they should quit waiting.\u201cFor him, eating his spinach is schmoozing with elected officials,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not something that he loves. He wasn\u2019t that kind of senator.\u201dWhite House officials flatly reject the idea that Mr. Obama has failed to build deep ties with Democrats on Capitol Hill.\u201cThe president is fighting to get Democrats elected and keep the Senate this fall because the stakes are too high for the American people,\u201d said Amy Brundage, the White House deputy communications director. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on making the case about Democrats\u2019 commitment to building on the progress we are seeing in the economy and growing the middle class, and we will continue to work in close partnership with the Democratic leadership throughout the fall.\u201dRegarding the meeting with Mr. Reid, White House aides said that the senator had caught the president off guard by abruptly shifting the conversation away from a sober discussion of the security threats in Iraq. Later, Mr. Obama called Mr. McConnell to press him to clear the way for more confirmations.The aides also cite 18 meetings this year that the president has held with groups of lawmakers, not including one-on-one phone calls or meetings. They say administration advisers routinely consult Democrats when crafting policy on climate change, the Affordable Care Act and the economy. They point to four social events for Democrats that the president hosted this year, and said Mr. Obama had extended 250 invitations to members of Congress for bill signings so far this year.But in interviews, several Democrats said that small talk at large, formal White House gatherings was not the kind of relationship they had in mind.\u201cI can count them on both hands, and they\u2019re big,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, referring to the number of times he has been to the White House since he took office in 2011, and to the size of the events. \u201cIt\u2019s more the interaction that I think has been somewhat lacking \u2014 the personal.\u201dEarly in his presidency, Mr. Obama largely outsourced his relations with congressional Democrats to Rahm Emanuel, his hyper-energetic first chief of staff. In the meantime, some Democrats say, they have just learned to accept the president\u2019s solitary nature and move on.Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 House Democrat, said that compared with Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, Mr. Obama \u201cis more self-contained, less gregarious.\u201d He added: \u201cDoes it somewhat take away from his spending more time with members of Congress and the Senate and politics? Yes.\u201d But, Mr. Hoyer said, \u201cthis president has reached out as much as any president in my view, been open to compromise as much as any I\u2019ve observed.\u201dIf there was an opportunity amid the Washington paralysis for Mr. Obama to build relationships, it might have been during his frequent golf games.\u00a0But only twice in more than 180 rounds has the president invited members of Congress to play with him, and only one Democratic official \u2014 Senator Mark Udall of Colorado \u2014 has joined a presidential foursome.Democratic senators, for their part, do not always show up at White House events. Twelve were invited to a St. Patrick\u2019s Day reception this year, for example, but only one showed up. Aides tried to encourage Mr. Obama to broaden his invitation list, to the White House and the links, but the idea went nowhere.Several people noted that Mr. Obama\u2019s path to the White House helped prevent the kind of close relationships that other presidents forged with Democrats.Unlike Mr. Clinton, who worked hard as a candidate to court every Democrat he could \u2014 from county chairmen to the socialite Pamela Harriman and Vernon Jordan, the superlawyer \u2014 Mr. Obama presented himself as unencumbered by the kind of close ties to the Democratic establishment that would mark him as a creature of Washington.Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, who said he had a \u201ccloser personal relationship with Mr. Obama than most\u201d of his colleagues, said that while he was satisfied that the president had tried to reach out, Mr. Obama would never be a \u201ccreature of Washington\u201d like Mr. Clinton. \u201cI don\u2019t think that was ever in the cards, and I still don\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Durbin said.Another point of tension between Senate Democrats and the White House has been the extent of the president\u2019s participation in the party\u2019s effort to retain the Senate this fall. A group with ties to Mr. Reid has established a \u201csuper PAC\u201d to compete with the efforts by the billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch to tip control of the Senate to Republicans.But the White House and Democrats have sparred over conditions that the administration has put on the president\u2019s participation, and Mr. Obama has no appearances currently scheduled for the group.The back and forth is reminiscent of the 2008 campaign, when Mr. Obama and his aides made a decision that he would not appear on stage side by side with Democratic lawmakers, given the low popularity of Congress.That thinking has continued in the White House. Members of Congress are usually invited to Mr. Obama\u2019s speeches, but they sit in the audience. The result is that Democratic members are robbed of a triumphant picture with the president that they can show their family members, while the White House sacrifices the loyalty of a once grateful lawmaker. \u201cThe White House has something in common with the rest of America, and that is disdain for Congress,\u201d Ms. McCaskill said. \u201cIt is hard to blame them.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Is the Economy Still Weak? Blame These Five Sectors", "Date": "2014-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Recovery in Need of a RecoveryBut why? Where is this gap coming from? To get at an answer, we needed a more basic question: What would the economy look like right now if it were fully healthy, and how is the actual reality of the economy right now different from that?We started by examining how large a proportion of G.D.P. that various sectors have accounted for historically \u2014 over the two decades ending in 2013, to be precise. (Initially, we looked at the full history of G.D.P. data, going back to 1947, but the economy was sufficiently different in the immediate postwar period compared with today that it seemed more sensible to limit it to more recent history.)Then we multiplied those percentages by the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s estimate of what the United States\u2019 potential output was in the second quarter of this year. That gives us a sense of what output \u201cshould\u201d be in each sector if we had a healthy economy and those historical proportions held.As it turns, six of 11 sectors we analyzed are doing fine, with output that is either stronger than or not too much worse than our model predicts. For example, consumer spending on services is exceeding the projection by $63 billion, with spending on nondurable goods undershooting by $74 billion. (Those numbers, like others contained in this analysis, are annualized). Business spending on intellectual property is a bit stronger than you would expect in a healthy recovery, spending on buildings a bit weaker. Trade is holding its own.The following, however, are the five pieces that are the major culprits in the nation\u2019s economic malaise, each vastly undershooting what they would look like in our model of a healthy economy: residential investment; consumption of durable goods; state and local government spending; business investment in equipment; and federal government spending.Together their deficit adds up to $845 billion \u2014 in other words, if those sectors returned to their typical share of economic potential, the economy wouldn\u2019t just be doing well, it would be in an outright boom.Let\u2019s take these five factors in failure one by one.Some caveats to this analysis: There is no \u201cright\u201d answer to how big a share of the economy each of these sectors ought to occupy. Perhaps there are longer-term shifts underway that mean, for example, that durable goods should be a smaller chunk of G.D.P. than they were historically, or that business investment in intellectual property should grow and equipment spending shrink, or any other shift you might imagine.But what you want to see is that even if one segment, say housing, shrinks in importance, something else rises to take its place. And what has happened in the last few years is that each of these major segments has shrunk relative to its usual role in the economy, and nothing else has increased enough to pick up the slack. It\u2019s also possible that the C.B.O.'s estimate of the nation\u2019s economic potential is too high, and that the elevated joblessness of the last few years is a new normal.But if you think that the American economy is capable of humming along a good deal faster than it is, and that the pattern of where economic activity comes from the past couple of decades should still mostly apply, then it\u2019s no mystery which sectors are to blame for the crummy economy.The Upshot: The Upshot presents news, analysis\nand graphics about politics\nand policy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Narendra Modi\u2019s Quiet Beginning Dims India\u2019s Hopes for Swift Change", "Date": "2014-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMemo From New DelhiNEW DELHI \u2014 During the months leading up to the spring parliamentary elections, Indians looked at Narendra Modi and saw what they wanted to see.Right-wing Hindus saw a cultural warrior. Working-class voters saw an incorruptible outsider who would impose discipline, from the \u201cDelhi durbar,\u201d the elite cliques dating to the Mughal courts, down to police constables. Industrialists counted on having an advocate at the top. And public intellectuals in New Delhi, among them centrists who had abandoned the Indian National Congress party, saw an economic reformer who would use his enormous mandate to introduce bold, potentially unpopular policies that would reawaken growth.Someone was bound to be disappointed.By the summer, around 70 days after Mr. Modi\u2019s swearing-in, the first chorus of disappointment emerged from advocates of radical change, including some who served as economic advisers during his campaign.What they had expected was not happening. Mr. Modi\u2019s government introduced its first budget on July 10, to the kind of breathless television coverage typically reserved for royal weddings or moon landings. But it was absent any move that could be described as bold, like lifting caps on foreign direct investment; rolling back the previous government\u2019s subsidy programs; or repealing taxes levied on transactions after the fact, which have long driven away potential investors.Much of the budget suggested that Mr. Modi had decided to adjust, rather than dispose of, the economic policies of the previous government led by the Indian National Congress party \u2014 a surprise to those who had listened to his bellowing attacks on the campaign trail. He has made few changes to the top echelon of the bureaucracy appointed by Congress, most notably extending the tenure of the highest-ranking civil servant, the cabinet secretary, Ajit Seth, who had been scheduled to retire in June.The government risks losing its credibility, Mr. Mehta said, \u201cif the prime minister does not come out swinging soon, in a way that can become an exemplar.\u201dMr. Modi is proving to be a quiet leader. He does not attend the late-night, whiskey-fueled gatherings that drive social life among the New Delhi elite, instead maintaining the monastic schedule he kept as the chief minister of the state of Gujarat. His most confident steps have come in the realm of foreign policy, where he has used his rhetorical gifts as hypnotically as he did in his campaign. At home, his trademark oratory \u2014 ubiquitous for months before the election \u2014 is rarely heard.Instead, the prime minister is said to be spending many hours in conference with senior bureaucrats, trying to identify bottlenecks and regulatory obstacles that have kept infrastructure projects in limbo for years. This is consistent with what he did when he took control of Gujarat. For the first two or three years, as he worked intensively within the bureaucracy, he \u201cdisappeared off the front pages,\u201d said Ashok Malik, a prominent columnist who supported Mr. Modi\u2019s campaign.Mr. Modi \u201chas a bit of the student in him,\u201d Mr. Malik added, and this, together with the relative inexperience of his ministers, has led to a \u201cdegree of overdependence on the bureaucracy.\u201d He said the leader was \u201cfinding his feet.\u201d\u201cWhen you\u2019re faced with a bureaucrat who has been around for 40 years, throwing jargon at you, it can be very overwhelming,\u201d Mr. Malik said. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s only been two months. If he\u2019s still doing the same thing after eight months, that will be something to worry about.\u201dThe markets have continued an upward trend, but the buoyant expectations of the spring have been tempered. Analysts say it will take at least a year and a half to two years for the new government to turn around India\u2019s economy.One argument for patience is that, despite winning a majority in the lower house of Parliament, Mr. Modi has not yet consolidated enough power to impose coherent economic policies. His Bharatiya Janata Party still hopes to take control of a series of important states in the coming months, which is necessary to make gains in Parliament\u2019s upper house. So it might be safer to introduce significant changes in 2015, during a stretch of time between major elections.But this early wave of disenchantment is a reminder that the man India elected this year is, in some ways, a cipher.He captured Indians\u2019 imagination by promising economic growth, but he never gave a blueprint of how he would achieve it. His record in Gujarat establishes him as pro-business, but it says little about how Mr. Modi will use economic policy, or even how he will handle the markets.When he takes the stage at the Red Fort on Friday, he will do so as a leader who has yet to fully reveal himself \u2014 a screen onto which hundreds of millions have projected their hopes.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the location of Jawaharlal Nehru\u2019s \u201ctryst with destiny\u201d speech. It was in Parliament on Independence Day, not on the grounds of the Red Fort in Old Delhi.Neha Thirani Bagri contributed reporting from Mumbai, India.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hitting ISIS Where It Hurts", "Date": "2014-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsWe believe that ISIS will remain financially solvent for the foreseeable future. A conservative calculation suggests that ISIS may generate a surplus of $100 million to $200 million this year that it could reinvest in state-building.America\u2019s post-9/11 approach to blocking terrorist financing will not be effective against ISIS because the group uses money as an instrument of statecraft. Its leadership has established institutions that administer an Islamist police state founded under Shariah law. While these institutions provide few tangible services, they consolidate the group\u2019s governing authority by facilitating trade, collecting taxes and maintaining control over the local population.Moreover, ISIS has never relied on basic formal financial institutions, such as banks. Instead, it has tended to reinvest its revenues in its own organization to further its fighting and state-building agendas.President Obama\u2019s decision last week to conduct airstrikes and send humanitarian aid will help buy time for both Iraqi and Kurdish forces to regroup. But Baghdad needs a strategy that aligns the political and economic interests of all Iraqis against ISIS. The group\u2019s center of gravity lies not in the international financial system but within the local economies of Iraq and Syria. Regardless of what limited additional measures America decides to undertake in the coming weeks and months, there are three possible Iraqi policies that could help turn the tide.If Iraq succeeds in replacing Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, as now seems likely, the new unity government should decentralize power and distribute a larger portion of the national budget to Sunni-majority areas. Baghdad should also work to strike deals with local Sunni tribes and business owners where ISIS has not yet taken control. These Sunni leaders would cooperate in squeezing ISIS out of local markets in exchange for subsidies and other direct government economic assistance.Second, America could help the Iraqis and the Kurds analyze ISIS financial information collected in raids and from informants, and then use that information to plot a strategy and to plan operations.The United States can help at the margins, but ultimately only the Iraqis have the power to defeat ISIS.

{"Headline": "Indonesian Court Rejects Election Challenge, Clearing Way for Joko Presidency", "Date": "2014-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 Indonesia\u2019s Constitutional Court on Thursday rejected claims by Prabowo Subianto, who lost the country\u2019s presidential election in July, that the voting had been rigged, a widely expected ruling that cleared the way for the populist governor of Jakarta, Joko Widodo, to become the country\u2019s next leader.The court ruled that Mr. Prabowo, a former army general, had failed to produce evidence backing his claim that the election was marred by \u201cmassive, structured and systematic fraud.\u201dMr. Joko, who just two years ago was the mayor of a midsize city in Central Java Province, is to be sworn in as president on Oct. 20. He defeated Mr. Prabowo by 53 percent to 47 percent in the July 9 vote, Indonesia\u2019s third direct presidential election since its transition to democracy following the ouster of the authoritarian president Suharto in 1998.Before the ruling on Thursday, thousands of police officers, some wearing riot gear, surrounded the Constitutional Court building in central Jakarta amid fears of violence by angry supporters of Mr. Prabowo, a former commander of Indonesia\u2019s Special Forces. The police at one point clashed with protesters trying to march to the court building in the afternoon, firing tear gas and shooting water cannons, which ultimately dispersed them.Over all, more than 40,000 police and military personnel were deployed in and around the Indonesian capital on Thursday, specifically to provide security for the court\u2019s ruling. Authorities advised city residents to avoid traveling near the court building, and some schools and businesses closed early.Mr. Prabowo, a former son-in-law of Suharto who has been accused of human rights abuses during his military career, had said there were massive irregularities in both the casting and the counting of ballots in July. He said the number of voters exceeded official voter rolls at 52,000 polling stations across the sprawling archipelago, rendering 21 million votes suspect.However, the Constitutional Court, the sole and final adjudicator of election disputes in Indonesia, rejected Mr. Prabowo\u2019s claims, saying his legal team had failed to submit any credible evidence of fraud or other violations of the country\u2019s electoral laws.\u201cBased on this determination, the Constitutional Court rejects all the appeals of the applicant,\u201d said Hamdan Zoelva, the court\u2019s chief justice.Tantowi Yahya, a spokesman for the Prabowo campaign team, said at a news conference at the Grand Hyatt Hotel that his team disagreed with the ruling but acknowledged that it could not further challenge the result.\u201cWe still believe that there was massive and structured fraud in the presidential election,\u201d Mr. Tantowi said. \u201cThe Constitutional Court\u2019s ruling has not given us substantive justice, which is the essence of our democracy. There will be a long struggle to fix our system. We will continue to struggle together with the people.\u201dThe judges had been widely expected to reject Mr. Prabowo\u2019s appeal, given that the country\u2019s General Elections Commission and independent election observers had dismissed his claims, as had many political analysts.The ruling Thursday affirmed the startling rise of Mr. Joko, 53, who was born and raised in a slum area in the city of Surakarta, also known as Solo, in Central Java Province. He grew up to be a carpenter and later a furniture exporter before entering politics in 2005. He was twice elected mayor of his hometown, then governor of Jakarta in 2012, a role in which he gained national attention for his common touch.Mr. Joko, widely known as Jokowi, will be Indonesia\u2019s seventh president and the first not to have emerged from the country\u2019s political elite or to have been an army general. He has promised to focus on the needs of ordinary people in a country that, while a member of the Group of 20 major economies, has more than 100 million people living on $2 a day or less.His agenda includes ridding the national bureaucracy of inefficiency and corruption through electronic budgeting, purchasing and audits; increasing infrastructure spending; eliminating energy subsidies that cost tens of billions of dollars annually; and addressing economic inequality.While Mr. Joko has been widely seen as bringing new excitement to Indonesia\u2019s political scene, which for decades has been ruled by aloof members of the elite, the new president could face formidable obstacles the moment he is sworn in.The coalition of parties that backed Mr. Prabowo\u2019s campaign will hold 68 percent of the seats in the incoming House of Representatives, which was elected in April and convenes in early October. Mr. Joko\u2019s Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle came in first with 20 percent of the seats, but other large parties supported Mr. Prabowo in July. Chief among them was the Golkar party, Mr. Suharto\u2019s political vehicle for 32 years, which came in second in the April legislative election.Mr. Prabowo has pledged to keep the coalition together in order to, among other things, challenge Mr. Joko\u2019s legitimacy as president regardless of the Constitutional Court\u2019s ruling.\u201cIf Prabowo can really keep his majority coalition together after the rejection of his bid by the Constitutional Court, Jokowi would face years of political resistance to his agenda,\u201d Donald K. Emmerson, director of the Southeast Asia Forum at Stanford University\u2019s Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Research Center, said before the ruling.Yet there have been signs in recent days that Mr. Prabowo\u2019s coalition is cracking. Eva Sundari, a lawmaker from Mr. Joko\u2019s party, said two parties had approached the Joko campaign about switching sides, including the departing governing party of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, who is constitutionally barred from seeking a third five-year term. There has been much speculation that Golkar, which has been a member of every democratically elected governing coalition since 1999, will also abandon Mr. Prabowo.\u201cThese parties follow the sources of money and power, generally, and clearly both of those are now on the other side,\u201d said John Kurtz, head of Asia for the consulting firm A.T. Kearney and a longtime Indonesia political analyst. \u201cInterestingly, the president-elect\u2019s camp has quietly made room for some of the major money players that were most ready to change coats and join the other camp.\u201dWhile openly welcoming parties from Mr. Prabowo\u2019s camp into his fold since he was declared the winner last month, Mr. Joko has nonetheless vowed not to trade political support for posts in his administration. He also said he would appoint as many apolitical technocrats as possible to his cabinet.But Burhanuddin Muhtadi, executive director of Indikator Politik, a prominent Indonesian polling organization, said he expected about 40 percent of Mr. Joko\u2019s cabinet posts to go to political appointees, given the political realities of Indonesia\u2019s emerging democracy.\u201cJokowi is likely to appoint a majority of technocrats and professionals, but still, even they have support from political parties,\u201d Mr. Burhanuddin said. \u201cBut they likely will be the kind that are sort of linked to their respective parties but have no official affiliation, which is better.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Pursuing Climate Accord in Lieu of Treaty", "Date": "2014-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration is working to forge a sweeping international climate change agreement to compel nations to cut their planet-warming fossil fuel emissions, but without ratification from Congress.To sidestep that requirement, President Obama\u2019s climate negotiators are devising what they call a \u201cpolitically binding\u201d deal that would \u201cname and shame\u201d countries into cutting their emissions. The deal is likely to face strong objections from Republicans on Capitol Hill and from poor countries around the world, but negotiators say it may be the only realistic path.\u201cIf you want a deal that includes all the major emitters, including the U.S., you cannot realistically pursue a legally binding treaty at this time,\u201d said Paul Bledsoe, a top climate change official in the Clinton administration who works closely with the Obama White House on international climate change policy.Lawmakers in both parties on Capitol Hill say there is no chance that the currently gridlocked Senate will ratify a climate change treaty in the near future, especially in a political environment where many Republican lawmakers remain skeptical of the established science of human-caused global warming.\u201cThere\u2019s a strong understanding of the difficulties of the U.S. situation, and a willingness to work with the U.S. to get out of this impasse,\u201d said Laurence Tubiana, the French ambassador for climate change to the United Nations. \u201cThere is an implicit understanding that this not require ratification by the Senate.\u201dAmerican negotiators are instead homing in on a hybrid agreement \u2014 a proposal to blend legally binding conditions from an existing 1992 treaty with new voluntary pledges. The mix would create a deal that would update the treaty, and thus, negotiators say, not require a new vote of ratification.Countries would be legally required to enact domestic climate change policies \u2014 but would voluntarily pledge to specific levels of emissions cuts and to channel money to poor countries to help them adapt to climate change. Countries might then be legally obligated to report their progress toward meeting those pledges at meetings held to identify those nations that did not meet their cuts.The strategy comes as scientists warn that the earth is already experiencing the first signs of human-caused global warming \u2014 more severe drought and stronger wildfires, rising sea levels and more devastating storms \u2014 and the United Nations heads toward what many say is the body\u2019s last chance to avert more catastrophic results in the coming century.At the United Nations General Assembly in New York next month, delegates will gather at a sideline meeting on climate change to try to make progress toward the deal next year in Paris. A December meeting is planned in Lima, Peru, to draft the agreement.Some areas of the globe are especially vulnerable to rising sea levels and inhabitants are being forced to make stark changes in their lives.In seeking to go around Congress to push his international climate change agenda, Mr. Obama is echoing his domestic climate strategy. In June, he bypassed Congress and used his executive authority to order a far-reaching regulation forcing American coal-fired power plants to curb their carbon emissions. That regulation, which would not be final until next year, already faces legal challenges, including a lawsuit filed on behalf of a dozen states.But unilateral action by the world\u2019s largest economy will not be enough to curb the rise of carbon pollution across the globe. That will be possible only if the world\u2019s largest economies, including India and China, agree to enact similar cuts.The Obama administration\u2019s international climate strategy is likely to infuriate Republican lawmakers who already say the president is abusing his executive authority by pushing through major policies without congressional approval.\u201cUnfortunately, this would be just another of many examples of the Obama administration\u2019s tendency to abide by laws that it likes and to disregard laws it doesn\u2019t like \u2014 and to ignore the elected representatives of the people when they don\u2019t agree,\u201d Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and minority leader, said in a statement.A deal that would not need to be ratified by the United States or any other nation is also drawing fire from the world\u2019s poorest countries. In African and low-lying island nations \u2014 places that scientists say are the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change \u2014 officials fear that any agreement made outside the structure of a traditional United Nations treaty will not bind rich countries to spend billions of dollars to help developing nations deal with the forces of climate change.Poor countries look to rich countries to help build dams and levees to guard against coastal flooding from rising seas levels, or to provide food aid during pervasive droughts.\u201cWithout an international agreement that binds us, it\u2019s impossible for us to address the threats of climate change,\u201d said Richard Muyungi, a climate negotiator for Tanzania. \u201cWe are not as capable as the U.S. of facing this problem, and historically we don\u2019t have as much responsibility. What we need is just one thing: Let the U.S. ratify the agreement. If they ratify the agreement, it will trigger action across the world.\u201dObservers of United Nations climate negotiations, which have gone on for more than two decades without achieving a global deal to legally bind the world\u2019s biggest polluters to carbon cuts, say that if written carefully such an agreement could be a creative and pragmatic way to at least level off the world\u2019s rapidly rising levels of greenhouse gas emissions.About a dozen countries are responsible for nearly 70 percent of the world\u2019s carbon pollution, chiefly from cars and coal-fired power plants.At a 2009 climate meeting in Copenhagen, world leaders tried but failed to forge a new legally binding treaty to supplant the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. Instead, they agreed only to a series of voluntary pledges to cut carbon emissions through 2020.The Obama administration\u2019s climate change negotiators are desperate to avoid repeating the failure of Kyoto, the United Nations\u2019 first effort at a legally binding global climate change treaty. Nations around the world signed on to the deal, which would have required the world\u2019s richest economies to cut their carbon emissions, but the Senate refused to ratify the treaty, ensuring that the world\u2019s largest historic carbon polluter was not bound by the agreement.Seventeen years later, the Senate obstacle remains. Even though Democrats currently control the chamber, the Senate has been unable to reach agreement to ratify relatively noncontroversial United Nations treaties. In 2012, for example, Republican senators blocked ratification of a United Nations treaty on equal rights for the disabled, even though the treaty was modeled after an American law and had been negotiated by a Republican president, George W. Bush.This fall, Senate Republicans are poised to pick up more seats, and possibly to retake control of the chamber. Mr. McConnell, who has been one of the fiercest opponents of Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change policy, comes from a coal-heavy state that could be an economic loser in any climate-change protocol that targets coal-fired power plants, the world\u2019s largest source of carbon pollution.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Eurozone Inflation Continues Its Slide", "Date": "2014-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Inflation in the eurozone fell in July to its lowest level since 2009, according to an official estimate released Thursday. But separate figures showing a drop in unemployment provided some reassurance that the region was not yet on the brink of a destructive downward price spiral.That was the lowest inflation rate since October 2009, and remained well below the 2 percent rate that the European Central Bank considers healthy for the eurozone economy.Economists and policy makers have worried that the eurozone is perilously close to a broad decline in prices known as deflation, which could undercut corporate revenues and profits, and lead to higher joblessness.Fears of deflation may be partly offset by the decline in unemployment to 11.5 percent in June, from 11.6 percent in May. Joblessness fell in all of the countries that had been hardest hit by the euro crisis, including Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain.Unemployment rose in France, however, to 10.2 percent, from 10.1 percent. The increase is likely to bolster concerns that France is stuck in an economic rut and politically incapable of making changes to labor rules or putting in place other overhauls needed to improve economic performance.Spain and Greece continued to have the highest unemployment in the eurozone, however. The jobless rate in Spain was 24.5 percent in June; in Greece, it was 27.3 percent in April, the most recent figures available. The lowest unemployment rates for the month of June were in Austria, at 5 percent, and Germany, at 5.1 percent.Economists say the eurozone unemployment rate is still too high to put pressure on employers to raise wages, which would also raise inflation.\u201cToday\u2019s figures don\u2019t give any assurance that the eurozone is already out of the deflation danger zone,\u201d Peter Vanden Houte, an economist at ING Bank in Brussels, wrote in a note to clients. \u201cMoreover, with the escalating conflict with Russia dampening growth prospects, it seems unlikely that deflation fears will disappear any time soon.\u201dThe drop in overall prices, which was in line with analyst forecasts, was caused by a fall in the inflation rate for food and tobacco, Eurostat said, as well as in energy prices.Prices of industrial goods excluding energy were unchanged, while service prices rose at a rate of 1.3 percent, perhaps reflecting higher wage increases in Germany.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Searching for Vintage Toilet Seats and Other Parts", "Date": "2014-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byShortcutsTHERE you are, performing one of the most mundane of household chores: lifting the toilet tank lid to see why the toilet won\u2019t flush. You casually lean it against the wall, and suddenly \u2014 disaster \u2014 it slides down and your lid is in several unsalvageable pieces.As you stare at the unsightly innards of the toilet, it becomes clear there are few options: For a replacement lid for a newish toilet, you can check online. But if your toilet is more than about five to 10 years old, you can either pay to have an entirely new one installed or begin the great toilet tank lid hunt.And it\u2019s not just lids. If you happen to have a toilet and matching fixtures in, say, the color Orchid of Vencencia (1929-1941) or Clair de Lune Blue (1929-1957 except for the war years), you\u2019ll have to search farther than the nearest Home Depot or Lowe\u2019s to find the right-colored seat when the old one gives out.But there is a whole subculture out there to service such needs. PlumbingSupply.com, based in Chico, Calif., is the largest supplier of new and old plumbing supplies in the country; its inventory includes about 8,500 used tank lids.It started as a brick-and-mortar store in Chico in 1979, catering to local plumbers and the community, then went solely online in 2005, said its president, Aden Cullens. And business has grown as the economy picks up and people are working on their homes again, he said.The company receives about 100 emails and fills 100 to 200 orders daily, 10 to 20 for toilet seats alone.\u201cAnd whenever we can\u2019t find the original product, we try to find a modern brand that\u2019s equivalent,\u201d he said.Most tank lids run in the $60-to-$80 range, though at the high end, a kidney-bean-shaped French vanilla lid from 1931 costs $697.30. The seats can go as high as $180 (colored, 1960s), but they average $20 to $60, Mr. Cullens said. The tank lids are mostly used, but the seats are newly manufactured to match old colors.Perhaps because those who run such services are dealing with a particularly intimate, yet necessary, part of life, some suppliers offer not just products but also jokes, advice and insights on their websites.Mr. Tjader has been in the business of plumbing supplies all his life. About 15 years ago, he was helping out with plumbing advice on several websites, and \u201ca recurring question was, Where do I get a tank lid? I knew where stacks of these were. I responded to one, asking the brand of the toilet, and he came by and bought it for $100. And it just rolled on from there.\u201dHe sells only the porcelain parts of the toilets, not the innards. He figures he now has about 2,000 tank lids in stock, and is regularly resupplied by plumbers, salvage places and once in a while, a lucky find by the side of the road.\u201cI was driving to the hardware store and someone put out a pedestal tank and tank lid,\u201d he said, noting that it was a particularly desirable model from the 1990s. He also runs a side business, toiletsalvage.com (closed until September), where local people pay him $17 per toilet (additional toilets get a discount) to recycle toilets instead of having them dumped in landfills.\u201cI harvest the parts and then take the rest to recycling,\u201d he said.If he doesn\u2019t have a part, he knows where to look, but even with all his sources, he\u2019s not always successful. Bill Janssen, of Fairfax County, Va., turned to Mr. Tjader in his search for 1950s Ming Green toilet to replace one that developed a leak.His plumber warned that the toilet might break if he removed it. But Mr. Janssen needs to fix the problem and has been scouring the Internet for an appropriate model. \u201cThere was one on eBay, but it was already sold by the time I looked,\u201d he said. Mr. Tjader estimated that the fixture he needed would cost almost $800.The cost \u2014 plus shipping and installation \u2014 is sobering. But Mr. Janssen has lived in his 1950s house for about 30 years and \u201cwe\u2019ve sort of grown to like\u201d the green, he said. \u201cAnd besides, the sink is Ming Green, the tub is Ming Green.\u201dFortunately, his other bathroom has white fixtures.Another option is TheAnswerLine.com, which sells parts and also has an extensive database for consumers and plumbers to search for particular items for showers, tub and sinks as well as toilets. The site is free for limited use, but membership costs $15 for three days up to $100 a month.\u201cA lot of people are trying to maintain continuity with design,\u201d said the site\u2019s founder, J. P. Shields, who grew up in a family that was involved in the plumbing business. \u201cIf you have a pink bathroom and put in a white toilet, when you go to sell the house, you\u2019ll need to redo.\u201dAesthetics aside, many people will argue that instead of looking to replace that old toilet with the same model that may use seven gallons of water (those made in the 1920s-1950s) five gallons (1960s-1970s) or 3.5 gallons (1982-1994), one should install a low-flow toilet. The federal Energy Policy of 1992 required that by 1994, all new toilets for consumers could use only 1.6 gallons. California, Georgia, Texas and New York City mandate 1.28 gallons.Saving water is good. But the cost of swapping out an old toilet and perhaps other fixtures that match \u2014 or the floor if it doesn\u2019t fit the footprint of the new model \u2014 might be more than some people want to invest.It\u2019s possible, Mr. Cullens suggested, to install some kind of dual-flush valve that, as he delicately put it, \u201cuses a small amount of liquid to clean away a little and a large amount of liquid to clean away a lot more.\u201dBut James Walsh, vice president of residential chinaware and commercial products at American Standard, didn\u2019t advise putting such flush valves in old toilets.\u201cYou can\u2019t just cut water usage down,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has to be engineered. I think you\u2019re asking for a lot of trouble. You really need to get a new toilet.\u201dWhen the Energy Policy Act was passed, toilet manufacturers weren\u2019t prepared, and the low-flow toilets that were manufactured didn\u2019t work that well, he said. But by the early 2000s, technology had progressed, he said, and now low-flow toilets no longer deserved a bad name.Replacing an old toilet with a new one can run as low as $150 and as high as $4,200 for the \u201cspa\u201d toilet that includes a seat that heats up, raises and lowers and that offers lots of bodily cleaning features.But options exist for those simply wanting to keep their old model going \u2014 and looking as good as possible. And there\u2019s no need to be embarrassed. Just check Mr. Tjader\u2019s website to see the explanations customers have given for needing a new tank lid.His favorite: \u201cThis is the last time I let my sister paint my bathroom while drinking.\u201dThe Shortcuts column on Saturday, about places to find parts for vintage toilets, misstated part of the business services of the website TheAnswerLine.com. It does in fact sell plumbing parts; it does not merely offer an extensive database of parts.Email: shortcuts@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Divisions Grow as a Downturn Rocks Europe", "Date": "2014-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Six years after being struck by economic crisis, Europe is facing a fresh downturn, with few new ideas on the table for reigniting growth and deepening political divisions over the austerity policies that many blame for worsening the malaise.Unemployment, which in the United States has fallen to 6.2 percent from a peak of 10 percent in 2009, has fallen only marginally in Europe, to 11.5 percent in July from a peak of 12 percent last year, according to figures released on Friday.The fresh downturn has worsened tensions between European leaders and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. Ms. Merkel continues to stand by an austerity program that she considers essential to financial stability, but that many critics now say is only deepening Europe\u2019s woes and leaving it at risk of losing a generation of growth.Action by the European Central Bank, which meets in Frankfurt next week, has become more urgent in the face of signs of another potential menace: deflation, a downward spiral in prices and wages that could further crimp Europe\u2019s recovery prospects. On Friday, Europe\u2019s statistical agency reported that inflation declined again in August to its lowest level since 2009.\u201cThis is a major red light\u201d for Europe, said Jean-Paul Fitoussi, a professor of economics at the Institut d\u2019\u00c9tudes Politiques de Paris. \u201cWe need to change the direction of policy to avoid a situation with potentially worrisome consequences for society and politics.\u201dA new approach is needed, Mr. Hollande told a conference of French ambassadors in Paris, because \u201cthe recovery is too weak, because inflation is too low, because the euro is too strong, and because Europe is menaced by long and possibly interminable stagnation if we don\u2019t act.\u201dMr. Hollande, a Socialist who as a candidate promised a new economic approach, has shown little willingness to break decisively with Germany over Ms. Merkel\u2019s insistence that keeping government debt under control is the precondition for long-term prosperity.Still, France, Italy and a number of other countries are likely to press within the European Union in coming months for a loosening of deficit-reduction targets for the next several years.The austerity program has helped Spain, Ireland and other troubled economies regain their ability to borrow money in the bond markets. But critics say that forcing countries to cut spending and raise taxes to meet fiscal targets while in recession also delayed and weakened the economic recovery, impeding job creation and income growth.Ms. Merkel, while agreeing that growth is important, continues to rebuff calls for a change in German policy.\u201cWe can talk about whether you make 2 or 3 percent more debt, or 1 percent, or, like us, a balanced budget,\u201d Ms. Merkel said this week. \u201cBut one really must question whether we can go on receiving less than we spend, so that our debts keep on growing. Indeed, a whole crisis of confidence has grown out of that.\u201dStill, she hinted she could be more flexible if countries undertook reforms to revive competitiveness. Spain, which adopted more business-friendly labor laws and other structural changes to its economy, is one of the few eurozone countries to show signs of recovery. In a visit this week with Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, Ms. Merkel praised Spain as a model for how to rebound from the crisis.Ms. Merkel has remained unmoved by her critics, even as Germany\u2019s economy has slowed and been challenged by new pressures like the confrontation with Russia over Ukraine. To some degree, the slowdown in Germany is being driven by a lack of demand for its exports from neighbors like France and Italy, which, lacking the ability to use government spending to spur growth, have struggled to gain economic traction. Italy, the third-largest eurozone economy, has returned to recession and remains saddled with a debt equal to 136 percent of gross domestic product, the highest ratio in the eurozone after Greece. Analysts said a new crisis in Italy could reignite fears that the eurozone will come apart.Germany is further vulnerable to the strife in Ukraine. Sales of machinery to Russia, the industry\u2019s fifth-largest export market, fell 19 percent in the first six months of the year. On Thursday, Ms. Merkel said the European Union would discuss tougher sanctions this weekend, hours after Kiev accused Moscow of a fresh incursion.Germany is also grappling with its strained relationship with France, where Mr. Hollande is having trouble holding his party together as calls increase to challenge the supremacy of German economic policy leadership. While the two recessions that have hit France in the last five years have not been as deep as those in other countries, growth has failed to revive meaningfully.Germans worry about the imbalance between the Continent\u2019s two essential powers, while French leaders feel belittled by Ms. Merkel, who \u201cwants to give us lessons,\u201d said Jean-Christophe Cambad\u00e9lis, a prominent French Socialist. \u201cWe are a great nation trying to pull ourselves together. We are not one of the German l\u00e4nder,\u201d he added, using the German word for its 16 states.\u201cGermany is a strong country, but it is too weak to lead the Continent alone,\u201d said Guntram Wolff, a German who runs the Bruegel organization in Brussels. While trade with France is important, their common projects \u2014 monetary union, the European Union itself, centuries of shared history \u2014 count for much more, he said.A prolonged downturn in Europe, should it happen, could weigh on the American recovery and have far-reaching consequences for European society and politics at a time when far-right forces have emerged as challengers in France, the Netherlands, Greece and elsewhere, analysts said.And as American imperatives point toward more multilateralism, Mr. Summers said, \u201ca greatly diminished and stagnating Europe will mean that the United States will increasingly lack its best partners.\u201dLiz Alderman reported from Paris and Alison Smale from Berlin. Jack Ewing contributed reporting from Frankfurt.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "2 Bank of England Board Members Support Raising Rates, Minutes Show", "Date": "2014-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Two members of the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee pushed this month for the central bank to raise interest rates, the first dissenting votes since Mark J. Carney became the bank\u2019s governor last year, according to minutes of the two-day meeting published on Wednesday.The dissenting votes, by the panel members Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty, come at a sensitive time for Mr. Carney, who has been accused of sending mixed signals to the market about the timing of any future rate increases.On Aug. 7, the nine-member committee voted 7 to 2 to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged at a low of 0.5 percent, where it has been since March 2009. Members of the committee had been unanimous in their monthly votes to keep rates unchanged since July 2011. Mr. Carney joined the bank in July 2013.In February, Mr. Carney abandoned his so-called forward guidance strategy \u2014 a pledge to consider raising interest rates only when unemployment dropped to, or below, 7 percent \u2014 after the British jobless rate fell more quickly than expected.The policy, which was adopted by the Bank of England shortly after Mr. Carney became governor in July 2013, was intended to remove uncertainty among investors and consumers about when rates would increase. Mr. Carney has since said that policy makers would consider additional factors, including gains in productivity and wages, before determining whether an increase was necessary.Economists had predicted that the unemployment rate would not reach 7 percent before 2016, but it fell to 6.9 percent in the three months from December 2013 to February 2014. The unemployment rate dropped to 6.4 percent in the second quarter, the lowest level since late 2008, according to the most recent figures.As a result of Mr. Carney\u2019s setting aside his guidance on unemployment, coupled with other seemingly contradictory statements in recent months, a British lawmaker likened him to an \u201cunreliable boyfriend\u201d who gave mixed signals to the market.The FTSE 100 index, a measure of 100 of the largest companies traded on the London Stock Exchange, initially moved higher after the announcement but later fell, echoing declines in Asia. The FTSE 100 closed down 0.35 percent.After the release of the minutes, the pound moved higher, to $1.66, after having declined Tuesday to its lowest level since April. A British government survey released on Tuesday showed that inflation in Britain declined in July, sending the pound lower as traders believed it was less likely that interest rates would rise this year.According to the minutes released on Wednesday, the majority of members of the Monetary Policy Committee believed there was \u201cinsufficient evidence\u201d of increasing inflationary pressures to justify an increase in interest rates at this time.Last week, the British central bank raised slightly its forecasts for growth and inflation, but said that it did not believe inflation would rise above its target of 2 percent before 2017. The bank predicted that the British economy would grow at an annual pace of 3.5 percent in 2014, slightly faster than the 3.4 percent growth it had forecast in May. It estimated inflation to be 1.9 percent by the end of the year and to remain at slightly lower levels for 2015 and 2016.Inflation reached 1.6 percent at the end of July, down from 1.9 percent in June, according to the most recent British data.At a news conference last week, Mr. Carney said that \u201cconflicting signals in the labor market\u201d were complicating the central bank\u2019s efforts to determine whether to raise interest rates. He said the bank was concerned about slower growth in wages in Britain, as pay including bonuses dipped in the second quarter from a year earlier.The bank last week lowered its annual outlook for wage growth this year, saying it expected wages to grow by 1.25 percent in 2014. In May, it had estimated that wages would grow 2.5 percent for the year.Slower wage growth \u2014 and fears of stifling the economic recovery \u2014 appeared to play a strong role in the Monetary Policy Committee\u2019s decision to maintain rates at current levels, according to the minutes released on Wednesday.\u201cGiven the risk that an increase in labor supply or persistent concerns over job security would result in weak wage growth continuing for longer, there would be merit in waiting to see firmer evidence that solid increases in pay growth were in prospect before tightening policy,\u201d the minutes said. \u201cThis would allow the expansion to become more entrenched.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "All Over the Map", "Date": "2014-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis year, three of the world\u2019s largest democracies are holding national elections \u2014 vast polls spread over several days and thousands of miles of territory, involving more than a billion voters. Two of these elections have attracted intense media coverage, or will. India\u2019s national elections, which took place in May, swept out of office the long-ruling Congress Party and handed government of a rising economic and political power to the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party. Brazil\u2019s elections, which will be held in October, are coming on the heels of the World Cup, one of several high-profile events that have marked the country\u2019s emergence as the second giant of the Americas. The third election, Indonesia\u2019s presidential vote on July 9, has been mostly ignored by the international media, even though Indonesia, with a population of about 250 million, ranks as the fourth-\u00adlargest country in the world, as well as the biggest economy in Southeast Asia.In \u201cIndonesia Etc.: Exploring the Improbable Nation,\u201d Elizabeth Pisani, a journalist, epidemiologist and on-and-off resident of Indonesia, readily acknowledges the archipelago\u2019s feeble presence on the global stage; her friends back in London look at her quizzically when she mentions the country. Though she had flirted with Indonesia for decades, she finally tires of the world\u2019s ignorance and chooses to take a break from work to travel the islands, offering a primer and a quick history lesson on this awakening powerhouse. Through her journey, too, she hopes to understand not only how a country as diverse and far-flung as Indonesia \u2014 at least 13,000 islands, many with their own unique cultures \u2014 has stayed together but also why, despite having had an average income similar to Malaysia\u2019s and Singapore\u2019s 60 years ago, it now lags badly behind. Today, some 105 million Indonesians live on less than $2 per day, though much of the country is blessed with fertile volcanic soil, rich fishing grounds, abundant natural resources and a demographic dividend, in which the country has a high ratio of working-age people to elderly. And in an era when authoritarian China is poised to become the world\u2019s largest economy and democracy is floundering throughout the developing world, perhaps Pisani\u2019s study of Indonesia can help answer the question of whether democracy is even compatible with the high growth needed to foster development in these emerging giants. Pisani knows that the only mental images outsiders may have of Indonesia hail from Java, the island containing nearly 60 percent of the country\u2019s population: Wayang shadow puppets moving behind a translucent screen, luminous batik cloths and the grim-faced former dictator Suharto, who ruled between 1967 and 1998. From the time of independence in 1949, Javanese elites have monopolized politics, the military and other major institutions.Pisani\u2019s strategy for countering Java\u2019s dominance is to explore the other Indonesia \u2014 the forgotten parts of a forgotten country. Her journey spans a year and 26,000 miles, and she rarely takes comfortable vehicles. She jumps five-day-long ferries to the most obscure islands and cadges journeys along rutted roads on the backs of motorbikes, which leave one\u2019s bottom bruised. Her rule for the trip, she declares, is \u201cjust say yes\u201d to any invitation. She not only visits Indonesia\u2019s forgotten areas; she clearly identifies with their residents, writing with passion and telling detail. On the island of Sumba, near northern Australia, she is adopted by the matriarch of one village, and moves in with the woman\u2019s family for a time. Eventually, Pisani becomes so involved in the rituals of this Sumba village that she finds herself carrying a squawking chicken to a local mystic, who will kill it, read its entrails and tell her fortune; later, she joins a massive animal sacrifice on Sumba in honor of a recent death. Her book is loaded with such anecdotes in places that seem the opposite of cookie-cutter Southeast Asian megacities. She watches supposedly forbidden whale hunts on the island of Lembata, near East Timor. She is suddenly swept into the wedding of a friend\u2019s brother. She stumbles into a revivalist Christian congregation in Ambon, amid the fabled Spice Islands, a congregation that seems to have been airlifted from a Texas megachurch.For someone who focuses on Indonesia, like myself, these anecdotes are tasty morsels, and rare. I had heard almost nothing, for example, about the sparsely populated Sangihe islands, between Sulawesi and the southern Philippines, where tuna fishing is the only industry. Here, Pisani says no to an offer for once, with good reason \u2014 it\u2019s a chance to join a four-day fishing trip on the open Pacific in a rickety outrigger with only a shoddy tarpaulin for cover.Unfortunately, these anecdotes rarely cohere into more than collected stories about Indonesia\u2019s outer provinces. Pisani introduces some broad themes that could help explain the country\u2019s simultaneous survival and failure, but she doesn\u2019t expand on them effectively. Indonesia, she suggests, has \u201cwelded so much difference together\u201d through collectivism in villages and clans \u2014 collectivism that makes people more secure in their daily lives. Its citizens have generally fostered a level of cultural tolerance rare in such large nations. Yet, she suggests, it has failed to change the byzantine bureaucracy, feudal political hierarchies and entrenched corruption left by the Dutch colonizers and then the Suharto regime. At times, she also tries to introduce the nonexpert to the country\u2019s myriad cultures but stumbles with strange analogies, calling Indonesia a \u201cBad Boyfriend\u201d \u2014 it excites your senses but then angers you with its flaws. For the most part, she remains content to drift back into anecdotes rather than pull them together. Worse, though Indonesia certainly is more than just Java, the book does not really grapple with Java or several of the other populous Indonesian islands. Mostly ignoring the bigger islands means that Pisani\u2019s picture of Indonesia, though different from those of many Indonesia specialists, is badly skewed in another way. She basically leaves out any discussion of about three-quarters of the country\u2019s population, and makes only passing mention of Jakarta\u2019s governor, Joko Widodo, the winner of the July presidential elections and the first post-Suharto era politician to run Indonesia. It\u2019s as if someone tried to write a book about America but ignored 40 of the states.Javanese elitism or not, it is simply impossible to understand the staggering changes Indonesia has undergone since the end of the 1990s, including decentralization, a rapid transition to democracy and growing relationships with both China and the United States, without truly considering how decisions are made in Jakarta and other major urban centers. Instead, Pisani falls back on easy clich\u00e9s about Jakarta, reform and the population itself. She deplores the rapid change and construction in the seemingly soulless capital, without seriously examining the positive aspects of all this growth, a strange omission for a public health specialist. She disdains the pork-barrel politics that come with greater direct democracy, as politicians jostle to deliver projects to their districts and sometimes skim a percentage for themselves. But this kind of patronage is necessarily curtailed by the transparency of democracy, and in the long run far healthier than the opaque and unreconstructed Suharto period. (Pisani herself acknowledges that in the latter part of Suharto\u2019s time, \u201call the growth\u201d went \u201cinto a handful of pockets,\u201d though she still paints a fairly rosy picture of the Suharto era.) She too often portrays Indonesians as accepting their fate in life, a fatalism not apparent in this spring\u2019s parliamentary elections, when Indonesian voters tossed out about half the incumbents.In the end, Pisani rediscovers her Bad Boyfriend idea, in a thin epilogue that again attempts to boil down what she has learned about Indonesia but soon turns into another anecdote.

{"Headline": "The S.&P.\u2019s Slow, Bumpy Climb to 2,000", "Date": "2014-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ChartsTHE Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has doubled in value, and it only took 16 and a half years.The index, which includes all the largest United States companies, climbed above 2,000 on Tuesday, 6,049 days after it first closed above 1,000 on Feb. 2, 1998. That is a compound annual return of 4.3 percent, which is a far cry from the 27 percent annual return when the index doubled from 500 to 1,000 in less than three years.As the accompanying charts show, the ride up was anything but smooth. Along the way, there were two recessions, the last one called the Great Recession, each accompanied by a bear market that cut share prices in half. Since the market hit bottom in March 2009, the index has nearly tripled, rising at a rate of more than 15 percent a year.Breaking that double into five segments \u2014 three bull markets and two bear markets \u2014 shows that there is truth to the biblical injunction that \u201cthe last shall be first, and the first last.\u201d The best stocks of the bull markets tended to be poor performers in the bear markets, while those that lagged on the way up recovered.Technology and telecommunications issues soared until early 2000. But consumer staples \u2014 the things that consumers will always buy, like soup and soap \u2014 were deemed boring and lost about a quarter of their value from early 1998 through the peak on March 24, 2000. Then the tech bubble burst, the economy went into recession and the stock market crumbled. Technology and telecommunications issues led the way down. But consumer staple stocks actually rose during the bear market that ended in autumn 2002.It then took exactly seven years for stocks to rise to a new peak, this time led by energy stocks. In that move, health care and consumer staple stocks were the laggards. Those two sectors were then the best performers during the down phase, which ended on March 9, 2009. Financial stocks were by far the worst performers in that bear market. Since then, financials have been among the best performers among the 10 S.&P. sectors, although they remain far below their 2007 peaks.The accompanying charts show the performance of each of the sectors, comparing them with that of the index as a whole. The star sector was energy, which rose nearly 300 percent over the period. Oil traded for about $17 a barrel when the S.&P. 500 first reached 1,000, and about $94 when the index hit 2,000. Telecommunications stocks are about 19 percent below where they were in 1998, and financial stocks are only 10 percent higher.Many stock investors no doubt did better than the S.&P. 500 since 1998. The Russell 2,000, an index of companies whose market capitalization is just below the 1,000 largest, rose 171 percent. And the smaller stocks in the S.&P. 500 generally did better than the large ones. An investment divided equally among all 500 stocks would have gained 229 percent.Of course, saying that the S.&P. 500 has doubled since 1998 can be misleading. That ignores dividends, which if reinvested would have produced a gain of 171 percent. But it also ignores inflation. Adjust for that and share prices are just 36 percent higher than in 1998. Adjust for both of them, and the gain is 85 percent.While taking 16.6 years to double seems awfully slow, it took 17.4 years to go from the first close over 100, in 1968, to the first one over 200, in 1985. A significant bear market in the 1970s intervened. And it took more than 29 years to go from the first close over 25, in 1929, to the first one over 50, in 1958. That period included the Great Depression.Advertisement"}

Comptroller Scott M. Stringer reported recently that the city\u2019s funds posted a 17.4 percent return over the last year. Over the last five years, the city\u2019s pension funds have earned an average rate of 13.4 percent.Your article also overlooks the role these systems play as an economic engine in local communities. According to the retirement institute, every dollar in pension benefits results in $1.98 in total economic input, creating jobs and a sustainable income stream.We are witnessing the truly devastating consequences when workers are left to fend for themselves in retirement. Fifty-nine percent of New Yorkers lack access to a retirement plan. The majority of those workers who do have access to a plan have less than $30,000 saved for retirement.We must meet a just and civilized standard for retirement, so that it\u2019s a time of security, not poverty.To the Editor:The article picks the year 2000 as a baseline comparison for the city\u2019s contribution to the pension system, a year in which the city\u2019s payment was $1 billion lower than usual because of a one-time reassessment of the fund\u2019s assets. Using this year to compare against future years unfairly inflates the growth of pension liabilities.Moreover, in the early 2000s, the market was still recovering from the tech stock crash, which had a devastating effect on the general public and pension systems. The malfeasance by publicly traded companies like Enron, WorldCom, Adelphia and so on caused tremendous damage to the assets of the pension funds and led to higher contributions.A few years of prosperity were followed by another precipitous crash, with the Dow cratering 50 percent between 2007 and 2009. Advising the pension fund to limit investments to stocks and high-rated bonds and not to invest in private equity or alternatives goes against the concept of diversification that is embraced by all major pension funds.That approach would have led to an even more catastrophic loss to the funds if we had narrowed our choices of asset classes. Even so, the crash again led to higher contributions.Given our experience and the true factors for recent pension contributions, we think that it\u2019s better to stick with the current trustees instead of Wall Street \u201cprofessionals.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Paper Mill Goes Quiet, and the Community It Built Gropes for a Way Forward", "Date": "2014-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMILLINOCKET, Me. \u2014 Pass a playground and follow a dusty road, and there, on the other side of a chain-link fence, is the wreckage of the paper mill that was born before this town was.One recent afternoon, backhoes picked through the rubble of a vast room that once held 10 paper machines, while a handful of townspeople, some smoking in their idling cars, watched.It is something to do here, witnessing the disintegration of the Great Northern Paper mill, which conjured this town out of the backwoods and sustained it for a century. Once among the biggest mills of its kind, it pulled power from the river and made pulp from spruce, filling wallets and pantries for thousands of families and supporting a bustling main street. People called Millinocket the Magic City.The mill stopped running in 2008, a turn of events that had once been unthinkable. Since the closing, the town has been unable to find a strategy that could provide an economic engine on anything near the scale the mill did. Its last paper machine was auctioned off in June, snuffing out any wistful hope of a restart. \u201cA series of generations of people earned their livings up there, good livings, and now this generation is stranded,\u201d said Lloyd Irland, a forestry consultant in Maine.The decline of Great Northern decimated the area\u2019s economy, making it an extreme example of once-prosperous Maine manufacturing communities that have been hollowed out as their mills have closed or shed jobs. Public officials here are anxiously awaiting late back-tax payments on the mill, while residents confront the vexing question of what their town can be without the mill that built it.\u201cYou used to hear it. It was part of the community \u2014 you\u2019d hear it running and everything,\u201d said John Raymond, 56, a town councilor and fourth-generation millworker who left after a shutdown in 2002 and is now a property manager. \u201cNow, it\u2019s just dead silence out here.\u201dThe main drag here is pocked with empty glass storefronts, a shadow of the days in the late 1970s and early \u201980s when department stores and other shops served between 4,000 and 5,000 people employed by Great Northern in the area. Maine was among the leading papermaking states, and two mills here made up the state\u2019s dominant paper-producing site.That made Millinocket a boomtown in the middle of nowhere, where every family had job security, needing nothing but the mill and the natural resources the company owned. \u201cWe had everything,\u201d said John F. DiCentes, 75, a lifelong resident who, like many in Millinocket, followed in the steps of his father and grandfather by spending his career at the mill, which recruited employees still in high school. \u201cYou could make as much money as you wanted.\u201dBut domestic and global competition pressed in on the business, while demand for paper declined as the technology to make it became more efficient. In the 1990s, the mill began to change hands and shed assets, and the layoffs came in waves. Since the mill\u2019s closing in 2008, unemployment in Millinocket has fluctuated between 10 and 21 percent, well above the state average over the same period. The town has aged, and it has shrunk: The median age has doubled since 1970, from 25 to 51, and the population dropped to 4,466 in 2010 from 7,742 in 1970.In some ways, the town seems as if it has frozen, with little economic growth to replace what was lost. It is hobbled by the isolation that was necessary to its founding. The closing of the mill has gutted bank accounts, and there are few employment alternatives close by. Without the mill, the town\u2019s biggest taxpayer, revenue will fall.\u201cWe\u2019re in a significant downsizing mode, and there isn\u2019t anything that\u2019s going to save us,\u201d said Peggy Daigle, the town manager.\u201cThere are towns that have become ghost towns, faded away,\u201d added Ms. Daigle. \u201cIf we do nothing, that\u2019s probably what will happen.\u201dSome here, like Mr. Raymond, want the town to tighten its belt by consolidating its schools. And many look to the area\u2019s natural beauty.\u201cTourism is seasonal jobs. You need balance with manufacturing,\u201d said Jimmy Busque, a town councilor and lifelong millworker. After he was laid off from the Millinocket plant in 2008, he went to work at Great Northern\u2019s East Millinocket mill, which got a boost making paper for the best-selling novel \u201cFifty Shades of Grey\u201d but has been on hiatus since January.Mr. Raymond and Mr. Busque watched as the Millinocket mill\u2019s current owner, Cate Street Capital, which bought Great Northern in 2011, convened the June auction that included the mill\u2019s biggest and last remaining paper machine \u2014 what people here call No. 11 (the other 10 were already gone).\u201cIt looked like everything had been blown up,\u201d Mr. Raymond said of the mill. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re left with.\u201dOver at the town library, the librarians looked for online news reports about the auction\u2019s progress. Cate Street owed Millinocket more than $2 million in taxes, compounding a fiscal crisis that already threatens to shut the library for good.\u201cWe took a huge cut this year, and I\u2019m told next year we\u2019re going to close,\u201d said Lori Fitzgerald, 55, the head librarian. She took out a brochure that laid out the library\u2019s services, with rainbow lettering. \u201cI just did this trying to save the library,\u201d she said, ruefully. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to do any good.\u201dAlexandra Ritchie, a spokeswoman for Cate Street, confirmed that enough money had been raised to cover the company\u2019s debt, but it has since fallen behind on its payment schedule, and the town government recently met with its lawyer about the matter. The company intends to use part of the old paper mill to open a wood pellet plant, which would create 55 jobs.It is difficult for many of the third- and fourth-generation millworkers who live here to conceive of a promising future without the paper mill. \u201cIt represented prosperity, hope \u2014 and it\u2019s hard for people to transition from that,\u201d said Georgia Manzo, 57, the secretary of the Katahdin Area Chamber of Commerce, who grew up here. \u201cWe have to pursue diversity in how we make a living up here.\u201dAdvertisement"}

What\u2019s needed to confront its nihilistic vision and genocidal agenda is a global coalition using political, humanitarian, economic, law enforcement and intelligence tools to support military force.In addition to its beheadings, crucifixions and other acts of sheer evil, which have killed thousands of innocents in Syria, Iraq and Lebanon, including Sunni Muslims whose faith it purports to represent, ISIS (which the United States government calls ISIL, or the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant) poses a threat well beyond the region.There is evidence that these extremists, if left unchecked, will not be satisfied at stopping with Syria and Iraq. They are larger and better funded in this new incarnation, using pirated oil, kidnapping and extortion to finance operations in Syria and Iraq. They are equipped with sophisticated heavy weapons looted from the battlefield. They have already demonstrated the ability to seize and hold more territory than any other terrorist organization, in a strategic region that borders Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey and is perilously close to Israel.With a united response led by the United States and the broadest possible coalition of nations, the cancer of ISIS will not be allowed to spread to other countries. The world can confront this scourge, and ultimately defeat it. ISIS is odious, but not omnipotent. We have proof already in northern Iraq, where United States airstrikes have shifted the momentum of the fight, providing space for Iraqi and Kurdish forces to go on the offensive. With our support, Iraqi leaders are coming together to form a new, inclusive government that is essential to isolating ISIS and securing the support of all of Iraq\u2019s communities.Airstrikes alone won\u2019t defeat this enemy. A much fuller response is demanded from the world. We need to support Iraqi forces and the moderate Syrian opposition, who are facing ISIS on the front lines. We need to disrupt and degrade ISIS\u2019 capabilities and counter its extremist message in the media. And we need to strengthen our own defenses and cooperation in protecting our people.In this battle, there is a role for almost every country. Some will provide military assistance, direct and indirect. Some will provide desperately needed humanitarian assistance for the millions who have been displaced and victimized across the region. Others will help restore not just shattered economies but broken trust among neighbors. This effort is underway in Iraq, where other countries have joined us in providing humanitarian aid, military assistance and support for an inclusive government.Already our efforts have brought dozens of nations to this cause. Certainly there are different interests at play. But no decent country can support the horrors perpetrated by ISIS, and no civilized country should shirk its responsibility to help stamp out this disease.ISIS\u2019 abhorrent tactics are uniting and rallying neighbors with traditionally conflicting interests to support Iraq\u2019s new government. And over time, this coalition can begin to address the underlying factors that fuel ISIS and other terrorist organizations with like-minded agendas.Coalition building is hard work, but it is the best way to tackle a common enemy. When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990, the first President George Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III did not act alone or in haste. They methodically assembled a coalition of countries whose concerted action brought a quick victory.Extremists are defeated only when responsible nations and their peoples unite to oppose them.Advertisement"}

The country\u2019s leaders and citizens obviously need to join in common cause to put the country on a steadier course.It would further polarize society, weaken the fragile democratic institutions and strengthen a powerful military, which says it wants to be out of politics but has regularly staged coups and otherwise sought to control civilian governments for three decades. Mr. Sharif came to office in a parliamentary election 15 months ago, the first peaceful, democratic transition of power between civilian leaders in the country\u2019s history. It was a hopeful moment; some 60 percent of voters turned out, and most people seemed willing to accept his victory.

He has also named cronies to high posts. But forcing him out now and in this way is not the answer. A smarter approach is to make democratic processes work through reforms to prevent electoral fraud and rampant cronyism. It will also require negotiation and compromise. The United States, preoccupied with crises elsewhere, has shown little urgency in trying to calm the situation, even though Pakistan\u2019s stability is crucial to regional order \u2014 especially as American troops withdraw from Afghanistan.

{"Headline": "Dethrone \u2018King Dollar\u2019", "Date": "2014-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 THERE are few truisms about the world economy, but for decades, one has been the role of the United States dollar as the world\u2019s reserve currency. It\u2019s a core principle of American economic policy. After all, who wouldn\u2019t want their currency to be the one that foreign banks and governments want to hold in reserve?But new research reveals that what was once a privilege is now a burden, undermining job growth, pumping up budget and trade deficits and inflating financial bubbles. To get the American economy on track, the government needs to drop its commitment to maintaining the dollar\u2019s reserve-currency status.The reasons are best articulated by Kenneth Austin, a Treasury Department economist, in the latest issue of The Journal of Post Keynesian Economics (needless to say, it\u2019s his opinion, not necessarily the department\u2019s). On the assumption that you don\u2019t have the journal on your coffee table, allow me to summarize. It is widely recognized that various countries, including China, Singapore and South Korea, suppress the value of their currency relative to the dollar to boost their exports to the United States and reduce its exports to them. They buy lots of dollars, which increases the dollar\u2019s value relative to their own currencies, thus making their exports to us cheaper and our exports to them more expensive. In 2013, America\u2019s trade deficit was about $475 billion. Its deficit with China alone was $318 billion. Though Mr. Austin doesn\u2019t say it explicitly, his work shows that, far from being a victim of managed trade, the United States is a willing participant through its efforts to keep the dollar as the world\u2019s most prominent reserve currency. When a country wants to boost its exports by making them cheaper using the aforementioned process, its central bank accumulates currency from countries that issue reserves. To support this process, these countries suppress their consumption and boost their national savings. Since global accounts must balance, when \u201ccurrency accumulators\u201d save more and consume less than they produce, other countries \u2014 \u201ccurrency issuers,\u201d like the United States \u2014 must save less and consume more than they produce (i.e., run trade deficits).This means that Americans alone do not determine their rates of savings and consumption. Think of an open, global economy as having one huge, aggregated amount of income that must all be consumed, saved or invested. That means individual countries must adjust to one another. If trade-surplus countries suppress their own consumption and use their excess savings to accumulate dollars, trade-deficit countries must absorb those excess savings to finance their excess consumption or investment.Note that as long as the dollar is the reserve currency, America\u2019s trade deficit can worsen even when we\u2019re not directly in on the trade. Suppose South Korea runs a surplus with Brazil. By storing its surplus export revenues in Treasury bonds, South Korea nudges up the relative value of the dollar against our competitors\u2019 currencies, and our trade deficit increases, even though the original transaction had nothing to do with the United States.A result of this dance, as seen throughout the tepid recovery from the Great Recession, is insufficient domestic demand in America\u2019s own labor market. Mr. Austin argues convincingly that the correct metric for estimating the cost in jobs is the dollar value of reserve sales to foreign buyers. By his estimation, that amounted to six million jobs in 2008, and these would tend to be the sort of high-wage manufacturing jobs that are most vulnerable to changes in exports. Dethroning \u201cking dollar\u201d would be easier than people think. America could, for example, enforce rules to prevent other countries from accumulating too much of our currency. In fact, others do just that precisely to avoid exporting jobs. The most recent example is Japan\u2019s intervention to hold down the value of the yen when central banks in Asia and Latin America started buying Japanese debt. Of course, if fewer people demanded dollars, interest rates \u2014 i.e., what America would pay people to hold its debt \u2014 might rise, especially if stronger domestic manufacturers demanded more investment. But there\u2019s no clear empirical, negative relationship between interest rates and trade deficits, and in the long run, as Mr. Pettis observes, \u201cCountries with balanced trade or trade surpluses tend to enjoy lower interest rates on average than countries with large current account deficits, which are handicapped by slower growth and higher debt.\u201d Others worry that higher import prices would increase inflation. But consider the results when we \u201cpay\u201d to keep price growth so low through artificially cheap exports and large trade deficits: weakened manufacturing, wage stagnation (even with low inflation) and deficits and bubbles to offset the imbalanced trade.But while more balanced trade might raise prices, there\u2019s no reason it should persistently increase the inflation rate. We might settle into a norm of 2 to 3 percent inflation, versus the current 1 to 2 percent. But that\u2019s a price worth paying for more and higher-quality jobs, more stable recoveries and a revitalized manufacturing sector. The privilege of having the world\u2019s reserve currency is one America can no longer afford.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo Patriarch Humbled Amid Bailout", "Date": "2014-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn 2011, just before entering into bailout discussions with creditors, Portugal\u2019s prime minister put in a call to consult with the country\u2019s most powerful banker, Ricardo Esp\u00edrito Santo Silva Salgado.But now the bank that Mr. Salgado and his family controlled for the better part of a century, Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo, is itself being bailed out in a humiliating intervention that highlights the extent to which age-old banking cliques continue to plague Europe\u2019s weaker economies like Portugal, Greece and Ireland.\u201cAll these countries share the same weakness: lack of effective regulation at the local level,\u201d said Peter Dalianes, a financial consultant based in Athens. \u201cNobody knows who is in cahoots with who.\u201dFew, it seems, were as connected as Mr. Salgado, widely known in Portugal as \u201cDono disto todo,\u201d or the owner of everything. But for all his prominence in Lisbon and elsewhere, the family patriarch Mr. Salgado, along with some of his relatives, faces not only financial problems but also legal ones. Portuguese and European prosecutors and regulators are investigating possible accounting fraud, abuse of privileged information and accusations that the bank funneled dubious loans to parts of the Esp\u00edrito Santo business empire, which includes hotels, hospitals, farms and more.In Portugal, the Esp\u00edrito Santo name, or Holy Spirit in Portuguese, carries with it a near religious aura, similar in many ways to the now-fading cachet of the Rockefeller family in the United States and the Rothschild name in Europe. Like those business empires, generations of family members kept a tight grip on the operations, accepting outside investors, but ceding little management control.The Esp\u00edrito Santo family owns a controlling stake in the bank. Mr. Salgado, who is 70, is a great-grandson of Jos\u00e9 Maria do Esp\u00edrito Santo e Silva, who started the family business in 1869 as a \u201ccasa de c\u00e2mbio,\u201d or exchange house, on a small Lisbon street.On Sunday night, Portuguese and European officials stepped in with a rescue package of 4.9 billion euros ($6.6 billion), after the bank reported a \u20ac3.58 billion loss last week. The swift intervention, quarantining the bank\u2019s problem assets and inflicting much of the financial pain on shareholders and some creditors, helped calm markets, which were briefly rattled last week. But experts remain wary of the ability of Europe\u2019s banking regulators to deal with larger, more systemic problems.\u201cIt\u2019s good that they\u2019ve dealt with this expeditiously,\u201d Nicholas Spiro, managing director of Spiro Sovereign Strategy in London, said of the rescue. \u201cBut essentially, once more it is a state-sponsored bailout, which is precisely what eurozone leaders were trying to avoid.\u201d There have been varying factors at work in the economic implosions in Greece, Portugal, Cyprus, Ireland and Spain, and experts have highlighted a financial thread common to all these countries: cozy, lightly regulated banking systems that made billions of euros of questionable loans to businesses in which the banks and their top executives had overt or covert relationships. Many of these banks have either collapsed or been wound down since the financial crisis hit Europe in 2010, but in Portugal and Greece, management of the top banking groups remained largely in place.Mr. Salgado, however, could no longer hold on. Having already resigned his chairmanship of the bank, Mr. Salgado was detained by police on July 24 at his home in Cascais, a picturesque oceanfront town on the outskirts of Lisbon, to appear before a judge leading a tax-evasion and money-laundering investigation. He asked to drive himself to court, but the police officers rejected his request. Some hours later, he was released after posting bail of \u20ac3 million, but was ordered to remain in Portugal.Mr. Salgado declined to comment for this article, but in a brief statement to the Portuguese media, he said that he would wait for the results of an audit by the central bank of Portugal before publicly discussing the crisis at this bank.Maria Jo\u00e3o Babo, co-author of a recent book on Mr. Salgado, called \u201cO \u00daltimo Banqueiro\u201d (\u201cThe Last Banker\u201d), described Mr. Salgado as \u201ca cold and calculating person,\u201d who maintained a strong influence not only on Portugal\u2019s economic affairs but also its politics. In an interview, she cited the prebailout briefing in 2011 as an example.During the bailout of the government\u2019s finances, Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo was the only major listed bank in Portugal that did not request any rescue financing. At the time, this was seen as a sign of strength. Now, it has raised suspicions about whether there was something to hide.Despite his high profile, Mr. Salgado has always been more comfortable striking deals in the back room than parading among Portugal\u2019s social elite. One relative of the family described Mr. Salgado as \u201cshy\u201d and a poor communicator, speculating that his personality traits might have stemmed from a struggle to cope with the early divorce of his parents at a time when divorce was extremely rare in Catholic Portugal.\u201cI think being shy made him initially appear rude and distant, but with time he has managed to become more accessible,\u201d said the relative, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the situation.Ms. Babo, the author, highlighted Mr. Salgado\u2019s reputation as a workaholic.Mr. Salgado, asked this year in a rare interview with the newspaper Di\u00e1rio de Not\u00edcias how he spent his time, replied that \u201cmy life begins at 8:30 a.m. in the bank and ends at 10 p.m. in the bank.\u201dThe family fortune grew substantially in the early 20th century under the founder\u2019s sons, Ricardo and Manuel, who were gifted networkers, establishing ties with the scions of American industry, including the Firestones and the Rockefellers. By the mid-1930s, Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo was the largest private lender in Portugal.The family\u2019s status at the top tier of European finance took on an even greater dimension during World War II, which brought disaster to most of Europe but turned Portugal into a diplomatic and aristocratic hub. As a neutral nation, Portugal was a haven for exiled royals and politicians, powerful families like the Rothschilds fleeing Nazism, as well as a hotbed of undercover diplomacy.Juan Carlos, the future king of Spain, spent several years with his exiled family in Estoril, a casino town next to Cascais. After the toppling of the Portuguese dictatorship in 1974, under which the Esp\u00edrito Santos had thrived, Mr. Salgado, who was born in 1944, was too junior a banking director to join some of the more senior family members in prison after the confiscation of Esp\u00edrito Santo assets. Upon their release, family executives eventually joined others in the clan already in exile across Europe and other parts of the world.Overseas, they started to rebuild their businesses, thanks to credit lines from banks but also from other powerful families, like the Agnellis, owners of Fiat, and the Rockefellers. Mr. Salgado eventually took charge of the overseas businesses, having spent most of the family\u2019s exile years in Brazil and Switzerland. In 1989, Portugal started to privatize assets that had been seized in the revolution, giving Mr. Salgado and his family an opportunity to buy back their bank with the support of France\u2019s Cr\u00e9dit Agricole.He took control of a bank less powerful than it was before the 1974 revolution, with a domestic market share of 8 percent in 1992. He gradually expanded its reach, bringing it back to the top, thanks in part to forays overseas. He added private banking offshoots in Geneva and Miami and a subsidiary in oil-rich Angola, a former Portuguese colony.Business historians point to the ability of the Esp\u00edrito Santo family to overcome more than a century of family feuds and keep the empire intact. But Mr. Salgado\u2019s maneuvering to emerge victorious in the latest boardroom spat may well have pushed the bank over the edge, analysts say. Late last year, with concerns mounting over the bank\u2019s exposure to struggling group companies, Mr. Salgado\u2019s leadership at the bank was challenged by one of his cousins and fellow bankers, Jos\u00e9 Maria Esp\u00edrito Santo Silva Ricciardi.Mr. Ricciardi forced a vote of no confidence against Mr. Salgado last November. But with his own father and family patriarch Antonio Ricciardi supporting Mr. Salgado, he failed to unseat Mr. Salgado. But in the end, Mr. Salgado couldn\u2019t escape the ruin.Jack Ewing contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "2 Hawaii Democrats Face Tough Primary Challenges", "Date": "2014-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONOLULU \u2014 With two hurricanes bearing down toward his state, Gov. Neil Abercrombie refused to discuss this weekend\u2019s Democratic primary election in which he is fighting to preserve his political life.\u201cI took off my campaign hat some time ago,\u201d he said at a news conference on Friday.In this heavily Democratic state, two of the party\u2019s marquee officeholders, Mr. Abercrombie and Senator Brian Schatz, are facing tough challenges in their bids to advance to the general election. And though polling here is notoriously fickle, just about every political pundit in Hawaii agrees on one thing: Mr. Abercrombie is in trouble.On first glance, Mr. Abercrombie should be in good shape. The Hawaiian economy is growing, Unemployment here is low and dropping. And he has enjoyed enormous advantages in fund-raising and name recognition over his rival, David Ige, a state senator.But Mr. Abercrombie, who has held elected office in Hawaii for nearly four decades, has trailed in almost every recent poll.A brash, tell-it-like-it-is style had served Mr. Abercrombie well for decades, including 20 years in Washington as a member of the House of Representatives, Mr. Milner said. But he said that during Mr. Abercrombie\u2019s four years as governor, that style \u201chas somehow turned against him.\u201d\u201cPeople used to complain that he had a big mouth, but they\u2019d vote for him for Congress,\u201d he said.Mr. Ige, by his own account, has focused his campaign on building his name recognition. Some of the distinctions he has drawn between himself and the governor are based as much on style as on policy.\u201cWe have heard loud and clear that voters felt disconnected from government and that government had stopped listening,\u201d he said in an interview Friday. \u201cI\u2019m an engineer by profession, so I listen more than I speak.\u201dMr. Abercrombie is bolstered by strong support from the Democratic Party establishment, including President Obama, who recorded an automated call for the governor that went out to voters. (\u201cI\u2019m asking you to support my friend, Gov. Neil Abercrombie,\u201d the president said in the recording. \u201cHe\u2019s taken action to turn Hawaii around.\u201d)\u201cAll of us in the campaign, from the governor to our volunteers in the field, are confident we\u2019ll advance through the primary,\u201d Shane Peters, a spokesman for the governor\u2019s campaign, said in an email. \u201cLike nearly every other re-election bid by previous Hawaii governors, we expect it will be close.\u201dJosh Green, a Democratic state senator who has not endorsed either candidate, said that Mr. Abercrombie may also benefit slightly from the storms. The second storm, Hurricane Julio, was approaching the island on Saturday, but it is not expected to hit Hawaii directly, and its effects may not come until Sunday.\u201cWith the number of traditional endorsements he got, which helps get out the vote, I think more of the early voters favored him,\u201d Mr. Green said. \u201cSome people could have trouble getting to the polls.\u201dEarly and mail-in voting accounted for almost half of the primary turnout in 2012.The first storm, Iselle, also gave Mr. Abercrombie the chance to perform as a leader responding to a crisis.\u201cBut I don\u2019t think it will be enough for him,\u201d Mr. Green said.At the very least, the storm has interrupted the usual get-out-the-vote activities \u2014 except for the television ads, which played nonstop during the storm.Mr. Abercrombie was hardly the only candidate to curtail campaign activities as Iselle closed in. Mr. Ige canceled phone banks and rallies. Mr. Schatz did the same. Colleen Hanabusa, a congresswoman challenging Mr. Schatz in the Senate race, went so far as to email her supporters, asking them to take down yard signs, lest a flying Hanabusa sign injure someone.\u201cWe didn\u2019t want anything to become a projectile,\u201d Ms. Hanabusa said.The race between Mr. Schatz and Ms. Hanabusa is seen as so close that almost any fluctuation in turnout \u2014 whether caused by the storm or anything else \u2014 could prove decisive. Democrats are almost certain to retain the seat, irrespective of who wins.Like Mr. Abercrombie, Mr. Schatz, as the incumbent, has enjoyed a financial advantage and support from powerful Democrats in Washington, including President Obama.He has built a progressive record for himself during his 18 months in Congress, and has worked to present himself as the better long-term option for the state, irrespective of how he initially got the job.\u201cHe tries to come off as being the most progressive candidate,\u201d Mr. Milner said, including going after Ms. Hanabusa on Social Security, an issue important to the large block of senior voters here. \u201cWhat he\u2019s been able to do is build up a semi-incumbency, whereas normally candidates who have been appointed get no bump in their first election.\u201dMs. Hanabusa, meanwhile, enjoys great support from Japanese-Americans, in part because of Mr. Inouye\u2019s endorsement.She has emphasized her long experience in Congress, and her Hawaiian roots (though Mr. Schatz also grew up in Hawaii). Her ads describe her childhood in rural Oahu, where her parents ran a gas station, and they are dotted with Hawaiian words.\u201cThey have been able to outraise and outspend us, though a lot of the money comes from the mainland,\u201d she said of Mr. Schatz in an interview Friday. \u201cI think tomorrow is going to be a statement about who really votes in Hawaii.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Herm\u00e8s Posts Rise in Profit, Despite Slowing Sales in China", "Date": "2014-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 The French luxury group Herm\u00e8s International said on Friday its profit rose 8 percent for the first six months of 2014, despite signs of slowing sales growth for high-end goods in China.Herm\u00e8s, along with other purveyors of high-end fashion and luxury goods, like Burberry of Britain and Richemont, the Swiss conglomerate that owns Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels, have begun to feel the pinch of a slowdown in spending on luxury goods in mainland China, one of the world\u2019s largest markets for such goods, as the government in Beijing has cracked down on lavish gift-giving.Herm\u00e8s\u2019s larger French rivals, LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton and Kering, whose brands include Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent, have also reported weaker sales growth in China.The consulting firm Bain & Company estimates that Chinese demand for luxury goods will grow no more than 4 percent this year from 2013, in line with expectations for Europe, which continues to struggle to emerge from the recent economic crisis. In China and Europe, growth is expected to be slower than in North America. That is in sharp contrast to the high double-digit growth in China in previous years.Luxury spending by the Chinese abroad, while still representing the bulk of Chinese luxury consumption, has also begun to moderate this year. Spending by Chinese tourists on high-end goods grew 9 percent in the second quarter from the level of a year earlier, according to Global Blue, a tax refund company in Geneva that tracks luxury purchases. That is well below the annual growth rates of 30 to 50 percent in recent years.The slowdown in Chinese sales comes as Herm\u00e8s looks to bolster its presence in China with the opening of a new Herm\u00e8s Maison flagship in Shanghai in September, followed later this year by a new store in Beijing and the opening of a larger outlet in a new location in Chengdu. Herm\u00e8s already has more than a dozen stores in mainland China, as well as locations in Hong Kong and Macau.The company did not break out financial results for the second quarter. But the 8 percent rise in first-half revenue reflects a sharp slowdown from the first three months of the year, when sales rose nearly 15 percent. In the first half of 2013, net profit rose 14 percent, and sales 11 percent.Herm\u00e8s said revenue growth in the first half was driven mainly by a 16 percent increase in sales in its ready-to-wear clothing and in fashion accessories. Sales of leather goods rose 13 percent, bolstered by an increase in the output of the company\u2019s coveted handbags as a result of the addition of two new production sites that opened in France in 2012.Watches were among the hardest-hit divisions in the first half, dropping 7 percent, mainly because of the sharp decline in gift giving in China.In addition to the moderation of luxury spending by Chinese tourists, analysts are also keeping a close eye on the impact of the crisis in eastern Ukraine. The United States and the European Union have imposed sanctions on Russia as a result of its policy toward Ukraine and pro-Russian separatists there.The tensions, along with a weakening Russian economy since last year, have already begun to curtail travel abroad by wealthy Russians, who have traditionally been big spenders on luxury goods in Europe. According to Global Blue, duty-free spending by Russian tourists fell 18 percent in the three months that ended June 30.At a briefing with analysts in Paris, Axel Dumas, the chief executive of Herm\u00e8s, said there were signs that the company\u2019s Russian clientele was \u201cbuying more at home\u201d this year, but that the effect on overall sales had so far been modest. \u201cFor now, we don\u2019t see a significant impact for the remainder of this year,\u201d Mr. Dumas said.Herm\u00e8s said it was maintaining its forecast of 10 percent sales growth for the full year in 2014, but cautioned that the impact of a weaker dollar and Japanese yen would most likely mean a slightly lower operating margin than in 2013, when it was 32 percent of sales.Herm\u00e8s manufactures the vast majority of its products in Europe, but the region accounts for only one-third of its sales, making the group\u2019s results highly sensitive to fluctuations in exchange rates.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where Artisans Meet Fashion", "Date": "2014-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn a recent overcast Saturday morning, an eclectic group convened in an unassuming office near Bryant Park within walking distance of the United Nations. There was Kythzia Barrera, 39, from Oaxaca, Mexico, in a gauzy tunic and sandals, resembling nothing so much as an Instagram snapshot taken at a cafe on a south-of-the-border vacation. And Jitendra Kumar, 30, from Varanasi, India, serious and focused, wearing formal leather lace-ups and carrying swatches of hand-loomed fabric. With him was Sara Otto, also 30, an American former Peace Corps member now living in India; she looked like a youthful backpacker, with an earring through one nostril. Meanwhile, Petra Fitzgerald, 40, who is British but lives in Nairobi, Kenya, looked more like a New Yorker doing weekend errands than someone who had flown more than 7,000 miles to attend, in a T-shirt and jeans.While more than half of the two dozen or so people were in New York for the first time, they were not here to ogle the Statue of Liberty but to get a crash course in the American fashion industry. They were also trying to develop a path of communication, the better to bridge their cultures and Seventh Avenue.They had been gathered together by Nest, an organization that acts as a matchmaker between artisans and companies in the fashion and home furnishings fields. Nest then oversees those business relationships, offering advice, training and often equipment like computers or looms. In the mix at the meeting were artisans, their representatives and Nest employees living abroad, like Ms. Otto and Ms. Fitzgerald. Some participants, like Komarudin Kudiya from West Java, Indonesia, specialize in a skill passed down for generations (in his case, batik fabric making); others, like Swaziland-based Philippa Thorne, have relocated from countries like England to oversee indigenous craft artists (like her colleague Zinhle Vilataki, who accompanied her) and the production and sales of their wares. \u201cNest brought together these artisans because they share the same challenges,\u201d said Rebecca van Bergen, 32, the organization\u2019s founder. \u201cOne of the largest is, How do you take largely home workers who have produced for local markets with different standards of quality, and translate that to a fashion industry, particularly a luxury fashion industry, that has very stringent requirements in terms of quality and replicability?\u201dAnswering the question is increasingly important as \u201cartisan\u201d has become a fashionable word, adding perceived value, both moral and aesthetic, to established brands. Over the last few years, designer labels like Vivienne Westwood, Stella McCartney and Marni have worked with indigenous craft artists, raising the style stakes for items obtained from them. As the appeal of such products grows, their manufacturing remains challenging; fashion companies are accustomed to the reliability of factory-made goods and usually do not have to deal with obstacles like a monsoon season. \u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018How do you make artisans work with luxury fashion in Europe and New York?\u2019 it\u2019s \u2018How do you make it work for both parties?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ms. van Bergen said. To address the issue, Nest created what it dubbed its Artisan Summit, bringing employees from American brands like Public School, Nanette Lepore and West Elm to the Nest offices to offer guidance in everything from production to accounting.Like an actual school, there was a field trip: a visit to ABC Carpet & Home, the Flatiron store that sells products like beaded necklaces from Nepal and Tunisian fouta towels. \u201cMy team were fascinated,\u201d said LanVy Nguyen, who works with craft workers in Hue, Vietnam, and who arrived with two colleagues. To them, she said, the class demonstrated, \u201cWow, out of some mountainous region we can be in one of the biggest markets in the world.\u201dThe buoyant Ms. van Bergen, who brings to mind Sally Field in the 1960s television show \u201cGidget,\u201d founded Nest in 2006. After earning a master\u2019s degree in social work from Washington University in her hometown, St. Louis, she entered a contest to create the business plan for a start-up company; her concept for Nest won the $25,000 grand prize. The organization began by microbartering \u2014 lending artisans money to produce goods, then selling the products to recoup those loans \u2014 but eventually eliminated sales to become a nonprofit. It has been involved in the production of Trina Turk glass-beaded necklaces in Tiruchirappalli, India; nubby cotton separates in Nairobi for the Elder Statesman; and handwoven Ikat FEED tote bags in Guatemala City. Nest has also worked since 2011 with Maiyet, a New York firm with artisan alliances whose clothing and accessories are sold at stores like Barneys New York and Galeries Lafayette. On the summit\u2019s final two days, Nest set up a makeshift showroom at the Hotel Americano in Chelsea, its product-laden tables resembling a church fair. Representatives from brands like Sophie Theallet, Rag & Bone and Calypso St. Barth took a look. At the end of the trip, a 50-person fund-raising dinner was held at the hotel. At one long table, the interior designer Tamara Magel chatted with Ms. Thorne about making custom place mats to sell on Ms. Magel\u2019s website, and with Ms. Barrera from Mexico about shipping costs; at another, Meredith Melling, a fashion consultant, was in deep conversation with a representative from the Clinton Global Initiative. The evening prompted one donor to sign up for a fund-raising trip to Swaziland in the fall.\u201cIt\u2019s strange and surreal,\u201d Ms. van Bergen said of moving between the worlds of developing economies and urban fashion. \u201cI was a social worker. I never imagined being a consumer of luxury fashion. To see the process from design to rack, I mean, it\u2019s art. Honestly, it\u2019s given me a whole new respect for it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ukraine Crisis Takes Toll on Germany\u2019s Economy, Powerhouse of the Eurozone", "Date": "2014-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 An important reading on the health of the eurozone economy is expected to show this week that growth stagnated in the most recent quarter as German output faltered, confirming the assessment of many analysts that a lasting recovery remains out of reach for the region.Economists are expecting that in the 18-nation currency bloc, gross domestic product expanded 0.1 percent in the second quarter compared with the first quarter, equivalent to an annual rate of growth of 0.4 percent. The eurozone eked out quarterly growth of 0.2 percent in the first three months of the year.The eurozone G.D.P. report, to be released Thursday by the European Union statistical agency, Eurostat, is based on data from before the latest tensions over Ukraine, and before the sanctions against Russia for its involvement in the crisis began to be felt. That means there are plenty of questions hanging over the second half of the year.Most worrying are the indications that Germany is beginning to struggle, including a steep drop in economic sentiment reported on Tuesday. Germany, which accounts for more than one-fourth of the overall eurozone economy, had been propping up the rest of the area for much of the last few years.On Tuesday, a report from the ZEW economic research institute in Mannheim, Germany, showed German economic sentiment fell this month to the lowest level since December 2012. The drop, the report said, \u201cis likely connected to the ongoing geopolitical tensions that have affected the German economy.\u201dThe gloomy sentiment in Germany is a \u201csignal that the growth performance in the second quarter could suddenly morph from a one-off into an undesired trend,\u201d said Carsten Brzeski, an economist with ING Group in Brussels.A further slowing in Europe would have serious implications for the rest of the world amid concerns about the United States economy, which began 2014 with a rocky start before posting modest growth, and Japan, which is thought to have contracted sharply in the second quarter.Stanley Fischer, the Federal Reserve vice chairman, told a conference in Stockholm on Monday that the European slowdown had been an important factor holding back growth in the United States.Still, he estimated that German growth was flat in the second quarter, taking a more optimistic line than many others, who predicted a slight contraction. Besides the geopolitical strains, Germany\u2019s weakness resulted from damp demand from eurozone trading partners and one-time factors including statistical distortions caused by unusually mild weather in the first quarter, he said.\u201cUp to now, the fallout of the Ukraine crisis has been limited to a general return of uncertainty and a sharp drop in German exports to Russia,\u201d Mr. Brzeski said. \u201cObviously, a further escalation of the crisis could start to really hurt the economy. This is why strengthening domestic demand, particularly domestic investment, should continue to be a top priority for all policy makers.\u201dAnalysts at Natixis, a French bank, estimated that a 30 percent drop in exports to Russia this year would shave \u201ca modest 0.3 percentage points\u201d from Germany\u2019s economic growth.Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, acknowledged last week that the economic tensions from the Ukraine crisis would \u201chave a greater impact on the euro area than they have on other parts of the world.\u201dSigns have been accumulating for months that, despite modest upticks in some countries, including some of the hard-hit \u201cperipheral\u201d euro members, demand is simply insufficient to generate a self-sustaining expansion.Stronger growth could help to solve one of Mr. Draghi\u2019s most pressing problems, the danger that the eurozone \u2014 where consumer prices are rising at a paltry 0.4 percent annual rate \u2014 will slip into an economically damaging downward spiral in prices.The central bank\u2019s latest forecasts show the eurozone economy growing just 1 percent this year, and reaching 1.8 percent in 2016.A healthier eurozone depends in large part on households and businesses chipping away at an overhang of debt that is curtailing spending, Marie Diron, an economist with Moody\u2019s Macro Financial Analysis, wrote in a report.\u201cOver all,\u201d she said, \u201cthe most likely scenario for the euro area remains one of positive but subdued growth.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama on the World", "Date": "2014-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Obama\u2019s hair is definitely grayer these days, and no doubt trying to manage foreign policy in a world of increasing disorder accounts for at least half of those gray hairs. (The Tea Party can claim the other half.) But having had a chance to spend an hour touring the horizon with him in the White House Map Room late Friday afternoon, it\u2019s clear that the president has a take on the world, born of many lessons over the last six years, and he has feisty answers for all his foreign policy critics.Obama made clear that he is only going to involve America more deeply in places like the Middle East to the extent that the different communities there agree to an inclusive politics of no victor/no vanquished. The United States is not going to be the air force of Iraqi Shiites or any other faction. Despite Western sanctions, he cautioned, President Vladimir Putin of Russia \u201ccould invade\u201d Ukraine at any time, and, if he does, \u201ctrying to find our way back to a cooperative functioning relationship with Russia during the remainder of my term will be much more difficult.\u201d Intervening in Libya to prevent a massacre was the right thing to do, Obama argued, but doing it without sufficient follow-up on the ground to manage Libya\u2019s transition to more democratic politics is probably his biggest foreign policy regret.At the end of the day, the president mused, the biggest threat to America \u2014 the only force that can really weaken us \u2014 is us. We have so many things going for us right now as a country \u2014 from new energy resources to innovation to a growing economy \u2014 but, he said, we will never realize our full potential unless our two parties adopt the same outlook that we\u2019re asking of Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds or Israelis and Palestinians: No victor, no vanquished and work together.\u201cOur politics are dysfunctional,\u201d said the president, and we should heed the terrible divisions in the Middle East as a \u201cwarning to us: societies don\u2019t work if political factions take maximalist positions. And the more diverse the country is, the less it can afford to take maximalist positions.\u201dWhile he blamed the rise of the Republican far right for extinguishing so many potential compromises, Obama also acknowledged that gerrymandering, the Balkanization of the news media and uncontrolled money in politics \u2014 the guts of our political system today \u2014 are sapping our ability to face big challenges together, more than any foreign enemy. \u201cIncreasingly politicians are rewarded for taking the most extreme maximalist positions,\u201d he said, \u201cand sooner or later, that catches up with you.\u201dI began by asking whether if former Secretary of State Dean Acheson was \u201cpresent at the creation\u201d of the post-World War II order, as he once wrote, did Obama feel present at the \u201cdisintegration?\u201d\u201cFirst of all, I think you can\u2019t generalize across the globe because there are a bunch of places where good news keeps coming.\u201d Look at Asia, he said, countries like Indonesia, and many countries in Latin America, like Chile. \u201cBut I do believe,\u201d he added, \u201cthat what we\u2019re seeing in the Middle East and parts of North Africa is an order that dates back to World War I starting to buckle.\u201dBut wouldn\u2019t things be better had we armed the secular Syrian rebels early or kept U.S. troops in Iraq? The fact is, said the president, in Iraq a residual U.S. troop presence would never have been needed had the Shiite majority there not \u201csquandered an opportunity\u201d to share power with Sunnis and Kurds. \u201cHad the Shia majority seized the opportunity to reach out to the Sunnis and the Kurds in a more effective way, [and not] passed legislation like de-Baathification,\u201d no outside troops would have been necessary. Absent their will to do that, our troops sooner or later would have been caught in the crossfire, he argued.With \u201crespect to Syria,\u201d said the president, the notion that arming the rebels would have made a difference has \u201calways been a fantasy. This idea that we could provide some light arms or even more sophisticated arms to what was essentially an opposition made up of former doctors, farmers, pharmacists and so forth, and that they were going to be able to battle not only a well-armed state but also a well-armed state backed by Russia, backed by Iran, a battle-hardened Hezbollah, that was never in the cards.\u201dEven now, the president said, the administration has difficulty finding, training and arming a sufficient cadre of secular Syrian rebels: \u201cThere\u2019s not as much capacity as you would hope.\u201dThe \u201cbroader point we need to stay focused on,\u201d he added, \u201cis what we have is a disaffected Sunni minority in the case of Iraq, a majority in the case of Syria, stretching from essentially Baghdad to Damascus. ... Unless we can give them a formula that speaks to the aspirations of that population, we are inevitably going to have problems. ... Unfortunately, there was a period of time where the Shia majority in Iraq didn\u2019t fully understand that. They\u2019re starting to understand it now. Unfortunately, we still have ISIL [the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant], which has, I think, very little appeal to ordinary Sunnis.\u201d But \u201cthey\u2019re filling a vacuum, and the question for us has to be not simply how we counteract them militarily but how are we going to speak to a Sunni majority in that area ... that, right now, is detached from the global economy.\u201dIs Iran being helpful? \u201cI think what the Iranians have done,\u201d said the president, \u201cis to finally realize that a maximalist position by the Shias inside of Iraq is, over the long term, going to fail. And that\u2019s, by the way, a broader lesson for every country: You want 100 percent, and the notion that the winner really does take all, all the spoils. Sooner or later that government\u2019s going to break down.\u201dThe only states doing well, like Tunisia, I\u2019ve argued, have done so because their factions adopted the principle of no victor, no vanquished. Once they did, they didn\u2019t need outside help.\u201cWe cannot do for them what they are unwilling to do for themselves,\u201d said the president of the factions in Iraq. \u201cOur military is so capable, that if we put everything we have into it, we can keep a lid on a problem for a time. But for a society to function long term, the people themselves have to make decisions about how they are going to live together, how they are going to accommodate each other\u2019s interests, how they are going to compromise. When it comes to things like corruption, the people and their leaders have to hold themselves accountable for changing those cultures.... ... We can help them and partner with them every step of the way. But we can\u2019t do it for them.\u201dSo, I asked, explain your decision to use military force to protect the refugees from ISIL (which is also known as ISIS) and Kurdistan, which is an island of real decency in Iraq?\u201cWhen you have a unique circumstance in which genocide is threatened, and a country is willing to have us in there, you have a strong international consensus that these people need to be protected and we have a capacity to do so, then we have an obligation to do so,\u201d said the president. But given the island of decency the Kurds have built, we also have to ask, he added, not just \u201chow do we push back on ISIL, but also how do we preserve the space for the best impulses inside of Iraq, that very much is on my mind, that has been on my mind throughout.\u201cI do think the Kurds used that time that was given by our troop sacrifices in Iraq,\u201d Obama added. \u201cThey used that time well, and the Kurdish region is functional the way we would like to see. It is tolerant of other sects and other religions in a way that we would like to see elsewhere. So we do think it\u2019s important to make sure that that space is protected, but, more broadly, what I\u2019ve indicated is that I don\u2019t want to be in the business of being the Iraqi air force. I don\u2019t want to get in the business for that matter of being the Kurdish air force, in the absence of a commitment of the people on the ground to get their act together and do what\u2019s necessary politically to start protecting themselves and to push back against ISIL.\u201dThe reason, the president added, \u201cthat we did not just start taking a bunch of airstrikes all across Iraq as soon as ISIL came in was because that would have taken the pressure off of [Prime Minister Nuri Kamal] al-Maliki.\u201d That only would have encouraged, he said, Maliki and other Shiites to think: \" \u2018We don\u2019t actually have to make compromises. We don\u2019t have to make any decisions. We don\u2019t have to go through the difficult process of figuring out what we\u2019ve done wrong in the past. All we have to do is let the Americans bail us out again. And we can go about business as usual.\u2019 \u201dThe president said that what he is telling every faction in Iraq is: \u201cWe will be your partners, but we are not going to do it for you. We\u2019re not sending a bunch of U.S. troops back on the ground to keep a lid on things. You\u2019re going to have to show us that you are willing and ready to try and maintain a unified Iraqi government that is based on compromise. That you are willing to continue to build a nonsectarian, functional security force that is answerable to a civilian government. ... We do have a strategic interest in pushing back ISIL. We\u2019re not going to let them create some caliphate through Syria and Iraq, but we can only do that if we know that we\u2019ve got partners on the ground who are capable of filling the void. So if we\u2019re going to reach out to Sunni tribes, if we\u2019re going to reach out to local governors and leaders, they\u2019ve got to have some sense that they\u2019re fighting for something.\u201d Otherwise, Obama said, \u201cWe can run [ISIL] off for a certain period of time, but as soon as our planes are gone, they\u2019re coming right back in.\u201dI asked the president whether he was worried about Israel.Asked whether he should be more vigorous in pressing Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and the Palestinian Authority\u2019s president, Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen, to reach a land-for-peace deal, the president said, it has to start with them. Prime Minister Netanyahu\u2019s \u201cpoll numbers are a lot higher than mine\u201d and \u201cwere greatly boosted by the war in Gaza,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnd so if he doesn\u2019t feel some internal pressure, then it\u2019s hard to see him being able to make some very difficult compromises, including taking on the settler movement. That\u2019s a tough thing to do. With respect to Abu Mazen, it\u2019s a slightly different problem. In some ways, Bibi is too strong [and] in some ways Abu Mazen is too weak to bring them together and make the kinds of bold decisions that Sadat or Begin or Rabin were willing to make. It\u2019s going to require leadership among both the Palestinians and the Israelis to look beyond tomorrow. ... And that\u2019s the hardest thing for politicians to do is to take the long view on things.\u201dClearly, a lot of the president\u2019s attitudes on Iraq grow out the turmoil unleashed in Libya by NATO\u2019s decision to topple Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, but not organize any sufficient international follow-on assistance on the ground to help them build institutions. Whether it is getting back into Iraq or newly into Syria, the question that Obama keeps coming back to is: Do I have the partners \u2014 local and/or international \u2014 to make any improvements we engineer self-sustaining?\u201cI\u2019ll give you an example of a lesson I had to learn that still has ramifications to this day,\u201d said Obama. \u201cAnd that is our participation in the coalition that overthrew Qaddafi in Libya. I absolutely believed that it was the right thing to do. ... Had we not intervened, it\u2019s likely that Libya would be Syria. ... And so there would be more death, more disruption, more destruction. But what is also true is that I think we [and] our European partners underestimated the need to come in full force if you\u2019re going to do this. Then it\u2019s the day after Qaddafi is gone, when everybody is feeling good and everybody is holding up posters saying, \u2018Thank you, America.\u2019 At that moment, there has to be a much more aggressive effort to rebuild societies that didn\u2019t have any civic traditions. ... So that\u2019s a lesson that I now apply every time I ask the question, \u2018Should we intervene, militarily? Do we have an answer [for] the day after?\u2019 \u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Construction of Rentals Is Taking Off", "Date": "2014-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ChartsAFTER the housing market collapse, there is a construction boom \u2014 in apartments.By contrast, building of single-family homes has partly recovered, but only slowly, and the same is true for buildings containing two to four units. As can be seen in the accompanying charts, the number of single-family homes started over the most recent 12 months was more than 60 percent below the level of 2005, when the housing boom was at its peak. But the number of apartment starts is now 7 percent higher than it was in 2005.This is still a country where most people live in single-family homes. But over the 12 months through July, apartment buildings accounted for 34 percent of all new housing starts, the highest share since 1974. In 2005, when the housing market was booming, the share for apartments fell below 15 percent.Now, with mortgages harder to get for many people with flaws in their credit history, and with others unwilling to buy after suffering losses when home prices collapsed in 2009, rentals seem to be in high demand. The Census Bureau says that the vacancy rate for rentals fell to 7.5 percent in the second quarter. That was the lowest vacancy rate since 1997.During the most recent 12 months, construction began on 629,000 single-family homes. That is 48 percent more than the 426,000 such starts recorded during the worst period of the housing crisis, but it is still very low by historical standards. Since 1959, when housing start figures began to be collected, the only time starts fell that low was in 1982, during a brutal recession that was accompanied by high interest rates that made mortgages very expensive.Sales of new single-family homes peaked last summer, on a seasonally adjusted basis, and have since slipped a bit, adding to the worries that the housing market might be slipping. The Census Bureau will report on Monday whether the sales rate of those homes also surged in July.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Evictions Soar in Hot Market; Renters Suffer", "Date": "2014-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMILWAUKEE \u2014 Just after 7 a.m., sheriff\u2019s deputies knocked on the door of the duplex apartment, holding a fluorescent orange eviction notice. The process was quick and efficient. A moving crew began to carry out the family\u2019s possessions and stack them neatly at the curb. Celeste Wilson, the tenant, appeared on the front step in pajama pants.Ms. Wilson, 36, explained that the family had missed a month of rent when her husband fell ill, so the landlady filed for eviction. Knowing they would be thrown out, the Wilsons had already found a new home, paying a double security deposit and an extra $300 because of the open eviction case.\u201cIt\u2019s the stability I worry about,\u201d Ms. Wilson said, watching her five children trickle out into the yard that had been their playground for seven months. \u201cThey\u2019ve got to start off fresh, get new friends, new neighbors. It might not show now, but maybe later on in life.\u201dFor tens of thousands of renters, life has become increasingly unstable in recent years, even as the economy has slowly improved. Middle-class wages have stagnated and rents have risen sharply in many places, fueled by growing interest in urban living and a shortage of rental housing. The result is a surge in eviction cases that has abruptly disrupted lives, leaving families to search for not just new housing that fits their budgets but new schools, new bus routes and sometimes new jobs.Landlord-tenant laws and housing market conditions vary widely, and evictions are not surging everywhere. And a court filing does not necessarily result in eviction; some cases are resolved through payment plans or other agreements. But from 2010 to 2013, Maine experienced a 21 percent increase in eviction filings, Massachusetts 11 percent and Kentucky 8 percent. In the fiscal year that ended in June, New Jersey, which has some of the strongest tenant protections in the country, had one eviction filing for every six renter households. In Georgia, where court statistics do not differentiate between tenants evicted by a landlord and homeowners evicted after foreclosure, filings soared to almost 270,000 last year, a 9 percent jump since 2010. Over the same period, according to the research firm CoreLogic, the number of foreclosures dropped by half.Perhaps the simplest explanation for the rise in evictions is a severe shortage of rental housing caused by a lack of new construction during the recession and the wave of foreclosures that turned homeowners into renters and occupied housing into abandoned blight.A vast majority of renters live in cities, but evictions are not limited to urban settings. Rural areas like western Oklahoma, where an oil and gas boom has increased demand for housing, have also seen an increase in eviction filings.The rising demand for, and tight supply of, apartments means landlords can now afford to be more exacting in their standards, if not outright aggressive in replacing renters with those who can pay more. In the second quarter of this year, the rental vacancy rate sunk to its lowest in almost 20 years, while rents, in inflation-adjusted dollars, remained close to their peak. Some advocates for tenants said that court filings were just the tip of the iceberg \u2014 many renters have been displaced by rising rents, threatening letters, one-time payoffs and condo conversions, without ever going to court.The rental shortage has made the most vulnerable tenants susceptible to eviction. \u201cSo many of our clients are people of color, people with disabilities, people who have suffered extreme health crises or a long-term chronic illness,\u201d said Christine Donahoe, a staff attorney with Legal Action of Wisconsin.Over two days in Milwaukee County, sheriff\u2019s deputies evicted two renters with mental illnesses, one of whom responded only to the initials V.G., for victim of government. The boss of the moving crew, Jim Brittain, said: \u201cI\u2019m seeing this more and more. One out of every five people we move, it seems like, have mental health issues.\u201dEviction can have a domino effect: People double up with relatives, placing their hosts at risk of eviction themselves for having unauthorized guests. Children miss school, parents find themselves far from their jobs or their normal means of transportation.\u201cYou would think that eviction is caused by job loss, but we found evidence that eviction can actually cause you to lose your job,\u201d said Matthew Desmond, a Harvard sociologist who studied evictions in Milwaukee. He found that women in poor, minority neighborhoods were evicted at higher rates than men, and that in court cases, tenants living with children were almost three times more likely to be evicted than those without children.\u201cWe also found evidence that people that are evicted, even years later, have higher rates of depression and higher rates of material hardship,\u201d like hunger or lack of medical care, he said.In some cases, economic realities have affected landlords as well as tenants, pushing them to act. In housing court in Madison, Wis., Denise Carty, a nursing consultant who owns one rental unit, said she had reluctantly filed a case against her tenant, a single mother, after years of charging below-market rent and tolerating late or missed payments. The debt had built up to more than $5,000. \u201cI can\u2019t sustain this anymore,\u201d Ms. Carty said.Even if an eviction case is ultimately dismissed or decided against the landlord, it can cause problems for a tenant who is looking for a new apartment.In Madison, Jawana Echols, a 34-year-old mother of two, said her previous landlord filed an eviction after one late payment, and the filing has haunted her ever since, even though she settled the bill. After seven rejections, she found a new apartment with the help of a social service agency, but car repairs left her $100 short on the rent one month, so she now has a second eviction filing. Again, she paid what she owed, but she believes that her record will make it impossible to move, even though it takes her an hour and a half by bus to get to work, since her car broke down once more.In a few states, there have been efforts to strengthen laws protecting tenants. A new law in Rhode Island seeks to keep renters in place if their residence goes through foreclosure. Virginia recently extended landlord-tenant regulations to small landlords. In Oregon, it is now illegal for a landlord to count eviction filings against a prospective tenant unless the tenant lost the case, and it is less than five years old.Tenants living in subsidized housing or using a federal housing voucher can find that support jeopardized by an eviction filing. That is why Lynette Moore and her two school-age daughters were living in Super 8 Motel in Madison about a month after being evicted from the three-bedroom house in a suburb of Milwaukee where they had lived for eight years.The landlord had given her notice that he planned to sell the house, she said, but without a place to go, she had stayed on until he had filed against her in court. Now she is looking for work in Madison, where she hopes life will be easier, while commuting to her job as a health care aide in Milwaukee and hoping that a legal aid lawyer will be able to get her rental voucher restored. The disruption sidelined her plans to work more hours and go back to school, Ms. Moore said.\u201cWe was just getting to the point where we could do life-changing things,\u201d she said.The move had come just as her daughter Aleisha, 17, was about to start her senior year in high school, and Ailyah, 10, had one year to go in elementary school. Now the two are biding their time until they start at new schools in the fall. During an interview Aleisha said little, but Ailyah chattered incessantly as she pretended to feed a toy dog, Sparky, some of her dinner.\u201cAbby\u2019s going to be really mad,\u201d Ailyah said. Abby is another stuffed animal, but unlike Sparky, she had been packed away in storage until the family finds a new home.An article on Aug. 29 about the sharp increase in evictions around the country misstated the length of time that a tenant in Milwaukee, Celeste Wilson, had rented her home before she was evicted. It was seven months, not five years.An article on Aug. 29 about the soaring eviction rates of renters in hot real estate markets, using figures gathered by the Neighborhood Law Clinic at the University of Wisconsin Law School, misstated the eviction increase for Milwaukee County from 2010 to 2013. It was 10 percent, not 43 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Market Rises on Hint of Easing Tension in Ukraine", "Date": "2014-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA burst of buying Friday in defied slumps in other markets and offered hope for investors shaken by geopolitical turmoil. Major stock indexes closed up around 1 percent, buoyed by signs that tensions in Ukraine might be easing.The rally on Wall Street contrasted with price declines in European and Asian stock markets. Fear has been creeping into stock and bond markets around the world in recent weeks against a backdrop of escalating global conflicts.News Friday of United States fighter jets dropping bombs in Iraq and the end of a three-day cease-fire in Gaza weighed further on European and Asian markets. The declines there capped broad losses for the week, including a 5 percent drop in Japan\u2019s major stock index.As anxieties have risen in recent days, money has been flowing from around the world into Treasurys, the perennial safe haven for spooked investors.Stock markets bucked the trend Friday as investors snapped up shares that had been beaten down in recent days. The buying surged late in the day on reports that Russia had ended military exercises near Ukraine. The Dow Jones industrial average surged 1.1 percent, its biggest gain since March. The index remains 3.4 percent below its record high set July 16.Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, said he wasn\u2019t surprised by the Wall Street rally.\u201cThe U.S. economy will grow at 3 percent or 4 percent for the rest of the year,\u201d Paulsen said. \u201cAre geopolitical risks really going to have an economic impact?\u201dIt\u2019s a question that\u2019s been unsettling investors.In June and most of July, prices in major stock indexes in the United States rose even in the face of the widening conflicts around the world. Some experts warned that markets had grown dangerously complacent.But then the West imposed increasingly crushing sanctions on Russia for supporting rebels in Ukraine. Israel\u2019s bloody war in Gaza dragged on. And Sunni extremists made advances in northern Iraq.Prices then began a sustained decline, even in resilient markets. Stocks in July posted their first monthly loss since January.The fear has driven up various government bond prices, too, and sent yields down. The yield on German government notes maturing in 10 years, for instance, hit an all-time low Friday. The yield on notes of the same maturity has reached its lowest level in about a year.Another sign of worry, the VIX, a gauge of expectation of future stock volatility, has climbed nearly 50 percent since early July.One fear is that Europe could fall back into another recession after having emerged from one last year. The economies of the 18 countries that share the euro currency are barely growing, and many of them depend on Russia for natural gas imports. Germany imports nearly all its natural gas from Russia.This week, the head of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, warned that the crisis in Ukraine could hurt the fragile recovery in the region.The troubles in Iraq also threaten oil supplies. A report from Citigroup to clients early Friday noted that Iraq is the fastest-growing supplier among OPEC members.The Citi report also noted, though, that there was reason to keep buying stocks, not the least of which is strong corporate earnings.An announcement from Gap on Friday underscored that trend. It reported that sales increased 3 percent in the second quarter as growth at Old Navy offset lower sales of the company\u2019s namesake brand. Its stock jumped $2.37, or 6 percent, to $42.57.With nearly all second-quarter results for S&P 500 companies out, analysts are calling for earnings in that index to jump 10 percent from a year earlier. At the beginning of July, they expected a gain of less than 7 percent, according to S&P Capital IQ (NYSE:MHP) , a data provider.On Friday, the Dow ended up 185.66 points, or 1.1 percent, to 16,553.93. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index rose 22.02 points, or 1.2 percent, to 1,931.59. The Nasdaq composite rose 35.93 points, or 0.83 percent, to 4,370.90.In economic news, the U.S. Labor Department reported that workers were more productive in the April-June quarter and that labor costs rose slightly, a sharp turnaround from grim first-quarter figures. Productivity increased 2.5 percent at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, after plummeting 4.5 percent in the first quarter.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Authenticity, Repurposed, in a Mason Jar", "Date": "2014-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMaybe you\u2019ve sipped a beer from a Mason jar. Or fished out a pickle swimming in brine from one. Or dined under illuminated clusters of them, dangling in chandelier formation, at a restaurant \u2014 especially if you dined in Brooklyn. You might like to use Mason jars to stash your dwindling supply of Cheerios or to chill fresh lemonade. Or maybe the one that\u2019s perched on a glass stem and marketed as the \u201credneck wineglass\u201d is more your speed. (Not to worry, martini drinkers, there\u2019s a version for you, too.) But until several years ago, the simple Mason jar was more likely to be found in the nooks of grandmothers\u2019 pantries than on retailers\u2019 shelves. It was salvaged from near extinction by businesses eager for a homespun aesthetic in a sturdy, affordable package \u2014 many of them hoping to lure the millennials who have fetishized the jars in photographs on Instagram and Pinterest. Though the Mason jar has become a symbol of hipness, it started as a necessity. In 1858, John Landis Mason found a way to preserve fruits, vegetables and other perishables when he devised a lid that screwed to the threaded-glass lip of a jar over a rubber ring that sealed previously boiled contents.\u201cA hundred and fifty years ago, these jars meant survival,\u201d says Douglas M. Leybourne Jr., a Mason jar expert and collector, and the author of books in a series called \u201cThe Collector\u2019s Guide to Old Fruit Jars.\u201d \u201cYou have a house full of people, and it\u2019s wintertime. You couldn\u2019t go down to the store \u2014 there wasn\u2019t one.\u201dInitially, the jars were handblown and infused with substances like iron oxide and cobalt, producing shades of amber and a hue that Mr. Leybourne calls \u201cVicks VapoRub blue.\u201d (These jars now fetch up to $30,000 apiece on the collectors\u2019 market.) But, eventually, manufacturers dispensed with the colors in favor of a clear view of the food inside.After Mr. Mason\u2019s patent ran out in 1870, about 500 other jar makers adopted it, including Ball and Kerr, which for decades stamped their glass creations with the date of the original patent \u2014 Nov. 30, 1858 \u2014 and marketed them as Mason jars. Billions were sold. \u201cThe demand was incredible,\u201d says Mr. Leybourne, who himself has a collection of more than 2,000 vintage fruit jars.The jars retained their popularity throughout the early 20th century, with sales spiking during the Great Depression and World War II, when the federal government urged people to cultivate victory gardens so more food could be allocated for the troops. In the 1950s and \u201960s, however, the jars\u2019 market began to fade. \u201cThat\u2019s when canning took a turn south,\u201d says Chris Scherzinger, president and chief executive of Jarden Home Brands, based in Daleville, Ind., which currently makes Ball- and Kerr-brand Mason jars. The rise of grocery products like Tang, Kraft Macaroni and Cheese and TV dinners threatened to extinguish the canning tradition and take down the Mason jar industry as well. Up through the 1990s, \u201cthere was a level of, I think you\u2019d say, category maturity, where it was very low or no growth,\u201d Mr. Scherzinger says. People sought out the comfort and utility of the jars during the Y2K panic of late 1999, when many people feared that computer systems would fail at the dawn of the year 2000, bringing down electricity and water services. Ball-brand jar sales surged that year, but leveled off again when predictions of exploding nuclear power plants didn\u2019t pan out. The turning point in the recent history of the Mason jar was the start of the recession in 2008. \u201cPeople stay home,\u201d Mr. Scherzinger says of that time. \u201cThey don\u2019t go out as much. They kind of go back to what the core of their roots are.\u201d At the same time, an aversion to processed food was intensifying. More people became focused on self-sufficiency and eking out as much value as they could from what they bought \u2014 and at a reasonable cost. Jarden sells a case of a dozen 16-ounce jars for $11.99 on its website. (Generic 16-ounce jars in the Mason style can go for less: $5.22 on one site.)\u201cEverywhere I look as I study consumers, I see this growing quest for more and more control,\u201d Ms. Koehn says. \u201cControl not only over where stuff comes from and what it\u2019s made of, but how it\u2019s made.\u201dThe personalized food movement, as Mr. Scherzinger calls it, began to emerge. According to him, 82 percent of Jarden Home Brands\u2019 customers have their own gardens, and many patronize farmers\u2019 markets.\u201cThey want to get their hands dirty; they want to be involved in the process, selection and the making of their food,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd canning is an extension of that.\u201d Mr. Scherzinger also says the idea of publishing your own content online has parallels to the canning of food products. \u201cIt\u2019s a natural extension of the idea of participation and creation,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t create my own iPhone, but I can certainly create my own food.\u201d\u201cThe functional side of it is that the Mason jars are heavy in weight, and they can withstand cocktail shaking and muddling ingredients,\u201d Mr. Prum says. Beyond that, the glass is clear, which means that customers can see its contents while they froth up their drinks.He also liked that Ball-brand Mason jars, which they went on to use, have always been made in the United States. It was a priority to provide jobs to American workers at a time when unemployment was climbing, he said. The two men\u2019s company, based in Brooklyn, has sold more than 100,000 Mason Shakers since its founding, through its website and retailers like Williams-Sonoma, Anthropologie and Sur la Table. The retail price is $29. But big corporations are also jumping on the trend, stuffing sugary, high-calorie treats into Mason jar knockoffs \u2014 and causing some to wonder whether the jar\u2019s 150-year run as a symbol of wholesomeness may be nearing its expiration date. Red Lobster now serves strawberry shortcake in a plastic version of the jar. And this summer, after picking up on Mason-jar chatter on social media, 7-Eleven began selling a plastic replica outfitted with plastic neon lids and straws as receptacles for its Slurpees. Laura Gordon, vice president for marketing and brand innovation at 7-Eleven, says the jar\u2019s \u201ccombination of simplicity and an emotional, fun nostalgia\u201d makes it \u201ca perfect fit for us.\u201dMr. Leybourne, who has spent the last 20 years cataloging vintage Mason jars and other fruit jars in his books, isn\u2019t bothered by some of the less conventional uses for the item he calls a functional antique. \u201cThey\u2019re an excellent storage jar,\u201d he says. \u201cI saw a half-gallon one filled with M&Ms.\u201d To Ms. Koehn at Harvard, the marriage of the solid, built-for-the-ages Mason jar and the scientifically engineered Slurpee is \u201cstrangely interesting.\u201d The quest for authenticity in the midst of the digital revolution draws people to the comforting rhythms of home life, she says.Many people, she says, will \u201cwant the damn jar more than they want the Slurpee.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Volvo Introduces Its First S.U.V. Made Under Chinese Ownership", "Date": "2014-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySTOCKHOLM \u2014 Volvo on Tuesday introduced its first vehicle designed and built under Chinese ownership. But the influence, if any, of the new owners from Hangzhou has been carefully hidden by many layers of Swedish aesthetic.The vehicle, a seven-seat sport utility vehicle known as the XC90 that will go on sale in April, is probably a make-or-break model for Volvo. It must succeed for the company to regain stature in America, where a few decades ago \u2014 before the advent of S.U.V.s \u2014 the Volvo station wagon was a suburban status symbol.It will be sold in Europe and Asia, too, but Volvo expects the United States to account for at least a third of sales. The carmaker wants to replace BMW, Mercedes and Audi S.U.V.s in the driveways of the well-to-do.Since Zhejiang Geely Holding bought the company from Ford Motor in 2010, China has become Volvo Cars\u2019 largest market. But that is partly because sales in other markets have been poor. Sales in the United States fell 10 percent during the same period, and Volvo\u2019s American market share has shrunk to a nearly irrelevant 0.35 percent.Still, the car company, separate from the Volvo Group, a truck maker, has returned to profit after losses in late 2012 and early 2013, and sales rose 10 percent in the first half of this year, to 229,000 cars.To achieve its goal of doubling global sales to 800,000 vehicles a year, Volvo is promoting its traditional emphasis on passenger safety while pumping up the elegance, albeit in a restrained Swedish way. Along with a shock-absorbing seat meant to protect a passenger\u2019s spine in a crash, and automatic braking to avoid collisions with people or other cars, the XC90 has a shift lever inlaid with Swedish-made glass crystal.Volvo said its goal was to ensure that, by 2020, no one would be killed or seriously injured in a Volvo car.Volvo is also putting more emphasis on fuel economy and emissions than in the past, addressing anxiety among some buyers that a big S.U.V. makes them look insensitive to climate change. The top-of-the-line model will be a plug-in hybrid capable of traveling about 25 miles solely on battery power.Yet, according to Volvo, the combination of a gasoline engine in front and electric motor in the rear will deliver a hefty 400 horsepower and allow the hybrid XC90 to accelerate to 62 miles an hour in 6.4 seconds.It has an interior designed to evoke an elegant Swedish living room and an optional sound system that supposedly replicates the acoustics of the concert hall in Gothenburg, the hometown of Volvo Cars.\u201cWe think it\u2019s absolutely necessary to come back to that territory,\u201d Hakan Samuelsson, the chief executive of Volvo Cars, told reporters in Stockholm on Tuesday. \u201cWith this car, we will take a big step.\u201dVolvo has not yet named a price for the top-tier model, but said a reasonably well-equipped conventionally powered version with all-wheel drive would sell for less than $50,000 in the United States. That is more than the starting price of $39,000 for an Audi Q5 but less than a BMW X5, which starts at $55,000.Volvo is to begin taking online orders on Sept. 3 for a conventionally powered special edition of the XC90 for $65,900.The XC90 is the first model built on a platform, or collection of common components, which Volvo calls scalable product architecture. The same chassis, seats, wheels and steering assembly can be used in sedans and stations wagons, and Volvo promises the process will lead to a complete renewal of its product line within four years.The platform also allows different models to be manufactured on the same assembly line, which saves costs and would bring Volvo more in line with German standards of automaking efficiency.At least initially, the XC90 will be made solely in Sweden. But other Volvo models are already being produced in China and Mr. Samuelsson said on Tuesday that some Chinese-made vehicles, like the S60 sedan, could be exported to the United States as soon as next year. Whether American consumers will buy a Chinese-made car is a largely untested prospect.But, judging from the introduction of the XC90 at a waterside venue outside Stockholm on Tuesday, marketing for the new model will play up the Swedish connection.\u201cWe are emphasizing our determination to build the future of our brand on our Swedish heritage,\u201d Mr. Samuelsson said at the event, standing in front of a large screen projected with images including that of a pebbly Baltic beach.Dennis Nobelius, a Volvo Cars vice president, said that the design team in Sweden was given a free hand and there was no micromanaging by the Chinese owners.While Geely managers have \u201ca burning passion\u201d for cars, Mr. Samuelsson said during a question-and-answer session with about a dozen reporters, \u201cthey are not sending in experts and controllers.\u201d\u201cThey have given us a new role as a stand-alone company,\u201d Mr. Samuelsson said of Geely. In an implicit dig at Ford, the previous owners from America, he added, \u201cWe are not a sort of division executing commands from some center.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the Chinese-made model of Volvo that could be exported to the United States as soon as next year. It is the S60 not the C60.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Eurozone Inflation Dips Again to Increase Pressure on E.C.B.", "Date": "2014-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Inflation in the eurozone continued to decline in August while unemployment hovered near record levels, according to official data released on Friday, reinforcing expectations that the European Central Bank will soon take more forceful action to prevent a dangerous downward price spiral.Inflation in the eurozone fell to 0.3 percent, from 0.4 percent in July, according to a preliminary estimate by Eurostat, the European Union\u2019s statistics agency. The fall was in line with analysts\u2019 predictions, and European stocks as well as the euro currency were little changed in midday trading.Unemployment in the eurozone in July remained stuck at 11.5 percent, Eurostat said. The level of joblessness remained too high to remove concerns about very low inflation, which creates problems for borrowers and can lead to deflation, a broad decline in prices that causes consumers to delay purchases and undercuts corporate profits and jobs.Eurostat said that 18.4 million were out of work in the eurozone in July and that nearly 25 million were jobless in the wider European Union, where the unemployment rate was unchanged at 10.2 percent in the same month.With inflation creeping closer to zero, analysts consider it ever more likely that the central bank will begin large-scale asset purchases, the same kind of quantitative easing that has been used by the Federal Reserve to revive the economy in the United States.Most analysts do not expect the European Central Bank to announce a quantitative easing program on Thursday, when the bank\u2019s governing council holds its monthly monetary policy meeting. The central bank will probably wait until it has a better idea of the effectiveness of earlier measures, including a program to encourage bank lending to businesses, before taking any further action.But Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, could signal on Thursday that a quantitative easing program is being prepared and could be deployed this year or early in 2015.\u201cWe now expect the E.C.B. to launch a broad-based asset purchase program \u2014 Q.E. \u2014 by the end of the year,\u201d analysts at Credit Suisse wrote in a note to clients on Friday. \u201cImportantly, we think this could be clearly telegraphed to markets as soon as next week\u2019s governing council meeting.\u201dMany economists, as well as central bankers from other countries, say the central bank should have already begun quantitative easing to pump money into the economy, because the eurozone is well on its way to a lost decade of stagnant growth.But quantitative easing is much more difficult to deploy in the eurozone than in the United States. Large-scale purchases of government bonds, the asset most readily available, would provoke stiff opposition in Germany and probably legal challenges. Officials of the Bundesbank, the German central bank, consider purchases of government bonds to be a violation of a prohibition against central bank financing of governments.Many economists say the European Central Bank must accept such risks in order to prevent another recession that could again throw the future of the eurozone into question.\u201cThe E.C.B. is behind the curve,\u201d said Zsolt Darvas, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. \u201cThe E.C.B. should have acted much earlier to prevent inflation from falling.\u201dEurostat said the decline in the inflation rate reflected falling prices for food, alcohol and tobacco, as well as lower energy prices. The price of services rose at an annual rate of 1.2 percent, while prices for industrial goods, not related to energy, rose 0.3 percent.Mr. Draghi has played down the risk of deflation by pointing out that low inflation is caused mostly by falling energy and commodity prices, which are determined largely by global conditions rather than the situation in Europe.Mr. Draghi has argued that the fall in inflation reflects a necessary decline in prices and wages in countries like Spain.Most of the causes of low inflation \u201care temporary in nature \u2014 though not all of them,\u201d Mr. Draghi said last week at a conference of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyo. But he added: \u201cIf this period of low inflation were to last for a prolonged period of time, the risk to price stability would increase.\u201dThe overall unemployment rate masked huge differences among the 18 members of the eurozone. Unemployment in Germany and Austria was 4.9 percent, according to Eurostat, while in Spain the rate was 24.5 percent, a slight improvement from 24.6 percent in June.In Greece, the rate was 27.2 percent in May, the most recent figure available. The rate in Greece improved slightly from 27.3 percent.Unemployment in the eurozone peaked at 12 percent last year and has fallen only gradually since then. Among people younger than 25, the jobless rate in July was unchanged from June, at 23.2 percent. In Spain and Greece more than half of young people were unemployed.In his speech last week, Mr. Draghi warned of the effect on young people of joblessness early in their careers. \u201cThe young have lost access to a crucial step of on-the-job training,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, would see her and give her a shout-out. No such luck; a tall security guard was in the way.As Zephyr Teachout was leaving the gospel concert in East Flatbush, a man in a wheelchair called out, \u201cWho are you?\u201d Ever eager, she explained that she was running as a progressive against Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo in the Democratic primary.The man, won over, pointed to a homemade campaign button pinned to Ms. Teachout\u2019s jacket. \u201cCan I have your button?\u201d he asked. She gladly obliged.Yes, she knows that few New Yorkers have heard of her. Yes, she knows that she will not have enough money for television ads. And yes, she knows that her best shot at statewide exposure \u2014 a debate with Mr. Cuomo \u2014 is unlikely. Still, she insists that she is gaining momentum, and is zestily campaigning with a kind of cynicism-free optimism that makes her a sunny surprise.\u201cI didn\u2019t know politics would be this much fun!\u201d she beamed after a South Asian festival in Queens a week ago.Privately, Ms. Teachout\u2019s admirers say that her campaign has already succeeded, by forcing Mr. Cuomo to embrace more liberal causes. If she gets more than 25 percent in the Sept. 9 primary, some argue, then Mr. Cuomo might need to worry about liberal angst heading into a general election against the Republican candidate, Rob Astorino, the Westchester County executive.Ms. Teachout does not pretend that her task will be easy. But she said the worst that could happen would be that she got only 1 percent of the vote, and that she became known as an idealistic but politically na\u00efve professor.\u201cWe\u2019re underdogs, we know that, but we\u2019re serious underdogs,\u201d she said at a house party near her apartment in Fort Greene, Brooklyn.Ms. Teachout and her running mate for lieutenant governor, Tim Wu, a Columbia University law professor, talked about winning over the small number of Democrats who actually vote in primaries.They hope to tap into disillusionment or even anger with Mr. Cuomo among teachers, public employees and upstate residents opposed to hydraulic fracturing.\u201cIn the face of Andrew Cuomo\u2019s silence, I am being loud,\u201d she said in Fort Greene.Mr. Cuomo has not publicly mentioned Ms. Teachout by name, and his campaign has declined to comment on her candidacy.Still, avid Democrats are getting to know her. A Vermont native, Ms. Teachout, 42, worked as a death penalty lawyer in North Carolina and co-founded an organization intent on breaking up Wall Street banks. The author of a coming book on political corruption, she is on track for tenure at Fordham early next year.Her most formative political experience came in 2003, when she became the director of online organizing for Howard Dean\u2019s presidential campaign.\u201cShe was terrific; she was hard-working,\u201d Mr. Dean said during a 10th-anniversary celebration that Ms. Teachout attended for Democracy for New York City, a Dean-inspired group.She often mentions two United States senators \u2014 Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Sherrod Brown of Ohio \u2014 as role models. She also raves about State Senator Gustavo Rivera of the Bronx and Letitia James, the New York City public advocate.She even buys into the anti-\u201ccrony capitalism\u201d message, if not the prescription, of Dave Brat, the Virginia professor and Tea Party upstart who defeated Eric Cantor, the former House majority leader, in the Republican primary in June.On the trail, she often asks people what they want in a governor. She has also honed a stump speech, talking about her unusual name (yes, that is her first name, and her last name is Dutch), then touching on public schools, small businesses, transportation and infrastructure.\u201cIn my vision we can have an economy and a democracy that works for all of us, not just the wealthy and well-connected,\u201d she said at a street fair outside the Bronx Zoo a week ago, eliciting a few \u201cthat\u2019s right\u201d replies.To get around, Ms. Teachout usually takes public transportation or relies on rides from volunteers, especially when she travels to Ithaca, Binghamton and other areas to fire up \u201cfractivists.\u201d One afternoon she spent $65 to take five people, including an aide and an independent filmmaker, from the Bronx to Queens by livery cab.Things do not always go according to plan.At the Chatpati Mela celebration in Jackson Heights, for example, she could not distribute any campaign literature (black-and-white photocopies) or speak onstage \u2014 it was a strictly nonpartisan affair.Unfazed, she talked excitedly with vendors until she stumbled upon some Bangladeshis selling saris. After hearing about the travails of establishing small businesses, she bought an orange one for $20, and tried it on.\u201cShould I wear this to my debate with Governor Cuomo?\u201d she joked.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.C.B. Chief Seeks Tax Cuts and State Spending ", "Date": "2014-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJACKSON HOLE, Wyo. \u2014 Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, said Friday that European governments needed to move from a focus on austerity to a \u201cmore growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies.\u201dMr. Draghi\u2019s comments were a change in tone for him, reflecting mounting concern that economic growth is sputtering in many European countries and that existing efforts have proved insufficient to spur faster growth.Speaking before an annual gathering of central bankers and economists at a resort in the Rocky Mountains, Mr. Draghi said that the central bank was moving to increase its own stimulus campaign but that governments in the eurozone also needed to help bolster demand for goods and services.\u201cSince 2010, the euro area has suffered from fiscal policy being less available and effective,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be helpful for the overall stance of policy if fiscal policy could play a greater role alongside monetary policy, and I believe there is scope for this.\u201dThe central bank moved in June to expand its own campaign to stimulate the economy, and Mr. Draghi emphasized that the effort would continue.\u201cOur preparations for outright purchases in ABS markets is fast moving forward,\u201d he said, referring to the bank\u2019s plans to begin a broad bond-purchase program, emulating the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan.He also noted that the euro\u2019s recent decline was likely to continue as the American economy gains strength, a development he characterized as favorable because it would help to increase exports.Mr. Draghi suggested that European countries should consider public investments and tax cuts to complement the central bank\u2019s stimulus campaign. Countries like Germany, which are relatively healthy, have the most room to adopt such policies without breaking the rules of the euro area. Mr. Draghi appeared to refer to the need for such countries to reconsider their commitment to austerity in calling for the euro area to move to \u201ca more growth-friendly\u201d fiscal stance. Some German officials, however, have already signaled a reluctance to move in this direction. They argue that the onus is on struggling European countries like Spain, Italy and Greece to make painful economic adjustments intended to increase long-term growth, like reducing legal protections for workers, cutting back on social welfare programs and reducing public spending.Mr. Draghi was careful to say that those countries could not avoid such adjustments. The argument he made on Friday, however, was that such policies are by themselves insufficient. \u201cWithout higher aggregate demand, we risk higher structural unemployment, and governments that introduce structural reforms could end up running just to stand still,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout determined structural reforms, aggregate demand measures will quickly run out of steam and may ultimately become less effective.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Albany Doubling Down as Casino Boom Fades", "Date": "2014-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Buy-InALBANY \u2014 New York State is charging headlong into the casino business, with four full-service gambling resorts expected to be approved this fall and opened as early as next year, and talk of a torrent of new revenue, thousands of new jobs and a powerful economic jump-start for long-depressed upstate communities.Supporters of the expansion \u2014 most notably Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo \u2014 hope it will reverse the fortunes of economically stagnating regions like the Catskills, where little has filled the void left by the demise of the borscht belt.None of which bodes well for the long-term goals of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s plan.\u201cHe\u2019s 15 years too late to the party,\u201d said Harold L. Vogel, a longtime gambling industry analyst.Few doubt that new casinos built by the likes of Caesars or the Malaysia-based Resorts World chain would make splashy debuts, especially if the government allows any to be built within a short drive of Manhattan. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat seeking re-election this fall who is believed to have national aspirations, would probably be able to point to a large influx of revenue and economic activity in the run-up to the 2016 presidential campaign.But any sudden windfall for New York could be short-lived if the novelty of new casinos wears off quickly, as it often does, or if other jurisdictions respond with new casinos of their own.Many in the industry suggest that New Jersey would allow slot machines or more at the Meadowlands, a few miles from the Lincoln Tunnel, or perhaps even closer, in Jersey City.And while the new casinos are \u201cintended to attract non-New York residents and bring downstate New Yorkers to upstate,\u201d according to the state\u2019s request for applications, a recent report from the state comptroller\u2019s office warns that many players will be from nearby communities \u2014 posing the risk of an economic wash, rather than a net gain.State officials may also face a vexing decision: choosing between areas in the greatest need of economic assistance and those where a casino could deliver the greatest impact for the state.The prospect of a casino in suburban Orange County, for example, less than an hour from Manhattan, has already chilled the prospects for a casino in the rural Catskills, farther north, where gambling had long been seen as a key to economic revival. Two of those proposals have now been shelved. Only three developers are competing for a license in the Catskills; six are contending in Orange County.A Fragile IndustryFor years, New York had resisted as other states welcomed the gambling industry\u2019s march from coast to coast. That changed after 9/11, when the reeling economy prompted lawmakers to approve slot-like video lottery terminals at racetracks. Tribal casinos, enraged, stopped making revenue-sharing payments under prior agreements. Beginning in 2011, Mr. Cuomo pushed for the constitutional amendment to allow full-scale casino resorts, in part to pressure the tribes to come to terms.But by then, casinos had sprouted up throughout the country, and industry employment was past its 2007 peak, leaving many to wonder whether maturation or saturation was at hand.Once confined to Nevada and Atlantic City, gambling has become a fixture of the economy in states across the country, with nearly 1,000 commercial and tribal casinos in 39 states, and dozens of casinos in the Northeast corridor between West Virginia and Maine.The nation\u2019s gambling thirst also is being slaked by lotteries and scratch-off games, an expanding world of Internet gambling and office pools on everything from March Madness to the Super Bowl.\u201cI think the entire industry knows that there\u2019s too much supply for the demand that\u2019s out there,\u201d said Richard McGowan, an economics professor at Boston College who studies casino gambling. \u201cThe gusher is over.\u201dMore than half the population in the Northeast now lives within 25 miles of a casino featuring video lotteries, table games or slot machines, up from about 10 percent a decade ago. As the market grows crowded, many older casinos are declining or going bankrupt.Recent developments have been ominous: Thousands of layoffs are expected this year in Atlantic City, where three casinos are poised to be shuttered. Closings and revenue declines have also hit states like Mississippi, Missouri and Iowa, all early adopters in the nation\u2019s casino craze. Tribal Indian gambling officials reported meager growth last month of less than 1 percent at some 450 casinos in 2013. And two major credit agencies have issued cautionary reports in recent weeks warning states of dimming demand and a surfeit of casinos.One, by Fitch Ratings, was deeply downbeat, citing a variety of long-term factors facing casinos, including saturation, lower wages among small-purse players, increased online gambling, as well as baby boomers\u2019 concern about their retirement funds. \u201cThe U.S. regional gaming supply has largely met demand,\u201d the report concluded.And some neighboring states are having second thoughts about the whole business. In Massachusetts, voters will decide in November whether to repeal a 2011 law that legalized casinos there.Still, even the most pessimistic analysts say that some New York casinos may initially reap big winnings \u2014 particularly those near the city and its 50 million tourists a year.But New York\u2019s new casinos will be facing much stiffer competition than the Aqueduct complex did.In June, regulators in Massachusetts approved an $800 million casino in Springfield, a battered city where tourist traffic until now has mainly been headed for the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Barring a repeal of the gambling law, the first slot parlor in the state, south of Boston, is expected to open by next summer.And Pennsylvania, which already has 12 casinos, is mulling a 13th in Philadelphia. Contending with that interstate competition, while salving upstate New York\u2019s economic wounds, were Mr. Cuomo\u2019s stated reasons for urging New York voters to legalize casinos.\u201cWe\u2019re losing revenue every day because people are going to those casinos to play,\u201d the governor said in 2013, adding, \u201cThey now go to New Jersey, they go to Connecticut. Why don\u2019t we bring them to upstate New York?\u201dCannibals and VictimsNew York is, of course, already in the gambling business, with five upstate Indian casinos offering table games and amenities like hotels, golf courses and conference centers, and nine horse racing tracks with slot machine parlors, known as \u201cracinos,\u201d that try to imitate the glamour of Las Vegas.Mr. Cuomo\u2019s strategy acknowledged that some business now captured by the racinos would be cannibalized by the new casinos. But he reasoned that if a large amount of gamblers\u2019 money was already exiting the state, New York would be better off with its share of both cannibals and victims, not just victims.That is cold comfort for the racinos, many of which are already suffering declining or stagnant winnings.Until now, the racinos have been important taxpayers, pouring $4.6 billion into the state\u2019s education fund from 2004 to 2013, including $877 million last year.But that largess comes from a staggeringly high tax formula that works out to roughly 60 percent at some tracks.Under legislative deals negotiated by Mr. Cuomo, however, slot machines at the new casinos will pay the state much less \u2014 from 37 percent to 45 percent.In order to produce the same amount of tax revenue for the state, the new casinos will have to do considerably more business than the racinos, at a time when there is less business to go around.Cuomo administration officials express confidence that the new casinos will, on balance, make money for the state. But they agree that gambling is not a panacea, rather \u201cjust a part of a comprehensive effort to grow the upstate economy and bring good-paying jobs to these host communities,\u201d said Richard Azzopardi, a spokesman for the governor. A report by the Budget Division \u2014 released a month before last year\u2019s casino referendum \u2014 suggested New York would collect an additional $238 million a year for education or property tax relief, as well as $192 million more for local government aid, even after lost racino revenue was figured in.The Cuomo administration had similarly sanguine estimates last year of employment growth from the new casinos: nearly 3,000 permanent jobs, and an additional 6,700 temporary jobs in construction, estimates based on seven casinos in Pennsylvania, including six of the state\u2019s largest, along with the most successful casino in Maryland.Curiously, all seven of the Pennsylvania casinos saw declines in slot machine revenue over the past year.Casino jobs are also unlikely to lift many New Yorkers into the middle class.

{"Headline": "In Pope\u2019s Trip to South Korea, Church Envisions Growth", "Date": "2014-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Myeongdong Cathedral, the center of South Korean Catholicism, was a magnet for the country\u2019s downtrodden for decades. Pro-democracy fugitives found asylum inside the red brick church in the center of Seoul during the darkest years of military dictatorship in the 1980s, and parents who lost their children to government torture sought solace there.Today, the activists and their slogans are long gone. As dusk fell on a recent evening, the church was shrouded in quiet, away from the lights and bustle of the large surrounding shopping and hotel district. Unlike the red neon crosses of the country\u2019s more popular Protestant churches, the cathedral\u2019s cross was barely visible in the night sky.But the Catholic role in sheltering those who moved the country toward democracy has not been forgotten. And that history, experts say, could give Pope Francis an important opening during his visit to South Korea starting Thursday \u2014 his first trip as pontiff to the Far East, which is viewed as vital to the church\u2019s future because much of its growth is outside traditionally Christian Europe.For the Argentine Francis, who was chosen to lead the world\u2019s Catholics in part because of his allure for people in South America, a stronghold of the faith, South Korea presents an important test of whether his popularity there and in the United States and parts of Europe transfers to Asia.\u201cFrom the vantage of the global demographics of Roman Catholicism, the pope\u2019s presence is a powerful symbol of the Vatican\u2019s recognition that it is in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa that the church is growing most prominently,\u201d said Lionel Jensen, an expert on religion in Asia at the University of Notre Dame.The Vatican is especially interested in populous China, where an underground church loyal to the pope often suffers persecution from the government and competes with an officially recognized Catholic church beholden to the Communist Party. China and the Vatican do not share formal diplomatic recognition, however, and the Vatican did not mention outreach to Chinese citizens as an official goal.But Vatican watchers say the pope is hoping that by traveling nearby, he will attract more attention among Chinese people curious about Catholicism. The Rev. Bernardo Cervellera, editor in chief of AsiaNews, a missionary news service with close links to the Vatican, said that through his trip to South Korea, Francis meant to show China that the \u201cchurch is free and can contribute to the development of a country of a Confucian tradition.\u201dFather Cervellera added: \u201cHe wants to show China that there is no need to fear the Catholic Church.\u201d The Vatican says the last papal trip to the region was in 1999, when Pope John Paul II visited New Delhi. Francis, who was installed last year, has made two international trips, the first to Brazil, where he attended an international gathering of young Catholics, and the second to Israel and Jordan.To emphasize its increased focus on Asia, the Vatican has announced that the pope will travel early next year to the Philippines and Sri Lanka.Paolo Affatato, the director of a news agency with a Vatican office dedicated to spreading the faith, said that with its vast youth population, \u201cAsia was the frontier of evangelization.\u201d Part of the impetus for the pope\u2019s trip to South Korea was to attend Asian Youth Day, a meeting of young Asian Catholics.South Korea is considered possible fertile ground for the pope, who has won accolades elsewhere for his humility and focus on the poor.The number of Catholics in South Korea grew from 1.86 million in 1985 to 5.14 million, nearly 11 percent of the total population, in 2005, the last year when a census on religious affiliation took place.Experts noted that John Paul\u2019s two visits, in 1984 and 1989, helped spur Catholic growth in South Korea, where a majority of Christians remain Protestant, many of them Presbyterian. The number of Protestants, after years of exponential growth, peaked at 8.76 million in 1995, slipping to 8.61 million in 2005.The experts also suggested that Protestant congregations might be vulnerable to conversions.While the Catholic Church has been flexible in embracing Koreans\u2019 centuries-old Confucian-based rituals of worshiping ancestors, a widely cited survey by the Christian Ethics Movement of Korea last year found Koreans complaining about Protestant churches\u2019 \u201cexclusive attitude toward other faiths.\u201d A leading Protestant preacher in recent years outraged people by declaring from the pulpit: \u201cBuddhist monks are wasting their time. They should convert to Jesus.\u201dPeople have also watched some of South Korea\u2019s Protestant megachurches \u2014 among the largest in the world \u2014 degenerating into internal squabbling as pastors attempted to bequeath their churches to their sons, triggering factional strife.Kim Yoon-jeong, 38, a homemaker in Seoul, is one of the disenchanted. Born into a Catholic family, Ms. Kim said that during her 20s she grew \u201cbored with rituals and formality\u201d in her church and transferred to a \u201cmore dynamic\u201d Presbyterian church. But she has now switched back because of disillusionment with Protestant churches.\u201cThey act just like chaebol,\u201d Ms. Kim said, referring to South Korea\u2019s family-controlled business conglomerates in which father-to-son transfers of wealth are the norm. \u201cAt least, you don\u2019t have such a problem with Catholic priests with no children to inherit churches.\u201dAhead of Francis\u2019 visit, new books on the pope in Korean have crowded bookstore shelves, and coins and postage stamps to celebrate his visit have been issued. The government of President Park Geun-hye, who was baptized as \u201cJuliana\u201d at a Catholic church but officially says she has no religion, plans a grand welcome. It has planned to close traffic on Gwanghwamun Boulevard, the hub of South Korean political and cultural life, when Francis leads a beatification ceremony there. Francis\u2019 appearance on the fabled street \u2014 surrounded by foreign embassies, museums and statues of Korea\u2019s most beloved national heroes \u2014 would set a milestone for Korean Catholics and Christians in general, whose origins were marked by bloody persecutions.Catholicism began taking root here more than two centuries ago, when Koreans studied imported books on the religion. The Joseon Dynasty saw Christianity as a subversive influence, and an estimated 10,000 Christians were beheaded, drowned, buried alive or tortured to death. During his five-day trip, Francis is scheduled to visit sites of those killings.Today, Protestants and Catholics together make up nearly 30 percent of the South Korean population, and the churches are often credited with helping push forward the country\u2019s modernization. But the South Korea that the pope will see this week is vastly different from the country that John Paul II visited more than two decades ago. After emerging from military dictatorship and building one of the world\u2019s strongest economies, Koreans now fret over growing gaps between rich and poor. Some here hope that the pope\u2019s visit will address a growing complaint among South Koreans that Christian churches are losing touch with the poor as wealthier people populate their pews.Francis planned to visit a center for the disabled, and organizers of the trip invited laid-off workers to a special mass at the Myeongdong Cathedral.Also eagerly awaiting his arrival are the parents of many teenage victims of a ferry that sank in April. No matter their religion, the parents, who call the government investigation of the tragedy a whitewash, hope that the pope\u2019s attention to their plight will help persuade the government to arrange an independent inquiry. \u201cWe are desperate,\u201d Kim Young-oh, who lost a child to the ferry disaster and has been on a hunger strike for a month, said in a television interview. \u201cSo I am holding on until the pope comes.\u201dJim Yardley contributed reporting from Forte dei Marmi, Italy, and Elisabetta Povoledo from Rome.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Strained Infrastructure in Philippines Erodes the Nation\u2019s Growth Prospects", "Date": "2014-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by8 PhotosMANILA \u2014 Chris Ibasan travels only about five miles to work each day in one of Manila\u2019s business districts, but it is often a grueling two-hour commute that gets him into the office late.\u201cMy manager understands,\u201d said Mr. Ibasan, a 24-year-old shipping company employee. \u201cEveryone is late; even the managers are late for work.\u201dFrom Mr. Ibasan\u2019s perspective, the problem is simple.\u201cThere are too many people going to work, too many vehicles and not enough roads,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd taking the train is like lining up to see a movie star. You wait for hours.\u201dBut from an economist\u2019s perspective, the problem is even larger. The 2.2 million vehicles a day that grind away on Manila\u2019s crumbling road system cost the country 876 billion pesos a year, or more than $20 billion, in lost productivity and wasted energy, according to a recent study by the Japan International Cooperation Agency. That is a serious drain on an economy of about $250 billion.\u201cInfrastructure in the Philippines \u2014 transport, energy and communication \u2014 is in a difficult state to say the least,\u201d said Thierry Geiger, an economist with the World Economic Forum. \u201cYear after year, when we ask business executives based in the country about the state of infrastructure, they say that it is improving. Yet it remains a major bottleneck.\u201dThe Philippines has been one of the fastest-growing economies in Asia in recent years. The gross domestic product rose 7.2 percent in 2013, although it is expected to slow modestly this year while remaining above 6 percent, according to most regional economists. In addition to new, streamlined government spending processes and the paying down of public debt, much of the improvement in the economy is linked to the anticorruption efforts of President Benigno S. Aquino III.But the infrastructure problems now threaten to hold the Philippines back from reaching the next level, economically speaking, and improving its manufacturing base. Infrastructure problems have surpassed corruption as the leading economic obstacle, according to the most recent World Economic Forum competitiveness report, which is based on responses from people doing business in the country. Manila is plagued by power failures, chronic water shortages, an antiquated telecommunications system, deteriorating roads and bridges and a subpar airport.In April, Mr. Aquino publicly apologized to travelers for the problem. During a World Economic Forum meeting in May, embarrassed airport officials had to use fans to cool things down.The infrastructure problems are felt in other ways as well. Many parts of the Philippines experience regular blackouts, but in the last few months the power failures have hit Manila as well. Energy officials say an insufficient number of power plants, combined with increased demand, is straining the country\u2019s grid.Though power is unreliable, it is also among the most expensive in Southeast Asia, said Joms Salvador, secretary general of Gabriela, a women\u2019s rights organization.\u201cIn Manila, if you don\u2019t pay your electricity bill, they cut your power,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no safety net for the poor. To pay their power bill, families have to scrimp on food or take children out of school.\u201dShe said that women and children were hit hardest by the country\u2019s poor infrastructure, particularly in areas without running water.\u201cIn metro Manila communities where we work, if there is no running water, then the women and the children have to fetch the water,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is an added burden for them.\u201dMr. Aquino has repeatedly acknowledged the need to invest in infrastructure, noting in recent speeches that the government had increased spending in this area to 400 billion pesos this year, or about $9.1 billion, from 200 billion pesos in 2011.The stakes are high for the Philippines, said Frederic Neumann, a managing director and co-head of Asian economic research at HSBC.Mr. Neumann noted that the country was in what some economists call a demographic sweet spot, in which millions of young people will be entering the work force. That makes the country a competitive destination for investments in export-driven manufacturing, which have propelled many countries in East Asia to prosperity.\u201cThis is the Philippines\u2019 moment,\u201d Mr. Neumann said. \u201cChina has been extraordinarily competitive in the last 20 years, but it is now \u2014 with rising labor costs \u2014 moving toward other types of production. The Philippines has low labor costs. It could pick up where China leaves off.\u201dBut the country cannot benefit from manufacturing unless it provides the basic infrastructure, including reliable energy supplies and modern roads and ports, that foreign investors need, Mr. Neumann said. The service sector, including business-process outsourcing, has helped drive economic growth in the country, but it might not support the millions of young people entering the labor market.\u201cTo create jobs for these youngsters, you really need to have a vibrant manufacturing sector,\u201d he said. \u201cThe service sector will not cut it on its own.\u201dRichard Javad Heydarian, a foreign affairs and economics lecturer at Ateneo de Manila University, said that although corruption investigations might keep infrastructure funds from being pocketed, they could also paralyze spending.\u201cThe ensuing political infighting and nonstop investigations could dampen the momentum for sustained infrastructure development,\u201d he said. \u201cIn short, the Aquino administration is confronting mammoth bureaucratic, temporal and political roadblocks in realizing its infrastructure development plans.\u201dThat is not good news for Gem Mallo, a 24-year-old call center employee who spends four to five hours a day commuting round trip from a Manila suburb to her job in the city center. She sets the alarm for 3:45 every morning in hopes that she can make it to work by 7 a.m.\u201cI sleep for five hours and spend a few hours with my family, and then I\u2019m back on the bus,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Life of Wonderment", "Date": "2014-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Cultural Leap With a glowing paper cutout pinned over her heart, the artist known as Swoon led a procession through the Brooklyn Museum early one summer night to her installation \u201cSubmerged Motherlands,\u201d a site-specific jumble that includes two cantilevered rafts, seemingly cobbled out of junk; a tree, of fabric and wire, that reaches to the rotunda; and nooks of stenciled portraits.A sellout crowd was there for a film premiere and multimedia concert, documenting and inspired by Swoon\u2019s travel on the rafts. As the audience sat spellbound, Swoon, her red curls bobbing, flitted around, snapping photos, taking it all in.\u201cThere\u2019s that feeling that you get when you see something that you don\u2019t understand the origin of: wonderment,\u201d she said. \u201cIt brings about a kind of innocence, and I love that. I love to witness it. I love to be a part of making those moments happen.\u201dSince she began illegally pasting images around the city 15 years ago, Swoon has inspired a lot of wonderment. Born Caledonia Curry, she started her career as a street artist, but quickly leapfrogged to the attention of gallerists and museum curators, which let her expand to installation and performance art, often with an activist, progressive bent. Her intricate paper-cut portraits and cityscapes, often affixed to walls in hardscrabble places, are meant to disintegrate in place, a refrain to the life around them. Meanwhile, her socially minded work has focused on building cultural hubs for far-flung artistically welcoming communities.The Brooklyn Museum has done solo shows for Jean-Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring, but hers was the first devoted to a living street artist, let alone a woman who rooted her career in Brooklyn. Alicia Keys and Swizz Beatz, newly minted Swoon collectors, came to the opening.\u201cWhen you look at the work of a lot of her peers, hers stands apart,\u201d said Sarah Suzuki, an associate curator at the Museum of Modern Art, which bought several Swoon pieces for its permanent collection in 2005. \u201cThere is a real observational aspect to what she\u2019s doing,\u201d documenting her extensive travels and missions.Unlike other street artists, Swoon\u2019s work isn\u2019t based in \u201ccynicism or a critique of commercial culture,\u201d Ms. Suzuki said. \u201cThere\u2019s an emotional core there.\u201dThe Brooklyn Museum is showing Swoon\u2019s site-specific installation \u201cSubmerged Motherlands.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0The last year has been a pivotal one for Swoon, personally and professionally. The Brooklyn Museum show, open through Aug. 24, is also a response to the death of her mother. Now 36, Swoon is grappling with her own choices \u2014 she pours most of her income back into her projects \u2014 while planning her next moves. Here, a glimpse into her artistic life.APRIL 30, 7:30 P.M.BENEFIT FOR THE KONBIT SHELTER, TRIBECA GRAND HOTELAs they prepared for another visit this year, the team needed money and resources. Donations were only a trickle. Most of Swoon\u2019s projects are financed through the sale of her work, whose prices run to the tens of thousands of dollars. In a pinch, she will turn directly to collectors to subsidize events. \u201cI think of money as a verb,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause you have it and it has to go out in the world to do things.\u201d Other artists in her position, especially those who rose to acclaim through the cool cred of the streets, might seek out corporate sponsorship or branding, but not Swoon. Her friend JR, the French artist and TED prizewinner, said he was impressed by her ethos. \u201cThe fact that she does it the way she does, and just struggles her own way\u201d allows her \u201ccomplete freedom\u201d as an artist, he said.Swoon employs six people in her studio, and many more for projects. \u201cI make a lot of money, and I spend a lot of money,\u201d she said. She\u2019s considering incorporating herself into a nonprofit organization. She still lives in the same apartment in the Gowanus section of Brooklyn that she\u2019s had since her early 20s, and she sometimes worries about how she will pay the $1,000 monthly rent.JUNE 12, 8 P.M.BROOKLYN MUSEUM FILM AND CONCERTThough her installations may look thrown together, they are in fact meticulously planned. In her studio are precise scale models for the rafts, which are officially registered watercraft. For her Brooklyn Museum show, Swoon was the first artist to use the full height of the rotunda, according to Sharon Matt Atkins, the museum\u2019s managing curator of exhibitions. That meant many consultations with architects and engineers to figure out how to support the tree and display the rafts.\u201cIt was also,\u201d Ms. Atkins said, \u201cthe first time an artist has used a fire extinguisher to paint our walls.\u201dSwoon employed a small army of friends as installers. \u201cI love to be able to create a micro-economy out of that,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re creating jobs, and it\u2019s jobs that are fun and bringing people together.\u201d But she exceeded the museum\u2019s $100,000 budget. \u201cI actually couldn\u2019t even tell you how much I went over,\u201d she said. \u201cBut quite a bit.\u201dShe put a call in to Sandra Powell and Andrew King, major street art collectors from Melbourne, Australia, who stepped in to buy a print, to add to their collection of some two dozen Swoons. \u201cOnce you understand Callie and become even a small part of her world, it becomes impossible not to admire and support her in every way you can,\u201d Ms. Powell said in an email.Growing up in Daytona Beach, Fla., known to friends and family as Callie, Swoon long considered herself the scrappy sort. At 10, she began taking oil painting classes; her classmates were mostly retirees doing beachscapes and sunsets. But her talent was evident. \u201cI got this epic amount of encouragement, and I just rose to it,\u201d she said. In high school, she started selling her paintings and ceramics \u2014 to her teachers. In Brooklyn, she studied painting at the Pratt Institute. \u201cPeople would email me, and I\u2019d take them to my house, and I\u2019d be like, \u2018Do you want to buy this art that\u2019s on my floor?\u2019\u00a0\u201dThe gallery owner Jeffrey Deitch helped to build her reputation with a solo show at his SoHo gallery in 2005, and an installation at the \u201cGreater New York\u201d exhibition at PS 1 in 2005 helped to sell MoMA on her. She brought her prints to MoMA in a backpack, on her bicycle, not long after she\u2019d quit her waitressing job. Since Mr. Deitch\u2019s gallery closed, she has mostly sold work on her own.JULY 14, 3 P.M.NEW ORLEANSSwoon packed the cardboard and balsa scale models for the new iteration of the musical shantytown project, \u201cThe Music Box,\u201d into her suitcase for her travels. She meant to stay in New Orleans and help build it, but changed her plans: She hadn\u2019t had real time in her studio in Brooklyn in months. \u201cI really have to fight to keep personal time for drawing,\u201d she said. She asked a local blacksmith to scale up her models. \u201cWe talked about what could be made without me and what couldn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve dropped off a model and left,\u201d she fretted. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of right angles.\u201dLike the building in Braddock, Pa., the New Orleans installation carries a message about a community in rebirth, but not a didactic one. JR, who called Swoon an inspiration, compared her to Ai Weiwei. \u201cShe has always managed to have some social impact with her work and at the same time stay an artist, not an activist,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s very rare.\u201dAUG. 2, 6 P.M.1278 MYRTLE AVENUE, BROOKLYNWith a pair of bolt cutters, Swoon slipped through a fence into an empty lot in Bushwick.She carried a paper portrait of a cityscape and a teenager from Braddock, and quickly pasted it on a cement wall. \u201cI loved the little rebellion of it,\u201d she said of her early experience wheat-pasting, though now she mostly does it legally. (She had permission to work here.) Wherever she travels, she leaves images like these behind. \u201cIt just feels like the spine of my work,\u201d she said. \u201cI still love all of the stories that get related to me about what different pieces mean to people, and how it affects the neighborhood and how they feel about the decay and passing of each piece.\u201dFor Swoon, art is a way to process monumental change, on a global and personal level. \u201cSubmerged Motherlands,\u201d commissioned after Hurricane Sandy, was meant to be about rising sea levels; after the death of her mother, from cancer, Swoon found herself adding more maternal imagery. \u201cDawn and Gemma,\u201d a grand portrait of a breast-feeding woman, dominates the installation\u2019s entry, providing, Swoon said, a new sense of nurture to the piece.\u201cWhen I was a kid, and I was like, \u2018I want to be an artist,\u2019 I had all these dreams and all these thoughts: \u2018What\u2019s it going to be like, and what am I going to make?\u2019\u00a0\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I just feel like I have exceeded my wildest dreams by, like, 5000.\u201d Projects all over the world beckoned. Now, she said, she could perhaps afford to pause for a moment and think, \u201cwhere is my compass needle pointing?\u201dSwoon packed up her wheat-pasting gear, and rode off. Next stop: Tunisia.Advertisement"}

She held her first gun just over two years ago when her boyfriend asked her to accompany him to a Las Vegas shooting range.\u201cIt costs less than a show on the Strip and I get so much out of it,\u201d she said. \u201cFor months later I can still feel that thrill when I just look at the picture of me I have on my desk holding an Uzi.\u201dGun tourism has flourished in Nevada in recent years, buoyed by laws that place relatively loose restrictions on high-powered weapons and shooting ranges that cater to visitors from other states and countries.The industry was shaken by Monday\u2019s accident, but gun range owners say that they do not anticipate any significant changes in the business.Anxiety about personal security in a challenging economy and fears that national gun laws may restrict people\u2019s rights have helped the gun tourism industry to grow in Las Vegas, Mr. Sessions and other gun-range owners said.\u201cThe local industry has seen a lot more business in the last four to five years,\u201d Mr. Sessions said.For visitors, the chance to shoot a high-priced, high-powered weapon is \u201can opportunity that people may not come across again in their lifetime,\u201d he said.Owning an automatic weapon, such as the powerful M5, which is available at many Las Vegas-area shooting ranges, is expensive, with big guns going for more than $20,000 each.\u201cWe get a lot of people from California and other states that [prohibit] guns, and Europe,\u201d Mr. Sessions said. \u201cThey can own a basic firearm but not a fully automatic gun.\u201dThe range\u2019s most popular package is the SWAT, where for $169 a shooter can fire 50 rounds of the MP5 submachine gun, the M4 machine gun and any 9 millimeter pistol, always with a trained instructor. The deal also includes eye and hearing protection as well as a T-shirt.\u201cIt gives them an opportunity to shoot a couple of machine guns and a handgun and they walk away pretty excited,\u201d Mr. Sessions said. \u201cWe get married couples who come in and split a package. It\u2019s a thrilling experience they can share together that they couldn\u2019t do anywhere else.\u201dMovies and video games have increased interest in the industry, he said.\u201cPeople play these games, all over the world, and see these guns and they want to know what it\u2019s like,\u201d Mr. Sessions said. \u201cFor a lot of people it is bringing a virtual world into their reality.\u201dGuns from different eras and wars are popular with international visitors who often want to hold and shoot a gun that a father or grandfather used in previous wars, Mr. Sessions said.\u201cIt becomes an amazing experience for them,\u201d he said.On a recent sunny afternoon in Las Vegas, David Miller, 59, and his son Paul Miller, 27, from Sydney, Australia, took time from their motorcycle tour of Route 66 to shoot at the Vegas Machine Gun Experience.\u201cI\u2019d never touched a machine gun before,\u201d said David Miller, a former Royal Air Force logistics officer. \u201cIt\u2019s really an interesting feeling to come into the gun shop here and listen to the people buying guns like they are buying groceries,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Australia, if you do have a gun shop, it\u2019s fairly subdued, with just single-shot rifles for shooting rabbits, not automatic guns and such.\u201dShooting at the Las Vegas range made an impression on him.\u201cYou see the shows and the movies and such and they wave them around, but to actually fire a real machine gun is quite an exciting experience,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really a mixed feeling. It\u2019s kind of scary, but also exciting, almost like riding a motorcycle. From the power and sound of the motorcycle, a gun is not that different.\u201dFamilies can buy packages ranging from small guns, suitable for children age 8 and older according to Nevada law, such as the 22-caliber rifle, up to a grenade launcher at Gun Garage, which opened in 2012.A large number of customers are women, Mr. Neagle said..A recent bachelorette party included a 74-year-old woman who had never touched a gun.\u201cIt\u2019s empowering,\u201d Mr. Neagle said. \u201cIt\u2019s like jumping out of an airplane.

{"Headline": "In the Sharing Economy, Workers Find Both Freedom and Uncertainty", "Date": "2014-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJust after 4 a.m. on a recent Friday, while most of the neighbors in her leafy Boston suburb were still asleep, Jennifer Guidry was in the driveway of her rental apartment, her blond hair pulled back in a tidy French braid, vacuuming the inside of her car. The early-bird routine is a strategy that Ms. Guidry, a Navy veteran and former accountant, uses to mitigate the uncertainty of working in what\u2019s known as the sharing economy.Ms. Guidry, 35, earns money by using her own car to ferry around strangers for Uber, Lyft and Sidecar, ride services that let people summon drivers on demand via apps. She also assembles furniture and tends gardens for clients who find her on TaskRabbit, an online marketplace for chores.\u201cYou don\u2019t know day to day,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very up in the air.\u201dIn the promising parlance of the sharing economy, whose sites and apps connect people seeking services with sellers of those services, Ms. Guidry is a microentrepreneur. That is, an independent contractor who earns money by providing her skills, time or property to consumers in search of a lift, a room to sleep in, a dry-cleaning pickup, a chef, an organizer of closets.In a climate of continuing high unemployment, however, people like Ms. Guidry are less microentrepreneurs than microearners. They often work seven-day weeks, trying to assemble a living wage from a series of one-off gigs. They have little recourse when the services for which they are on call change their business models or pay rates. To reduce the risks, many workers toggle among multiple services.To try to insulate herself from the uncertainty, Ms. Guidry makes herself available to drive most weekdays in the predawn darkness. At that time, she figures, ride seekers are likely to be business travelers headed to the airport, a profitable fare.Around 4:30 a.m., Ms. Guidry ushered me upstairs to her home office, careful not to wake her family sleeping down the hall. She pulled up TaskRabbit on her laptop to check if any new offers had come in. She scrolled through Craigslist, where she occasionally picks up work as a private chef. Nothing doing.She glanced at the sofa bed by her desk, musing aloud whether she could rent it out on Airbnb. \u201cThe thing is, I have kids,\u201d she said, gesturing to a child-size desk on the other side of the room where her son Aden, who is 5, does his schoolwork. So much for the couch-rental idea.Resigned, Ms. Guidry activated her Uber iPhone, a device that the company issues to its drivers. On her personal Samsung Galaxy phone, she activated the driver modes for her Lyft and Sidecar apps.Moments later, the Uber phone pinged with a ride request. She accepted immediately. But, ever in risk-mitigation mode, she waited two minutes before leaving, lest the rider change his mind.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing worse than driving all the way over to some place and then having them cancel,\u201d she explained, heading down to the driveway.A little over an hour later, Ms. Guidry returned home, having completed an airport drop-off. She had made $28, not accounting for the cost of gas. She would do a second airport run, then come back to wake her family and make breakfast.The \u2018Precariat\u2019Piecemeal labor is hardly a new phenomenon. But as expedited by technology and packaged as apps, it has taken on a shinier veneer under new rubrics: the sharing economy, the peer economy, the collaborative economy, the gig economy.Gigs hold out the prospect of self-management and variety, with workers taking on diverse assignments of their choice and carving out their own schedules. Rather than toiling at the behest of some faceless corporation, they work for their peers.Certainly, it\u2019s a good deal for consumers. Peer marketplaces democratize luxury services by making amateur chauffeurs, chefs and personal assistants available to perform occasional work once largely dominated by full-time professionals. Venture capital firms seem convinced.Uber has raised more than $1.5 billion from investors; Lyft has raised $333 million; and TaskRabbit, $38 million. Part of the attraction for investors is that the companies can avoid huge employee payrolls by effectively functioning as labor brokers.If these marketplaces are gaining traction with workers, labor economists say, it is because many people who can\u2019t find stable employment feel compelled to take on ad hoc tasks. In July, 9.7 million Americans were unemployed, and an additional 7.5 million were working part-time jobs because they could not find full-time work, according to estimates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.He views peer marketplaces as part of a larger global phenomenon, in which labor brokers encourage people to work on contingency without basic employment benefits or protections. The companies essentially channel one-off tasks to the fastest taker or lowest bidder, he says, pitting workers against one another in a kind of labor elimination match.The flexible timetables of project work are a trade-off for regular employment income and benefits. Retailers, restaurant chains and other employers may require more rigid work schedules than piecemeal gigs, or, worse, keep their workers guessing from week to week about which hours they will work. But many of those employers also offer workers benefits like disability pay or commuter discounts.Uber, Lyft and TaskRabbit, for instance, do not regard the workers who provide services to their users as employees. The companies say they are simply arenas, like eBays for gigs. They require their service providers to work as independent contractors and, as such, the workers don\u2019t qualify for employee benefits like health insurance, payroll deductions for Social Security or unemployment benefits.Jamie Viggiano, senior director of marketing at TaskRabbit, says the company is trying to improve the situation for its 30,000 contractors in 19 cities in the United States. It recently instituted a sitewide minimum wage of $15 an hour. It also adopted a $1 million insurance policy, covering both clients and contractors, for any property damage or bodily harm that occurs while performing a job. Still, Ms. Viggiano says that \u201cacross the industry, we have only scratched the surface of helping freelancers work in the gig economy.\u201dOne issue for contractors is that the companies can alter their terms with impunity. Workers are often reluctant to challenge these changes because the companies can drop them \u2014 or deactivate them, in industry lingo \u2014 at any time.Executives at Lyft say they are sensitive to the implications of price changes for drivers. The company, which has more than 60,000 drivers, recently decreased fares 30 percent in many cities as part of a price war with Uber, its chief rival. To compensate drivers, Lyft temporarily suspended charging them its 20 percent commission fee on fares.\u201cWe have an internal culture of putting drivers first,\u201d John Zimmer, Lyft\u2019s president and co-founder, told me last Monday.The sudden imposition of tiered commissions on drivers didn\u2019t sit well with Ms. Guidry. \u201cIt\u2019s a penalty for part-time drivers,\u201d she said.By now, workers are accustomed to companies\u2019 rapidly switching edicts.\u201cThey can do whatever they want with pricing and compensation; they can deactivate you as a driver whenever they want,\u201d said a man who drives for three ride-sharing services in San Francisco and asked that his name be withheld for fear of being blacklisted. \u201cNobody has my back.\u201dPainter, Caterer, Dog SitterOn Saturday morning, canvas tool bag in hand, Ms. Guidry drove to a house a couple of miles from her apartment on a TaskRabbit assignment.The clients, a professional couple, were repeat customers. They had previously hired Ms. Guidry to assemble a rolling wooden cart for their young son, an energetic toddler, and to install child-resistant latches on their kitchen cabinets. Now she was to childproof a chest that contained their wedding china and crystal goblets.For the past year, Ms. Guidry has devoted most weekends to such gigs.\u201cIt\u2019s regular people who don\u2019t own a drill and have never hung anything on drywall. It can be daunting for people,\u201d she said of the chores. She feels invigorated by the variety of the work and the applicability of her skills: \u201cI\u2019ve done everything from painting and catering to dog sitting.\u201dFor about 30 minutes, she worked on the cabinet. Later, she adjusted a child-safety gate at the top of a staircase. After that, she hung a wind chime off the back porch.For two hours of work, her take came to $50. Some of her competitors on TaskRabbit do similar chores for $15 an hour.\u201cI probably get fewer gigs than people who bid less,\u201d Ms. Guidry acknowledged. \u201cBut it\u2019s a sustainable model for me.\u201dSix years ago, she had a full-time job as the controller at a small company. After she gave birth to her youngest son, her office asked her to work extended hours. She couldn\u2019t both accommodate the company and take care of her newborn. So she ended up leaving her job.\u201cI started applying for part-time jobs, but those are very rare and highly competitive,\u201d Ms. Guidry recalled. \u201cMidcareer, there is very little available part time for stay-at-home moms.\u201dHer partner, too, was out of work for a while, although he now has a full-time job as a network administrator. At the time, she was also coping with the aftereffects of a back and hip injury she had sustained in 2000 when in training for the Navy. With reduced mobility, she needed a cane to get around.So Ms. Guidry, who has training in electronics, accounting and cooking, began taking on projects in different fields. Peer marketplaces have greatly improved her ability to find gigs that she can fit into her child-care schedule. TaskRabbit has become one of her income mainstays.Until recently, TaskRabbit functioned as an auction site where clients posted tasks and its \u201crabbits\u201d bid for them. The system allowed workers to communicate with potential clients in order to make more accurate estimates for bids.\u201cYou could chitchat, find out more about the task and see if they were flexible on time,\u201d says Erin Mata, a single mother in Austin, Tex., who has delivered flowers and designed birthday invitations for TaskRabbit clients.But last month, TaskRabbit overhauled its approach, replacing open bidding with an algorithm to match a client with people who have specific experience in the requested task and are within the client\u2019s budget.Ms. Viggiano, the TaskRabbit marketing executive, says the new model makes it faster for consumers to find the right helpers and for workers to secure gigs. The company now asks workers, rebranded as \u201ctaskers,\u201d to respond to offers within 30 minutes.\u201cThere was a lot of inefficiency,\u201d Ms. Viggiano says. \u201cThere was a lot of back-and-forth before the task was assigned.\u201dAfter the redesign, some active taskers ended up receiving even more offers. Under the new system, for instance, Ms. Guidry\u2019s stream of new clients initially slowed to a trickle. But she expanded her range of tasks on the site and ended up with a flood of new offers, often at a higher rate of $35 an hour.\u201cI\u2019ve been five times as busy, without having to hunt down jobs,\u201d she told me.Some others are seeing fewer work offers.Although she has a regular office gig with a longstanding TaskRabbit client, as of late July, Ms. Mata in Austin said she had not received new offers. \u201cI guess it makes sense on the business end, but it takes all the personal interaction out of it.\u201dFavors and FeesInherent in Favor\u2019s name is the peer-economy rebranding of labor as a kind of good-will effort toward others, rather than an old-fashioned exchange of work for remuneration. Instead of one-off gigs, however, Favor offers workers delivery shifts of several hours or more at a time.Consumers can use the Favor app to select items from local restaurants or stores. Then, for a fee from $5 to $10, depending on the cost of the order, the service sends a messenger to pick up and deliver it.Favor runners earn tips plus a percentage of the fees. But the company has tried to insert some predictability into the process by allowing workers to schedule shifts a week ahead of time. Should their tips fall short, Favor currently guarantees them a minimum wage of $9 an hour.\u201cIf they don\u2019t make that in tips, we will bump them up,\u201d says Zac Maurais, the co-founder of Favor. \u201cSo they don\u2019t have to worry that they aren\u2019t going to be fairly compensated.\u201dThe income floor appeals to Ms. Mata. In January, she was laid off from a job as a manager of customer-service employees at General Motors. She now works 20 to 40 hours a week for Favor, earning an average of $15 an hour in tips and commissions. She signed up for health insurance through the state health exchange.One humid evening in Boston, I accompanied Kelsey Cruse, a Favor messenger, as she picked up and delivered burritos from a Chipotle outlet. Favor had just come to town, and Ms. Cruse, a student at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, had been one of the first people selected to make deliveries.\u201cOn average, you\u2019re going to make $7 per favor,\u201d Ms. Cruse explained, using the company\u2019s euphemism for a delivery. \u201cIf you are running two favors in an hour, that\u2019s $14 an hour. It\u2019s pretty awesome.\u201dShe hadn\u2019t yet racked up enough \u201cfavors\u201d to earn that much consistently. So far that week, she had worked about 20 hours and earned $179 \u2014 the company minimum.Many gigs may seem to offer decent pay. But they may not look that great after factoring in the time spent, expenses, insurance costs and taxes on self-employment earnings.\u201cIf you did the calculations, many of these people would be earning less than minimum wage,\u201d says Dean Baker, an economist who is the co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington. \u201cYou are getting people to self-exploit in ways we have regulations in place to prevent.\u201dWhat about the potential risk to Favor drivers or bike messengers if they have an accident while making deliveries? Mr. Maurais, Favor\u2019s co-founder, says that the company itself has $1 million in insurance coverage per incident; it requires delivery drivers, but not bike messengers, to provide proof of vehicle insurance.Good Gigs, or \u2018Wage Slavery\u2019?After her TaskRabbit work on that Saturday morning, Ms. Guidry spent time at a local farmer\u2019s market, where she bought squash and basil for a meal she was making on a private-chef gig. Later that afternoon, she ferried passengers for a few hours. She spent an hour in her home office, combing through discount websites like CouponMom and printing out a stack of grocery coupons. She took them to the supermarket to buy more ingredients for the client meals.Around midnight, she returned to driver mode, taking Bostonians to downtown clubs and local house parties. Others she drove home to far-flung suburbs. Her self-assigned shift ran until around 5 a.m.\u201cCombining all this stuff together, I don\u2019t know that it adds up to a career,\u201d Ms. Guidry ruminated. \u201cBut it definitely makes things easier.\u201dTechnology has made online marketplaces possible, creating new opportunities to monetize labor and goods. But some economists say the short-term gig services may erode work compensation in the long term. Mr. Baker, of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, argues that online labor marketplaces are able to drive down costs for consumers by having it both ways: behaving as de facto employers without shouldering the actual cost burdens or liabilities of employing workers.\u201cIn a weak labor market, there\u2019s not much of a floor on what employers, or quasi employers, can get away with,\u201d Mr. Baker contends. \u201cIt could be a big downward pressure on wages. It\u2019s a bad story.\u201dLabor activists say gig enterprises may also end up disempowering workers, degrading their access to fair employment conditions.(Disclosure: For two weeks in the summer of 1988, I had a gig as the au pair for Professor Aronowitz\u2019s daughter, then a toddler.)Peer-economy experts and executives recognize that many gig workers are laboring largely without a safety net. Mr. Clark, the industry veteran who founded RelayRides, reels off a list of lacunas: health insurance, retirement saving plans, tax withholding and even the kind of camaraderie and mentoring that can be available in full-time office jobs.\u201cLooking at this as a new paradigm of employment, which I think it is, the question is, What are you giving up?\u201d Mr. Clark says. \u201cAt the end of the day, there\u2019s a metalayer of support services that is missing.\u201dHe predicts that new businesses will soon arise to cater to the needs of project workers: \u201cThere are opportunities to focus on providers, finding ways to make it easier, more stable and less scary to earn in the peer economy.\u201dThat may not be enough. Dr. Standing, the labor economist, says workers need formal protections to address the power asymmetries inherent in contingent work. International rules, he says, could endow gig workers with basic entitlements \u2014 like the right to organize and the right to due process should companies seek to remove them from their platforms.\u201cThere should be codes of good practice at an international level that all companies should be required to sign,\u201d he said.As for Ms. Guidry, she had joint implant surgery a few months ago to address the back and hip injury she sustained in Navy training. For the first time in years, she can stand and walk at length without chronic pain. Now she is trying to decide whether to continue patching together an income from multiple gigs, or to start looking for more formal employment.\u201cI like my freedom \u2014 fixing someone\u2019s cabinet, driving, pulling up weeds, cooking,\u201d she told me as we sat in her dining room on Monday morning, recapping her weekend of work. \u201cI would not like to do any of those things as a full-time job.\u201dYet she recognizes that her current routine may not be sustainable. Between 10 a.m. on Saturday and 5 a.m. on Sunday, she had earned about $263. But that had required working marathon hours and running a sleep deficit.\u201cIt was a good day I would say, all in all, but a long day,\u201d Ms. Guidry acknowledged. \u201cI can\u2019t do many of those.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "S.&P. 500 Ends August With a 3.8% Gain, the Largest Since 2000 ", "Date": "2014-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index delivered its fourth nominal high in five days on Friday, ending with a monthly gain of 3.8 percent, the biggest since February, and its best August since 2000.The milestone-crushing run capped a week when the S.&P. eclipsed the 2,000-point mark for the first time. Six months of solid job gains, strong company earnings and a bevy of corporate deal news contributed to the rally, part of a bull market that\u2019s been rumbling on for more than five years.The market appeared ready for a correction at the end of July, but the downturn didn\u2019t last long. For most of August, stocks have managed to shake off geopolitical conflicts in Ukraine, Gaza and Iraq.\u201cThe market has a good underlying tone,\u201d said Michael Levine, portfolio manager of Oppenheimer Equity Income Fund. \u201cPeople feel like the economy is gaining some strength and the job market is getting better and corporate earnings should be pretty good.\u201dEven in a quiet day of trading ahead of the Labor Day holiday, stocks eked out a gain. The indexes opened higher, but eased soon after, as investors digested news that consumer spending fell and income growth slowed in July.The markets began to recoup some losses by midmorning, however, when a gauge of consumer sentiment indicated greater optimism in August, particularly among higher-income groups. Some better-than-expected company earnings also lifted stocks.Over all, the indexes wavered between small gains and losses throughout the afternoon.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a listless, preholiday market,\u201d said Drew P. Wilson, an investment analyst at Fenimore Asset Management.The S.&P. 500-stock index rose 6.63 points, or 0.33 percent, to 2,003.37. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 18.88 points, or 0.11 percent, to 17,098.45. The Nasdaq composite index added 22.58 points, or 0.5 percent, to 4,580.27.\u201cIt\u2019s been a good August,\u201d said Linda Duessel, senior equity market strategist at Federated Investors. \u201cI imagine it\u2019s the end of the month and people closing their books are saying, \u2018I better show I\u2019m invested, we had a brand-new high this week.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Nevertheless, some investors may be more hesitant in September, once widely considered the stock market\u2019s worst month. Since World War II, the S.&P. 500 has ended September with a loss half of the time. But recently, September has been good to investors. The S.&P. 500 has turned in a September loss just twice in the last decade: in the depths of the financial crisis in 2008 and after a fight over raising the government\u2019s borrowing limit in 2011. Last September, investors saw an array of threats lined up after Labor Day, including a fight over the federal budget and a possible attack on Syria by the United States military. The result? The S.&P. 500 gained 3 percent.Among the stocks making big moves Friday were Avago Technologies, which makes semiconductors used in smartphones, computer servers and other devices. Its shares surged $5.73, or 7.5 percent, to $82.09. The gain came after the company reported earnings that beat analysts\u2019 estimates. Avago rose the most in the S.&P. 500 index and touched a record high.Splunk, a developer of data management software, soared 19.07 percent, or $8.64, to $53.93, after reporting earnings late Thursday that beat expectations. It also raised its full-year profit and revenue estimates.Tesla Motors and a state-owned Chinese phone carrier announced plans on Friday to build 400 charging stations for electric cars in a bid to promote adoption of the technology in China. Shares of Tesla increased $5.84, or 2.21 percent, to $269.70.In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.35 percent, from 2.34 percent late Thursday, while its price fell 3/32, to 100 8/32.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Portugal, Central Bank Moves to Clean Up Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo", "Date": "2014-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMADRID \u2014 Portugal\u2019s central bank stepped up efforts to clean up the troubled lender Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo and end its family control after the bank reported a stunning first-half loss of $4.8 billion that will force it to raise more capital.After the bank\u2019s earnings report, the central bank issued a statement ordering Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo to raise more funds and announced the suspension of three members of the Esp\u00edrito Santo family, which has controlled the bank for generations.The central bank removed the three members\u2019 voting rights as directors and said that it would push for legal action against any director involved in fraudulent activities.\u201cThe reshuffle of the leadership equals a nationalization of the financial institution through the back door,\u201d Antonio Barroso, an analyst at Teneo Intelligence in London, said in a report.Auditing responsibilities will be handed over to PricewaterhouseCoopers, the central bank said, until shareholders appoint a new auditing committee for the bank.The central bank also faulted KPMG, the auditing firm long used by the Esp\u00edrito Santo group, for leading it to wrongly assert on July 11 that Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo had enough capital to withstand possible lending losses. The central bank said that it then was informed about other facts, \u201conly identified by the external auditor,\u201d it said, \u201cwith a negative impact of around \u20ac1.5 billion.\u201dThe bank attributed the loss of \u20ac3.58 billion to \u20ac4.25 billion in impairments and contingency measures, required mostly because of loans made to prop up other parts of the Esp\u00edrito Santo group.The bank said that at least \u20ac856 million in provisions were needed to cover possible losses on credits granted without proper internal clearance.The record loss, Mr. Barroso said, \u201cshowed that the bank increased its funding significantly to its parent holding and other subsidiaries of the group over the last six months.\u201dBanco Esp\u00edrito Santo said it would use all means available \u201cto ensure the bank is reimbursed for losses caused as a result of any potential illegal behavior that is identified.\u201dRegulators and prosecutors are already investigating possible accounting fraud and abuse of privileged information in Portugal, Luxembourg and other offshore centers used by the family group.The Esp\u00edrito Santo family, whose investments include hotels in Europe and farms in South America, has had a strong influence over Portugal\u2019s economy for more than a century, and it managed to rebuild its business empire after the 1974 revolution that led to the nationalization of the family\u2019s assets.In a separate statement late Wednesday, Mr. Bento said the bank would not only go ahead with a capital increase but would also prepare \u201ca thorough evaluation of the bank\u2019s assets that could be divested.\u201dBanco Esp\u00edrito Santo is Portugal\u2019s largest listed bank in terms of assets. It also has several subsidiaries overseas, including in Angola, Switzerland and the United States, and its financial troubles could make it a takeover target, according to analysts.Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo shed little light on how it planned to resolve the problems at its Angola unit. It said in its earnings report that it could lose majority control of BESA as part of a planned capital increase.The Portuguese bank also said that it was negotiating with regulators in both Portugal and Angola \u201cto reach a solution that meets the interests of the Angolan authorities and that safeguards Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo\u2019s interest and those of its shareholders.\u201dThe \u20ac3.58 billion loss wipes out the bank\u2019s \u20ac2.1 billion capital cushion and leaves its solvency ratios well below those demanded by regulators.The bank said that its common equity Tier 1 ratio, a measure of a firm\u2019s ability to weather financial shocks, now stood at 5 percent, 2 percentage points below the Bank of Portugal\u2019s minimum requirement, according to a regulatory filing.Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo raised \u20ac1 billion in a rights issue in June \u2014 before its problems came to the surface \u2014 which is now expected to result in lawsuits from investors because of misleading disclosures about possible losses.Mark Scott contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Because he broke his most important promise, we have decided not to make an endorsement for the Democratic primary on Sept. 9.His opponent in the primary is Zephyr Teachout, a professor at Fordham Law School who is a national expert on political corruption and an advocate of precisely the kind of transparency and political reform that Albany needs. Her description of Mr. Cuomo as part of a broken system \u201cwhere public servants just end up serving the wealthy\u201d is exactly on point, but we decline to endorse her because she has not shown the breadth of interests and experience needed to govern a big and diverse state.Why endorse no candidate in a major state primary? Here\u2019s how we see it: Realistically, Governor Cuomo is likely to win the primary, thanks to vastly greater resources and name recognition. And he\u2019ll probably win a second term in November against a conservative Republican opponent. In part, that\u2019s because issues like campaign finance rarely have been a strong motivator for most voters. Nonetheless, those who want to register their disappointment with Mr. Cuomo\u2019s record on changing the culture of Albany may well decide that the best way to do that is to vote for Ms. Teachout. Despite our reservations about her, that impulse could send a powerful message to the governor and the many other entrenched incumbents in Albany that a shake-up is overdue.\u2022The most important failures, though, were in ethics reform. New York still has no comprehensive campaign finance system and has one of the highest donation limits in the country. Mr. Cuomo proposed a better system, but, when legislators balked, he threw up his hands and claimed there was nothing he could do. Where was the energy and determination he showed on marriage rights and guns?\u2022She would limit contributions to candidates to $2,600, compared with the current $60,000, and would keep corporations from giving five-figure donations, a loophole that Mr. Cuomo has exploited to raise millions of dollars. These proposals are as thoughtful as one would expect from a leading expert on combating public corruption, particularly given her work promoting transparency as national director of the Sunlight Foundation in 2006 and 2007.As he has repeatedly shown, Mr. Cuomo knows how to bend lawmakers to his will, especially when it serves his political interest. But he has repeatedly failed to do so when it comes to cleaning up Albany. Having walked away from his most important goals, he should not be surprised if many Democrats walk away from him on Sept. 9.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Egypt Has Ambitious Plan for Suez Canal Expansion", "Date": "2014-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Tuesday, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi said he was ready to build another one. At a lavish groundbreaking ceremony that included a military air show and the symbolic detonation of demolition explosives, Mr. Sisi\u2019s government announced an ambitious plan to build a new waterway that would expand the capacity of the existing canal while creating jobs and revenue for the government. Mr. Sisi set an equally ambitious timeline for the project, which would involve the digging or dredging of approximately 45 miles of earth and wetlands, saying the new waterway would open next year. \u201cWe are racing time, because we are very late,\u201d he said.There has been talk for years of expanding the development along the canal, a crucial passage for international shipping that links the Red Sea to the Mediterranean, and one of the Egyptian government\u2019s principal sources of hard currency. With the government\u2019s other sources of revenue, including tourism, drying up after years of political turmoil, plans for the canal, along with other state-led projects to stimulate the economy, have taken precedence, analysts said. \u201cHe\u2019s here to do something radical, or unprecedented, compared to Mubarak \u2014 and to show that the military has the intention to change things,\u201d Mr. Adly said.The plan announced Tuesday also included the development of what officials called the Suez Canal corridor, with new ports and industrial and economic zones around the waterway. The timeline for that project, as well as details including its financing, were still vague, Mr. Adly said.Officials spoke in more detail about the new waterway, saying that the military would lead the effort to dig it, at a cost of $4 billion, and would supervise Egyptian companies selected to participate in the project. The funds would be raised by selling bonds to Egyptian banks and individuals, including citizens overseas, Mr. Sisi said. Sherine Hassan, a retired Egyptian admiral and maritime expert who supports the plan, said the new canal would drastically shorten the time needed for passage along the waterway and permit the Suez Canal Authority to double the number of ships passing every day. Still, some experts were skeptical that the work could be completed in a year, as Mr. Sisi had ordered. \u201cIt\u2019s a heavy project,\u201d Admiral Hassan said.Lena Naassana and Merna Thomas contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Mr. Rogers and Mr. Heck are management consultants who have long studied how technology shapes business, and in a provocative new book they put forward the ultimate optimist\u2019s case for why the tech industry might substantially improve most of our lives.They put forward a rigorous argument bolstered by mountains of data and recent case studies. And once you start looking at Silicon Valley their way, your mind reels at the far-reaching potential of the innovations now spreading through society.\u201cWhat we haven\u2019t yet done is put information technology, biotechnology and nanotechnology into industrial technology. And once we begin to do that, we\u2019ll open up technologies that are equally large as the invention of the airplane,\u201d Mr. Rogers said during a recent interview.But don\u2019t start shopping for your Utopia pajamas just yet. When you dig into Mr. Rogers and Mr. Heck\u2019s best forecasts for the future, you find complications.Often, the authors look at the world from a clinical perspective. They imagine, as optimists are wont to do, that in the face of radical, society-splintering technological change, consumers, businesses and politicians will embrace innovations with the best long-term view in mind. The authors underplay the messiness of tech, including the possibility that people will reject advances for social or emotional reasons, or that they\u2019ll use technologies in inefficient ways nobody would have ever guessed.Companies like Tesla are pushing toward an electric-car infrastructure that would vastly improve the efficiency of our vehicles. That\u2019s because electric motors convert more than 90 percent of energy into movement, while gas engines can\u2019t manage more than 45 percent efficiency.It\u2019s when you put electric engines, ride-sharing and self-driving vehicles together that Mr. Heck and Mr. Rogers see the biggest payoff.\u201cThere\u2019s a big incentive for a state like California to say, \u2018Our car pool lanes are now sharing, autonomous lanes,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Heck said. \u201cYou could even exempt them from the speed limit.\u201dThat would create something like an autonomous car-sharing \u201ctrain\u201d in which electric vehicles would platoon down suburban commuter corridors, shipping people off to work, delivering packages or transferring us between high-speed public transportation lines.This all sounds plausible. On the other hand, just as it is with our cars today, people could decide to use autonomous vehicles in inefficient ways, too.What if people find commuting in autonomous vehicles so comfortable that they move out farther from the office, contributing to urban sprawl? What if people ditch public transportation because cars become much more fun?\u201cAnd if I\u2019m traveling 60 miles to work, well, maybe I want a much larger vehicle,\u201d Dr. Bhat said. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll have a place to shave in my vehicle, or maybe I\u2019d like to take a nap. In the extreme case, what if we all want recreational vehicles?\u201dThis isn\u2019t to say that the authors are wrong; the macroforces they discuss seem unstoppable.

{"Headline": "Democrats Seize on Social Issues as Attitudes Shift", "Date": "2014-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical MemoWASHINGTON \u2014 Facing re-election, Gov. Scott Walker, Republican of Wisconsin, no longer talks about stopping same-sex marriage. \u201cIt\u2019s those on the left that are pushing\u201d the issue, he says.Ed Gillespie, the Republican Senate candidate in Virginia, argued that Senator Mark Warner, the Democratic incumbent, was \u201cmaking up my views\u201d when Mr. Warner accused him of seeking to overturn abortion rights and ban some forms of contraception. In fact, Mr. Gillespie, a former Republican National Committee chairman, said in a recent debate, he wants contraceptives available (behind the counter) at pharmacies without a prescription.Representative Cory Gardner, a Republican in a tight Senate race in Colorado, proposed the same thing after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision on the Hobby Lobby case exempted some private businesses from covering certain contraceptives in health insurance plans. He was shielding himself from attacks by Senator Mark Udall, a Democrat, who has spent months slamming Mr. Gardner\u2019s \u201cradical agenda\u201d on abortion and family planning.\u201cUdall is running his entire campaign on social issues,\u201d said Brad Dayspring of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. \u201cAll they talk about is birth control, \u2018personhood,\u2019 abortion.\u201dSo will many other Democrats this fall. They aim to match President Obama\u2019s feat in 2012, when the incumbent used topics such as same-sex marriage and contraception as weapons to offset his vulnerability on the economy. That they would even try while facing the older, whiter, more conservative midterm electorate shows how thoroughly the politics of social issues have turned upside down.The tumultuous social changes that began in the 1960s supplied decades of political ammunition for Republicans. Beginning with Richard M. Nixon, they rallied Americans disturbed by noisy protests over civil rights, the sexual revolution and the Vietnam War.\u201cAcid, amnesty and abortion\u201d was the epithet hurled at the 1972 Democratic presidential candidate, George McGovern. Republicans seized on concerns about welfare, school busing and crime \u2014 memorably with a black convict named Willie Horton in 1988 \u2014 to cement their grip on white voters. As recently as 2004, Republicans used a proposed constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage to rally tradition-minded \u201cvalues voters\u201d behind President George W. Bush\u2019s re-election.Now the values wedge cuts for Democrats. Demographic change keeps shrinking Nixon\u2019s \u201cSilent Majority.\u201d President Bill Clinton and a Republican Congress overhauled welfare. Fear of crime has receded enough that members of both parties propose more lenient sentencing.American households have changed significantly. Nearly half of adults are unmarried. Fully 10 percent of opposite-sex married couples are interracial or interethnic. Acceptance of same-sex marriage has expanded with astonishing speed.Legalization of medical marijuana has moved, in two states, Colorado and Washington, to legalization of recreational marijuana. College students from the Summer of Love are pushing 70, the elders who disapproved of their behavior are largely gone and young adults are wondering what the turmoil was ever about.Democrats profit politically \u2014 among young voters, college graduates, single women, blacks and Latinos \u2014 from the sense that they welcome these cultural shifts while Republicans resist them.\u201cThat\u2019s why people are voting for us these days \u2014 not for our economic prowess,\u201d said Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster. \u201cThey all reflect an underlying attitude. It\u2019s openness, it\u2019s tolerance, it\u2019s respect for others and who they are.\u201dOnly 18 percent of staunch conservatives say society should accept homosexuality, compared with 62 percent overall; 16 percent believe society is \u201cjust as well off\u201d if people have priorities other than marriage and children, compared with 50 percent over all; and 28 percent favor legalization of marijuana, compared with 54 percent over all.Six in 10 want their representatives to stick to their positions rather than compromise. Seven in 10 call immigrants \u201ca burden\u201d on society, and say America\u2019s best years have passed. While 61 percent of the population says the globe is warming, three in four staunch conservatives see \u201cno solid evidence.\u201dThose attitudes complicate the party\u2019s ability to forge a new majority coalition as education levels rise and attitudes change.\u201cI\u2019m worried when Republicans say global warming is a hoax,\u201d said Peter Wehner, a former aide to Mr. Bush. \u201cIt\u2019s not scientifically true.\u201dOnce seen as members of the \u201cDaddy\u201d party providing the sort of discipline Americans wanted in a president, Republicans lately have tried to display their nurturing side. This year, for the first time in Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency, Republicans chose a woman, Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, to deliver the party\u2019s response to the State of the Union address. And would-be Republican presidential candidates are offering new antipoverty plans.Mr. Obama\u2019s adversaries have plenty of other political tools. Americans remain fearful about their economic futures. Administration foreign policy has not averted chaos and violence in Ukraine, Gaza, Iraq and Syria. The president\u2019s low approval ratings fuel desire for change.On some divisive issues like abortion, attitudes have not shifted much; sonograms and advances in medical treatment have increased the discomfiture of some Americans with the procedure. Part of Republicans\u2019 defensive crouch on social issues, pollster Whit Ayres noted, reflects the fact that \u201cDemocrats have done a better job\u201d with campaign communications.Republicans tried to regain advantage by casting the Hobby Lobby decision as being about religious freedom rather than the availability of contraception. But Democrats\u2019 aggressive response underscored their higher confidence.Among co-sponsors of legislation to overturn it were three Democrats facing tough re-election fights: Mr. Udall, Senator Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Senator Mark Begich of Alaska. If such alignments have become routine for a new generation of Democratic strategists, they remain startling for those who once struggled to court culturally conservative \u201cReagan Democrats.\u201dAs Stan Greenberg, a Democratic pollster, put it, \u201cI still wake up in disbelief at the transformation that\u2019s taken place.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "New French Cabinet Sheds Critics and Leaves Austerity Policies in Place", "Date": "2014-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 The new government approved Tuesday by President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande squelched important voices of dissent on the left wing of his Socialist Party but signaled little change of direction on economic policies that critics say have left the French economy mired in stagnation.The marginal changes, analysts said, mean that France, Europe\u2019s second-largest economy, after Germany, could be in for a long slog, with consequences for both Mr. Hollande\u2019s already weak political standing and the wider European economy.\u201cHe is changing the government without changing the direction of policy, which is a bad thing,\u201d said Jean-Paul Fitoussi, a professor of economics at the Institut d'\u00c9tudes Politiques de Paris. \u201cWe are in a world of uncertainty, and they need to be reactive to a dangerous new phenomenon that has appeared, which is stagnant growth.\u201dMaking clear that he and the president would brook little dissent, Prime Minister Manuel Valls kept a trusted lieutenant, Michel Sapin, a career politician and close friend of Mr. Hollande, as finance minister.And he named Emmanuel Macron, 36, a former investment banker at Rothschild and a deputy secretary general at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace who has been a close adviser to Mr. Hollande on economic policies, as the new economy minister, replacing Mr. Montebourg.Yet in a sign that Mr. Valls is seeking to ensure his party\u2019s backing, he asked Parliament on Tuesday to hold a rare vote of confidence in the new government in September or October. \u201cThe majority will have to be there,\u201d he said of the vote in an interview on French television. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get a majority, it\u2019s over \u2014 we cannot continue.\u201dBoth men were expected to press ahead with Mr. Hollande\u2019s economic program, including a package of spending cuts totaling 50 billion euros, or $66 billion, through 2017, and a package of tax measures for employers designed to stoke hiring.The moves appeared to trim the ideological breadth of the cabinet at the expense of the left. But analysts expected that would do little to alter the course Mr. Hollande has plotted in trying to keep his party with him while also appeasing European Union officials who want countries to mend their public finances by reducing budgets.Mr. Hollande has tried to walk a line between the two camps, and watched his public standing dwindle. His policies have stoked ire from both the left and from French businesses and international investors, who say he has not gone far enough to revive the nation\u2019s competitiveness.If nothing else, the crisis has made more apparent the competing forces that have tugged at Mr. Hollande since the beginning of his term in 2012. It has also highlighted the limited policy tools available to him in an atmosphere, in France and in much of the rest of Europe, of high public debt, persistent unemployment and stagnant growth that threatens to transform the five-year euro crisis into a chronic economic illness.Analysts said they expected the new government to push ahead with more of Mr. Hollande\u2019s austerity measures, which were necessary to help reduce France\u2019s deficit. Critics say the measures have thwarted an economic recovery after nearly a year of stagnant growth and high unemployment, which hovers above 10 percent.Politically, the early judgments on the reshuffling were gloomy as jockeying began for the next presidential elections in 2017, cementing Mr. Hollande\u2019s image as an ineffective politician who now faces the added risk of seeing his party base further erode.Simon Tilford, an economist who is deputy director of the Center for European Reform, a research institute in London, said that the latest French political crisis would invariably also diminish Mr. Hollande in Brussels in favor of Germany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel. It was her insistence on austerity that helped spur the divisions that led to the French crisis.\u201cIn terms of the way Hollande is perceived abroad, this will reinforce the perception that he is a weak leader who is unable to marshal his troops effectively,\u201d Mr. Tilford said.At home, the abruptness and upheaval caused by the crisis were a fresh blow to Mr. Hollande at a time when his popularity ratings are already at record lows, and disillusioned voters show signs of defecting to other parties, including the far-right National Front.Fran\u00e7oise Fressoz, an editorial writer for Le Monde, wrote in a blog post on Tuesday that the reshuffle showed a structural flaw within the Socialist Party.While the prospect of change may rest with Mr. Sapin and Mr. Macron, both are close allies of Mr. Hollande and are unlikely to voice much dissent.\u201cHe stands plainly for everything that Montebourg was opposed to,\u201d Antonio Barroso, a senior vice president at the advisory firm Teneo Intelligence, said in a note to clients. \u201cHis appointment will reduce the potential for dissonant opinions inside the government and help Valls to push ahead with his policy agenda.\u201dLike nearly every member of the French cabinet, Mr. Sapin, who attended an elite French university with Mr. Hollande, has never worked in business. He is better versed in the nuances of European politics, having gotten his start in the early 1990s, when, as finance minister under President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, also a Socialist, he managed the referendum campaign to persuade the French to join in the creation of the euro.While Mr. Montebourg had warned that the austerity program would only suppress a recovery, others said it was important for the president to make some progress in curbing runaway government spending.\u201cFifty billion in three years is massive for France, so it\u2019s a positive sign that Mr. Hollande is committed to continuing what he\u2019s doing,\u201d said Famke Krumbm\u00fcller, a Europe analyst at the Eurasia Group in London. \u201cThe only alternative would be to do much less to please the left wing of his party.\u201dWith growth so tepid, Mr. Sapin has already warned France\u2019s European partners that the government can no longer meet its deficit targets, and he is expected to continue pressing the European Union and Germany for more flexibility on fiscal rules.Still, in an interview in July, Mr. Sapin rejected the notion that France risked becoming the next sick man of Europe. \u201cWe don\u2019t see it like that,\u201d he said. \u201cFrance is a huge economy in Europe, with an industrial base, innovation and research. I don\u2019t see how we can be sick \u2014 or at least sick for a long time.\u201dMa\u00efa de la Baume contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Bronck in the Bronx Gives a Swedish Town a Reason to Cheer", "Date": "2014-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRoy Gustafsson, the co-founder of the Jonas Bronck Center in Savsjo, Sweden. This weekend, the center will celebrate the 375th anniversary of Bronck\u2019s arrival and settlement as the first European in the borough of the Bronx.Nobody would mistake the municipality of Savsjo for the borough of the Bronx.Savsjo, surrounded by dense forests in southern Sweden between Stockholm and Malmo, has about 5,000 inhabitants (about one-tenth as many as the Co-op City section of the borough alone, but about 10 times as many as the number of Bronxites who claim Swedish heritage). Its medieval churches date to the 12th century (the oldest existing house in the Bronx was built in 1748). Savsjo\u2019s best-known sports team plays handball, not baseball.And yet the two localities share one largely forgotten favorite son, whose Swedish heritage has only recently been confirmed: Jonas Bronck.Bronck was born in 1600 just outside Savsjo (pronounced SEV-sho) in the hamlet of Komstad. He emigrated to Denmark, where he became a mariner, and then to the Netherlands, where he married a local woman. In 1639, after the local economy was roiled by a boom-and-bust mania for tulip bulbs, the couple sailed on the Fire of Troy for New Amsterdam.The Broncks built a stone house they named Emmaus (after a site where Jesus appeared after his resurrection) at what would become East 132nd Street and Lincoln Avenue, on a bluff overlooking what would become a 680-acre farm flanked by the Harlem River, the Bronx Kill, which separates the borough from Randalls Island, and the Aquahung, which later became known as Bronck\u2019s River.The 375th anniversary of Bronck\u2019s arrival and settlement as the first European in the Bronx will be celebrated this weekend in Savsjo by his descendants and dignitaries from both countries. (This year is also the centennial of Bronx County, New York State\u2019s youngest.)\u201cThe invisible hand of the Almighty Father,\u201d Bronck wrote to a friend in Amsterdam, \u201csurely guided me to this beautiful country, a land covered with virgin forest and unlimited opportunities. It is a veritable paradise and needs but the industrious hand of man to make it the finest and most beautiful region in all the world.\u201dBronck died childless at age 43 of unknown causes.\u201cThe story behind Jonas Bronck will serve as a model and be the power behind Jonas Bronck Center\u2019s goal \u2014 to make the cultural and historical treasure in Smaland and Savsjo, the focal point of tourism in this part of Sweden,\u201d said Curt Wrigfors, the chairman of the center, which is also conducting historical and genealogical research. The center, a former hotel, also houses a Vietnamese restaurant and a tattoo parlor.Until recently, when it has begun a modest rebound, the Bronx has been famous for the Yankees, the zoo and the New York Botanical Garden, but also disparaged for the Bronx cheer and Ogden Nash\u2019s ultimate contumely (later retracted) \u201cThe Bronx? No thonx,\u201d and mocked at home as a national symbol of urban blight (Howard Cosell: \u201cThe Bronx is burning;\u201d Tom Wolfe\u2019s \u201cThe Bonfire of the Vanities\u201d).So New Yorkers may be surprised that Jonas Bronck himself has been claimed as a native of Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany and the Frisian and Faroe Islands. His Swedish roots were established only in the last few decades by Lloyd Ultan, the Bronx borough historian, and further authenticated by an Irish historian and Mr. Andersson.\u201cIt\u2019s a big deal in Sweden,\u201d Mr. Ultan said. \u201cRural areas are always looking for ways to make themselves a tourist attraction \u2014 \u2018this is where Jonas Bronck came from, come and see\u2019 \u2014 and it\u2019s a bit of pride for people who live in the area.\u201dThe Rev. Harold Raymond Bronk Jr., an 86-year-old Brooklyn-born Episcopal minister also descended from Pieter, said he was proud of his Bronx heritage, but never flaunted it. When it comes to loyalty, he draws the line at baseball.\u201cI was a Dodger fan, and then I never adopted any team,\u201d said Mr. Bronk, a Massachusetts transplant. \u201cAnd wearing a New York Yankees cap in Boston is an invitation to getting beaten up.\u201dThis weekend\u2019s program will include the unveiling of a monument to Bronck, exhibitions about Swedes in the Civil War, the auto industry and professional hockey; a service in the church where Bronck was baptized, a Viking drama and a selection from the musical \u201cKristina from Duvemala,\u201d inspired by a Swedish family\u2019s migration to America in the 19th century (it includes a bilingual joke about flatulence, not unlike a Bronx cheer).The borough will be represented by Lenny Caro, president of the Bronx Chamber of Commerce, who will deliver an official proclamation and a Bronx flag. (The borough\u2019s motto, Virgil\u2019s admonition \u201cNe cede malis,\u201d or \u201cDo not yield to evil,\u201d is supposedly adopted from the Bronck family crest.)The wellspring of hip-hop, the Bronx has been the birthplace of or home to Woody Allen, Bella Abzug, Herman Badillo, the Belmonts, Lloyd Blankfein, Mary J.

{"Headline": "Russia May Be Losing Influence Over European Energy Markets", "Date": "2014-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGreen ColumnThe Ukraine crisis is unlikely to produce many benefits. But it could serve as a kind of stress test to see whether Europe\u2019s approach to energy policy is working.The European authorities have been far more interventionist than their American counterparts on energy, with the objectives of reducing carbon emissions and promoting energy security.Now along comes an international imbroglio in which energy is playing an outsized role. How much impact is it having on Europe?Of course, the confrontation over Ukraine has heightened fears that natural gas from Russia could be cut off. For those reasons, Europe has been reluctant to impose punitive sanctions on Russia. And when it did start clamping down on Russia\u2019s energy industry late last month, the sanctions were carefully drafted to block the export of technology or equipment that might aid new oil projects in Russia, while not interfering with Russian gas, which Europe supposedly cannot live without.But the indicators so far are that these fears may be exaggerated and that it is executives at Gazprom, Russia\u2019s state-controlled gas export monopoly, who have reason to be uneasy.Even in the midst of tensions over Ukraine, there are signs that Russia\u2019s influence over European energy markets is weakening rather than growing stronger.Prices for future delivery of gas have dropped more than 30 percent over the past year on the British market, Europe\u2019s most liquid, according to statistics from ICAP, which provides trade data. Traders appeared to shrug off the Ukraine conflict and the threat it could pose of a cutoff.Analysts attribute the price drop partly to the balmy winter that tamped down demand and allowed gas storage facilities across Europe to fill.But changes in the market are also having an impact. Paolo Scaroni, a former chief executive of the Italian energy company Eni, likes to say that the old European gas business was boringly simple. The chiefs of big gas middlemen like Eni and the German utilities, which buy gas from suppliers like Russia and distribute the fuel to factories and power plants, would sit down with their counterparts at Gazprom or Sonatrach, the Algerian national energy company, and work out long-term contracts linked to the price of oil.That system is now unraveling. Helped by liberalization promoted by the European Union, big industrial customers are insisting on prices determined by the actual trading of gas on what are known as hubs, and companies like Eni now face the choice of either beating Gazprom down on prices or getting stuck with overpriced gas.While the shift is far from complete, the European gas market is beginning to resemble that of the United States, where gas is priced according to what buyers and sellers will pay, not linked to much more expensive oil.Europe\u2019s much-criticized renewables push is also influencing energy markets. In the first half of this year, 28.5 percent of German electric power came from renewable energy sources like wind and solar power \u2014 a nearly 4 percent increase over a year earlier. Britain is also surging ahead, with almost 15 percent of electricity coming from renewable sources, an increase of almost one-third.Although the growth of electricity generated by offshore wind farms and vast solar arrays is a nasty headache for fossil-fuel utilities, these unconventional power installations are reducing demand for gas and coal in Europe.While President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia shows little sign of backing down over Ukraine, Gazprom, one of his government\u2019s main sources of revenue, has been retreating on its European contracts. In late May, for instance, Eni said it had reached a deal with Gazprom to bring the Russian gas it buys on long-term oil-linked contracts down to current market prices \u2014 in effect a 15 to 20 percent price cut, analysts estimate.In a recent interview, Eni\u2019s new chief executive, Claudio Descalzi, said the next step would be to extract similar terms from Algeria and Libya, two of the company\u2019s other big suppliers. Other large European gas buyers like E.on and GDF Suez will probably get similar terms.The European Union, which has been under pressure from industries to ease back on costly new emission-cutting requirements, is taking note of this unexpected strategic gain from renewables, which comes as the Union is formulating energy policies for the next 15 years.On July 23, G\u00fcnther Oettinger, the top European energy official, told reporters that a higher-than-expected energy savings target would be recommended for 2030 because of \u201cthe need for energy security in gas because of the situation in Russia and Ukraine,\u201d according to Reuters.Less-expensive gas should also produce environmental benefits. It is starting to edge coal out of power generation, reversing a perverse trend of recent years in which European utilities increased their burning of coal, the fossil fuel that emits the most carbon, at the expense of gas.Of course none of this is to say that it would be a good idea to completely cut off gas from Russia. With Russia supplying about one-third of European gas, \u201cIt would be incredibly hard to replace in the short term,\u201d said Trevor Sikorski, an analyst at Energy Aspects, a research firm based in London.But Russia, whose economy is already poised for decline, is unlikely to want to cut Europe off and raise further questions about whether it is a reliable energy supplier.In calm times, the energy system that Europe has built is not irrational. Europe itself may not have the huge supplies of gas needed to power its industries, but these exist on Europe\u2019s fringes, in Russia and North Africa \u2014 hence the wisdom of maintaining reasonable working relations with these countries.Whatever domestic energy supplies Europe can tap will strengthen its hand and serve as insurance. In that sense, renewables are important cards to hold.\u201cThe Ukraine crisis could act as a wake-up call for European decision makers to increase the use of renewable energy,\u201d said Marcus Ferdinand, an analyst at Point Carbon, a research firm based in Oslo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "South Africa\u2019s Subprime Crisis", "Date": "2014-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAPE TOWN \u2014 When America\u2019s housing bubble burst and the subprime loan market tanked in 2007, banks around the world found themselves exposed to subprime debt through an array of complex and opaque financial arrangements. But here in South Africa, financial institutions and government regulators puffed out their chests in pride.The regulations they\u2019d put in place left the banking system largely unaffected and insulated local investors from much of the subprime fallout. But South Africa\u2019s government failed to take heed of a similar credit bubble, precipitated by the business practices of micro-lenders, growing right under their noses. This was because the government was blinded by good intentions and an unquestioned belief in a market-based path to socioeconomic development.Seven years later, this failure has come back to haunt the country amid the collapse of African Bank, a small, listed commercial micro-lender with big ambitions. Its implosion \u2014 and subsequent bailout \u2014 earlier this month has exposed how little South Africa\u2019s banks and regulators actually learned from the subprime crisis.In 2006, as the first signs of trouble appeared in the American mortgage market, African Bank began to target low-income earners more aggressively with offers of unsecured credit \u2014 mostly small loans not backed by an underlying asset. The interest rates and fees were exorbitant, and borderline usurious, due to the assumed risk of lending to poorer people. But the business model proved so profitable that new competitors and even larger commercial banks got in on the act, causing the total value of unsecured credit in the system to skyrocket from 2007 onwards.It all came undone earlier this month as African Bank announced massive losses and an urgent need for an injection of new capital. The announcement caught investors unaware and caused the company\u2019s stock to shed over 90 percent of its value in two days, forcing South Africa\u2019s central bank to intervene.It placed the bank under external supervision as part of a $1.6 billion bailout to avert contagion throughout the financial system. The collapse nonetheless prompted the ratings agency Moody\u2019s to slash credit ratings of African Bank\u2019s largest competitor and the country\u2019s top four commercial banks \u2014 a move that will ultimately increase the cost of borrowing for these banks and their customers, pushing the country\u2019s slow-growing economy closer to stagnation.Amid the collapse, investors and the public alike have been asking why the government, the Reserve Bank and other institutions had not stepped in earlier. It\u2019s not as if there were no warning signs.The first answer can be found in the country\u2019s history: For decades, only a small white minority were allowed the unfettered freedom to pursue opportunities for economic development. This history shaped the distribution of household income with a huge number of low-income earners at the bottom, 99 percent of whom are black.Under the guise of righting this imbalance, the country\u2019s post-apartheid government followed a development path that, along with providing a social security program to protect those at the bottom from the ravages of absolute poverty, would bring low-income earners into a financial system that had previously overlooked them. Ensuring this group had access to credit was an important part of this plan.The government strengthened consumer protections and regulation of financial institutions. But, to make providing credit to low-income earners an attractive business proposition, it left a gap \u2014 allowing lenders to provide unsecured credit at higher interest rates, currently capped at 32 percent, and over longer repayment periods \u2014 both factors that increase the chances of default and incurring punitive charges and fees.The government saw this as an acceptable risk of financial inclusion because it had been seduced by the idea that easy access to microcredit would amplify the economic potential of low-income earners. The loans were, in theory, supposed to help poorer people invest in education, small businesses and other activities that would ultimately improve their income-generating capacity.In reality, borrowers\u2019 incomes hadn\u2019t grown fast enough to keep pace with the extremely high interest payments and fees after they had paid for basic needs like rent, food, transport and telephone bills. This trapped borrowers in a vicious cycle, whereby they had to take on more debt just to survive, and African Bank gladly obliged, until the inevitable default happened.The Reserve Bank\u2019s rescue of African Bank may have halted the crisis for the moment. But the pressure will only mount from now on. Once the Moody\u2019s downgrade has sent its ripples through the economy, it will strain already tight household budgets and temper the demand for goods and services. This will leave the government with few options as the South African economy, which is forecast to grow at a lowly 1.7 percent this year, loses its luster for domestic and foreign investors.And the rescue does not deal with the bigger question of whether the country\u2019s socioeconomic development path, which relies on the belief that including people in markets has been a success, is sensible in a country with inequalities like South Africa\u2019s.The big lesson from African Bank\u2019s collapse and the government\u2019s inability to adequately regulate the microcredit market is that inclusion alone isn\u2019t the answer. Given that commercial banks are seemingly incapable of providing credit and other financial services to poorer people without punishing them for being poor, the government must step in with a bank of its own \u2014 one that complements the country\u2019s existing social security program by lending to low-income earners at fair rates.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article incorrectly described apartheid South Africa. Only a small white minority \u2014 not \u201call but a small white minority\u201d \u2014 had meaningful economic opportunities.Advertisement"}

A big reason is that five years after the Great Recession officially ended, the economy is showing a strength and durability that other major nations can only envy. Thanks in part to the Federal Reserve\u2019s ultralow interest rates, employers have ramped up hiring, factories have increased production, and businesses have been making money.All of this has cushioned the economy from the economic damage abroad.

Ukraine claimed that its artillery fire destroyed most of the vehicles, but Russia denied that.The reports upended major European markets, turning gains into losses. Germany\u2019s DAX dropped 1.4 percent, after climbing 1.1 percent earlier. France\u2019s CAC 40 lost 0.7 percent. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note plunged as low as 2.30 percent, the lowest since June 2013, as traders seeking safety shifted money into government bonds. In late afternoon trading, the yield climbed back to 2.34 percent, still down from 2.40 percent late Thursday.

{"Headline": "More Jobs Are Open, but They\u2019re Filling Slowly", "Date": "2014-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ChartsTHERE are now more jobs available \u2014 but unfilled \u2014 in the United States than there were before the Great Recession began at the end of 2007. And employers are firing fewer workers than they did when times were good. But they are also hiring fewer people.In a report this week, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said that employers reported in June that they had 4.5 million available jobs that they were unable to fill. That is the highest number since 2007, and more than twice as high as the figure in October 2009, when the economy was officially beginning to recover but there were no signs of that in the labor market.That figure was contained in the monthly Jolts report \u2014 Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. Until recently, the survey tended to get relatively little attention. In part, that is because the survey began in 2000, so there is relatively little history, and in part it is because the figures are released more than a month after the jobs numbers for the same month come out, making them seem like old news. But since Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, began to cite them in her assessment of the economy, they have received more attention in the hope that they may provide a hint of when the Fed will begin to raise interest rates.\u201cThe economy seems to be moving faster toward Yellen\u2019s goal of eliminating slack in the labor market,\u201d said Ed Yardeni, the chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research, after the Jolts numbers were released.The accompanying charts compare three-month moving averages of seasonally adjusted figures to the averages for all of 2007. The moving averages are used because the Jolts figures, which are based on monthly surveys of employers, can be volatile.On that basis, in June the three-month average of unfilled job openings was 4.57 million, with June\u2019s figure at 4.67 million. It was the first time since the recession began that the three-month figure exceeded the 2007 average of 4.48 million.The volume of firings soared during the recession, but now is lower than it was before the downturn. The number of people quitting has recovered, but it is still well below the earlier level.In March, Ms. Yellen noted that while there were signs of progress, the number of new hires remained disappointing.\u201cI take the quit rate in many ways as a sign of the health of the economy,\u201d she told a news conference. \u201cWhen workers are scared they won\u2019t be able to get other jobs, they show a reduced willingness to quit their jobs. Now, quit rates are below normal prerecession levels, but on the other hand, they have come up over time, and so we have seen improvement. The job opening rate has also come up. The hires rate, however, remains extremely depressed, and I take that as a sign of a weaker labor market.\u201dThe survey classifies employee departures in one of three ways, including the two obvious ones of workers who quit and those who are laid off or discharged. The third, and smallest, group includes workers who leave for other reasons, principally retirement or death, but also because of transfers. Because the survey covers individual working locations \u2014 a particular Walmart store, for example \u2014 rather than entire companies, a worker who is transferred from one store to another could be classified as having left.

{"Headline": "Protest March Bears Down on the Leader of Pakistan", "Date": "2014-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Thousands of Pakistanis rallied behind the former cricketer Imran Khan on Thursday as he led a motor cavalcade toward the capital, Islamabad, for a protest to demand the resignation of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and fresh elections.The rally started in the city of Lahore, 160 miles to the south, with dancing and singing from Mr. Khan\u2019s boisterous supporters. It was expected to reach Islamabad, the capital, as early as Friday afternoon. A smaller group, also bound for Islamabad, was led by Muhammad Tahir-ul Qadri, a cleric who has promised a \u201cpeaceful revolution\u201d in Pakistan.The march, timed to coincide with the 67th anniversary of Pakistan\u2019s independence, followed weeks of growing political tension in the country. It is the strongest challenge yet to Mr. Sharif\u2019s 14-month-old government.Apparently rattled by plans for the protest, the government employed heavy-handed tactics in recent weeks. Riot police officers clashed with Mr. Qadri\u2019s supporters across Punjab Province last weekend, resulting in at least two deaths. Mr. Sharif closed roads leading to Islamabad and invoked public-order laws that ban meetings on its streets.His reaction appeared to stem in part from speculation that the political tumult could open the way for a military coup \u2014 a fate that Mr. Sharif suffered in 1999, leading to his imprisonment and then seven years in exile. But by late Thursday, those fears had dissipated somewhat after the government reluctantly agreed to allow the protests to proceed.Mr. Sharif also made a show of unity with the military leadership, appearing twice alongside the powerful army chief, Gen. Raheel Sharif. Late Wednesday, the two men, who are not related, attended a military ceremony outside Parliament. On Thursday, they traveled to insurgency-stricken Baluchistan Province for a ceremony to mark the reopening of Ziarat House, a former residence of Pakistan\u2019s founding father, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. The house was burned to the ground last year by Baluch separatists.\u201cThe country cannot afford any more subversion and negative politics,\u201d Mr. Sharif said in a speech.Mr. Khan\u2019s \u201cindependence march,\u201d as he calls it, is driven by accusations that Mr. Sharif\u2019s party rigged the general election in May 2013. The results handed Mr. Sharif a handsome majority in Parliament, although Mr. Khan\u2019s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party won control of the government in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province.The popularity of Mr. Khan, 61, a former captain of the national cricket team and an enduring sex symbol \u2014 he was photographed bare-chested outside his home in Lahore this week \u2014 is built on his appeal to young Pakistanis disillusioned by traditional politics. In recent days, supporters camped outside his home, and several spoke of \u201crevolution.\u201d\u201cWe will go to Islamabad and sit there for days, months and even years until our demands are met,\u201d said Ayesha Ahmed, a Lahore woman in her early 30s who wore a dress in the colors of Mr. Khan\u2019s party.But Mr. Khan has also faced criticism from critics who see his protest as a power grab by an electoral loser, and a needless distraction when Pakistan is facing pressing challenges from an ailing economy and Islamist insurgents. The army has been fighting in North Waziristan, home of the Taliban rebellion, since mid-June.The picture is further complicated by the return of Mr. Qadri, who normally lives in Canada and who led protests in January 2013 against the previous government, which was headed by President Asif Ali Zardari. Although Mr. Qadri\u2019s party has no seats in Parliament, Mr. Sharif inadvertently bolstered his credentials in June when riot police officers clashed with his supporters in Lahore, resulting in at least nine deaths.Although Mr. Qadri and Mr. Khan lead separate protest groups, they have formed a loose alliance and seemed set to appear, separately, on the streets of Islamabad on Friday. Government officials said the protesters would be allowed to demonstrate at Zero Point, a major traffic intersection on the edge of the city.Mr. Khan said he intended to lead a sit-in until his demands were met. His party published a photo showing him packing overnight belongings into a bag from Selfridges, a high-end London department store. Critics on social media said the picture belied his image as a man of the people.As darkness fell, the military\u2019s attitude remained the march\u2019s greatest unknown. While there was little evidence that the generals wanted to take over, analysts said, they could take advantage of any discord to reassert themselves more openly in politics.Salman Masood contributed reporting from Islamabad, Pakistan, and Waqar Gillani from Lahore, Pakistan.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will Germany Let Europe Save Itself?", "Date": "2014-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconoclastLONDON \u2014 This week\u2019s theatrical resignation threat by Manuel Valls, the French prime minister, combined with the deep anxiety about deflation revealed at Jackson Hole, Wyo., by Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, suggest that the euro crisis may be coming back. But a crisis is often an opportunity, and this is the hope now beginning to excite markets in the eurozone.Investors and business leaders are asking themselves three questions: Will European governments and the central bank recognize the unexpected weakness of the eurozone economy as an opportunity to change course? If they do see this as an opportunity, will they know how to grasp it? And will they be allowed to do what is necessary by the true economic sovereign of Europe, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany?First, the opportunity. Europe still has a chance to save itself from a Japanese-style lost decade of stagnation and deflation. And this may well be a last chance, because a lost decade in Europe could produce some very un-Japanese social rebellions and political unrest. Europe, after all, lacks Japan\u2019s social consensus, national unity and financial cohesion. It is therefore far from clear that Europe could survive 10 years of recession without the breakup of the eurozone and perhaps even the European Union. Secondly, what must Europe do to save itself from stagnation and disintegration? The obvious answer is to follow something similar to the \u201cThree Arrows\u201d program popularized (though not genuinely implemented) by the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe. His \u201cthree arrows\u201d were aggressive monetary stimulus, fiscal easing that required suspension of government deficit and debt targets, and structural overhauls to correct long-term weaknesses in both supply and demand.Judging by Mr. Draghi\u2019s speech at a conference of central bankers in Jackson Hole, all three of these policies are becoming feasible for Europe. The central bank is hinting at a more growth-oriented monetary policy, the European Commission seems willing to interpret its fiscal rules more flexibly, and national governments are promising to undertake more structural overhauls. The problem is that all these hints and promises are hedged with too many conditions, uncertainties and caveats. Even if the E.C.B. does decide to experiment with quantitative easing in the style of the United States, Britain and Japan, its record suggests that it will probably do too little, too late \u2014 just enough to prevent a collapse of the euro, but not nearly enough to pull the European economy out of its slump. The prospects for fiscal and structural overhauls are even more depressing to judge by the political upheaval this past week in France. President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande responded to his prime minister\u2019s threat to resign by getting rid of Arnaud Montebourg, the left-wing economy minister, along with several of his allies. But Mr. Montebourg was advocating policies of budget flexibility and stimulus measures very similar to those suggested by Mr. Draghi. And Mr. Montebourg rightly stressed the importance of \u201csequencing\u201d monetary, fiscal and structural changes correctly \u2014 a very fair point also made by Mr. Draghi and before that by Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund. What matters is not just the policies that governments and central banks implement, but the order in which they do so. Misguided sequencing has arguably been a root cause of Europe\u2019s economic malaise. For example, monetary expansion is much more effective if it is combined with fiscal stimulus through temporary tax cuts or injections of public spending. If, on the other hand, monetary expansion is contradicted by premature fiscal consolidation, then both policies can be doomed to failure. Structural changes, on the other hand, are very slow to have an impact and cannot generate growth in the short-term. They should therefore be viewed as a complement to macroeconomic policy, not as a precondition for monetary and fiscal expansion.Major reductions in public spending, which reduce growth in the short term even though they may increase long-run efficiency, should come at the end of the whole overhaul process, instead of being \u201cfront-loaded\u201d ahead of tax cuts, as the European Commission and the German government tend to demand. For all these reasons, and many others, skepticism is certainly justified about Europe\u2019s ability to pull itself out of stagnation. Which raises the third and most important issue: Will Angela Merkel allow Europe to save itself? To judge by Ms. Merkel\u2019s public statements, the answer is no. Officially, the German government refuses even to discuss any loosening of the European Union\u2019s budget rules and does not accept the economic logic of sequencing espoused by the I.M.F., the United States, Japan, China and every other major economy. But is that really her current position \u2014 and even if it is, can she sustain it much longer? With the German economy weakening because of the downturn in France and southern Europe, as well as sanctions against Russia, Ms. Merkel is becoming less arrogant about imposing German ideas. At the same time, the pressure from France, Italy and Spain is growing as their prime ministers all face challenges to their leadership. In this sense, the rebellion against Mr. Hollande could be a useful cautionary tale for Ms. Merkel. If she remains too obstinate, she could lose all her allies and face some truly frightening hostility from openly anti-Germany politicians like Marine Le Pen, Mr. Montebourg and Silvio Berlusconi. This is not a legacy Ms. Merkel will want to leave behind. It is quite possible, therefore, that the political furor this past week was actually coordinated, at least informally, by Mr. Hollande and Ms. Merkel. Let us assume that the two finally recognized, as a result of the recent slump in European economic indicators, that fiscal and monetary stimulus are urgently needed.For Ms. Merkel, this would be a very difficult concession since she has vehemently opposed any loosening of European Union budgetary targets and expressed severe reservations about monetary \u201cexperiments\u201d such as quantitative easing. To avoid losing face, she would therefore require a diversionary tactic. Ms. Montebourg\u2019s demand for stimulus, which he combined with an attack on Ms. Merkel\u2019s domination of European economic policy, provided a perfect distraction. By firing Mr. Montebourg, Mr. Hollande was able to signal that he would accept German economic dominance and abide by Europe\u2019s fiscal rules. Having done this favor for Ms. Merkel, he could then go ahead and discretely break these same rules. It is a measure of the European Union\u2019s political and economic dysfunctions that such twisted Machiavellian logic now offers Europe its best hope. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New to the Archaeologist\u2019s Tool Kit: The Drone", "Date": "2014-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHEP\u00c9N, Peru \u2014 A small remote-controlled helicopter buzzed over ancient hilltop ruins here, snapping hundreds of photographs. Below, stone walls built more than a thousand years ago by the Moche civilization gave way to a grid of adobe walls put up only recently by what officials said were land speculators.\u201cThis site is threatened on every side,\u201d said Luis Jaime Castillo Butters, Peru\u2019s vice minister of cultural heritage as he piloted the drone aircraft.Archaeologists around the world, who have long relied on the classic tools of their profession, like the trowel and the plumb bob, are now turning to the modern technology of drones to defend and explore endangered sites. And perhaps nowhere is the shift happening as swiftly as in Peru, where Dr. Castillo has created a drone air force to map, monitor and safeguard his country\u2019s ancient treasures.Drones mark \u201ca before and after in archaeology,\u201d said Dr. Castillo, who is also a prominent archaeologist and one of a dozen experts who will outline the use of drones at a conference in San Francisco next year.In remote northwestern New Mexico, archaeologists are using drones outfitted with thermal-imaging cameras to track the walls and passages of a 1,000-year-old Chaco Canyon settlement, now buried beneath the dirt. In the Middle East, researchers have employed them to guard against looting.\u201cAerial survey at the site is allowing for the identification of new looting pits and determinations of whether any of the looters\u2019 holes had been revisited,\u201d said Morag Kersel, an archaeologist from DePaul University in Chicago who is part of a team using drones in Jordan and Israel.Peru, with its stunning concentration of archaeological riches, is suddenly fertile ground to try out this new technology. The country is becoming a research hot spot as archaeologists in the Middle East and elsewhere find their work interrupted by unrest. But in Peru they encounter another kind of conflict. Here they struggle to protect the country\u2019s archaeological heritage from squatters and land traffickers, who often secure property through fraud or political connections to profit from rising land values. Experts say hundreds, perhaps thousands of ancient sites are endangered by such encroachment. The drones can address the problem, quickly and cheaply, by providing bird\u2019s-eye views of ruins that can be converted into 3-D images and highly detailed maps.The maps are then used to legally register the protected boundaries of sites, a kind of landmarking that can be cited in court to prevent development or to punish those who damage ruins by building anyway. \u201cLima has grown to a point where the only land left is archaeological land,\u201d said Dr. Castillo, who is also a professor at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru.Though his work is focused on the deep past, Dr. Castillo is fascinated by gadgets and new technology. He began experimenting with drones about two years ago, buying a $100 one from the Sharper Image. Now he has a squadron of eight, all miniature helicopters that cost about $1,500 to $20,000. He hopes to soon add 20 more.The drones, he said, \u201csolve the first riddle of archaeology.\u201d \u201cFinally you can fly whenever you want to, wherever you want to, in any angle, for anything you want and get the great picture you always thought you should take,\u201d he said.Dr. Castillo\u2019s eureka moment occurred in 2012, while teaching in Sweden, where researchers were working with a powerful Russian-made computer program that could meld hundreds of photographs into a 3-D composite image. Dr. Castillo realized that by feeding his drone photographs into the program, he could produce incredibly detailed and clear 3-D images of ancient temples, fortifications and burial sites.Pointing to a nearby hillside, Dr. Castillo said that last year a survey team spent two months, at a cost of thousands of dollars, to map the area using conventional methods. Now, with a drone, he covers a similar area in less than 10 minutes. Once he loads the photos into a computer program, he can have a map the next day.\u201cThe faster we produce the maps, the more parts of the site we\u2019re going to be able to save,\u201d he said.Drones do have some drawbacks. Their batteries last as little as six minutes. The dust common at archaeological sites, especially in Peru\u2019s coastal desert, can foul the equipment.Earlier on Cerro Chep\u00e9n, Aldo Watanave, who leads Dr. Castillo\u2019s drone team, had been unable to get a larger drone to work when the apparatus that controls the camera\u2019s movement failed. Dr. Castillo and his staff often must rely on their ingenuity, jury-rigging the drones to hold cameras in place. In this instance, Mr. Watanave tried tying the apparatus in place with string but then the mechanism that made the camera take pictures at regular intervals also went on the fritz. Dr. Castillo ended up using a smaller drone for the job.The nerve center for the drone effort is in the basement of the Culture Ministry, a massive gray concrete building in Lima. In cramped cubicles, eight men and women work with the 3-D maps created from drone photographs, refining them and adding information, including details about land ownership and archaeological excavations.The task before them is daunting. Peru has an estimated 100,000 sites of archaeological importance, though experts acknowledge that is little more than a guess. Of those, only about 2,500 have been mapped in some way and only about 200 are fully inscribed in public registers owing to money and manpower issues.\u201cWe have a mountain of work to do and a very small budget,\u201d said Nohem\u00ed Ortiz, who directs the office responsible for registering sites. \u201cBut we have to start somewhere.\u201dRecently their work brought them to Pimentel, a Pacific beach town where about 700 years ago a fishing village occupied a raised expanse of sand. The sand on a recent visit was littered with artifacts, pieces of pottery, a ceramic shard featuring the snout of a feline creature, notched stones once used as fishing weights and chunks of coral that may have once marked the perimeter of houses.But a large area of sand around the mound, and perhaps parts of the mound itself, were recently flattened with heavy equipment. Stakes were driven into the sand in what appeared to be an effort to establish property lines.Government archaeologists discovered the encroachment when they arrived to map the site with conventional methods.Carlos Wester La Torre, an archaeologist who directs the nearby Br\u00fcning National Archaeological Museum, said it appeared that local leaders had begun to parcel up the beachfront to take advantage of escalating land values. \u201cI think they wanted to disturb this so they could say it\u2019s not worth anything,\u201d he said of the damage to the site, \u201clike taking a book and ripping out the pages so you can\u2019t read the story anymore.\u201dDr. Castillo\u2019s team had arrived just that day. Soon one of his drones was buzzing overhead, recording what was left of local prehistory before it, too, would be obliterated.William Neuman reported from Peru and Ralph Blumenthal from New York.

The arts center is now the largest private cultural investment in Spain.The Bot\u00edn family\u2019s waterfront project is lifting expectations about the potential economic halo effect of the Guggenheim, which transformed the image and economy of Bilbao, about 60 miles east. But it is also provoking some legal complaints and scorn from critics who say that Santander\u2019s public quay and seaside views are being exploited for private use \u2014 to build a modern-day pyramid for the glory of a banker in his company town.Some are pressing lawsuits questioning the use of public space for a private foundation\u2019s project. A citizens\u2019 group called DEBA, short for Defense of the Bay, lost a legal round to halt the project and is now pressing an appeal to a higher court that could take years.A separate legal complaint against the city of Santander and the port authority is being pursued by Fernando Merodio, a Santander lawyer, who contends that the project grew out of back-room deals between local political parties and the foundation. His administrative complaint was rejected this summer, and he has filed a new complaint with the European Parliament.\u201cThis is a pyramid in every respect, and Bot\u00edn is the pharaoh,\u201d Mr. Merodio said. \u201cIt\u2019s on a magnificent bay in a prime location. Why is he building it? He cares nothing about art.\u201dAt age 79, Mr. Bot\u00edn, a banker with a zest for deals, is indeed an unusual cultural patron. He is not an art collector, but his grandmother and great-grandfather carved a signature place for themselves in art lore by discovering in 1879 prehistoric rock paintings in the Altamira cave in northern Spain.Those around him call Mr. Bot\u00edn the project\u2019s guiding force, but through the foundation he declined to comment. In a public appearance last month to inaugurate the nearby Pereda Gardens, he stood at a podium by the bay and declared his ambition to build an \u201cart center of culture and education that will boost the Cantabria region and create wealth.\u201d\u201cThis building is a gift to the city of Santander,\u201d said Ms. Bot\u00edn, who is a member of the foundation\u2019s board. \u201cThe Bot\u00edn family is not building it for ourselves. We are creating a building that will be a home for art and education and will help local people and become a global attraction. People in Santander are very conservative, and we hope it will open minds like the Guggenheim Bilbao did.\u201dThis alliance of culture and banking reflects the cool calculation of business competition among Spanish banks, which aim to promote their international brands and images, according to Robert Tornabell Carrio, an emeritus professor of banking at the business school Esade.\u201cSantander is a small town and it\u2019s not a financial center like Madrid, but Emilio Bot\u00edn is proud of his roots,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have seen the benefits for Banco Santander\u2019s competitor, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, which already has the connection as a sponsor to the Guggenheim Bilbao.\u201dSince the concept was first announced in 2010, the Bot\u00edn center\u2019s design has evolved to reflect early public comments and criticism, according to Mr. Piano, the architect. A bridge was eliminated, replaced by an underground car tunnel. Cement and metal were ruled out for the exterior of the buildings. Soon the wings will be covered with 360,000 ceramic tiles, bolted on metal panels. The tiles, the color of mother-of-pearl, are designed to reflect the bay\u2019s flickering light and changing blue-gray tones.And through the pillars, people will be able to stroll along the historic promenade and view the sea, Mr. Piano said.\u201cWith the building floating, there is no barrier. And that is quite important because we are not taking away public space,\u201d Mr. Piano said. \u201cWhen I told Emilio about this idea of floating above ground, he was very careful. How much should the building fly? If it\u2019s too close it looks squeezed. But if it\u2019s too high it will look like a monument, detached from the ground and people and community.\u201dThis logic of preserving sea views has not reassured all critics, and people in Santander are awaiting the center\u2019s completion.The city\u2019s mayor, I\u00f1igo de la Serna, 42, of the conservative People\u2019s Party, said Santander must react to changing tastes. \u201cCulture is a form of tourism that is more in demand. The more traditional destinations like the beach have reached a saturation point.\u201dChange, though, does not come easily. When Salvador Lebenegos walks along the promenade, he remains disturbed by the sight of the Centro Bot\u00edn. \u201cSome people like it, and some people don\u2019t. It\u2019s like a wall, like bottles dripping with wax,\u201d he said, gripping his cane. Will he visit? \u201cIf God is willing and I live that long. I\u2019m 87 after all.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Subway in the Sky, Valley Meets Plateau", "Date": "2014-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLA PAZ and EL ALTO, Bolivia \u2014 In these two cities, geography and rank stand in inverse relation. La Paz \u2014 the seat of government, old money and a lighter-skinned elite \u2014 sits in a valley. Above it on a high plateau is the frenetic city of El Alto: poorer, younger and generally darker-skinned. La Paz has always looked down on its upstart younger sibling above.Now, that relationship is being challenged, and this urban M\u00f6bius strip, where down is up and up is down, is getting a new twist. A mass-transit aerial cable-car system, a cross between a ski gondola and an elevated train, is being installed to better connect them, chipping away at the physical barriers and possibly some of the psychological ones.The first line in the system, stretching from an area near the center of La Paz to just beyond the lip of the plateau into El Alto, began carrying riders on May 31. Another line is expected to go into operation in September, and a third the next month \u2014 just in time for an election on Oct. 12, in which President Evo Morales is running for a third term.Mr. Morales, who ordered the construction of the cable-car system, recently announced that he would build five more lines. It is part of a master plan that Cesar Dockweiler, the general coordinator of the project, said could eventually include up to 18 lines: stretching deep down the valley into La Paz\u2019s Zona Sur, or Southern Zone, where the wealthiest live, and far across the plateau, home to some of El Alto\u2019s poorest.The first line, known as the red line, carried two million passengers in its first 51 days of operation, which Mr. Dockweiler said was beyond the most optimistic projections. Some riders are commuters, but many have flocked to the line out of curiosity. It has become a sightseeing attraction for its novelty and for its sweeping views of La Paz and the surrounding mountains. The heaviest ridership is on Thursdays and Sundays, when a sprawling open-air market fills the streets of El Alto.\u201cIt\u2019s a wonder,\u201d said Carlos Flores, 60, a printer, standing in a long line to board a cable car on a recent Sunday at La Paz\u2019s Central Station (Estaci\u00f3n Central in Spanish, or Taypi Uta in Aymara, the predominant indigenous language in El Alto). Referring to one of his country\u2019s natural marvels, Mr. Flores said, \u201cWe say that Lake Titicaca is a wonder, and now we have another one.\u201dMuch as the subway system changed New York in the early 20th century, the cable-car system has the potential to transform La Paz and El Alto, connecting distant neighborhoods to the city center, raising real estate values, slashing commute times and altering social relations.\u201cPeople in El Alto are more guarded and more timid,\u201d said Leonidas S\u00e1nchez, 45, a school administrator from El Alto, riding down into La Paz one recent morning. \u201cWe are timid because we have a different skin color, and we live in different types of houses, and we do different kinds of work compared to the people of the Zona Sur. There has always been a relation of respect and even fear with those people.\u201dMr. S\u00e1nchez said that if he sat next to lighter-skinned people from the La Paz elite in a cable car, he would feel obligated to give them more space. While the election of Mr. Morales, an indigenous former coca farmer from a poor background, in 2005 has gone a long way toward changing such attitudes, Mr. S\u00e1nchez said the cable cars could help break them down further.\u201cI think that relationship of superiority will change, because we will express ourselves, and they will get to know us, and we will get to know them,\u201d he said.\u201cLa Paz and El Alto have a different logic of life,\u201d said Luis Cayujra, 40, a lawyer from La Paz, who was waiting in line, camera in hand, to board a cable car for a ride up the slope to El Alto.\u201cI have friends that have either never been to El Alto or are afraid to go,\u201d Mr. Cayujra said. Now, he said, \u201cLots of young people will be able to explore the complex world of El Alto: the culture, the economy, the social forms, the architecture.\u201dTraveling from El Alto on a frigid winter morning, the cable cars move over rooftops beneath a brilliant blue sky, the massive snow peak of Illimani ahead.At night, the orange and white lights of La Paz spread out beneath riders like stars filling the valley, undulating with its contours.Benjamin Limachi, 28, a jewelry maker who lives in El Alto, said he liked to take his girlfriend for rides at night, when they could sit alone in a car and take in the romantic view.\u201cIt\u2019s very different to look from above and see how pretty La Paz is,\u201d Mr. Limachi said. \u201cIt\u2019s like flying in an airplane at low altitude.\u201dOther cities, like Medell\u00edn, Colombia, and Caracas, Venezuela, have put in cable cars to reach some isolated hilltop neighborhoods. But nowhere else have cable cars been envisioned as the backbone of a mass-transit system, as in La Paz, said Torsten B\u00e4uerlen, a manager at Doppelmayr, the Austrian company that is building the first three lines.La Paz, the world\u2019s highest capital at about 12,000 feet above sea level, is different from most other cities. It spills down the slopes of a steep valley, making a subway or other train system impractical, and buses are subject to the heavy traffic that often gridlocks both cities.\u201cFor us, the solution has been to build, quite literally, a subway in the air,\u201d said Mr. Dockweiler, the project coordinator.A ride costs about 44 cents, as much as double the cost of the packed minibuses that clog the streets. But at least some commuters are willing to pay more to save time, and for the added comfort. The minibuses are reviled for being dirty and overcrowded, with drivers who often are rude, charge above the established fare and refuse to pick up older riders or people with children.The $234 million price tag for the first three lines was paid virtually in cash, from the vast trove of hard currency that the country\u2019s Central Bank has amassed during several years of impressive economic growth fueled largely by the sale of natural gas to neighboring Brazil and Argentina. That in itself is a sign of the changes going on here.\u201cBefore, to invest and carry out this type of project, the Bolivian government had to turn to outside financing,\u201d Mr. Dockweiler said. \u201cWhen we opened the red line, people felt proud. And now Bolivians believe in themselves, believe in their ability to develop, in the country\u2019s chances to become greater.\u201dThe government sees the cable-car system as a way to draw La Paz and El Alto closer together, advertising it with slogans like \u201cUniting our lives\u201d and \u201cA meeting place.\u201d\u201cThe thread of the cable car will permit a dialogue between the two cultures, a connection,\u201d said Ren\u00e9 Pereira, director of the school of social science at San Andr\u00e9s University in La Paz. \u201cAnd that is going to break down borders, and we will probably start to seriously reconsider the reality that is Bolivia.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Family Leave Policies Be Too Generous? It Seems So", "Date": "2014-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPerverse IncentivesBut it turns out that long paid leaves can also hold back women. Researchers are finding that even as family leave boosts labor force participation by women, it can have negative effects on their job opportunities.Mothers on both sides of the Atlantic, then, pay a price for the structure of family leave policies. The challenge for policy makers is to minimize the penalty women pay. That could happen by pulling levers in both policy and culture around the length of leaves and who takes them.A big policy question is how long family leave should be, several economists said \u2014 and neither the United States or Europe seems to have figured out the ideal.\"I suspect women in the U.S. would benefit from longer leaves than the 12 weeks that are currently mandated,\u201d Ms. Blau said. \u201cIn Europe the leaves may be so long as to have negative effects on women\u2019s labor market outcomes.\u201dHe advocates for paid leave \u2014 just not too much. \u201cBecause I\u2019m an economist, people will ask me, is it going to be good for the economy? And the answer to that, based on the evidence we have, is yes,\u201d he said.\u201cBut my opinion is we often frame it the wrong way,\u201d he added.\"To me this is a family values issue. I think it\u2019s important as a society that we support families throughout the life cycle.\u201d\u201cThere are a bunch of reasons, but one is we have cultural norms,\u201d he said. \u201cIf anybody, but particularly males, said I\u2019m taking six weeks off, they\u2019d be concerned there\u2019d be negative repercussions.\u201dSo perhaps another way to minimize the career penalty women pay for having children is to stop making parental leave all about mothers. If men also demanded more flexibility to take care of family (not just babies, but also aging parents), then perhaps employers would be less likely to discriminate against women of childbearing age. Even more, research has shown that in countries where men are more involved at home, women are freed up to achieve more at work.Claire Cain Miller\nis a reporter for The\nUpshot, which\npresents news,\nanalysis and data\nvisualization about\npolitics and policy.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Ranch With 1,000 Acres, for Your Inner Buckaroo", "Date": "2014-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBig DealMost New Yorkers would barely know what to do with 1,000 square feet of space, let alone 1,000 acres. But what\u2019s to stop us from trying to figure it out. Buying a ranch is the stuff of childhood cowboy fantasy \u2014 riding horseback past herds of bison or standing knee-deep in a rushing stream filled with trout. And while foreign investors and tech billionaires drive the New York market, in places like Colorado and Montana, it is cattle shortages and the price of grain that hold sway. If you are in the market for ranch land and the ultimate anti-Hamptons getaway, there are three types of purchases you can make: farmland, where crops are plowed to yield a harvest; working ranches with large cattle herds that convert grass into beef; and recreational ranches, also called executive ranches or retreats, according to James H. Taylor, who is a principal of Hall and Hall, a real estate company based in Billings, Mont., that specializes in the sale, management and financing of rural property. Eric O\u2019Keefe, the editor of The Land Report, a quarterly magazine based in Dallas, said: \u201cRecreational ranches don\u2019t have any income streams associated with them. Think of it like buying a Chateau Margaux or a Picasso, just something to enjoy.\u201d \u201cWhen he was a child, President Truman would spend the summers with his grandparents at the cabin,\u201d said Earl Tally, Chimney Rock Farm\u2019s owner. And at $3.9 million, it\u2019s a relative bargain. While they may be beautiful, these recreational ranches have failed to return the same level of investment as farmland and working ranches in recent years. Farms have benefited from several years of skyrocketing prices for corn and wheat, although prices for these commodities have dropped over the last year. The prices of working cattle ranches, meanwhile, have also gone up because of several droughts that have caused a nationwide beef cattle shortage.\u201cThe U.S. cow herd is at a historic low right now, the last time it was at this level was 1952,\u201d Mr. Taylor said. \u201cWhen coupled with the increased demand by growing worldwide populations for high quality protein, such as beef, it has caused the price of beef, and therefore, the demand for ranch land, to go through the ceiling.\u201dPrices for recreational ranches, on the other hand, have fallen 35 percent to 50 percent since the market peak, Mr. Taylor said, and there are now several properties available at steep discounts. \u201cThere are a whole bunch of different biospheres, from meadow planes to juniper trees and forests,\u201d said Henry S. Field, the broker who is representing the property. \u201cIt is a wild place. On my first trip up there I saw four bears, and I wasn\u2019t even looking for them.\u201d While the market for these ranches remains soft, there are compelling reasons to buy them, including the possibility of creating conservation easements. In these instances, a ranch owner sells or donates the development rights on the property to a land trust in exchange for a tax deduction.\u201cOne of the most notable trends we\u2019ve been following is the increasing appeal of conservation properties to high-net-worth individuals,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Keefe said. The tax benefits are the main draw, he said, but many are also compelled by \u201cthe social component to preserving open spaces.\u201d Buying large tracts also can provide an opportunity for the very wealthy to diversify their investments. In an economy where interest rates are low and bonds provide little return, parking cash in land can be a useful strategy. \u201cWe are seeing more cash buyers in the market right now,\u201d said Mike Swan of the Swan Land Company, a real estate brokerage firm. \u201cBecause the stock market won\u2019t stay where it is forever, people are pulling up their investments and putting the money into land where there is not the same amount of volatility.\u201d Speaking of Ms. Fonda, no column on ranches would be complete without mentioning her ex-husband, Ted Turner, the country\u2019s second-largest landholder with two million acres. (The media mogul John C. Malone surpassed him in 2011 when he bought one million acres of timberland in Maine, putting his total acreage at 2.2 million, according to the Land Report.) \u201cTed Turner was the first to spend a significant amount of money for a ranch \u2014 the first big ranch he bought was for $21 million,\u201d said Mr. Taylor, who worked with Mr. Turner on many of his ranch purchases, including his first in 1987. \u201cBefore that, a $6 million sale was considered a large transaction.\u201dWhile owning thousands of acres out West may be a dream-come-true, there are a number of complications to consider, such as ancillary costs. If you have a large ranch of a few hundred thousand acres, for example, you\u2019ll need to hire a ranch manager to help you run the property, with a base salary of up to $250,000 a year, according to Mr. Taylor. And pay attention to things like water rights, mineral rights, deed encumbrances, county zoning, soil profiles and property access, Mr. Swan added.\u201cAfter the recent recession,\u201d he said, \u201cbuyers have become more cautious and are doing extensive research on properties before they engage.\u201d Advertisement"}

Shares in 21st Century Fox rose $1.63, or 5 percent, to $33.96 after it reporting better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings late Wednesday. The company got a boost from films including \u201cX-Men: Days of Future Past,\u201d \u201cRio 2\u201d and \u201cThe Fault in Our Stars.\u201d The stock added to gains made Wednesday after Fox underscored its abandonment of a bid for Time Warner and announced a stock buyback.The gains for stocks were short-lived on Thursday. The market started to head lower by lunchtime, and as stocks declined, bond prices rose, pushing down interest rates.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note dropped to 2.41 percent from 2.47 percent late Wednesday, while its price rose 16/32, to 100 25/32. The 10-year note\u2019s yield is now at its lowest level since June 2013.At the start of this year, many investors and analysts had expected the price of the 10-year Treasury note to fall as the economy continued its recovery and the Federal Reserve wound down its economic stimulus program. Instead, the opposite has happened. Bonds have rallied as inflation has remained low and doubts have arisen on prospects for long-term growth.United States Treasury securities also offer a higher yield than bonds issued elsewhere. The yield on the 10-year German government bond, for instance, is 1.06 percent, while French government bonds of the same maturity return 1.5 percent.Investors are also buying Treasury securities as a safe haven as geopolitical tensions rise around the world.\u201cThe Treasury market is going to continue to confound the bears,\u201d said Bill O\u2019Donnell, chief Treasury strategist at RBS.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Italy Falls Back Into Recession, Raising Concern for Eurozone Economy", "Date": "2014-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 The Italian economy shrank in the second quarter, according to an official estimate on Wednesday, taking economists by surprise and provoking concern that violence in Ukraine and tension with Russia could be pushing the broader eurozone back into recession.Italy\u2019s gross domestic product contracted 0.2 percent from April through June, compared with the first quarter of 2014, Istat, the Italian statistics office, said in a preliminary estimate. It was the second quarterly decline in a row for Italy, meeting the most common definition of a recession. In the first quarter, output shrank 0.1 percent compared with the previous quarter.The decline dashed hopes that Italy, the third-largest eurozone economy after Germany and France, was finally emerging from a decade of stagnation. And it may be one of the first concrete signs of how tension with Russia is hurting the European economy, analysts said. Along with a report of a sharp decline in German factory orders, the data raised new questions about the health of the 18-country eurozone as a whole. Only three of the 18 members of the eurozone \u2014 Cyprus, Finland and Greece \u2014 had reported two quarters in a row of negative output at the end of March. But the number of countries in recession is bound to increase during the coming week as more of them report second-quarter growth. The economic data and news that Russia was massing troops and military equipment on the Ukrainian border caused stock prices to fall across Europe on Wednesday. Italy\u2019s main stock index fell more than 2 percent and the euro also slipped to a nine-month low against the dollar, down to $1.334.Analysts surmised that the strained relations with Russia as well as turmoil in the Middle East had undercut demand for Italian exports, in particular fashion and other luxury goods.\u201cRussia is important for Italian exports, as is the Middle East,\u201d said Martin Lueck, an economist at UBS in Frankfurt. \u201cThere must have been an impact.\u201dIn an example of how the Ukraine turmoil could further impinge on the European economy, President Vladimir Putin of Russia on Wednesday ordered limits on agricultural imports from countries imposing sanctions on Russia \u2014 a measure aimed at the European Union and the United States.The move threatens a fast-growing market for European farmers. The European Union exported agricultural goods worth 11.8 billion euros, or $15.8 billion, to Russia last year, and sales have been rising at a rate of almost 15 percent a year.The eurozone has been growing since last year, but that growth has been spotty and vulnerable to a shock, like the kind caused by the fighting in Ukraine as well as by sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union on Russia.The currency area has still not returned to the same levels of employment and economic output it had before the financial crisis began in 2008. Some economists argue that the region is already well into a so-called lost decade.During the first quarter, economies in seven of the 18 eurozone countries shrank while France had zero growth. The eurozone as a whole grew only 0.2 percent from the previous quarter, according to Eurostat, the European Union statistics agency.Separately, the German Federal Statistical Office reported on Wednesday that new industrial orders in Germany fell 3.2 percent in June compared with May. Analysts had expected orders to increase. Germany has the largest economy in Europe and is a crucial market for other eurozone countries, so any slowdown there is ominous for the rest of the Continent.The discouraging economic figures are also putting pressure on the European Central Bank, which is to hold its monthly news conference on Thursday in Frankfurt. However, the central bank, which cut its benchmark interest rate to a low of 0.15 percent in June, is not expected to take further action this month.The new data from Italy and Germany were causing some economists on Wednesday to question previous forecasts for eurozone G.D.P. in the second quarter. The European Union statistics agency is scheduled to publish an estimate of quarterly growth on Aug. 14.\u201cThe economy in the eurozone as a whole probably also expanded only moderately in Q2,\u201d Marco Wagner, an economist at Commerzbank, wrote in a note to investors.For Italy, the deteriorating economy puts greater pressure on Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who less than a week ago promised not to impose any more government budget cuts and to invest in improving the country\u2019s roads and other infrastructure. Such promises will be difficult to keep if slower growth, which usually translates into higher unemployment and lower corporate profits, limits tax receipts.A slower economy also endangers Italy\u2019s ability to comply with eurozone rules on budget deficits. Italy\u2019s 2.1 trillion euro government debt equals 136 percent of its annual gross domestic product, the second-highest debt ratio in the eurozone, after Greece.If G.D.P. shrinks, the ratio of debt to G.D.P. automatically rises. Italy would either have to breach spending limits \u2014 risking harsh criticism from its eurozone allies \u2014 or reduce government spending at a time when Italians are already complaining about cuts in services.Pier Carlo Padoan, the Italian economy minister, said Wednesday that the country would not violate European Union rules limiting annual budget deficits to 3 percent of gross domestic product. But, he told the financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore: \u201cThe country needs to reform itself alone, and is doing so. We have to do it even faster.\u201dItaly\u2019s slipping back into recession undermines optimism that some of the most troubled countries in the eurozone were on the cusp of revival. On Tuesday, UniCredit, the Italian bank, reported a steep increase in demand for credit in Italy, which was seen as a sign that businesses and individuals were becoming more optimistic about their economic prospects.In another hopeful sign, the Bank of Spain estimated last month that Spain had emerged from recession and that its economy probably grew 0.5 percent in the second quarter.But much of the eurozone remains in the doldrums. And Mr. Wagner and some other economists were wary of blaming Russia for the most recent figures. They said Italy\u2019s problems stemmed more from its failure make changes needed to improve the performance of its economy.Mr. Renzi, who took over as prime minister in February, was seen as having the charisma and drive to finally shake Italy out of its torpor. But it will be more difficult to overcome formidable political resistance to change with the country in a recession.\u201cThe slow pace of structural reforms is worrisome,\u201d said Paolo Manasse, a professor of macroeconomics at Bologna University. He said there was no sign of progress on necessary steps like selling off state-owned assets or overhauling the labor market or public pension system.\u201cThere is widespread disappointment,\u201d Mr. Manasse said, \u201camong those who gave credit to Renzi and his large political support after the European elections.\u201dJack Ewing reported from Frankfurt and Gaia Pianigiani from Rome.Advertisement"}

France, he said, could add 200,000 jobs and add 1.3 percentage points to economic growth over the next three years by extending 16 billion euros, or $21 billion, of tax breaks to the middle and lower classes.\u201cThat would raise the deficit a little \u2014 very, very little,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause growth would help to lift revenue.\u201dHe also said that the European Central Bank should employ the sort of outright purchases of government bonds that the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England have used.\u201cCompare the money creation of the Fed and the E.C.B.,\u201d he said. \u201cBetween 2008 and 2014, the Fed has increased the monetary base in the United States by 467 percent; that compares to 25 percent by the E.C.B. in the eurozone.\u201dHe noted that Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, appeared to have had a change of heart about the austerity dogma, calling during a speech last week at Jackson Hole, Wyo., for coordinated fiscal stimulus by eurozone governments to restore demand and jobs.But Mr. Montebourg expressed skepticism that the message was getting through to policy makers.\u201cWe can thank Mr. Draghi for having taken note of the difficulty of the situation,\u201d Mr. Montebourg said. But the E.C.B.'s latest policy measures, including putting into effect negative deposit rates in June, \u201care insufficient,\u201d he added. \u201cThese are temporary steps that will not increase the money supply.\u201dPressure is mounting \u2014 not just from Mr. Montebourg \u2014 on the bank to make further stimulus moves when its governing council meets next week.\u201cThe E.C.B. says it aims for 2 percent inflation, but it\u2019s not respecting that target at all,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re preoccupied with inflation that doesn\u2019t exist. They\u2019ve forgotten unemployment, which is massive; it\u2019s destroying the European Union.\u201dMr. Montebourg refused to comment on his political future, and declined to say how he thought the Socialists would fare now that Mr. Hollande had decisively turned away from the party\u2019s left wing.A lawyer by training, he said he would return to his home in Burgundy. \u201cIt\u2019s a new life for me,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I will remain a vigilant and engaged citizen.\u201dAsked if he might consider a run for president in the 2017 election, he replied, \u201cFor the moment, I\u2019m looking for a job.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Interest Rates Need to Stay Low", "Date": "2014-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe economic evidence indisputably favors Ms. Yellen, who has indicated that rate increases should not begin until sometime next year, at the earliest. It will take until then to be able to say with confidence whether recent improvements in growth and hiring are sustainable. For now, the prospects for both are mixed at best, with the preponderance of evidence \u2014 including the Fed\u2019s own analysis \u2014 indicating that growth this year will average out around a still-sluggish 2.3 percent. That is too slow to reliably boost the number and quality of jobs and, as such, too slow to justify raising rates. It is also unknown whether growth and hiring, if and when they fully recover, will spark inflation. For that to occur, wage increases would have to be substantial enough to push up prices, meaning annual raises in excess of 3.5 percent given present rates of inflation and productivity growth. Wage increases of that magnitude are not in the cards, and neither is any hint of worrisome inflation. Since the economic recovery began in mid-2009, hourly wages have risen by a mere 1.9 percent a year on average.Against that backdrop, arguing in favor of a near-term rate increase is to argue for subpar wage growth and for continuing a status quo in which economic gains flow largely into profits rather than wages. Ms. Yellen and her supporters are right to rebut that stance in both word and deed. The debate over interest rates does not stop there. Another argument in favor of near-term rate increases is that the Fed\u2019s prolonged low-rate policy is inflating asset bubbles that could burst with harmful consequences. Unlike the inflation argument, for which there is no evidence, concern about bubbles is justified. The Fed\u2019s loose policies have pushed up stock, bond and real estate prices \u2014 which is, in fact, the point of a low-rate policy. There is legitimate debate about how overvalued assets may be. But low rates, by fostering investments with borrowed money, invariably create the conditions for bubbles. There is no guarantee that keeping rates low for a \u201cconsiderable period,\u201d as the Fed leadership has pledged, will propel the economy forward. But it is all but certain the economy will backslide if rates are raised too soon. That\u2019s because the economy\u2019s critical underpinning \u2014 good jobs at good pay \u2014 has not yet been restored, and until it is, monetary support from the Fed and fiscal support from Congress are needed. Fiscal support has been withdrawn and reversed in recent years, a misguided move that has needlessly depressed growth and represents a failure of both policy and politics. Raising rates too soon would be a policy error on a par with that debacle, a mistake that the economy can ill afford. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Russia Sanctions Itself", "Date": "2014-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe sad truth of the tit-for-tat sanctions that Russia has imposed against the West is that they will hurt Russians far more than they will hurt Westerners. In effect, Russians will be getting another hefty bill for their president\u2019s arrogant efforts to batter Ukraine, and they will become more estranged from the global economy they need to develop their vast country.Mr. Putin\u2019s readiness to impose hardships on his own people rather than back down in Ukraine is, unfortunately, not surprising. His entire adventure in Ukraine, from the annexation of Crimea to the active military support for secessionists in eastern Ukraine, reflects his view of a zero-sum contest between Russia and the West in which Ukraine is the central battlefield. Even as Russia ordered the retaliatory sanctions, NATO reported that Russian troops were again massing on the Ukrainian border, once again raising the dangerous possibility of a direct intervention in support of the rebels, who are under attack by Ukrainian troops. Further, in addition to the ban on food imports, Mr. Medvedev indicated that Russia was also considering a ban on flights over Siberia, a measure that would add to the cost of Europe-Asia travel, but would also cost Russia millions in transit fees.Polls show that Mr. Putin is hugely popular with Russians, and no doubt his latest show of defiance against the West will find applause. But that could begin to change once prices for basic needs begin to rise and jobs begin to vanish in a contracting economy. The new economic elite, already funneling their money abroad at high rates, will not welcome the loss of the fine European foods that fill Moscow supermarkets. Many in the middle class are already wondering what it is they\u2019re paying so huge a price for, and that question is bound to spread as Russians lower on the economic scale begin to feel the pain.It is critical at this juncture for the Western allies to remain united, even if the cost of the sanctions \u2014 their own and Russia\u2019s \u2014 are not equally borne. The European Union has a fund to compensate farmers for lost production in times of crisis, and this is just such a time. Sanctions are a painful weapon, and Russia has been a lucrative market for Europe. But the alternatives to sanctions \u2014 military action on one side, or doing nothing in the face of Mr. Putin\u2019s brazen challenge to the post-Soviet order \u2014 are not really options.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ford\u2019s European Van Gets a Makeover for America", "Date": "2014-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s no secret that the classic American van is on its way out. Since the late 1960s, most full-size van models have been trucklike vehicles with stubby noses, long bodies and relatively low-profile front windshields. The General Motors G-Series and Dodge Ram vans are already gone.The Ford E-Series has been America\u2019s top-selling van since the early \u201880s, but it\u2019s also about to virtually disappear, replaced with something new for the United States, but not for Europe: the Ford Transit.The newest version of the carlike Transit cargo van was introduced at the Detroit auto show in January 2013, but Transit vans have been hauling cargo and passengers around Europe since the 1950s. The Transit has existed in its current modern-looking, wedge-shape form since 1986, receiving a couple of redesigns and face-lifts before the new model had its debut last year.The Transit van may look almost effete next to its burly, snub-nosed American predecessor, but Ford offers two wheelbases, three roof heights and three different body lengths for the new van that could make practicality minded commercial customers forget about what looks \u201cnormal.\u201d The low-roof vans are sleek by commercial van standards, and the long-overhang, high-roof Transits, although they look ungainly, have 487 cubic feet of cargo volume. Equipped with the optional dual rear-wheel axle, the Transit is rated to carry up to 4,650 pounds of cargo. The base model costs $30,560.There are places in the dash to put coffee cups where they won\u2019t spill. There\u2019s a flat spot on top of the dash where a clipboard can be placed. There\u2019s even a little pocket in the door that\u2019s hidden when the door is closed. The interior walls inside the stripped-down vans feature threaded attachment points for shelving and other equipment, which Ford says will prevent the potential rust problems from custom-drilled attachment holes.The passenger-oriented wagon models are offered with a variety of seating configurations, and Ford says that on the high-roof version, passengers up to 6 feet 5 inches tall can stand comfortably in the back. On the medium-roof version, a tall journalist at the event had only to bend his head down a little to stand inside.There are three engines available in the Transit: the standard 275-horsepower 3.7-liter V6, a 185-horsepower 3.2-liter diesel engine and the top-of-the-line 310-horsepower turbocharged 3.5-liter EcoBoost V6. The 3.7 proved adequate power, although it, like the EcoBoost, buzzed a bit at higher engine speeds. That seems to be a normal trait in Ford\u2019s V6 engine.The 5-cylinder diesel engine is the latest version of the Puma engine Ford has been selling overseas for more than a decade. The engine provides smooth power and 350 pound-feet of torque from 1,500 to 2,500 r.p.m., where a commercial vehicle needs it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "One Way to Fix the Corporate Tax: Repeal It", "Date": "2014-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cSome people are calling these companies \u2018corporate deserters.\u2019\u00a0\u201d A tax inversion occurs when an American company merges with a foreign one and, in the process, reincorporates abroad. Such mergers have many motives, but often one of them is to take advantage of the more favorable tax treatment offered by some other nations.Such tax inversions mean less money for the United States Treasury. As a result, the rest of us end up either paying higher taxes to support the government or enjoying fewer government services. So the president has good reason to be concerned.Yet demonizing the companies and their executives is the wrong response. A corporate chief who arranges a merger that increases the company\u2019s after-tax profit is doing his or her job. To forgo that opportunity would be failing to act as a responsible fiduciary for shareholders.Of course, we all have a responsibility to pay what we owe in taxes. But no one has a responsibility to pay more.If tax inversions are a problem, as arguably they are, the blame lies not with business leaders who are doing their best to do their jobs, but rather with the lawmakers who have failed to do the same. The writers of the tax code have given us a system that is deeply flawed in many ways, especially as it applies to businesses.A more subtle problem is that the United States has a form of corporate tax that differs from that of most nations and doesn\u2019t make much sense in the modern global economy.A main feature of the modern multinational corporation is that it is, truly, multinational. It has employees, customers and shareholders around the world. Its place of legal domicile is almost irrelevant. A good tax system would focus more on the economic fundamentals and less on the legal determination of a company\u2019s headquarters. Most nations recognize this principle by adopting a territorial corporate tax. They tax economic activity that occurs within their borders and exclude from taxation income earned abroad. (That foreign-source income, however, is usually taxed by the nation where it is earned.) Six of the Group of 7 nations have territorial tax systems. The exception is the United States, which has a worldwide corporate tax. For companies incorporated in the United States, the tax is based on all income, regardless of where it is earned. Again, moving our tax code toward international norms would help slow corporate inversions.Perhaps the boldest and best response to corporate inversions is to completely rethink the basis of corporate taxation. The first step is to acknowledge that corporations are more like tax collectors than taxpayers. The burden of the corporate tax is ultimately borne by people \u2014 some combination of the companies\u2019 employees, customers and shareholders. After recognizing that corporations are mere conduits, we can focus more directly on the people. Some may worry that a flat consumption tax is too easy on the rich or too hard on the poor. But there are ways to address these concerns. One possibility is to maintain a personal income tax for those with especially high incomes. Another is to use some revenue from the consumption tax to fund universal fixed rebates \u2014 sometimes called demogrants. Of course, the larger the rebate, the higher the tax rate would need to be.Major tax reform may be too much to hope for, given the current dysfunction in Washington. Nonetheless, it\u2019s worth keeping the possibilities in mind. Corporate tax inversions aren\u2019t the largest problem facing the nation, but they are a reminder that a better tax system is within reach, and that only politics stands in the way.N.

{"Headline": "Hong Kong Told to Strive for a \u2018Less Perfect\u2019 Democracy", "Date": "2014-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 On the eve of a decision by Beijing on rules for elections in Hong Kong, a top Chinese scholar presented a series of justifications on Thursday for why the territory\u2019s more than seven million people should temper demands for Western-style democracy, insisting that a \u201cless perfect\u201d version of democracy is better than none at all.Hong Kong is set to pick its top official, the chief executive, by a popular vote starting in 2017. China\u2019s legislature, the National People\u2019s Congress, is expected to give guidance in the coming days on how it should implement the elections.Beijing has taken the position that candidates must be vetted by a nominating committee, which democracy activists and pro-establishment figures alike say will screen out anyone seen as unacceptable by Beijing.Speaking in Hong Kong on Thursday, Wang Zhenmin, dean of the law school at Tsinghua University in Beijing, who advises the central government on Hong Kong issues, said \u201cno democracy in the world\u201d was perfect.\u201cThe overwhelming majority of the people in Hong Kong and the central authorities would like to see universal suffrage in 2017,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should not let the people down. More is less, less is more. Less perfect universal suffrage is better than no universal suffrage. Leave some room for future growth.\u201dMr. Wang, who visited Hong Kong under the auspices of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to make its case for the new rules, also assured Hong Kong residents that contrary to published reports, the territory\u2019s independent courts would be respected and flourish in coming years, as China itself moved toward a more rules-based system. He said reports that judges would be subject to a political requirement of \u201cloving the country\u201d were the result of mistranslations of a Chinese white paper.But the meat of his presentation focused on the election rules in the former British colony. One person familiar with the deliberations in Beijing, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the discussions, said the Congress would almost certainly insist that candidates be vetted by a nominating committee that would restrict the public from putting forth candidates.Democrats in the Hong Kong legislature have vowed to block any measure that does not allow for free and fair elections, and a broad coalition of citizens, including religious leaders, students and even some members of the city\u2019s financial community, have vowed to stage large protests that may disrupt business in Asia\u2019s top financial center if the government\u2019s plan limits who can be on the ballot.Mr. Wang acknowledged that there was mistrust over Beijing\u2019s intentions in Hong Kong, which is run separately from the rest of China under an agreement with Britain that paved the way for the return of Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Hong Kong citizens enjoy civil liberties, including freedoms of assembly, speech and religion, that are not available elsewhere in China. Many Hong Kong residents fear that such autonomy is being eroded, citing recent pressure on the media and a controversial policy document issued by Beijing earlier this year.\u201cSince the handover in 1997 we have not made good progress on confidence-building between Hong Kong and the mainland,\u201d Mr. Wang said.He likened the central government in Beijing to a mother, who would never do anything to harm her children. \u201cThe mother always acts in the best interests of her children,\u201d he said. \u201cHer intentions are pure.\u201dIn an unusual theoretical leap for a state that is still at least nominally socialist, Mr. Wang suggested one reason to keep control of the nomination process was to protect the interests of its capitalist class.\u201cWe have to take care of every class,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery group of people. Every person. Rich or poor. No one should be ignored. No one should be left behind. Especially those whose slice of pie will be shared by others upon the implementation of universal suffrage.\u201dMany of Hong Kong\u2019s tycoons \u2014 at the top of the hierarchy in a city that has for decades been ranked as one of the most free-market economies in the world \u2014 have long feared that democracy would lead to the introduction of a European-style welfare state, with much higher taxes on their fortunes to pay for it. Since Hong Kong\u2019s return to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, a committee of about 1,200 electors who choose the top leader has been stacked with tycoons, and the first chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, was drawn from their ranks.Mr. Wang drew on a theoretical shift made more than a decade ago that allowed capitalists into the Communist Party. The so-called \u201cThree Represents\u201d policy formally ended decades of official hostility toward the business class in a state founded to promote the interests of workers and peasants.But on Thursday, Mr. Wang appeared to take that one step further, putting the interests of the wealthy above others\u2019 by advocating that they retain power in Hong Kong disproportionate to their numbers.\u201cEven if it is a small group of people, a very small group of people,\u201d Mr. Wang said. \u201cBut they control the destiny of the economy in Hong Kong. If we just ignore their interests, then Hong Kong capitalism will stop. So that\u2019s why on the one hand we realize universal suffrage in Hong Kong, on the other hand we must guarantee the continued development of capitalism in Hong Kong.\u201dMartin Lee, founder of the Democratic Party, who helped to write the laws that will govern Hong Kong separately from the rest of China until 2047, said the idea that the interests of the rich wouldn\u2019t be protected in a democracy went against the experience of advanced industrialized states.\u201cThere\u2019s a Republican Party in the States, there\u2019s a Conservative Party in the United Kingdom. Right? I mean you can just form your own party,\u201d Mr. Lee said in an interview following Mr. Wang\u2019s remarks. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason why the law should be bent to protect their interest above the interest of everybody else. We\u2019re talking about equal rights, and they cannot claim to be more equal than the others.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Swelling School Districts Find Costly Way to Put Off the Pain", "Date": "2014-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Texas TribuneAUSTIN, Tex. \u2014 In 1994, the Leander school district had 7,200 students and was growing fast. To handle the hundreds of additional students expected in the coming year, the Central Texas district embarked on a building binge, including the construction of its sixth and seventh elementary schools.Twenty years later, with the economy thriving, the district remains one of the most popular destinations for families in Texas. Enrollment has more than quintupled to 36,750 and is projected to top 50,000 by 2023. The district now has 24 elementary schools and, officials say, needs at least five more.\u201cWe\u2019re growing by 1,000 to 1,200 children every year, which, if you think about it, is pretty much a middle school every year, or an elementary school and a half, or half a high school,\u201d the assistant superintendent for business and operations, Ellen Skoviera, said.Handling this growth is not cheap. Leander has $1.7 billion of debt, more than would normally be allowed under state law. To get around the limit on debt, Leander and other districts have relied heavily on a controversial financing tool called capital appreciation bonds. Their upside: No payments are required for years, even decades. Their downside: They cost more and may saddle taxpayers with a massive I.O.U. far into the future.The difference between more traditional bonds and capital appreciation bonds is principally about timing. With a traditional bond, a local government can borrow money, then pay off the principal and interest in installments until the debt is retired. With a capital appreciation bond, installment payments are not required for the duration of the bond. The district must, however, pay the entire principal plus years of compounded interest when the bond reaches maturity in 30 or 40 years. The avoidance of installment payments comes at the cost of higher interest, potentially as much as 10 times the amount borrowed compared with a traditional bond, according to public finance officials. \u201cMeryl votes it in today, and then Tom, Dick and Harry comes in and, boy, are they in for a surprise,\u201d the state comptroller, Susan Combs, said, explaining her dislike of the bonds.School districts that have used capital appreciation bonds say they are hamstrung by what is known as the \u201c50-cent test\u201d \u2014 a state law that limits the property tax rates that districts can assess to cover debt service costs to 50 cents per $100 of assessed value. By pushing required payments far into the future, capital appreciation bonds allow districts at or near the cap to issue more debt without having to increase their tax rates.Public entities in Texas have used the bonds for decades, often to refinance existing debt and avoid tax increases. But in recent years, critics have raised concerns as some fast-growing school districts have used the bonds to sidestep the 50-cent test and sharply increase their overall debt.Leander has issued more debt through capital appreciation bonds than any other Texas school district in the last decade. It has become a defender of the bonds, though a bit reluctantly, calling them prudent fiscal policy for fast-growing districts.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be known as the district with debt,\u201d Ms. Skoviera said. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been known for our academic excellence, and that\u2019s why people come here.\u201dThe district began using the bonds more aggressively in the 1990s, when enrollment began to soar, fueled by Leander\u2019s proximity to Austin and its abundance of land available for development. Because of the rising enrollment, Leander is using 39 temporary, mobile-homelike classrooms. Without the capital appreciation bonds, the number of temporary classrooms would be much higher, Ms. Skoviera said.\u201cWhat C.A.B.s do is they give you an ability to direct when your payments are made so you can control your tax rate and ensure you can build within 50 cents,\u201d Ms. Skoviera said. Last year, Fitch Ratings downgraded the school district\u2019s credit rating to AA-, in part because of its heavy use of capital appreciation bonds, though it still classified the district as a low credit risk. Some of Leander\u2019s C.A.B.-related debt does not require a payment for nearly 30 years, but the district plans to pay off much of it well before those bonds mature, Ms. Skoviera said. While the district will ultimately pay more than if it had used more traditional bonds, it will not pay interest anywhere near 10 times the amount borrowed, as some critics have claimed. In a worst-case situation, she said, the district would end up paying $3.7 billion to pay off its $1.7 billion in debt. \u201cYes, it costs more, but when you\u2019re at 50 cents and another 1,200 children come in, we think, \u2018Where are we going to put them?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ms. Skoviera said.\u201cWe need to look and research other ways to provide them with public financing tools so they can build capacity and handle the growth in population,\u201d he said. \u201cBut certainly C.A.B.s are not the answer.\u201d\u201cI think schools need to begin looking at their existing resource pools before going to outside sources, especially when they\u2019re tapped out of issuing debt already,\u201d Mr. Quintero said. In the meantime, Leander and other school districts will consider issuing more capital appreciation bonds. The Eagle Mountain-Saginaw school district in Tarrant County is already taxing property for debt service costs at 50 cents per $100, the most allowed under state law. Though the district\u2019s property tax revenue has increased, it has not kept up with the rising number of students, said James Schiele, the district\u2019s chief financial officer. He said the district\u2019s options were to increase class sizes, install more temporary classrooms or issue capital appreciation bonds. The school board was likely to choose bigger classes, he added.\u201cIt\u2019s the choice of death by firing squad or death by electrocution,\u201d Mr. Schiele said. \u201cThe bottom line is, if you put people in an insane situation, don\u2019t expect rational decisions.\u201dabatheja@texastribune.org Advertisement"}

Behold my dirty pillows, my fun bags. Come nurse at the fountain of bliss.\u2019 \u201dHe was 42 then, wearing his Popeye outfit, a blue-striped T-shirt and black baggy jeans. Surrounded by kids, a rabbit and an iguana, we talked about everything from John Belushi to his father, a stern Ford Motor Company executive. As our interview ended, I was telling him about my friend Michael Kelly\u2019s idea for a 1-900 number, not one to call Asian beauties or Swedish babes, but where you\u2019d have an amorous chat with a repressed Irish woman. Williams delightedly riffed on the caricature, playing the role of an older Irish woman answering the sex line in a brusque brogue, ordering a horny caller to go to the devil with his impure thoughts and disgusting desire.I couldn\u2019t wait to play the tape for Kelly, who doubled over in laughter.The woman who always does her homework, the woman who resigned as president of Wellesley College\u2019s Young Republicans over the Vietnam War, made that vote without even bothering to read the National Intelligence Estimate with its skimpy evidence.It was obvious in real time that the Bush crew was arbitrarily switching countries, blaming 9/11 on Saddam so they\u2019d get more vivid vengeance targets and a chance to shake up the Middle East chessboard, and that officials were shamelessly making up the threat as they went along. For me to believe that Hillary would be a good president, I would need to feel that she had learned something from that deadly, globe-shattering vote \u2014 a calculated attempt to be tough and show that, as a Democratic woman, she was not afraid to use power.Yet, she\u2019s still at it.As one Democrat noted, citing the callous Clintonian principle that unpopular things make foolish investments: \u201cIf Obama was at 63 instead of 36, she\u2019d be happy to be Robin to his Batman.\u201dIt\u2019s not that she\u2019s too old, despite nasty cracks on conservative websites like the Washington Free Beacon.

Americans are sick of the idea that we should plunge in and plant our flag in the ground and work out the details later. It\u2019s a complicated world, where you cross the border from Syria to Iraq and your allies are the enemy.Hillary booed the president, who has been boosting her at the expense of his own vice president, and said that, as secretary of state, she had wanted to do more to help the Syrian rebels. She said that Obama\u2019s \u201cfailure\u201d in Syria led to the rise of ISIS and sniped about Obama\u2019s slogan: \u201cGreat nations need organizing principles, and \u2018Don\u2019t do stupid stuff\u2019 is not an organizing principle.\u201dSaying you can\u2019t live by slogans is rich, coming from someone whose husband\u2019s presidency was built on \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid.\u201d David Axelrod tartly tweeted: \u201cJust to clarify: \u2018Don\u2019t do stupid stuff\u2019 means stuff like occupying Iraq in the first place, which was a tragically bad decision.\u201dHillary may know that she seemed unseemly.

{"Headline": "After Heated Week, President Blows Off Steam", "Date": "2014-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhite House MemoWASHINGTON \u2014 At the end of a week of frustrating developments for the White House, at home and overseas, President Obama took time on Friday afternoon to vent.The president revealed a long list of gripes in a nearly 50-minute news conference: a recalcitrant Congress that is refusing to deliver the amount of emergency funding he requested for a border bill; crises in the Middle East and Ukraine that defy quick or simple solutions; even a press corps that neglected to wish him a happy birthday.For a president who has already shown signs of second-term fatigue and disillusionment, the question-and-answer session was a display of Mr. Obama\u2019s exasperation with the limits of his power and the burden of outsize expectations.\u201cIt kind of will be seen in history as his \u2018I\u2019m sick of the gridlock\u2019 press conference,\u201d said Douglas G. Brinkley, a presidential historian. \u201cIt\u2019s a president that feels that he has no more patience with Congress\u2019s shenanigans and what he considers the politics of the moment.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a frustration in the second term, and there\u2019s a bit of a scolding feel here,\u201d Mr. Brinkley added. \u201cHe\u2019s the president that promised to keep us out of foreign wars and get the economy going, and he\u2019s done that, but people are still nit-picking.\u201dThe news conference started on a cheery note as Mr. Obama opened with the day\u2019s economic news of strong job growth. \u201cThings are better,\u201d he said. \u201cOur engines are revving a little bit louder.\u201dBut it soured from there. The president complained of \u201creally unfair criticism\u201d leveled at Secretary of State John Kerry for his efforts to reach a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza and gave a pessimistic prognosis for restoring the most recent truce, which broke down Friday 90 minutes after it began.\u201cIt\u2019s difficult, and I don\u2019t think we should pretend otherwise,\u201d Mr. Obama said of the conflict. It was a sentiment he returned to on a range of issues. Mr. Obama lamented congressional dysfunction in which, he said, \u201ceven basic common-sense, plain-vanilla legislation can\u2019t pass because House Republicans consider it somehow a compromise of their principles or giving Obama a victory.\u201dHe bristled at criticism of his foreign policy, saying, \u201cApparently, people have forgotten that America, as the most powerful country on earth, still does not control everything around the world.\u201dHe complained about trying to change people who do not want to change themselves. \u201cWe can leave them to resolve some of the technical issues and to show them a path, but they\u2019ve got to want it,\u201d Mr. Obama said of the Israelis and the Palestinians. He spoke of the limits of his influence in Ukraine. \u201cShort of going to war, there are going to be some constraints in terms of what we can do if President Putin and Russia are ignoring what should be their long-term interests,\u201d he said. Even when he returned to the happier news of the economy, Mr. Obama was in a defensive crouch, saying that if he had held a similar news conference in his first term, the questions would all have been about the lack of jobs and sluggish housing market.\u201cWell, you know what?\u201d the president said. \u201cWhat we did worked, and the economy\u2019s better. It shows you that if you stay at it, eventually we make some progress.\u201dJon Favreau, a former speechwriter for Mr. Obama, said the president was not necessarily in a foul humor. \u201cHe was clearly in a mood of, \u2018I\u2019m going to sit here and take all the questions there are,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Favreau said. \u201cTo me, it was less frustration and more just sort of telling it like it is: This is the Congress we have, this is the situation we\u2019re in, this is the mindless partisanship we\u2019re facing, and I\u2019m going to keep trying.\u201d Still, for a president who once campaigned on hope and change, Mr. Obama\u2019s talk of trying had a distinctly pessimistic edge. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very hard to put a cease-fire back together again if Israelis and the international community can\u2019t feel confident that Hamas can follow through on a cease-fire commitment,\u201d he said. Mr. Obama also suggested that he and his team had been over-criticized and underappreciated merely for taking on a role in the world that no other nation would bother to play. \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be a bunch of complaints and second-guessing about, \u2018Well, it hasn\u2019t happened yet,\u2019 or nit-picking before he\u2019s had a chance to complete his efforts,\u201d he said of Mr. Kerry. \u201cBecause, I tell you what, there isn\u2019t any other country that\u2019s going in there and making those efforts.\u201dThe president briefly broke the dour mood of the news conference with a mention of his birthday on Monday \u2014 by way of a playful complaint.\u201cI thought that you guys were going to ask me how I was going to spend my birthday,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cWhat happened to the \u2018Happy Birthday\u2019 thing?\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Intensifying Presidential Campaign Brings Tension to Brazil\u2019s Markets", "Date": "2014-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe tension in the markets is accentuating the strain between Ms. Rousseff and many in the country\u2019s business establishment, revealing a debate over development priorities and who should benefit from Brazil\u2019s natural resources as authorities grapple with a sluggish economy.Ms. Rousseff is expanding the sway of huge state-controlled banks and energy companies while promoting antipoverty projects and imposing controls on energy prices to keep inflation from climbing. Her opponents contend that these policies are curbing growth, heightening the reliance of many companies on loans from state banks and delaying a rise in inflation until after the presidential elections.\u201cThere\u2019s a lack of humility and self-criticism in the government over policies which are blatantly incompetent,\u201d said Rog\u00e9rio Freitas, a partner at Te\u00f3rica Investimentos, a Brazilian hedge fund. \u201cThe results speak for themselves with an economy in stagnation, but to make things scarier the authorities are trying to limit dissent among those who are simply stating the obvious.\u201dThe president reacted furiously, describing the Santander report as \u201cunacceptable\u201d interference in Brazil\u2019s financial system. Santander promptly fired the analyst who wrote the report and issued a public apology, raising concerns over reprisals against others who criticize Ms. Rousseff.She had especially harsh words for Mr. Neves, whose party held power in Brazil from 1994 to 2002 and introduced a stabilization program that radically restructured the economy. The measures vanquished galloping inflation, opening the way for the next decade\u2019s growth.Still, some economists on the left, including Ms. Rousseff, say that scant attention was paid then to cutting inequality. \u201cHe\u2019s going to do what they did when his party was in power: unemployment, recession and the tightening of salaries,\u201d Ms. Rousseff said of Mr. Neves. \u201cLook at the data since 2003, and you see the more virtuous reality of Brazil.\u201dUnemployment in Brazil remains near record lows, and controls on energy prices have kept inflation in check.But as Ms. Rousseff reinforces a model of state capitalism that grants exceptional influence to the oil giant Petrobras and other national companies, executives at some of Brazil\u2019s largest private corporations are fuming.\u201cOnly someone who is crazy would invest in Brazil,\u201d Benjamin Steinbruch, the president of one of the country\u2019s largest steel makers and the leader of S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s powerful Federation of Industries, an industry group, said this month at a business conference.But in a reflection of rising polarization in Brazil, positive public sentiment about Ms. Rousseff among many antipoverty program recipients stands in contrast to the souring views of her government in Brazil\u2019s executive suites and trading floors.\u201cI think Dilma\u2019s projects are excellent,\u201d said B\u00e1rbara Leite, 29, who recently moved from a gritty area on Rio de Janeiro\u2019s outskirts to a new low-income housing complex near the city\u2019s old center, thanks to a program called \u201cMy House My Life\u201d that allows people to own subsidized apartments by paying monthly installments as low as $44.While the selection process involved two years of bureaucratic wrangling, Ms. Leite, who previously had been paying about $220 a month in rent, said it was worth it. Upon moving in, she even received a stipend of about $2,200 to furnish her apartment. \u201cThings have really improved for me,\u201d she said.Such programs have clearly helped the president maintain her lead in the polls. Still, the campaign has grown more unpredictable since it became clear that Ms. Silva, who broke from the Workers Party in 2009, would enter the race.Indeed, Brazil\u2019s main stock index has climbed since March on expectations that Ms. Rousseff\u2019s opponents could fare well in the race, raising the possibility that shares could fall sharply if they do not. At the same time, some economists contend that many of the bets against Ms. Rousseff\u2019s candidacy are merely efforts by traders to profit from the election\u2019s volatility.\u201cThe idea that Dilma\u2019s re-election would somehow be the end of Brazil is an exaggeration,\u201d said Nelson Barbosa, a former high-ranking official in the Finance Ministry, referring to the president by her first name, a widespread custom in Brazil. \u201cIf she wins, there could still be a gradual adjustment of policies, including the smoothing-out of price controls.\u201dMany Brazilians who are not benefiting from Ms. Rousseff\u2019s antipoverty programs, however, express indignation over her emphasis on social spending and control of big state companies \u2014 another example of how this year\u2019s election is emerging as a test not just of the president but also of her big-government vision for leading Brazil.\u201cAll of these projects make people dependent on them for their entire lives,\u201d said Carlos Eduardo Ildefonso, 31, an English professor at a private university in Cabo Frio, a city near Rio. \u201cI don\u2019t have faith in Dilma\u2019s social policies.

Criner, the pastor of St. Rest Baptist Church in Fresno, who has worked with the homeless for more than a decade, called the video \u201cpure buffoonery for publicity.\u201d\u201cTo pose as a homeless man is just wrong \u2014 it\u2019s no different than a white man putting on black face and saying he knows what it is to be black,\u201d Mr. Criner said. \u201cIf he was really homeless, he would have no insurance, nothing to lean back on, but at the end of the seven days he can go back to his beach mansion.\u201dDan Newman, a spokesman for the Brown campaign, called the move a \u201cbizarre campaign stunt,\u201d adding, \u201cIf this were more than a stunt, would he oppose providing unemployment benefits for people without jobs and fight the minimum wage for the working poor?\u201dWhile the publicity blitz may not propel Mr. Kashkari into office, it instantly lifted his profile both inside the state and nationally, as he continued to try to carve out his image as a new face of the Republican Party. It is not the first time he has tried to present a softer image to appeal to voters here, where Democrats now hold every statewide office and maintain overwhelming control of the Legislature. In the last several months, he has campaigned in African-American churches, gay pride parades and at a teachers union convention.\u201cEverything starts with education and jobs,\u201d Mr. Kashkari said by telephone. \u201cWe talk about temporary help, but if the bridge is a bridge to nowhere, what does it matter? There has to be land, and that land has to be a job.\u201dMr. Kashkari said he remained opposed to raising the minimum wage.\u201cWould that have helped me get a job?\u201d he asked. \u201cAbsolutely not, it would have made it harder.\u201d The city where the experiment took place \u2014 Fresno, the largest city in California\u2019s agriculturally rich Central Valley \u2014 has struggled with higher rates of unemployment and poverty than the rest of the state. And now, facing a drought that has meant an enormous reduction in farm jobs, the region is struggling even more. Still, several advocates for the poor dismissed Mr. Kashkari\u2019s solutions \u2014 fewer regulations for businesses and more new jobs, rather than more social services \u2014 as na\u00efve and misleading.\u201cI am delighted that he is putting this out on the forefront, rightly highlighting that there is a loss of hope,\u201d said Vanessa Aramayo, the executive director of California Partnership, an umbrella group for dozens of antipoverty groups. \u201cWe do have a crisis in California, but he like many is missing the bigger picture \u2014 it lacks vision and insight. It\u2019s not just about creating jobs \u2014 I can be working 40 hours a week and still not able to make ends meet.\u201dMs. Aramayo and others have criticized Mr. Brown for ignoring the poor and choosing to use the state\u2019s budget surplus for a rainy-day fund rather than for more social services. As for Mr. Kashkari, \u201cIt\u2019s very important conversation and at least he\u2019s bringing it up \u2014 the governor is not,\u201d Ms. Aramayo said.In the video, Mr. Kashkari is seen stopping in a local thrift store, a mini-mart and a repair shop asking for work of any kind. And while he was rarely recognized on the streets, there were signs that he was not quite typical \u2014 at one point in the video he jots down notes for a job lead inside a Moleskine notebook, which usually costs at least $10.Mr. Kashkari said he did not yet know how much the video would cost the campaign but said it had been operating on a \u201cshoestring budget.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "It\u2019s a Long Way to the Top", "Date": "2014-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAround the BlockThe 2014 Ram Power Wagon. The 2500 Power Wagon is tall. How tall? It doesn\u2019t have floorboards, it has a mezzanine level. You could park it at the beach and use it as a lighthouse. Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair so we can go mud-running. Just to get literal for a moment, the tailgate is 40 inches off the ground when it\u2019s lowered. Which is nice at the grocery store because you can just back up to the loading dock.The Power Wagon is Ram\u2019s ultimate off-roader, factory-equipped with front and rear locking differentials, an electronic disconnecting front antiroll bar and a Warn winch. The underside is armored with skid plates and the front bumper is studded with red tow hooks. In the name of heroic off-road ground clearance, the Power Wagon\u2019s suspension is lifted two inches over the already towering Ram 2500, allowing room for 33-inch-tall Goodyear Wrangler Duratrac tires. Which, frankly, look a little small down there beneath the soaring arches of the Ram\u2019s fenders. But the modest tires are probably a necessity, since the truck is already on the verge of bashing the top of its cab on the way into standard garages. I nosed the Power Wagon into my garage, opened the sunroof and found I could high-five the top of the doorframe. There were a couple of inches to spare at the top, but I didn\u2019t park inside, because the Crew Cab is about 20 feet long and so is my garage. Oh, for want of an aircraft hangar.Because of its dimensions, the Power Wagon is suited for certain off-road geography \u2014 big obstacles and big spaces. Northern logging trails, Western washes, Southern mudholes: all good. Tight trails? Perhaps you\u2019ll want to put an ATV in the bed, a tender for your land yacht.I\u2019ll admit I didn\u2019t get the Power Wagon too far off road, because my local trails are more suited to Jeep Wranglers and Suzuki Samurais; I once tried taking a Toyota Tundra out there, and it was like trying to squeeze Warren Sapp into a Tokyo subway car at rush hour. So my time was spent mostly on the street, where the 2014 Power Wagon has a few advantages over the 2013 model, mainly because it enjoys the same upgrades as other 2500 Rams: coil-spring rear suspension and a new 6.4-liter V8.The new engine isn\u2019t drastically more powerful than the previous 5.7-liter, but it\u2019s brawny enough that the Power Wagon can use a 4.10 final drive ratio instead of a tachometer-twisting 4.56:1. The new motor also has variable valve timing and cylinder deactivation, helping the fuel economy cause for a truck that can use all the help it can get.On a flat road at a steady 60 m.p.h., humming on four cylinders, the Power Wagon might approach 20 m.p.g. But 15 is probably more realistic. Why no Power Wagon with a Cummins diesel engine, you ask? Because the Cummins, which is available on other 2500 Rams, is physically incompatible with some of the Power Wagon gear \u2014 its intercooler, for instance, resides in the same spot as the Power Wagon\u2019s winch. The Cummins\u2019s incredible torque is almost redundant in low-range four-wheel-drive, when the transfer case is already multiplying torque to the wheels. So there are plenty of reasons not to build a Cummins Power Wagon, which isn\u2019t to say it\u2019s been totally ruled out. After all, Chrysler has brought back Alfa Romeo and just released a four-door family car that does 204 m.p.h. There are good reasons not to do those things, either.Fuel economy aside, the Power Wagon drives amazingly well. Heavy-duty pickups tend to ride stiffly, but the Ram\u2019s coil-spring rear suspension is relatively compliant. Bumps are vague seismic events that don\u2019t much disturb the Laramie\u2019s heated and cooled leather driver\u2019s seat. Taking some starch out of the suspension also furthers the off-road mission, since strong axle articulation \u2014 flex \u2014 helps to maintain traction on uneven surfaces. With the front antiroll bar disconnected, the truck can put one front tire atop a 26-inch-tall obstacle while keeping the three other tires on the ground. With the axles locked and the antiroll bar disconnected, this thing will go just about anywhere.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Resist Changing Direction Because of a Single Event", "Date": "2014-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySketch GuyI recently went backpacking in the Uinta Mountains. It\u2019s a range of gorgeous peaks close to my home in Park City, Utah. A group of friends planned to spend a few days in the backcountry, so we got together to discuss everything we\u2019d need for the trip. We had a lot of experience hiking and camping in this area, and we talked about a lot of things. But one subject never came up: bears.Bears do exist in the Uintas, and we know it, but they\u2019re rare. I\u2019ve taken other trips, to the Teton Range and to Yellowstone, and plans always included the possibility of bears because they\u2019re more common there. On this particular trip, however, we didn\u2019t think about it.We started the 11-mile hike into our campsite, and about four miles in, we came upon a park ranger riding a horse and towing a pack mule called Erma (the ranger called her Erm). We stopped to chat about the weather, and our friendly ranger mentioned offhandedly that someone had seen a bear a few days earlier. She didn\u2019t mention the exact location, where the bear was headed or give us any kind of warning. She was just a ranger who happened to mention a bear during a conversation.What happened next was interesting to watch. Again, only one person had seen a bear in the area, and it\u2019s an enormous area. But based on a single observation, we started behaving differently. Over the next two days, we did things we hadn\u2019t planned on during our trip prep.We hung our food in the trees and took other precautions to avoid attracting bears to our campsite. To be clear, these things were all good ideas, but the point is we had not planned on doing them. All it took was a single comment, based on a secondhand report, to change our behavior.On the hike out, I thought about our response. It was based on a single report, a sample size of exactly one. In statistics, the shorthand for the sample size of an experiment is often denoted by using the letter \u201cN.\u201d It equals the number of observations in the sample, and having an N of one is more closely related to a personal story or anecdote than to a valid experiment.In other words, it\u2019s rarely a good idea to make a decision when N equals one.Yet, we do it all the time with our money. We\u2019ll start by doing the right thing and picking the investment options in our retirement plan at work based on what we think will give us the best shot at meeting our goals down the road. And we\u2019re happy with our choices, until we hear on the news that the economy is slowing down. Or we talk to a co-worker who can\u2019t believe we\u2019re still invested in the international fund or ignoring the new real estate offering.Whatever the catalyst, we latch on to one observation and let it send us into a tailspin. It\u2019s very easy to forget that it\u2019s just a single observation. In most cases, it\u2019s just someone else\u2019s opinion or guess.It\u2019s so important to expand our sample size before making big money decisions. A single event, weighed in the context of everything else that\u2019s happening, does not predict the future. But in the heat of the moment, it can feel like everything hinges on this one thing. If we genuinely feel like a single sample is of some consequence, then it shouldn\u2019t be that difficult to get confirmation of our conclusion from other samples.These single observations can stick around in our thoughts for a long time, even though we know better. I know, for example, that the next time I go into the Uintas, bears will come up during trip prep. In fact, I still latch on to a single sample that happened years ago when I rode my motorcycle down a canyon near my home.I\u2019ve driven this particular route hundreds of times, and one time (one time!), a deer ran out in front of me. Now, every time, in that same place, I think, \u201cO.K., watch out for a deer.\u201d There\u2019s nothing special about that particular spot in the road. A deer could just as easily pop out somewhere else, but I now assume that\u2019s where a deer will appear.There will be times when a single observation will remind us of something we should be doing anyway. I don\u2019t regret being cautious about bears or being careful when I\u2019m riding my motorcycle. But we also need to understand how an N of one may not always mean what we think it means.We\u2019re really good at taking a single sample and blowing it out of proportion. We need to get better at putting single samples into context. Yes, this one thing happened, and it seems like a big deal, but does it truly justify changing all your plans? The answer almost every time will be, \u201cNo.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Midterm Election Mind-Reading: The Market Tends to Win", "Date": "2014-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesWill the Republicans win control of Congress? With summer drawing to a close, the midterm election is just two months away and this question is likely to be analyzed and debated with increasing urgency. But for the stock market, the answer may not matter at all: The market has a tendency to rally no matter which party wins a midterm election. That\u2019s what the historical record suggests, anyway. In fact, from the standpoint of stock market history, political outcomes aren\u2019t very relevant, but the calendar is. September is typically a difficult and volatile month for stocks, while in a midterm election year the clouds over Wall Street have tended to lift in October. Regardless of which side has won in a November midterm election, the market has generally prospered for the rest of the year. And it has often excelled in the next calendar year, typically the most propitious year for stocks in what is often called the four-year presidential cycle.Here is that compendium\u2019s current calculations for the average annual gain of the Dow Jones industrial average in each year of a presidential term, going back to the beginning of the 20th century: 6.2 percent for Year 1, 4 percent for Year 2 (which this midterm year would be), 12.4 percent for Year 3 and 7.5 percent for Year 4. What to make of all this? The data can be endlessly fascinating, in the way baseball or soccer statistics can be. (Forgive me, Britain: For you, it\u2019s \u201cfootball.\u201d) They may be best used as light entertainment.So let\u2019s be clear: These are merely patterns, not reliable statistics. As the saying goes, past performance doesn\u2019t guarantee future returns. Virtually no one recommends using historical market patterns as simple templates for investing. \u201cWe believe these patterns are worth considering,\u201d Mr. Clissold said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t believe they ought to be anyone\u2019s main input for investing.\u201dThe correlation between a political outcome and the movement of the stock market hasn\u2019t been demonstrated in as compelling a fashion. There are theories, of course. Mr. Hirsch said that because presidents \u2014 and their parties \u2014 want to win elections, they manipulate the economy as best they can to assure favorable outcomes, and in so doing they affect the stock market. In a president\u2019s first year, for example, he can afford to take tough measures, proceeding to stimulate the economy when the next election draws near, or so the theory goes. Academics have considered these issues, too. In most cases, the research has been inconclusive. But oh, those numbers! They are endlessly intriguing: The stock market, for example, has generally done better under Democratic presidents than Republican ones. From 1901 through 2013, the Dow gained 7.9 percent, annualized, under Democrats, versus 3 percent under Republicans, according to Ned Davis data. Why? Then there are midterm elections under Democratic presidents, specifically. The market has done splendidly when Congress has been split, as it is now, with annualized returns of 10.4 percent, but there is a major caveat, Mr. Clissold said. The Obama years are the only ones since the dawn of the 20th century in which there has been a Democratic president with a divided Congress. \u201cThat\u2019s not a very big data set,\u201d he said wryly.There\u2019s a little more data for a Republican-controlled Congress under a Democratic president, an alignment that occurred under both Bill Clinton and Woodrow Wilson, and in those years the Dow gained 9.6 percent, on average. The record for midterm elections under lame ducks like Mr. Obama isn\u2019t very deep, either. Since World War II, there have been four of them, during the presidencies of Dwight D. Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan, Mr. Clinton and George W. Bush. The midterm in November will be the fifth. For what it\u2019s worth, the data is upbeat, Mr. Hickey said, with positive returns but less volatility than in elections during presidential first terms. Regardless of the outcome in the Senate, Republicans are virtually assured of retaining control of the House, so power in Washington will remain divided, and that\u2019s been good for stocks, Mr. Hickey said. \u201cThe market seems to like it when you don\u2019t have one party controlling everything. It likes the status quo. And it likes it when administrations run out of steam,\u201d which, he said, tends to happen by the middle of a presidential second term.\u201cWall Street assumes a president at that point won\u2019t get much more done,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the market likes it when nothing much happens in Washington.\u201d None of this proves where the market is heading, of course, and it isn\u2019t an uplifting gloss on the state of affairs in Washington. It does, however, suggest a cheery mood for the stock market over the next year or so. And if enough people believe it, that may even turn out to be true. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amid Election Impasse, Calls in Afghanistan for an Interim Government", "Date": "2014-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA coterie of powerful Afghan government ministers and officials with strong ties to the security forces are threatening to seize power if an election impasse that has paralyzed the country is not resolved soon.Though it is unusual to telegraph plans for what could amount to a coup \u2014 though no one is calling it that \u2014 the officials all stressed that they hoped the mere threat of forming an interim government would persuade the country\u2019s rival presidential candidates, Abdullah Abdullah and Ashraf Ghani, to make the compromises needed to end the crisis.After weeks of quietly discussing the prospect of imposing a temporary government, officials within the Karzai government said the best way out of a crisis that had emboldened the Taliban, weakened an already struggling economy and left many here deeply pessimistic about the country\u2019s democratic future, might well be some form of interim government, most likely run by a committee.\u201cBut what will happen if the legal institutions, if they are not working?\u201d asked Rangin Dadfar Spanta, national security adviser to President Hamid Karzai, though he declined to explicitly back any move toward an interim government and insisted a solution to the crisis must be in line with Afghanistan\u2019s Constitution.It often happens that when power is seized during a political crisis, as in Thailand or Egypt, those taking charge argue that the step is essential to restore order and protect democracy in the long run. That is also the case here, where such a move is being advertised as a last resort to save democracy. It could also effectively discard the results of a presidential runoff election that, until it was derailed by allegations of fraud, had been promoted as a historic event in a country that never had a democratic transfer of power.\u201cIt\u2019s not only tactical, it\u2019s real, and it\u2019s because the memory of the crisis years ago in the 1990s is still fresh, and they don\u2019t want to go to that,\u201d the official said.That official and others interviewed in recent days spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were discussing plans that could be considered seditious. The fact that they discussed the plans in advance suggests that they are using the threat of a coup to achieve political ends, not simply plotting in secret to execute one.The officials said they believed they would have the backing of Afghanistan\u2019s army, police and intelligence corps. Though no concrete plans are in place, several officials said a committee would most likely be formed to run Afghanistan and that representatives of Mr. Abdullah and Mr. Ghani would be asked to join. Both candidates have dismissed the idea of an interim government.Many Afghans are liable to view any step to an interim government as a power grab by the men who surrounded Mr. Karzai for the last 12 years who may be seeking an excuse to preserve their power.The United States and European countries are loath to see Afghan officials make an end-run around Afghanistan\u2019s Constitution, which would call into question the lives lost and billions spent by the West in Afghanistan. Yet, in the two months since the runoff, the Abdullah and Ghani campaigns have proved unable or unwilling to compromise.Along with the threat of violence, the political fight has brought Afghanistan\u2019s ethnic divides back to the surface, pitting the smaller Tajik and Hazara communities against the dominant Pashtuns. The economy is suffering as well. Two Afghan officials warned that the government would soon be unable to pay its civil servants because revenue from taxes and customs were down by nearly a third this year.A new government is needed soon if there is to be any chance of securing deals to keep American and European troops here after the end of the year, some Afghan officials said. They said it would be better to start laying the groundwork to justify an interim government now in case Mr. Abdullah and Mr. Ghani cannot not find a solution.Talk about plans for an interim government intensified after some of Mr. Abdullah\u2019s most powerful backers \u2014 men who command well-armed militias \u2014 came within days of trying to seize power and declare their candidate the president after the release of preliminary results that gave Mr. Ghani a wide lead.Three senior Afghan officials said they needed a government in place by mid-September to ensure security agreements needed to keep some United States and NATO forces in Afghanistan beyond the end of the year. They said a new presidential election could most likely be held next year, probably at the same time Afghanistan will elect a new parliament, which would help keep costs under control.\u201cThe debate is there and people have the right to debate, of course, particularly when they are faced with such an important national crisis,\u201d said Umar Daudzai, the Interior minister. \u201cBut personally I prefer, and I see it in our national interest, that something come out of this election, whatever way it is, whether it is a national unity government, or power sharing, because this is the only constitutional way we have.\u201dUltimately, though, it may all come back to Mr. Karzai, as so much has in post-Taliban Afghanistan. Officials with knowledge of the inner workings of the presidential palace said many of Mr. Karzai\u2019s confidants were frustrated with what they described as the president\u2019s support for Mr. Ghani and fearful that his dark view of the West would eventually leave them at the mercy of the Taliban.Some of those officials and advisers are now involved in the discussions about the interim government, they said.Ideally, the officials said, Mr. Karzai would go along with the interim government, and he has in recent days insisted he would step down this month no matter what happened with the election.Aimal Faizi, a spokesman for the president, said that Mr. Karzai had provided no support to any candidate, dismissing talk of the interim government as \u201crumors.\u201dAn article last Tuesday about threats by prominent Afghans to install an interim government as Afghanistan\u2019s election impasse drags on misspelled the middle name of President Hamid Karzai\u2019s national security adviser. He is Rangin Dadfar Spanta, not Dafdar.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Japan Consumer Inflation Reaches 3.3%", "Date": "2014-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Japanese core consumer inflation, which excludes the volatile prices of fresh food but includes oil products, hit 3.3 percent in July, compared with the same month last year, government data showed Friday.When excluding the effect of the April tax increase, inflation stood at 1.3 percent, still distant from the 2 percent target the central bank pledged to meet next year.Household spending fell more than expected, and factory output remained anemic in July after plunging in June, according to government figures, suggesting that soft exports and the sales tax increase may drag on the economy longer than expected.While the central bank, the Bank of Japan, is in no mood to expand monetary stimulus anytime soon, it will be under pressure to act if the economy fails to gather momentum after contracting in the quarter ended in June, analysts say.Household spending fell 5.9 percent in July from the same month a year earlier, more than the median forecast of economists polled by Reuters of a 3 percent drop, because of the higher sales tax and bad weather that kept consumers at home.\u201cThe April sales tax hike has hurt purchasing power,\u201d said Hiroaki Muto, senior economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management. \u201cHeavy rainstorms this summer have made the situation worse. Consumer spending will recover, but the pace will be slow. I don\u2019t see the need for a big fiscal spending package, but the government may try to come up with some form of economic stimulus for next year.\u201dCompanies continued to cut back on production as sluggish demand at home and overseas led to a buildup in inventories, separate data showed, another sign that the pain of the tax increase is proving to be more severe than initially expected.Despite weak signs in the economy, the Bank of Japan is optimistic that a tightening job market will lead to higher wages and more income for households to spend, thereby keeping Japan on track to meet its 2 percent inflation target.The jobless rate, however, rose to 3.8 percent in July from 3.7 percent in June, meeting the median forecast. The jobs-to-applicants ratio was 1.1, a 22-year high.Industrial output rose 0.2 percent in July, far less than the 1 percent increase projected in a Reuters poll of economists. That was a tepid rebound from a 3.4 percent fall in June \u2014 which had been the fastest drop since the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami \u2014 as companies slowed production in response to weak exports and slack post-tax domestic demand.Manufacturers surveyed by the Ministry of Economy, Industry and Trade expect to raise output 1.3 percent in August and 3.5 percent in September, although a ministry official said at a briefing that the increases were largely in reaction to sluggish output in June and July.\u201cShipment lacks momentum and isn\u2019t recovering that much, while inventory is building up,\u201d the official said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to judge whether output will recover as a trend.\u201dJapan\u2019s economy shrank at an annualized rate of 6.8 percent in the second quarter, more than erasing the 6.1 percent first-quarter surge before the sales tax increase.Many analysts agree with the Bank of Japan that growth will rebound in the current quarter, though some warn that the recovery may falter this year if the tax-increase pain is prolonged and exports fail to emerge from the doldrums.The Nikkei 225-share index dropped 0.2 percent on Friday. For the week, the Nikkei fell 0.7 percent, and it declined 1.3 percent for the month. The broader Topix dropped 0.2 percent on Friday after briefly flirting with positive territory, possibly because of index-buying by domestic investors.Advertisement"}

The government contends that it is using the antimonopoly law, first established in 2008, to protect the interests of consumers against price gouging and other abuses.\u201cIf China is going to be the third leg in the global antitrust regime, along with the U.S. and the E.U., and that\u2019s clearly coming, then the key question is, What sort of approach is China going to take?\u201d John Frisbie, president of the US-China Business Council in Washington, said in a telephone interview. \u201cIs it going to be more the socialist state-run model, or is it going to be more of a market- and consumer-oriented model, or something in between? I don\u2019t think we know the answer yet.\u201dNot everything in China is stacked against multinationals, some of which may well have engaged in questionable practices and often have their own political allies and business partners. Nor is China the only country where Microsoft and other companies have faced consumer ire and regulatory scrutiny. But multinationals appear to be facing new and substantial challenges in navigating a clutch of separate regulatory agencies across China, each keen to amass victories, and the fines and political kudos that go with them.Over the last few weeks, investigators have been particularly busy \u2014 and particularly public \u2014 in their efforts, setting a pattern of making abrupt searches of foreign companies\u2019 offices. These are then reported by local media, tersely confirmed by the companies and followed by the government declaring that the companies are suspected of violating pricing, distribution and bundling rules, harming Chinese businesses and consumers.Last Wednesday, the State Administration of Industry and Commerce, or S.A.I.C., conducted a follow-up raid on two Microsoft offices in China and searched Accenture\u2019s offices in the northeastern city of Dalian. Last week, officials at the National Development and Reform Commission searched the Shanghai offices of Daimler, which makes Mercedes-Benz cars, and said they planned to fine Chrysler and Audi.The reform commission enforces pricing violations of China\u2019s antimonopoly law and has been investigating how automakers price the spare parts that are sold by their distributors in China. In response to the investigation, BMW said on Friday that it would lower parts prices in China. Similar component price cuts have been made recently by Mercedes and Audi.The reform commission is one of three agencies with a role in enforcing the antimonopoly law, which includes rules against unfair pricing and sales restrictions, even when a company has plenty of competitors.The Ministry of Commerce vets domestic and overseas mergers and acquisitions to ensure that they don\u2019t give any one company dominance over the market for a particular good or service in the country. The ministry has expanded the number of deals it examines \u2014 reaching decisions on 207 cases last year, an increase of 26 percent from 2012, and imposing significant conditions on those transactions.Alongside the commerce ministry, S.A.I.C. and the reform commission have taken on a higher profile in antimonopoly cases since last year. The commission in August of last year fined six companies that sell infant milk powder a total of $109 million, accusing them of price fixing and anticompetitive behavior. Five of the companies, including Mead Johnson Nutrition of the United States, were foreign and the other was based in Hong Kong.Qualcomm has also been subject to an antimonopoly investigation by the reform commission since at least late last year, as have dozens of foreign pharmaceutical companies.Analysts say foreign companies may be relatively more vulnerable to investigation because they generally lack the deep networks of political patronage that prevail in many sectors of China\u2019s economy, particularly those like energy and finance that remain state-dominated.\u201cAs Beijing prunes back outdated forms of government intervention, regulations to protect consumers and promote competition must come to the fore, which is why President Xi scoped this into his reform design,\u201d said Daniel H. Rosen, the founding partner of the Rhodium Group, an economic and political consulting firm in New York. \u201cIt does seem that foreign firms are the subject of a disproportionate share of China\u2019s new enthusiasm for competition policy.\u201dBut the enforcers, too, appear to be feeling the pressure from shifts in Chinese economic policy making. The powerful National Development and Reform Commission has traditionally been China\u2019s top economic planning agency and remains responsible for setting the retail prices that state energy companies like PetroChina and Sinopec can charge for products like gasoline.But its influence has waned under Mr. Xi, who has shifted the oversight of some economic policies to newly established committees that he heads. Shoring up influence through enforcement of antimonopoly rules may help the agency compensate for that change.Among foreign companies, few would appear to be better connected in China than Microsoft. Its co-founder, Bill Gates, has met with Mr. Xi several times to discuss the charitable work of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and he hosted Mr. Xi\u2019s predecessor, President Hu Jintao, at a 2006 dinner at his home in Medina, Wash. Since then, however, the Chinese government\u2019s wariness of Western technology providers has deepened, especially after Edward J. Snowden\u2019s disclosures about surveillance done by the United States.It is not clear to Microsoft executives precisely how the Chinese authorities believe that they violated the country\u2019s antimonopoly law. For months, Microsoft was in private discussions over competition issues with S.A.I.C. officials. The discussions were not hostile, said one person briefed on the meetings who spoke on condition of anonymity.So it was a surprise to Microsoft executives when investigators raided its offices. S.A.I.C. officials have said publicly that the investigation is related to software compatibility, bundling and file verification issues for Windows and Office.Late last week, The People\u2019s Daily, the chief newspaper of the party, told foreign companies to get used to tougher scrutiny. \u201cIn the future, the focus on market order will continue to be constantly enhanced,\u201d it said. \u201cEvery kind of business should adjust its behavior and thinking to this new regulatory normal.\u201dNeil Gough and Chris Buckley reported from Hong Kong and Nick Wingfield from Seattle.

{"Headline": "Catalan Vote Seen as Test for Separatists in Europe", "Date": "2014-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBILBAO, Spain \u2014 On a recent drizzly morning here, Mariano Bilbao, a retired metals worker, took part in an event for the 120th anniversary of the first hoisting of the Ikurri\u00f1a, the Basque flag. But with the neighboring region of Catalonia set to hold a vote this fall on whether to break from Spain, Mr. Bilbao\u2019s thoughts were less on the past than on the future. The Ikurri\u00f1a, he hopes, will eventually fly over a new Basque nation.\u201cCatalonia opens new possibilities, and the dream of independence is now very much alive for us,\u201d Mr. Bilbao said.Indeed, as the Catalan vote nears, analysts are raising alarms that it could set off a separatist spiral that would dismember Spain, as well as have a domino effect among other independence-minded European regions that should make defenders of the 28-nation European Union sit up and take note.A meeting last week between Artur Mas, the leader of the Catalan regional Parliament, and Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy of Spain did nothing to forestall the independence drive, and Mr. Mas vowed to go ahead with the vote as scheduled on Nov. 9.If Catalonia does vote on independence, the Basque Country and other regions will quickly want to stage similar votes, potentially paving the way for the eradication of the Spanish state, said Emilio Lamo de Espinosa, the president of the Real Instituto Elcano, a political research group in Madrid. And if Spain splinters, it \u201cwould destroy the E.U. project, which is based on union and not division and splitting,\u201d he added.The Catalans are set to vote just weeks after the Scottish hold their own referendum on independence from the United Kingdom on Sept. 18, and the Scottish outcome is being regarded as something of a bellwether here. But if the United Kingdom has something to worry about in Scotland\u2019s referendum, then Spain arguably faces larger trouble.Scotland\u2019s 5.3 million people represent about 8 percent of the United Kingdom\u2019s population and account for 9 percent of its economic output. Scotland\u2019s North Sea oil assets, however, make it the wealthiest part of the United Kingdom per capita.By contrast, Catalonia\u2019s 7.5 million people represent about 16 percent of the Spanish population and account for 19 percent of Spain\u2019s gross domestic product. The Basque region of 2.2 million people is Spain\u2019s richest region per capita, accounting for 6 percent of G.D.P.Combined, Spain would lose a quarter of its economy if both the Basque and Catalan secessionist drives ever succeeded.Still, both Catalan and Basque nationalist politicians are urging Mr. Rajoy to take a lesson from Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain, who has argued against separation for Scotland but has not tried to block the Scottish vote. Mr. Rajoy should understand what Mr. Cameron does, said Ibon Areso, the mayor of Bilbao, the largest Basque city, which is that \u201cthe Spanish state is made up of several different people.\u201d\u201cThe whole problem of the European Union is that it has been about politicians defending states rather than trying to create a genuine union of people,\u201d Mr. Areso said.When it comes to Catalonia, Mr. Rajoy has argued that the vote is unconstitutional. But whether he can actually stop the region from carrying it out is another matter. If the vote goes ahead, it will at a minimum set off a serious constitutional crisis for Spain. But while insisting that Catalonia has to abide by Spanish law, Mr. Rajoy has done little to entice it to stay.\u201cThe Catalans are now leading the way, but nobody should forget that historically it has been the Basques who have made the strongest sovereignty demands,\u201d said Jon I\u00f1arritu, a Basque member of the Spanish Parliament.The Basque problem could be even knottier for Mr. Rajoy than Catalonia, given that the Basque region\u2019s history of violent separatism may make it even harder for him to offer concessions.E.T.A., the Basque separatist group, killed over 800 people in Spain during a four-decade campaign of bombings and targeted assassinations. It has not killed on Spanish soil since 2009, has stuck to a cease-fire announced in 2011 and recently announced that its military wing had been dismantled. But Mr. Rajoy and other mainstream Spanish parties are demanding an unconditional surrender and the handover of weapons.In the Spanish news media and in the corridors of power in Madrid, Mr. I\u00f1arritu is often portrayed as representing an extremist coalition, known as Euskal Herria Bildu, which includes politicians who supported E.T.A.E. H. Bildu, whatever its antecedents, has made significant electoral gains. It now holds 21 of the 75 seats in the Basque regional Parliament, second only to the 27 seats of the P.N.V., the Basque nationalist party that is also seeking greater autonomy.In July, I\u00f1igo Urkullu, a P.N.V. politician who is the head of the Basque regional government, sent a letter to Mr. Rajoy requesting a meeting to discuss Basque demands for greater sovereignty. There was no official response from Mr. Rajoy.Already, the independence claims of Catalonia and the Basque region are feeding each other, even as they differ in important ways.In June, about 150,000 people formed a human chain across the Basque region to demand independence, mimicking a much larger secessionist show of force last September by Catalans, who had clasped hands across Catalonia.Pedro Ibarra, a Basque political scientist and former lawyer who defended several E.T.A. members in the 1970s, said the Basque human chain showed how far Catalonia\u2019s referendum push and the E.T.A. cease-fire had \u201cclearly reshaped the nationalist debate here in much more democratic terms.\u201dBut unlike with the clearly defined region of Catalonia, the Basques are divided over where the borders of any independent country should lie. What Basque nationalists call their homeland, known as Euzkadi, stretches north into France, where about 300,000 people are Basques.Hard-liners believe a Basque nation should encompass Spain\u2019s three Basque provinces as well as the French Basque Country and the neighboring Spanish region of Navarra. Only a section of Navarra, however, speaks Basque. And the French Basques, while proud of their distinctive sports and culture, have not been pushing to break away from Paris.For now, Basque secessionist politicians seem content to let Scotland and Catalonia \u201clead the independence movement within Europe,\u201d said Laura Mintegi, an E. H. Bildu politician. If Scotland and Catalonia fail to secede, however, \u201cwe will certainly go ahead on our own path,\u201d Ms. Mintegi warned.Francisco de Borja Lasheras, associate director of the Madrid office of the European Council on Foreign Relations, forecast that \u201cthe referendum question will be on the Basque agenda sooner or later, depending on both how quickly the E.T.A. issue gets fully resolved and what happens next in Catalonia.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Driving School in France Hits a Wall of Regulations", "Date": "2014-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Alexandre Chartier and Benjamin Gaignault work off Apple computers and have no intention of ever using the DVD player tucked in the corner of their airy office. But French regulations demand that all driving schools have one, so they got one.Mr. Chartier, 28, and his partner, Mr. Gaignault, 25, are trying to break into the driving school business here, using computer technology to match teachers and students across France and to offer cut rates.But they are not having an easy time. The other driving schools have sued them, saying their innovations break the rules. Their application for an operator\u2019s license for their school, Ornikar, has been met with total silence at the prefecture.\u201cIt seems like the idea is to wait us out until we run out of money,\u201d Mr. Gaignault said recently. \u201cThere is an effort to just destroy us.\u201dPartly because they are young business school graduates and partly because getting a driver\u2019s license here is so difficult and expensive that it has inspired books on the subject, Mr. Chartier and Mr. Gaignault have become minor celebrities. Various experts say their struggle highlights how the myriad rules governing driving schools \u2014 and 36 other highly regulated professions \u2014 stifle competition and inflate prices in France.The rules set up barriers to newcomers, sometimes indirectly. Lowering them has become a critical test of France\u2019s willingness to confront its declining competitiveness and the drain of its young people to London and other more flexible places from a country where protecting entrenched interests has always ranked higher, politically and culturally, than innovation.Now, however, with France\u2019s economy faltering and the Socialist government desperate to do something to revive its popularity, some experts expect that President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s administration may finally take steps to tear down the tangle of rules that keep competition \u2014 and many young people \u2014 out of so many sectors of the economy.But there has been scant progress so far. In the case of driving schools, the government offers only a limited number of exams each year, and these are doled out to the driving schools depending on their success rate the year before. That fact alone gives the old guard a virtual monopoly, according to Gaspard Koenig, who wrote a book on his own (failed) efforts to get a driver\u2019s license here, despite having graduated from one of France\u2019s most elite universities.\u201cThe system is absurd,\u201d said Mr. Koenig, who was a speechwriter for Christine Lagarde when she was the French finance minister. \u201cYou are begging to get into the classes. You are getting shouted at by these teachers. It is humiliating.\u201d Mr. Koenig finally got his license in London.Since then, he has been campaigning for changes, including calling for an overhaul of the written test, which he says goes far beyond making sure that a person knows the rules of the road. Instead, he said, it seems intended to trip students up with ridiculous questions, such as: If you run headlong into a wall, would you be safer if you were in a tank or in a car? (The answer: a car, because it has air bags.)Meanwhile, Mr. Koenig says, the system makes it possible for the driving schools to make outsize profits.Some studies have concluded that the French are probably paying 20 percent more than they should for the services they get from regulated professions, which include notaries, lawyers, bailiffs, ambulance drivers, court clerks, driving instructors and more.When Greece needed its bailout, the first thing demanded by its international lenders \u2014 the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund \u2014 was that similar regulations be eliminated as quickly as possible. Some progress has been made.The failure rate for the French driving exam is about 41 percent, the government office for road safety said. The cost to the economy goes beyond the embarrassment of those who fail, according to those who have studied it.Francis Kramarz, an economist who has studied the French licensing system, says that barriers to getting a license are so high that about one million French people, who should have licenses, have never been able to get them. Although it is technically possible to reduce the cost by having parents teach students in a dual-control car, few expect to succeed this way, and so it is rarely done.Mr. Kramarz said that it often costs 3,000 euros, or about $3,900, to get a license. But others said the average was closer to 1,500 to 2,000 euros.\u201cNot having a license has a major impact on employment possibilities,\u201d he said, if only because it makes getting a job in a neighboring town out of reach.Young men in France routinely used to get their licenses during their year of military service. But the requirement to serve was eliminated in the mid-1990s, throwing a flood of new customers into a closed market. Mr. Chartier said he got the idea for Ornikar because so many of his friends were so frustrated with the system.\u201cIt didn\u2019t happen to me,\u201d Mr. Chartier said. \u201cBut it was happening to a lot of my friends. Everyone talks about how bad it is.\u201dUnder the current system, would-be drivers register with a driving school. The schools offer instruction in their own classrooms (\u201coften smelly caves,\u201d according to Mr. Koenig) for the written test and on the road. They also determine when students can take an exam.Since the school never has enough slots for all its students, it picks the best students first. The wait can stretch 18 months or longer. Although students are required to take only 20 hours of driving lessons, most end up doing double that while they wait for a chance to take the test.Under the Ornikar model, students would be able to study for the written test on their own computers. They would be able to take classes from and rate licensed instructors of their choice, making their appointments online, and eliminating another one of Mr. Koenig\u2019s frustrations: facing a constantly changing crew of instructors who trash the methods of the one before.And the Ornikar students would be able to take advantage of a rarely used clause in the regulations that allows individuals to sign up for the exam on their own without paying a fee for that service.It is highly unlikely that any of the students would ever go to the Ornikar office in Paris. But, the partners say, they have nonetheless met every regulation, including providing wheelchair access, a separate area for classroom study and, of course, a TV and DVD player.But owners of other driving schools are crying foul. Philippe Colombani, the head of a union of school owners, UNIC, who works out of a storefront on the outskirts of Paris, said he was well aware of public frustration. One client set a driving school on fire a few years back. And he said a female instructor was assaulted recently.But Ornikar, he said, was breaking the rules that everyone else had to follow. For instance, he said the regulations dictated a closed-off area for study that was accessible to people with disabilities. Ornikar, he said, did not have such an area, and its owners\u2019 assertion that headsets would provide privacy was just not good enough.\u201cI have people who spend 8,000 euros on construction to make areas handicapped accessible,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat do I say to them?\u201dThough his first suit against Ornikar failed to shut it down, Mr. Colombani said that he would continue to challenge the Ornikar model in court over other issues, such as whether Ornikar\u2019s use of freelance instructors was acceptable.He, too, would like to see some changes, notably in the number of exams available, but nothing too radical because the rules, he said, \u201care in the interest of public safety.\u201dThe prefecture did not reply to requests for information about its stand on Ornikar. The government has said it could not afford to expand the number of tests in a significant way, and charging a fee for this service is apparently out of the question. In France, charging for the test would be seen as giving rich people an unfair advantage, Mr. Koenig said. \u201cThings that seem obvious elsewhere,\u201d he said, \u201care not here.\u201dYann Cres contributed reporting from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Skirmishes Put Feeling of Wartime on India-Pakistan Border", "Date": "2014-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJORA FARM, India \u2014 The habits of wartime have crept back into life here along the border between India and Pakistan.It is not clear what has caused the rise in nightly artillery firing across the border, which intensified in mid-August and, according to officials, has killed two Indian civilians and four Pakistani civilians, and injured dozens more. On Wednesday, there was hope that a de-escalation had begun. Two rare nights had passed without gunfire, and junior commanders from both countries met in a first step toward bringing down tensions.Each side blames the other for shooting first: Indian officials say Pakistani rangers are launching the attacks to provide cover for militants hoping to cross into India. Pakistani officials say the Indians are firing without provocation, perhaps to retaliate for Pakistani successes against Afghan-based militants who, they claim, are supported by India.Meanwhile, Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, has squabbled with Pakistani military leaders over policy toward India. Mr. Sharif wants to build business ties between the two countries to stimulate Pakistan\u2019s ailing economy. But the generals, who have a long history of wrecking civilian-led peace initiatives, have resisted \u2014 a possible factor, analysts say, in the increased shelling.Stephen P. Cohen, who last year published a book on the India-Pakistan conflict, said border exchanges like this one have repeatedly led the two countries to the brink of conflict, and that it is all but impossible to trace their origins.\u201cOn one or the other side, a local commander gets a little nervous and starts firing at what he thinks is someone crossing over,\u201d he said. \u201cOr, secondly, a local commander could be ambitious. Or, thirdly, you could have a deliberate policy choice by the government on either side.\u201dThis section of the 1,800-mile border between India and Pakistan runs through rich farmland, close enough for workers to look up at the enemy watchtowers from their rice paddies. Civilians here have become accustomed to small-arms fire, but in recent weeks villages have seen nighttime attacks with long-range 81-millimeter mortars, some of them striking in the heart of residential areas.The chief of India\u2019s border security force, D. K. Pathak, who made an impromptu visit to the Jammu region on Tuesday, said the exchanges began with Pakistani sniper fire in mid-July, making it the most intense and prolonged stretch since two countries went to war in 1971. This year, he said, \u201cwe have been told very clearly to respond appropriately.\u201d\u201cOur response,\u201d he said, \u201cwill not be less, it will be equal or more. But not less.\u201dAsked what had set off the crisis, he said that he believed Islamic militants were gathering on the Pakistani side, waiting for the chance to cross into India.In Pakistan, Brig. Mateen Ahmad Khan, the commander of Chenab Rangers, dismissed that claim, saying the flat, bare terrain in the area made it an unfavorable crossing-point for guerrilla fighters, and noting that India has erected a double fence equipped with sound detectors, and illuminated after dark.\u201cThere is no jungle, no forest,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone is looking at everyone. Why haven\u2019t the Indians killed or captured anyone who is trying to infiltrate? No crosser has been killed. It is simply because there is nothing like that.\u201d He also disputed Mr. Pathak\u2019s claim that the episode began with Pakistani sniper fire.\u201cThese are lame excuses,\u201d he said. \u201cThey lie with flat faces.\u201dOn Wednesday, two nights without firing had allowed some people to relax a little. At a border post on the Pakistani side, an officer of the Chenab Rangers peered through binoculars toward the Indian position half a mile away, and spotted a shadow near the pinkish post. He sent out a subordinate to tell a Pakistani farmer to come in from his rice fields.\u201cHe could come under fire,\u201d he said. \u201cTell him to have patience for a few days, until things normalize.\u201dSettlements on both sides remained largely deserted, and those who remained behind were eager to show visitors the punctured ceilings and deeply gouged walls. In Jora Farm, a cattle-herding village about 20 miles south of the city of Jammu, a patch of soft mud covers the spot where Mohammad Akram Hussain and his son, Aslam, who was said to be 6, were killed by a mortar.Before dawn on Saturday, firing on the village had become so heavy that Mr. Hussain, 30, and his family worried that their thatched roof would catch fire, so they crept outside and sat against a wall, thinking it was safer there. The children climbed into the adults\u2019 laps.That is how Mr. Hussain and his son were sitting when a mortar round fell about five feet away, shearing off part of Mr. Hussain\u2019s face and slicing through his son\u2019s leg and arm, relatives said.At a funeral gathering this week, elders discussed how to evacuate the whole settlement \u2014 800 people and 5,000 heads of cattle \u2014 a measure they have not taken since 1999, when the two armies faced off in a monthlong conflict. Salamuddin, an elder who uses one name, said the attacks this month were of the same scale.\u201cFor us, it is a war,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat else worse will we see in a war? Two members of our family have been killed.\u201dEllen Barry reported from Jora Farm, and Salman Masood from Sialkot, Pakistan. Hari Kumar contributed reporting from Jora Farm.Advertisement"}

Many people, myself included, would like to move on to other subjects. But we can\u2019t, because the crisis is by no means over. Recovery is far from complete, and the wrong policies could still turn economic weakness into a more or less permanent depression. In fact, that\u2019s what seems to be happening in Europe as we speak. And the rest of us should learn from Europe\u2019s experience.Before I get to the latest bad news, let\u2019s talk about the great policy argument that has raged for more than five years. It\u2019s easy to get bogged down in the details, but basically it has been a debate between the too-muchers and the not-enoughers.The not-enoughers \u2014 a group that includes yours truly \u2014 have argued all along that the clear and present danger is Japanification rather than Hellenization. That is, they have warned that inadequate fiscal stimulus and a premature turn to austerity could lead to a lost decade or more of economic depression, that the Fed should be doing even more to boost the economy, that deflation, not inflation, was the great risk facing the Western world.To say the obvious, none of the predictions and warnings of the too-muchers have come to pass. America never experienced a Greek-type crisis of soaring borrowing costs. In fact, even within Europe the debt crisis largely faded away once the European Central Bank began doing its job as lender of last resort. Meanwhile, inflation has stayed low.Which brings me to Europe\u2019s woes.The good news is that things don\u2019t look that dire in America, where job creation seems finally to have picked up and the threat of deflation has receded, at least for now. But all it would take is a few bad shocks and/or policy missteps to send us down the same path.There\u2019s an old joke about the man who decides to cheer up, because things could be worse \u2014 and sure enough, things get worse. That\u2019s more or less what happened to Europe, and we shouldn\u2019t let it happen here. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Spending Falters, but Consumer Confidence Reaches a 7-Year High", "Date": "2014-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byConsumer spending fell in July for the first time in six months, but a measure of confidence among households hit a seven-year high in August, suggesting the retrenchment would be temporary.A third report on Friday showed a sharp acceleration in factory activity in the Midwest this month, a further sign that the economy remains on solid ground.\u201cThe weakness in spending will quickly subside this fall\u201d as momentum builds from promising signs like the surging stock market, rising home prices and an improving job market, said Michael Woolfolk, global markets strategist at BNY Mellon in New York.Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity in the United States, dipped 0.1 percent last month after rising 0.4 percent in June, the Commerce Department said. Economists had expected a 0.2 percent gain. When adjusted for inflation, it fell 0.2 percent.The weakness in spending prompted some economists to lower their forecasts for third-quarter economic growth. Goldman Sachs cut its projection by two-tenths of a percentage point to a 3.1 percent annual rate. Macroeconomic Advisers cut its forecast by a similar amount, taking it down to 2.9 percent.But it also left inflation muted in July, giving the Federal Reserve room to keep interest rates near zero for some time.Consumer prices edged up 0.1 percent, the smallest rise since February, the spending report showed. In the 12 months through July, it was up just 1.6 percent. Excluding food and energy, prices also rose 0.1 percent, with the 12-month reading holding at 1.5 percent. The Fed targets inflation of 2 percent. Over all, many economists expect another relatively sturdy quarter given the rise in confidence, a strengthening labor market, and gains in manufacturing and business spending. Housing and government spending are also improving.Two such examples came on Friday. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment index increased to 82.5 in August, the highest level since July 2007, from 81.8 in July. The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago said its barometer of Midwest factory activity shot up to 64.3 this month from 52.6 in July \u2014 the biggest monthly point gain since July 1983.\u201cWe expect growth to remain on a firmer trajectory as improving economic fundamentals continue to reassert themselves,\u201d said Gennadiy Goldberg, an economist at TD Securities in New York.The sluggish consumer spending may also signal hidden momentum as many households opt to save extra money from steady income gains. Income rose for a seventh straight month in July, while savings hit their highest level since December 2012. \u201cConsumers could be positioned to trim savings and tap credit to fuel stronger spending, although it remains to be seen,\u201d said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Mich.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Big Banks Still a Risk", "Date": "2014-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameBig bankers are usually good at arithmetic. But when it comes to assessing the benefits of their too-big-to-fail status, their calculators tend to go haywire. And yet, taxpayers have a right to know exactly how much their implied guarantees are worth to these huge and politically powerful institutions. So it is unfortunate that the new study by the Government Accountability Office trying to quantify those benefits was such a muddle. Central to the hearing is that six years after the financial crisis, it\u2019s clear that some institutions remain too complex and interconnected to be unwound quickly and efficiently if they get into trouble. It is also clear that this status confers financial benefits on those institutions. Stated simply, there is an enormous value in a bank\u2019s ability to tap the taxpayer for a bailout rather than being forced to go through bankruptcy.That value was what the G.A.O. had been asked to measure. But its methodology was convoluted and its conclusions hardly definitive. The report said that while the big banks had enjoyed a subsidy during the financial crisis, that benefit \u201cmay have declined or reversed in recent years.\u201dThey ran 42 models for each year using different variables. The results were mixed. In 2013, 18 of the 42 calculations showed a positive value for the implied subsidy, while eight resulted in a negative value. The other 16 calculations gave the implicit subsidy no value whatsoever.The trouble with this mishmash is that big bankers and even policy makers will cite these figures as proof that the problem of too-big-to-fail institutions has been resolved. Mary J. Miller, the departing under secretary for domestic finance at the United States Treasury, wrote in a letter about the report: \u201cWe believe these results reflect increased market recognition of what should now be evident \u2014 Dodd-Frank ended \u2018too big to fail\u2019 as a matter of law.\u201d Not exactly. As the report noted, the value of the implied guarantee varies, skyrocketing with economic stress (such as in 2008) and settling back down in periods of calm.In other words, were we to return to panic mode, the value of the implied taxpayer backing would rocket. The threat of high-cost taxpayer bailouts remains very much with us. \u201cToday\u2019s report confirms that in times of crisis, the largest megabanks receive an advantage over Main Street financial institutions,\u201d Mr. Brown and Mr. Vitter said in a statement. \u201cWall Street lobbyists may try to spin that the advantage has lessened. But if the Army Corps of Engineers came out with a study that said a levee system works pretty well when it\u2019s sunny \u2014 but couldn\u2019t be trusted in a hurricane \u2014 we would take that as evidence we need to act.\u201dMs. Admati, a co-author with Martin Hellwig of \u201cThe Bankers\u2019 New Clothes,\u201d and Mr. Kane, an authority on the value of implicit taxpayer guarantees, were persuasive on why the G.A.O. report should not be taken as proof that reckless banks no longer pose a problem to our economy.At the outset, Mr. Kane criticized the G.A.O.\u2019s methodology, saying that it was wrong to consider only one benefit, lower debt costs. Missing, he said, was an assessment of the benefits received by stockholders of these institutions, a very real element of the implied guarantee. \u201cThe G.A.O. fell into the trap of thinking of bailout expenditures as either loans or insurance,\u201d Mr. Kane said. That ignores the lower cost of equity that taxpayer guarantees also provide to big banks, he said.Mr. Kane knows his topic. Back in the 1980s, he helped calculate the value of implied guarantees at Fannie Mae, the mortgage finance company, when it was technically insolvent. He also valued taxpayer backstops at failing savings and loan associations.In his testimony last week, Mr. Kane said bailouts should be viewed as equity investments whose risks deserve a return to taxpayers of at least 15 percent. \u201cIt is shameful for government officials to imply that too-big-to-fail bailouts were good deals for taxpayers,\u201d he wrote.On the nature of taxpayer guarantees, Ms. Admati said: \u201cThe subsidies are real and they are very large.\u201d She added: \u201cThe main problem with the guarantees is they reinforce and create perverse incentives and intensify the conflicts of interest between the banks and the rest of society.\u201dBanks are still too highly leveraged, Ms. Admati contends. She said raising equity capital was the best way for them to guard against losses.As for the G.A.O. estimates that the size of big-bank subsidies have decreased, Ms. Admati noted that calm markets can quickly give way to turmoil. \u201cVolatility is low now,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I remind everyone that 2006 was a great year \u2014 volatility was very low and everybody was making record profits.\u201d Not even a year later, the crisis had begun.The hearing was held the day before the congressional summer recess began. Still, it attracted greater interest than usual from senators and the media, Mr. Brown told me in a phone call on Thursday evening. \u201cI think people are increasingly aware that this is still a serious, serious problem,\u201d he said. \u201cThis report has underscored that if there is a real crisis, investors will move their money to the banks that are too big to fail. That was significant and is really troubling. The system continues to reward risky behavior.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Let Your Children Grow Up to Be Farmers", "Date": "2014-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionNEW HAVEN \u2014 AT a farm-to-table dinner recently, I sat huddled in a corner with some other farmers, out of earshot of the foodies happily eating kale and freshly shucked oysters. We were comparing business models and profit margins, and it quickly became clear that all of us were working in the red.My experience proves the trend. To make ends meet as a farmer over the last decade, I\u2019ve hustled wooden crafts to tourists on the streets of New York, driven lumber trucks, and worked part time for any nonprofit that could stomach the stink of mud on my boots. Laden with college debt and only intermittently able to afford health care, my partner and I have acquired a favorite pastime in our house: dreaming about having kids. It\u2019s cheaper than the real thing. But what about the thousands of high-priced community-supported agriculture programs and farmers\u2019 markets that have sprouted up around the country? Nope. These new venues were promising when they proliferated over a decade ago, but now, with so many programs to choose from, there is increasing pressure for farmers to reduce prices in cities like my hometown, New Haven. And while weekend farmers\u2019 markets remain precious community spaces, sales volumes are often too low to translate into living wages for your much-loved small-scale farmer. As one grower told me, \u201cWhen these nonprofit farms want a new tractor, they ask the board of directors, but we have to go begging to the bank.\u201dAnd then there are the chefs. Restaurants bait their menus with homages to local food, attracting flocks of customers willing to pay 30 bucks a plate. But running a restaurant is a low-margin, cutthroat business, and chefs have to pay the bills, too. To do so, chefs often use a rule of thumb: Keep food costs to 30 percent of the price of the meal. But organic farming is an even higher-risk, higher-cost venture, so capping the farmer\u2019s take to a small sliver of the plate ensures that working the land remains a beggar\u2019s game.The food movement \u2014 led by celebrity chefs, advocacy journalists, students and NGOs \u2014 is missing, ironically, the perspective of the people doing the actual work of growing food. Their platform has been largely based on how to provide good, healthy food, while it has ignored the core economic inequities and contradictions embedded in our food system.Unlike our current small-bore campaigns, previous food movements of the 1880s, 1930s and 1970s were led by highly organized farmers\u2019 organizations \u2014 like the American Agricultural Movement, National Farmers Union and Colored Farmers\u2019 National Alliance \u2014 trailblazing new paths for the economy.It\u2019s not the food movement\u2019s fault that we\u2019ve been left behind. It has turned food into one of the defining issues of our generation. But now it\u2019s time for farmers to shape our own agenda. We need to fight for loan forgiveness for college grads who pursue agriculture; programs to turn farmers from tenants into landowners; guaranteed affordable health care; and shifting subsidies from factory farms to family farms. We need to take the lead in shaping a new food economy by building our own production hubs and distribution systems. And we need to support workers up and down the supply chain who are fighting for better wages so that their families can afford to buy the food we grow. But none of these demands will be met until we start our own organizations \u2014 as in generations past \u2014 and shape a vision of a new food economy that ensures that growing good food also means making a good living.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gaza, Victim of History", "Date": "2014-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorPARIS \u2014 The current conflict in Gaza is the third since 2008. If nothing is done to address the root causes, any cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hamas will only be a pause before the next outbreak of violence. The collective impotence of the world\u2019s leaders is striking, since the Gaza Strip is, within the broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a far less complex issue to handle than East Jerusalem and the West Bank. All parties have endorsed the Gaza Strip\u2019s borders, which were drawn in 1949 at the end of the first Arab-Israeli war. The last Israeli settler left Gaza in 2005, after Ariel Sharon opted for a unilateral withdrawal, similar to Ehud Barak\u2019s disengagement from southern Lebanon in 2000. There is no religious site in the Gaza Strip to be contested by Muslims, Jews and Christians. Many Israelis dream of waking one morning to discover that Gaza has gone away (or been annexed by Egypt, a softer version of such a fantasy). But Gaza is there to stay, with its 1.8 million people crowded into 141 square miles (365 square kilometers). How did this tiny slice of the Mediterranean coastline become one of the most wretched spots on earth? Over the centuries, travelers have remarked on the fecundity of Gaza\u2019s vegetation. The Gaza Valley, which runs down into the Mediterranean coast, south of the modern city, is a refuge for migrant birds and small animals. Gaza was once the leading exporter of barley in the region; more recently, it has been a producer of citrus. Perched between the Levant and the Sinai and Negev deserts, Gaza has had the misfortune of being at the crossroads of empires. Gaza City, slightly inland and adjacent to a natural harbor, has been inhabited for at least 3,500 years. The first historical reference to the loose subsoil of Gaza \u2014 which has made possible the network of Hamas tunnels targeted by Israel in the latest conflict \u2014 dates to Alexander the Great, whose forces besieged the Arab garrison for three months and eventually sacked the city, filling six ships with booty. Some 1,500 years later \u2014 following the emergence of Islam and sporadic rule by crusaders \u2014 Gaza was the westernmost point of the Mongol advance. Centuries later, it was seized (briefly) by Napoleon. In 1906, the British government, which controlled Egypt, agreed with the Ottoman Empire on the boundary between the Egyptian Sinai and the Ottoman province of Palestine, with Rafah becoming the coastal border town that it is today.In Gaza, the earliest Jewish-Muslim conflict dates to the period of the British mandate, which began in 1922. The indigenous Jewish inhabitants \u2014 some 54 individuals, as of 1922 \u2014 left the city (although they had been protected by their Arab neighbors) after anti-Zionist riots broke out in Jerusalem, Hebron and elsewhere in 1929. By 1945, 4 percent of the land in the Gaza region was owned by European Zionist settlers, who made up 2 percent of the population. Under the 1947 partition plan of the United Nations, Gaza was supposed to be part of a new Arab state, alongside the new Jewish state. But when the state of Israel was proclaimed on May 14, 1948, the Egyptian Army entered Gaza and the territory became a magnet for Palestinians fleeing from all over.Israel bombed Gaza by land, sea and air, even though its firepower was far more restrained than what we witness nowadays. American Quakers, funded by the United Nations, tended to the first waves of refugees. Measles and cold took dozens of lives. Gaza became, as one refugee told me, the \u201cNoah\u2019s Ark\u201d of a lost Palestine. One in four Arabs from the former British mandate took refuge on 1 percent of its land area. Seen another way, 200,000 refugees were packed into a territory inhabited by 80,000 Palestinians. (The proportion is about the same today: 1.2 million refugees out of a population of 1.8 million.) But for the Sinai, those waves of refugees could have settled in refugee camps around Cairo the way they did around Beirut, Damascus and Amman.The Egyptians administered this territory, but refused to annex it, contrary to what Jordan did in the West Bank. So in 1949, David Ben Gurion proposed to annex the Gaza Strip and to resettle its Palestinian refugees throughout Israel. This offer was rebuffed both by the United Nations and by the Arab states, which would not accept Israeli territorial expansion. An Egyptian-run Gaza inexorably became a hotbed of Palestinian nationalism. It was sometimes directed against Egypt\u2019s ruler, Gamal Abdel Nasser, as during an uprising in 1955. Or it could be manipulated by Egyptian intelligence, which trained the first Palestinian Fedayeen \u2014 freedom fighters or terrorists, depending on your point of view \u2014 for missions in Israel.The young state of Israel became obsessed with the menace from Gaza. This was one of the main motivations for the offensive against Nasser\u2019s Egypt, begun in October 1956 with French and British support. Gaza was occupied for four months, with a terrible toll on the population (more than 1,000 dead out of some 300,000 inhabitants). Under American pressure, Ben Gurion agreed to withdraw from the Gaza Strip, but he trusted Nasser to keep the territory quiet. The next 10 years were marked by very little tension, but the Fedayeen merely went underground. The Palestine Liberation Organization was established in 1964 with prominent nationalist figures from Gaza.During Israel\u2019s Six Day War against its Arab neighbors, in June 1967, Gaza was conquered in a matter of hours and the surrendering Egyptians were soon evacuated. But local Palestinian guerrillas kept fighting this new occupation for the next four years. Then the Israeli military thought it best to let an Islamist network develop, to neutralize the nationalist camp in Gaza. This is how Sheikh Ahmed Yassin built a power base and eventually founded his movement, Hamas, to challenge the nationalist P.L.O.In December 1987, a Palestinian generation born and raised under two decades of occupation found in its frustration the energy for an unprecedented intifada, or uprising. The cradle of this uprising was the Gaza Strip, but it soon spread to the West Bank and forced Jordan\u2019s king to relinquish any claim over the West Bank. The P.L.O. endorsed a \u201ctwo-state solution\u201d \u2014 an independent Palestine, covering East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza \u2014 in the early 1990s, as part of the process leading up to the Oslo Accords. This peace option was bitterly opposed by Hamas: Its leader, Sheikh Yassin, had been jailed by Israel, but his followers founded a military wing, the Qassam brigades. In 1994, the P.L.O. leader, Yasir Arafat, led the new Palestinian Authority into Gaza \u2014 a significant blow to Hamas, which then transferred part of its apparatus to the West Bank. Yitzhak Rabin, Arafat\u2019s partner in the Oslo Accords, was murdered in 1995 by a Jewish extremist. Benjamin Netanyahu took over and, eager to \u201cdestroy\u201d Hamas, dispatched agents in 1997 to Amman to poison Khaled Meshal, head of Hamas\u2019s exiled leadership.The plot was disrupted by Jordanian intelligence; Netanyahu not only had to turn over an antidote, which saved Meshal from certain death, but he was also forced to release Yassin, who was flown back to Gaza. Arafat was now overshadowed by the larger-than-life figures of Yassin (who was assassinated in 2004) and Meshal (who continues to lead Hamas, from exile in Qatar). The weakening of the Palestinian Authority led to the second intifada in 2000, with its disastrous string of suicide attacks and aerial bombings.Ariel Sharon\u2019s campaign against Arafat\u2019s nationalist movement, Fatah, which controls the Palestinian Authority, only strengthened Hamas, even after Mahmoud Abbas succeeded Arafat in 2005. Two years later, Hamas expelled the Palestinian Authority from the Gaza Strip. Israeli forces invaded Gaza at the end of 2008 and bombed it in the fall of 2012; the latest campaign has been deadlier than the previous two, combined.There is a way to break this vicious cycle. Israelis want the Gaza Strip demilitarized, and the Palestinians want a lifting of the blockade of Gaza. From an Israeli perspective, lifting the economic siege is essential for demilitarization, since the blockade generates a demand for commodities that can only be met through smuggling, via the tunnels. And those tunnels can only be financed with hard currency, obtained through the exchange of weapons and explosives. So the most efficient way to \u201cdestroy\u201d the tunnels is not by sending Israeli tanks into Gaza, but by lifting the blockade, reviving the local economy and offering, at last, other opportunities than militant Islam to young Palestinians (more than half of the Gazan population is unemployed). Gaza has to be able to rebuild, to sell the products of its farms and workshops; its people must be allowed to move freely. It is certainly easier said than done, but there is no alternative to achieve a sustained peace in Gaza.And yet, both Israel and Hamas still harbor elusive dreams of military victory.The people of Gaza are the ones who suffer from these delusions. Three generations have grown up: a generation of mourning (1948-67), a generation of submission (1967-87) and a generation of the intifadas (1987 to the present). To turn back the clock, it will be necessary to return to a concept from the Oslo Accords: \u201cGaza first.\u201d If there is ever to be Israeli-Palestinian peace \u2014 with all other options having been exhausted \u2014 Gaza will be the foundation, and the keystone.

{"Headline": "Fears of Renewed Instability as Fed Ends Stimulus", "Date": "2014-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseAfter a nearly uninterrupted five-year rally in stocks and bonds, some investors seem to be getting nervous. On July 31, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 317 points, wiping out the year\u2019s gains. Last week, junk bond funds experienced record withdrawals and junk bond interest rates spiked.Such gyrations may be healthy, a reminder that there are risks and that markets go down as well as up. But they could also be the harbinger of something more worrisome, which would be renewed financial instability as the Federal Reserve brings to an end its extraordinary easy money policy. The Federal Reserve has said it expects to raise interest rates in 2015 for the first time since the financial crisis.\u201cThere\u2019s no real precedent for ending anything of this magnitude,\u201d said Jeremy Stein, who left the Fed\u2019s Board of Governors at the end of May to return to Harvard\u2019s economics department, where I caught up with him last month on the day of the Dow\u2019s big drop. As the Fed feels its way, he said, investors may have to prepare for greater volatility.While at the Fed, Mr. Stein was viewed as the chief advocate for financial stability on the seven-member board, where he pondered the possible unintended consequences of the Fed\u2019s stimulus policies.Mr. Stein said his differences with his fellow board members, and especially the chairwoman, Janet Yellen, had been exaggerated and were more a matter of nuance. \u201cI certainly felt we were courting some risks\u201d with the Fed\u2019s last round of quantitative easing, he acknowledged. \u201cBut then again, given the level of the unemployment rate at the time, some risk-taking was warranted.\u201d\u201cTo be clear, we are not necessarily talking about once-in-a-generation financial crises here, with major financial institutions teetering on the brink of failure,\u201d he said in a speech to the International Monetary Fund. \u201cNevertheless, the evidence suggests that even more modest capital market disruptions may have consequences that are large enough to warrant consideration when formulating monetary policy.\u201dShe even explored a previously taboo subject, which is whether the Fed contributed to the post-2000 housing bubble by keeping rates too low. While conceding the low rates may have been a factor, she warned that raising rates was \u201ca very blunt tool\u201d that would probably have had worse consequences than rising housing prices. While she said she saw no need now for tighter monetary policy than the Fed had charted, she did identify \u201cpockets\u201d of excess and added, \u201csome investors may underappreciate the potential for losses and volatility going forward.\u201dWhile some critics took Ms. Yellen to the woodshed for purporting to identify bubbles, comparing her comments to then Fed chairman Alan Greenspan\u2019s ill-timed reference in 1996 to the stock market\u2019s \u201cirrational exuberance,\u201d Mr. Stein called Ms. Yellen\u2019s speech \u201cadmirable.\u201d The Fed chairwoman \u201cwas being forthright,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s struggling with this issue in an honest way, which is progress. I don\u2019t think anyone has yet figured out the right answer about how to deal with this.\u201dAfter a brief spike last year after the Fed announced that it would taper its bond purchases, interest rates have fallen this year \u2014 the opposite of what many economists and investors expected. (Bond prices fall as interest rates rise, and vice versa.)\u201cYou can only explain about 20 percent of the variability in asset prices based on fundamentals,\u201d Mr. Stein said. \u201cWe don\u2019t understand the other 80 percent. All the Fed can hope to do is to be slow and deliberate\u201d and communicate its intentions.The Princeton economist Markus K. Brunnermeier, an expert on asset bubbles and crashes, has identified what he calls \u201csynchronization risk,\u201d a phenomenon in which investors ride a wave of price increases even if they realize the assets are overpriced. \u201cIt\u2019s what economists call a lack of common knowledge,\u201d he said. \u201cWe may all know an asset price is too high, but we don\u2019t know that others know it, too. Timing is everything. The danger is if you move too early and the market doesn\u2019t follow up. So everyone waits on the sidelines watching and listening,\u201d as long as asset prices keep rising. The danger comes when they all try to get out at the same time.This seems especially true of many fund managers, who don\u2019t want to underperform their rivals and obsessively follow one another\u2019s moves. Professor Brunnermeier attributes the sudden spike in interest rates last year partly to a fund stampede once bond prices showed signs of cracking.\u201cI very much think that stability is a major issue, and the Fed has to take it into account,\u201d Professor Brunnermeier said. \u201cIdeally, you want to see markets correct early rather than late in one big crash.\u201dHow to achieve that remains elusive. \u201cSpeaking only for myself, you don\u2019t want to raise rates too aggressively now,\u201d Mr. Stein said. \u201cIt may be too late for that. Financial markets are fairly fragile.\u201d Current official forecasts are for the federal funds rate to rise to 2.5 percent in 2016 from the current rate of 0.25 percent, and Mr. Stein said he was \u201ccomfortable\u201d that a rise of that magnitude made sense if the economy stayed on its current course.Still, he says the Fed should stick to its guns even if markets gyrate. \u201cThis is subtle, but I\u2019d try to indicate a little more willingness to stay the course if financial markets fluctuate one way or the other,\u201d he said. \u201cMarkets seem to sense an element of a Fed put, and that complacency can be a source of risk in itself, so you have to push back on that a bit.\u201d (A put is an option that protects investors if prices decline.)In other words, investors shouldn\u2019t expect the Fed to come to the rescue just because stock or bond markets falter. No one wants another crash, but a garden-variety correction may be just what\u2019s needed to avoid one in the future.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Greece, Migrants Are Desperate to Flee Again", "Date": "2014-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA man from Somalia at an abandoned furniture factory in Patras, Greece, that immigrants call home while they seek work or, even better, a forbidden\u00a0 trip to Italy.PATRAS, Greece \u2014 On a recent morning, the young men began to drift back to the abandoned furniture factory, returning from the beach, the roofs of nearby construction sites and other hiding places where they had been sleeping.Amid rotting timbers and piles of garbage, one man from Afghanistan did his laundry; another shaved using cold water from a fraying hose. The mood was bleak.The police had raided at dawn, rounding up more than 30 of their friends, many of them just teenagers.The men ended up here because Greece, through its border with Turkey, is easier for unauthorized immigrants to reach than most of the rest of Western Europe. But after a long and often dangerous trip, they found themselves not in the land of opportunity they had envisioned, but in a country struggling to take care of its own people and increasingly hostile toward the waves of immigrants arriving from Afghanistan, Iran, Sudan and other ravaged or repressed places.For the migrants, the result has been a mix of disillusionment and despair and, for some, a determination to take on yet another risky and surreptitious journey. Each day the men squatting in the row of crumbling factories in this gritty port city hope to steal away on the ferries across the street, heading for various ports in Italy and then, perhaps, elsewhere in Europe.But many have been stuck here for months, making a life as best they can behind broken fences and waist-high weeds, out of sight of the Greeks who shout insults and throw garbage at them when they venture into the streets.There is a barber chair in one of the factories and an area where the young men do chin-ups on the pipes. They charge their cellphones from a fuse box at a nearby construction site and pool their resources to cook, usually one meal a day, usually rice. But there is no getting away from the filthy toilets, the boredom and the fear that they will not be able to move on.Inside the factories, the immigrants divide by age, country of origin and tribal affiliations. The teenagers \u2014 with American television shows on their smartphones \u2014 still have hope about what life may yet offer, and a charity that provides breakfast, showers and access to the Internet.But the older men receive no such help, and many have grown bitter. \u201cDo you think this is fun?\u201d one of the men said before walking away. \u201cDo you think we are used to living in trash where we come from?\u201dWith its economy in tatters, Greece has plenty of its own citizens barely surviving and few resources to help the many immigrants who have continued to arrive in recent years. Watchdog groups have repeatedly cited Greece for wretched conditions in many of its detention centers and, more recently, for pushing immigrants back into Turkey.Even those who are free to move around Greece say that immigrants face overwhelming hostility. According to the Greek investigative magazine Hot Doc, a top police official was recorded in December saying that the lives of unauthorized migrants should \u201cbe made unbearable.\u201dSome of the young men trying to get on the ferries tell stories of the Taliban invading their villages, of wandering from country to country after their parents died. Some show the scars of battle \u2014 a calf missing a chunk of flesh, a scar across a shoulder.Some have managed to sneak onto the ferries several times, only to be returned by the Italian authorities.Advocates say many of the young men have unrealistic expectations of what they will find elsewhere in the European Union. \u201cBut what can you say?\u201d said Christina Tampakopoulou, a member of a volunteer group, the Movement for the Defense of Refugee and Migrant Rights, that sometimes visits the men and assists when it can. \u201cHere, it is worse.\u201dBy early afternoon, it was time to change into dark clothes and slip between the bent bars of the fence surrounding the ferry terminal. The young men could be seen darting among the lined-up 16-wheelers, searching for an unlocked container or, barring that, a way to hitch a ride under the trucks.But getting out of Greece this way has become more and more difficult. Inspectors at the ferry terminal had little trouble spotting Mohammed Morsal, 27 years old and easily six feet tall, curled up in the spare-tire rack under a truck. Soon, he was in handcuffs.Asked whether his family knew where he was, Mr. Morsal, from Sudan, looked down at the floor and broke into sobs. \u201cThey are all dead,\u201d he said, before being escorted away by officials.Tryfon Korontzis, the Coast Guard captain who oversees the port, says he is engaged in a sad cat-and-mouse game, aware each day that elsewhere in the world, Greeks, too, are trying to make a living in foreign countries. Most days his inspectors find two or three men hidden in the trucks. Some have been near death after spending hours in refrigerated containers or buried and gasping for air in piles of cotton seed.Released after six hours in detention, Mr. Morsal made his way back to a tire factory, where stained mattresses were scattered about.He applied for asylum five years ago, he said, but his case is among the 25,000 in a backlog here. He has never heard anything from the authorities. Even if he did, the news would probably not be good. Greece granted asylum to fewer than 5 percent of applicants last year, according to European Union statistics.\u201cWe eat from garbage like animals,\u201d Mr. Morsal said. \u201cThese people drive by on motorcycles and they throw bottles at us.\u201dMr. Morsal has tried to find work here, as have most of the men who live in the factories.

{"Headline": "Celebrations Came a Little Too Soon in Germany", "Date": "2014-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInside EuropeBERLIN \u2014 The German soccer team\u2019s romp to victory in the World Cup last month was hailed at home as a symbol of the country\u2019s emergence as a confident global economic power.But in an ironic twist, the feel-good triumph in Brazil may have come at a time when Germany\u2019s new Wirtschaftswunder, or economic miracle, is coming to an end.In recent weeks, the economy that proud German politicians have taken to describing as a \u201cgrowth locomotive\u201d and \u201cstability anchor\u201d for Europe has been hit by a barrage of bad news that has surprised even the most ardent Germany sceptics.The big shocker came last week, when the Federal Statistics Office revealed that gross domestic product had contracted by 0.2 percent in the second quarter. \u201cThe euphoria that we\u2019ve seen, the perception that the German economy is booming, is simply misplaced,\u201d said Marcel Fratzscher, director of the DIW economic institute in Berlin.So why is Germany suddenly ailing?The standoff with Russia over Ukraine has received its fair share of blame in the German media. But that conflict may not hit the economy with full force until the third quarter. It was only last month that Europe stung Moscow with economic sanctions, prompting a tit-for-tat response from President Vladimir V. Putin.In reality, economists and some government officials acknowledge, there are deeper reasons for the recent downturn. And they have little to do with the spike in geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe or the Middle East.They start at home, where Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s abrupt exit from nuclear energy after the Fukushima disaster in Japan and aggressive push into renewables has unnerved German industry. A recent overhaul of the country\u2019s complex renewable energy law has done little to alleviate uncertainty over future policy or assuage fears about German energy competitiveness.\u201cEnergy-intensive industries in particular have lost confidence in the future of Germany as a business location,\u201d said Thomas Mayer, a former chief economist at Deutsche Bank who now runs the Cologne-based Flossbach von Storch Research Institute. \u201cI think this is a major issue that will burden German industry for years to come.\u201dFurther souring the mood among businesses has been a rollback of economic reforms that Ms. Merkel\u2019s predecessor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, introduced a decade ago, and which many credit with fueling a sharp drop in German unemployment and a rebound in growth that began in 2006 \u2014 when Germany itself hosted (but failed to win) the World Cup.Since coming to power in late December, Germany\u2019s left-right \u201cgrand coalition\u201d government has pushed through a reduction in the retirement age for some workers and won parliamentary approval for a nationwide minimum wage of 8.50 euros, or $11.40, an hour. Next on the agenda are stricter limits on temporary workers.The pension reform, which allows longtime workers to retire four years early at 63, risks aggravating a skilled labor shortage in some sectors of the economy. The ratings agency Moody\u2019s said last week that it undermined the sustainability of the German pension system.The unintended effect of the policies has been to discourage firms from investing at home. Corporate investment in machinery and equipment, for example, hit an all-time low of 6.2 percent of G.D.P. last year, Elga Bartsch of Morgan Stanley points out, despite solid domestic demand dynamics, low lending rates and upbeat business sentiment.Compounding the problem has been pronounced weakness in public investment. A study by the DIHK Chambers of Commerce and Industry last month said Germany was suffering from an overall investment gap amounting to 3 percent of G.D.P., or \u20ac80 billion annually.At roughly 17 percent of G.D.P., annual investment levels in Germany lie below those of other industrialized countries, which average over 21 percent. In Austria, for example, the level is 27 percent.Pointing to these figures, Eric Schweitzer, the president of DIHK, likens the current mood in Germany to that on the Titanic: \u201cEveryone is partying and no one sees the threat of the looming iceberg.\u201dIn private, government officials also admit concern. The Economy Ministry has been examining ways to tackle Germany\u2019s investment problem and Sigmar Gabriel, the economics minister, has invited outside experts to discuss the matter later this month.\u201cThere have been periods, for example in the late 1990s, when Germany lost its economic edge,\u201d said one government official, who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the growth debate. \u201cAre we heading into another of these periods? There are people who are concerned that we are.\u201dGermany still looks good compared with its European partners like Italy, whose economy also contracted by 0.2 percent in the second quarter, and France, which admitted last week that it would miss its deficit targets for this year after its economy stagnated in the period.Part of Germany\u2019s second-quarter weakness can be explained by weather effects: The mild winter led construction firms to invest more heavily in the first three months of the year, at the expense of the recent quarter.German unemployment, at a rate of 6.7 percent, is near post-reunification lows and wages are on the rise, supporting domestic demand, which has taken over from trade as the economy\u2019s main growth pillar.In contrast to some of its European counterparts, Germany\u2019s finances are also in excellent shape.Data released on Thursday showed total public debt \u2014 combining federal and state governments, the local authorities and the social security system \u2014 fell last year for the first time in the post-war era. The government\u2019s 2015 budget contains no net new borrowing for the first time since 1969.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like we\u2019re on the brink of disaster,\u201d said Andreas W\u00f6rg\u00f6tter, head of division at the economics department of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.But Mr. W\u00f6rg\u00f6tter says it would be foolish to dismiss the impact of the Russia conflict, which he believes could be far bigger than bilateral trade ties \u2014 Russia makes up only about 3 percent of total German exports \u2014 would suggest.\u201cWhatever comes out of this crisis, it is a game changer because the framework for German-Russian economic cooperation has been seriously damaged,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "African Leaders Coming to Talk Business May Also Be Pressed on Rights", "Date": "2014-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byListening PostThe question, Africa experts are saying, is what will Mr. Obama tell them? \u201cAre we going to have a strong message for these strongmen?\u201d said Vera Songwe, the World Bank\u2019s country director for Senegal, Cape Verde, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau and Mauritania.The answer, White House officials said, is a resounding yes: The meeting, the first of its kind on American soil, is intended \u201cto build a deeper relationship based on mutual interest and mutual respect,\u201d Susan E. Rice, the national security adviser, said in an interview. \u201cIn each of the sessions, there will be some very straight talk and give-and-take.\u201dStill, given the attendance of iron-fisted leaders from Angola and Equatorial Guinea \u2014 to say nothing of American partners with checkered records, like the leaders of Rwanda and Uganda \u2014 some advocates worry that human-rights issues will take a back seat to other priorities.The centerpiece of the four-day meeting will be a high-octane conference to stimulate trade and investment. The leaders will be put together with dozens of deal-hungry American chief executives. Former President Bill Clinton will speak, as will the former mayor of New York City, Michael R. Bloomberg, whose foundation is a co-sponsor, along with the Commerce Department. The White House will push initiatives like Power Africa, a privately funded plan to bring electricity to 20 million households across sub-Saharan Africa. Companies have pledged $9 billion, and the White House is likely to announce more support at the summit meeting.Though American officials are loath to admit it \u2014 given their sharply different approaches to Africa \u2014 the United States is chasing China, which has spent lavishly on the continent, mainly to lock up mineral resources for its booming economy. \u201cNo African leader is going to say no to an invitation from Obama to come to Washington,\u201d said Anneke Van Woudenberg, a senior researcher for Human Rights Watch, who specializes in the Democratic Republic of Congo. \u201cSo in that sense, it\u2019s a real missed opportunity.\u201dThe White House notes that it has made governance one of the three main themes of the meeting, along with trade and investment and peace and security. Human rights and the rule of law, officials said, will be an unavoidable subtext in all the discussions.Other Africa experts said the administration was right not to call out its guests too conspicuously. A more subtle and effective message, they said, would be to remind Africans that the best American companies want to invest only in places with a reliable rule of law.\u201cIt would be a huge mistake to lecture on the democracy and human-rights agenda,\u201d said Jennifer G. Cooke, the director of the Africa program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cIf it looks like finger-wagging, it\u2019s going to come across very badly.\u201dYet human-rights considerations clearly played a role in assembling the guest list. The United States did not invite the leaders of Sudan, Eritrea, the Central African Republic or Zimbabwe, all of whom are on bad terms with the African Union. Egypt was invited belatedly after its election removed it from the African Union\u2019s blacklist.Egypt\u2019s new president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, declined the invitation and will send his prime minister instead \u2014 in part because none of the leaders will get a one-on-one meeting with Mr. Obama. Administration officials said that was simply a matter of logistics; the leaders will have to make do with a handshake and a few words of greeting.The presidents of Liberia and Sierra Leone have canceled plans to attend to deal with an outbreak of the Ebola virus in their countries. That will deprive the meeting of Africa\u2019s most visible female leader, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia, and may fuel worries that other Africans flying to Washington could carry the virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said there was no significant risk to the United States from the outbreak.The Ebola outbreak is only the latest distraction for a White House that has been lurching from crisis to crisis. Some Africa experts said they worried that despite Mr. Obama\u2019s best intentions, the summit meeting would be overshadowed by the violence in Gaza and Ukraine.Mr. Obama\u2019s aides, however, said he planned to speak at the opening of the meeting, take part in the business session, and play host at a dinner for the leaders at the White House. The meeting has been in the works since Mr. Obama\u2019s trip to Africa last summer, which was viewed as a success but raised a perennial criticism of the administration.\u201cYou have these big, high-profile trips to Africa and then the issue falls off the front-burner,\u201d said Benjamin J. Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser.It says something about the chaotic state of the world that the Obama administration views Africa as a bright spot for American engagement. But Mr. Rhodes said on the merits, Africa had transformed itself into a genuine opportunity, with fast-growing economies and greater control over issues like health and food security.\u201cWe\u2019re never going to match the dollar amounts China announces,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when you add together what we\u2019re doing in development with the private sector, there\u2019s a lot of incentive for the Africans.\u201dAdvertisement"}

We warned her, and she continued to do it.\u201dMany commentators on Chinese-language social media, however, see more at work, especially because Ms. Su was one of the most prolific bloggers on Deutsche Welle\u2019s widely read Chinese-language website, and often very critical of Chinese government policy. In recent months, they say, more pro-Beijing voices have been given greater prominence.Perhaps most significant, she posted accounts of internal meetings held between Deutsche Welle directors and its Chinese-language staff, in which the staff is said to have been told to tone down its coverage.\u201cHe told us that he had been to see the Chinese ambassador and that we shouldn\u2019t be so critical,\u201d Ms. Su said in an interview. \u201cThat seemed very problematic issue for us.\u201dThe Deutsche Welle spokesman, Dr. Hoffmann, said the German broadcaster was committed to a broad range of voices. He noted that Mr. Chang had been given the opportunity to write his rebuttals to Mr. Sieren\u2019s articles.\u201cIt showed our willingness to have a broad dialogue,\u201d Dr. Hoffmann said. \u201cWe have critical positions toward China and other positions too.\u201dOne Deutsche Welle contributor, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals for publicly criticizing the broadcaster, said that articles like Mr. Chang\u2019s were increasingly rare on the Deutsche Welle website, while columnists like Mr. Sieren had become more prominent.Since the beginning of the year, according to internal Deutsche Welle statistics, Mr. Sieren has published over 80 commentaries.Liao Yiwu, a Chinese writer in exile in Berlin, said he worried that the case showed how even foreigners worry about how China will react to critical articles. Deutsche Welle is owned by the government, much like the British Broadcasting Corporation or the Voice of America, and has to balance journalistic issues with broader foreign-policy concerns.\u201cI\u2019m concerned that this is part of an overall trend in the world to play these issues down,\u201d Mr. Liao said in an interview. \u201cA lot of people have economic interests at stake, and they are worried.\u201dBecky Davis contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}

Mr. Jarbawi attempts to do this by shedding light on a serious obstacle to Israeli-Palestinian peace: growing Israeli racism and extremism. We who advocate for social justice and human rights in Israel are alarmed that Israeli opponents of the war in Gaza have been attacked by bands of right-wing extremists.But Mr. Jarbawi\u2019s statement that the Israeli left is, \u201ca relic, all but extinct\u201d is not only false, but also shortsighted. Zehava Gal-On, head of the left-wing Meretz party, has tirelessly fought racism. There have also been numerous demonstrations protesting the latest war, and Meretz party members have had a presence at all of them. Support for Meretz grew sharply in polls prior to the Gaza war, revealing a renewed interest in their message among Israelis.Mr. Jarbawi\u2019s assertion that the Palestinian national movement has no support in Israel is false. The prevalence of this idea has impeded Israelis working for equal rights and a two-state solution. There are many Israelis pushing for resolution of the conflict, beginning with an end to the occupation. In fact, there are Israelis who are willing to be attacked by right-wing racists while marching against Israeli violence. These people exist, and they often work with like-minded Palestinians toward a united movement for peace.Nathan Hersh, New YorkThe writer is managing director of Partners for Progressive Israel.\u00a0Mr. Jarbawi\u2019s description of how occupying countries essentially corrupt their own state through the distorting effects of colonialism, devaluing the humanity of their unwilling subjects, is remarkably calm, dispassionate and illuminating.Marian Price, Burlington, Vt.\u00a0Instead of simply casting Israel as the bad guy, perhaps Mr. Jarbawi should admit that the Palestinian leadership shares some responsibility in the \u201cextinction\u201d of the Israeli left in the political process. If, as he suggests, the Palestinians, are sincere about peace and \u201care more than ready for an agreement,\u201d then perhaps, 15 years after President Bill Clinton\u2019s efforts, they can readily admit their past errors as well.Jeff Benjamin, Staten Island, N.Y.\u00a0This is not a case of colonization, but a case of Israelis seeking to defend themselves against those sworn to destroy it. The intent to wipe Israel off the map existed long before Israel found itself saddled with the West Bank and Gaza. This intent continues unabated, and it is this determination to annihilate Israel that causes the conflict. If the Arab hatred of Israel ever ceased, there would be peace in the Middle East.Mark Cohn, Naples, Florida\u00a0One can only reel in amazement and disbelief at Mr. Jarbawi\u2019s arguments. First, he calls Israel\u2019s \u201coccupation\u201d of Palestine one of the only remaining occupations in the world today, but neglects to mention that Israel has been ready and willing to adopt a two-state solution many times, and that it was the Palestinian leadership that refused. The Palestinians\u2019 status as perennial refugees is maintained not by Israel, but by those who benefit from it, like Hamas and other terrorist organizations whose raison d\u2019\u00eatre and source of recruitment is the destruction of Israel.Next, Mr. Jarbawi bemoans the \u201cshamelessness\u201d of Israeli anti-Palestinian rhetoric, but ignores the venomous and vile anti-Semitism that permeates every pore of Palestinian culture. Finally, Mr. Jarbawi insists that it will take peace to end the bloodshed, but that this cannot happen without an end to the \u201coccupation.\u201d So does that suggest attacks on Israel will not end until peace is achieved? Why would any country make peace under those circumstances?Gary Taustine, New York\u00a0America and opportunityRe \u201cInequality is a drag\u201d (Aug. 9): I was distressed to read of Paul Krugman\u2019s ideas on inequality in America. I am hoping he will clarify the following: \u201cIncome redistribution at the levels typical of advanced countries (with the United States doing much less than average) is \u2018robustly associated with higher and more durable growth.\u201d\u2019 Really? Did he have France in mind \u2014 where unemployment is almost twice that of the United States, growth is very low, and, because of robust income redistribution, to work is an option for many?I also question his statement, \u201cDo talented children in low-income American families have the same chance to make use of their talent \u2014 to get the right education, to pursue the right career path \u2014 as those born higher up the ladder? Of course not.\u201d So how does he explain President Barack Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama, former President Bill Clinton and Justice Sonia Sotomayor of the Supreme Court?

{"Headline": "Fantasy Football, Stock-Market Edition", "Date": "2014-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s the EconomyLast football season, Evan Berlin was a champion. He beat his friends in a fantasy league and won $625 on a $100 buy-in. This season, Berlin, a technology executive in Denver, hopes to profit from another sort of sports play: owning shares of stock in Vernon Davis, the 30-year-old tight end for the San Francisco 49ers.In April, a San Francisco start-up called Fantex began selling stock linked to the future income of professional athletes. Davis was its debut initial public offering, and Berlin paid $1,000 for 100 shares. (He framed and put on display the stock certificate with Davis\u2019s picture that Fantex sent him.) Later on, leading up to Fantex\u2019s second I.P.O., for stock in E. J. Manuel, a Buffalo Bills quarterback, Berlin reserved 50 shares.For now, Fantex is selling only football players \u2014 a third I.P.O., tied to Mohamed Sanu, a wide receiver for the Cincinnati Bengals, is expected in October \u2014 but the company plans to add baseball players, golf pros and even actors and musicians to its portfolio. One part marketing agency and one part Wall Street brokerage, Fantex pays stars a lump sum upfront, effectively financed by the shares it sells to the public, in exchange for a portion of their \u201cbrand\u201d income later. Davis and Manuel each agreed to give Fantex 10 percent of whatever they earn from playing contracts, corporate endorsements and any related, post-playing-career pursuits like broadcasting jobs or book deals.The company expects to make most of its money by keeping 5 percent of the income it collects from athletes; the rest of that income will be allocated for shareholders and will fund possible dividends. Recently Fantex paid out its first dividend to Davis investors, who can also trade shares through an online exchange it runs. (The company earns commissions on such trades.) The hope is that this sort of financial interest in players will get investors to promote their athletes on social media and boost their stock. \u201cThe average person has 130 social media followers,\u201d says Buck French, Fantex\u2019s chief executive. That translates, he says, into \u201cfinancial amplification of the brand.\u201d And greater returns for both Fantex and shareholders like Berlin.Taking a stake in and profiting from the careers of sportsmen has precedents in the worlds of golf and boxing, but typically the process has involved wealthy individuals with personal connections to the athletes. For example, before he changed his name to Muhammad Ali, Cassius Clay signed a deal early in his boxing career with a group of Louisville businessmen who arranged his fights, hired his trainer and paid his expenses in exchange for half his earnings. (That cut was subsequently reduced to 40 percent, according to the Filson Historical Society.)The impersonal, public bankrolling of entertainers is a more recent phenomenon, however. In 1997, David Bowie turned heads in the business world by selling $55 million worth of bonds backed by sales of his albums. \u201cWhen we first did it, everyone thought it was crazy,\u201d says David Pullman, the financier who sold the Bowie bonds and later did similar deals with the Motown songwriting team Holland-Dozier-Holland and the estate of Marvin Gaye. \u201cSix months later, it was everyone else\u2019s idea.\u201dIn 1998, Frank Thomas, the White Sox slugger, tried to get an investment bank to sell bonds backed by his income. The deal fell apart, but the concept endured. In 2005, with $10 million in venture capital, a Silicon Valley start-up called ProTrade introduced a website that merged stock market trading and fantasy sports by letting fans bet on their favorite players. But ProTrade, which closed its site a few years later, had no real financial connection to the athletes.The closest precursor of Fantex was Real Sports Investments, started in late 2007 by Randy Newsom, a pitcher in the Cleveland Indians organization. He and another minor leaguer tried to create a way for fans to wager on players\u2019 major-league prospects. Newsom was the guinea pig, selling 1,800 shares for $20 each, or a 3.6 percent stake of what he figured he would ultimately earn from baseball. The goal was to sell a 5 percent stake, but the offering had a few problems, among them the fact that it wasn\u2019t registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Newsom ended up refunding his investors\u2019 money and putting the idea aside, eventually leaving baseball for law school and a stint at a white-shoe firm. Today he is developing Fantex\u2019s nascent baseball business.The Internet, of course, is what makes it feasible now for lots of people to take small stakes in practically anything. The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, a 2012 law that lifted a ban on advertising by start-ups seeking capital, enables the modestly wealthy to play the role of angel investor. Some newfangled financial firms let individuals make loans to strangers who want to buy boats, R.V.s and motorcycles, among other things. But Fantex, open to anyone with $10 to spend on a share of stock, may best exemplify the thorough democratization of high finance.For football players, most of whose contracts are not guaranteed, Fantex looks like a sweet deal, a great payday. Davis, popular among 49ers fans but far from a superstar, got $4 million from Fantex; Manuel, who missed six games in his rookie season last year because of injuries, got nearly $5 million. Players like these \u201care going to take whatever they can get,\u201d says Ben Sturner, the chief executive of the Leverage Agency, a sports-marketing firm. But everyone else, including the individuals who finance these windfalls, might do well to look at the venture as evidence that irrational exuberance is making a comeback.John C. Coffee Jr., a professor at Columbia Law School, refers to the Fantex shares as a kind of sports souvenir, as well as a sign of the times. \u201cThe market has soared over the last two years, and everything is at record levels, and that\u2019s when you get a little bit of froth on top of the wave,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to predict whether there\u2019s a bubble bursting or not, but this is the kind of froth that you see only at market peaks.\u201dThough Fantex is meticulous about complying with securities laws \u2014 even requiring its athletes to observe \u201cquiet periods\u201d surrounding their I.P.O.s \u2014 what it offers consumers is essentially a game, albeit one that comes with financial risks and rewards. Investors have to think like fantasy-sports participants, weighing the likelihood that a player will be injured or get cut from his team or be involved in a scandal or simply fade away after retiring. Then again, in today\u2019s market, when the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has almost tripled since bottoming out in 2009, more and more investors tend to treat conventional stock investing as a game, too.A big test for Fantex will come when football season gets going in September and trading starts to be influenced by what happens on the field. The company stumbled in marketing the Manuel I.P.O. to investors, as lackluster demand forced it to buy almost half the shares being offered. Evan Berlin was one of the skeptics. He ended up canceling his $500 order for Manuel shares. \u201cEngagement-wise,\u201d he says, he and his wife \u2014 who met Davis at her bachelorette party a couple of years ago \u2014 liked Davis better.\u201cI could go out and I could buy 50 shares of Johnson & Johnson,\u201d Berlin says. \u201cClearly, doing that will probably fund my retirement and help me to live a better life for the next 50 years. But I\u2019m not going to look at it every few days. I\u2019m probably not going to look at it every day during football season.\u201dWilliam Alden is a writer for The New York Times\u2019s DealBook.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rebound in Exports Signals Hope in Japan", "Date": "2014-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Japan\u2019s exports rose in July for the first time in three months, government data showed on Wednesday, in a tentative sign that overseas demand is starting to recover, which could raise hopes that exports could offset a slump in consumer spending.The 3.9 percent rise compared with the same month last year was roughly in line with a 3.8 percent increase expected by economists in a Reuters poll. It followed a revised 1.9 percent decline in June.Growth in exports was driven by increased shipments of cars to Europe, metal-processing machinery and items like liquid crystal displays, according to the Ministry of Finance data.\u201cThe data shows exports are recovering moderately as a trend, so external demand may offset some of the weakness in domestic demand ahead,\u201d said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at the Norinchukin Research Institute. \u201cBut export growth is unlikely to accelerate much from here. Europe\u2019s economy lacks momentum, and this will weigh on growth of Japan\u2019s big Asian export markets like China.\u201dExports to Asia, which account for more than half of Japan\u2019s total exports, rose 3.4 percent in July from a year earlier as automobile shipments grew in the first increase in three months. Exports to China were up 2.6 percent in July because of gains in shipments of metal-processing equipment and car parts.Japanese exports have struggled with weak demand in Asia for much of this year, as well as a growing shift in production overseas that has disappointed officials in the government and at the central bank, the Bank of Japan.Exports to the United States rose 2.1 percent as Japan shipped more car parts. However, exports of cars to the United States market tumbled 10.3 percent from a year earlier, the fourth straight month of decline, as Japanese companies shifted production to the United States and other countries.The central bank has warned that the relocation of factories offshore, particularly for making cars, means that Japan may not be able to accelerate exports at will. But the evidence that exports are finally starting to recover suggests that the economy may rebound after a sales- tax increase this past April, which would ease pressure on policy makers to do more to support growth.\u201cThe B.O.J. can say with more confidence that it will keep its monetary policy on hold,\u201d said Hiroshi Miyazaki, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. \u201cThe government has already announced some steps to support corporate activity. Now it is simply a matter of reflecting these policies in next fiscal year\u2019s budget.\u201dJapan\u2019s imports rose 2.3 percent in July, compared with a median forecast for a 1.7 percent annual decline, as energy imports grew. That brought the trade balance to a deficit of 964 billion yen, or $9.3 billion.The export data will be a relief for the central bank, which has based its economic growth and inflation forecasts on a rapid rise in exports as part of the government\u2019s plan to energize the economy.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe updated his economic growth strategy, known as Abenomics, in June with a plan to lower the corporate tax rate and to offer incentives in special economic zones to encourage companies to expand operations in Japan.The economy shrank an annualized 6.8 percent in the quarter that ended in June, its biggest slump since the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami, raising fears that consumer spending had weakened more than expected after the April sales-tax increase.Exports also fell in that quarter, showing that both domestic and external demand had weakened.Economists expect that Japan\u2019s gross domestic product will grow around 4 percent on an annualized basis in the current quarter, and many policy makers say exports must grow to ensure the economy remains on track.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bringing Tech Culture to the Staid College Quad", "Date": "2014-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMachine LearningCOLLEGE has its problems. It\u2019s expensive, it has some outdated traditions and it has a tendency to produce graduates who struggle to find jobs in the rapidly changing economy.Still, traditional colleges aren\u2019t going away anytime soon and tech entrepreneurs have realized this, too. There are several companies that let students take better advantage of the college education they are getting, instead of the education of the future.\u201cLearning has been an inefficient market,\u201d said Dan Rosensweig, the chief executive of Chegg, an education services company. \u201cThe price of books, the diversity of who you can learn from, the geography of where you can learn. It\u2019s now getting more and more efficient.\u201dThe average student now spends over $600 a year on textbooks and other course-related material, according to the National Association of College Stores. But savvier shopping can probably cut book costs significantly.Amazon offers some textbook rentals, although there are restrictions on what states books can be shipped to.Packback is trying to improve on the textbook rental idea by offering on-demand digital book rentals for $3 to $5 day. The assumption is that students don\u2019t always need a textbook for an entire semester \u2014 they may need it only a few times a year.Kasey Gandham started Packback in 2012 with Mike Shannon, a fellow graduate of Illinois State University, when they were still in college. \u201cIt\u2019s a no-brainer that textbooks were too expensive,\u201d Mr. Gandham said, \u201cbut no one was ever really addressing the problem of why they\u2019re so expensive to begin with.\u201dMr. Gandham said textbook prices had entered a vicious cycle: They\u2019re expensive, so students buy them used and then resell them as used books for someone else to buy. In those cases, publishers get no revenue and may need to raise prices of their new books to offset fewer sales.\u201cThe solution,\u201d he said, \u201cwas the thing that was driving up prices.\u201dIf students rent digital textbooks through Packback, they can take notes and make highlights in the e-book reader the company created. If they return the books and rent them again, the notes will still be there. And if students find they\u2019re renting the book over and over, they can convert what they\u2019ve already spent toward buying the book outright.Boundless also hopes to be a teaching platform. Educators can get texts free, along with course material like quizzes, and then teach directly from these cheaper sources \u2014 a kind of disruption from the top down.Tech entrepreneurs are also building services far beyond textbooks that are meant to help students be smarter college consumers.One option already known to many students is Chegg, which is evolving from a textbook search and rental site into a full-fledged resource for digitally savvy students.\u201cIt democratizes tutoring,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can get a tutor in any subject, any language, any time of day for as little as 40 cents a minute.\u201d And on the flip side, InstaEDU lets college students offer their own tutoring services for up to $20 an hour.Chegg also offers an internship search engine that matches openings with students\u2019 disciplines, location and whether they want to get paid.There\u2019s also a career search with job descriptions, salary ranges and videos of real people explaining what they actually do for a living.\u201cLess than 50 percent of all college students in this country use their career center, and less than 2 percent get a job from it,\u201d Mr. Rosensweig said. \u201cWhen we launched our service, in six months almost 500,000 students used it.\u201dAnd sites like Chegg help students keep student loans to a minimum by making it easier to search for grants and scholarships that can offset tuition costs. Such scholarships have always been available, but they\u2019re often hard to find, spread out across multiple sources, and the application process can be hard.And in the end, isn\u2019t a lot of college about learning to choose the right options? If we\u2019re not going to remake college education tomorrow, it is surely worth making the most out of it now.Not only are students consumers, they\u2019re the generation of consumers that expect the web and modern technology to make their lives more efficient and connected. If higher education can\u2019t keep up, they\u2019ll find other options, and they\u2019ve got an army of start-ups ready to help.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Japan\u2019s Economy Contracts After Sales Tax Increase", "Date": "2014-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 A sales tax increase this spring drove Japan\u2019s economy into its biggest contraction since the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami, official data showed on Wednesday.The April 1 tax increase took a heavy toll on household spending, shrinking the Japanese economy, the world\u2019s third-largest, after the United States and China, at an annualized rate of 6.8 percent from April through June, and wiping out the 6.1 percent growth of the January-March quarter, when consumers shopped heavily to avoid the higher tax.Seeing the slump as temporary, however, the Bank of Japan said it was convinced that the economy was on course for a moderate recovery and that it had no plans to expand stimulus any time soon.The economics minister, Akira Amari, signaled the government\u2019s readiness to prepare a supplemental budget this year if growth in the third-quarter stayed weak, although any fiscal stimulus would probably not be enough to have a major effect on the economy, given Japan\u2019s troubled government finances.On a quarter-to-quarter basis, Japan\u2019s economy shrank 1.7 percent in the second quarter, less than a median forecast for a 1.8 percent fall. The second-quarter contraction was the biggest decline since the first quarter of 2011, when the devastating earthquake and tsunami that March disrupted factory production and chilled household spending.External demand added 1.1 percentage points to gross domestic product, after shaving 0.2 point off first-quarter growth, mostly because of a fall in imports. Exports fell 0.4 percent in the second quarter, underscoring how much the failure of exports to rebound is weighing on the economy.Many analysts expect a pickup in the July-September quarter as the tax increase\u2019s effect fades, with some projecting an annualized expansion of between 3 percent and 5 percent. A tightening job market is gradually pushing up wages and big companies have increased summer bonus payments, which augurs well for consumption.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ambivalence About America", "Date": "2014-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAttitudes in Europe toward an America that is regrouping are marked today by extreme ambivalence. Europeans have long been known for finishing their diatribes about the United States by asking how they can get their child into Stanford. These days, European after-dinner conversation tends to be dominated by discussion of the latest episode of \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d or \u201cHomeland\u201d or \u201cMad Men.\u201d A French diplomat told me that every meeting he attended at the White House during his tour in Washington ended with one of his party asking if it might be possible to see the West Wing. He found it embarrassing. Europeans complain of the personal data stored or the tax loopholes exploited by the likes of Amazon, Facebook, Starbucks, Google and Twitter, but they are hooked on them all. Google, as recently reported by my colleague Mark Scott, now has an 85 percent share of search in Europe\u2019s largest economies, including Germany, Britain and France, whereas its share of the American market is about 67 percent. American tech companies operate seven of the 10 most visited websites in Europe. Rage at the practices of the National Security Agency is outweighed by addiction to a cyberuniverse dominated by American brands.The magnetism of Silicon Valley may suggest that the United States, a young nation still, is Rome at the height of its power. American soft power is alive and well. America\u2019s capacity for reinvention, its looming self-sufficiency in energy, its good demographics and, not least, its hold on the world\u2019s imagination, all suggest vigor.But geostrategic shifts over the past year indicate the contrary: that the United States is Imperial Rome, A.D. 376, with various violent enemies playing the role of the Visigoths, Huns, Vandals et al.; the loss at home of what Edward Gibbon, the historian of Rome\u2019s fall, called \u201ccivic virtue,\u201d as narrow interests paralyze politics; the partial handover of American security to private military contractors (just as a declining Rome increasingly entrusted its defense to mercenaries); the place of plunder rather than productiveness in the economy; and the apparent powerlessness of a leader given to talk of the limits of what the United States can do. There is no record of the Emperor Valens\u2019s saying, as Obama did, \u201cYou hit singles, you hit doubles,\u201d but perhaps he thought it.Ambivalence is not peculiar to Europe, of course. To heck with the world\u2019s problems, many Americans now say, we have done our share over all these decades of Pax Americana. If China and India are really rising, let them take responsibility for global security, as America took the mantle from Britain in 1945.Barack Obama \u2014 professional, practical and prudent \u2014 would appear to suit this American zeitgeist. He may not be managing decline but he is certainly resisting overreach. He is not the decider. He is the restrainer.Why, then, is Obama\u2019s no-stupid-stuff approach to the globe so unpopular? Fifty-eight percent of Americans in a recent New York Times/CBS News poll disapproved of his handling of foreign policy, the highest of his presidency. A strange duality seems to be at work. Americans want the troops to come home. They want investment to prioritize domestic jobs, education, health care and infrastructure.Yet many seem to feel Obama is selling the nation short. They want a president to lead, not be a mere conduit for their sentiments. Americans, as citizens of a nation that represents an idea, are optimistic by nature. It may be true that there is no good outcome in Syria, and certainly no easy one. It may be that Egyptian democracy had to be stillborn. It may be that Vladimir Putin annexes Crimea because he can. Still, Americans do not like the message that it makes sense to pull back and let the world do its worst. America\u2019s bipolarity sees recent bitter experience vying with the country\u2019s innermost nature, its can-do aspiration to be a \u201ccity upon a hill.\u201dIt is not easy to read this world of bipolarity (both European and American), Jihadi Springs and Chinese assertiveness. It is too simple, and probably wrong, to say that the United States is in decline.But Pax Americana is in decline. America\u2019s readiness to use its power to stabilize the world \u2014 the current bombing of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria notwithstanding \u2014 is fading. For that reason, the world is more dangerous than it has been in a long time. The waning under Obama of the credibility of American power has created a vacuum no magnetic soft power fills.The pendulum always swings too far. Obama the restrainer has been the great corrective to Bush the decider. Far from the magician imagined back in 2008, Obama has been the professional moderator. But the president has gone too far; and in so doing has undersold the nation, encouraged foes, disappointed allies, and created doubts over American power that have proved easy to exploit.David Brooks is off today.

{"Headline": "In New Calculus on Smoking, It\u2019s Health Gained vs. Pleasure Lost", "Date": "2014-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Rarely has the concept of happiness caused so much consternation in public health circles.Experts say that calculation wipes out most of the economic benefits from the regulations and could make them far more vulnerable to legal challenges from the tobacco industry. And it could have a perverse effect, experts said. The more successful regulators are at reducing smoking, the more it hurts them in the final economic accounting.\u201cThis threatens the F.D.A.\u2019s ability to take strong actions against tobacco,\u201d Frank J. Chaloupka, an economist at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said of the Food and Drug Administration. \u201cIf they can\u2019t demonstrate that there is a significant economic benefit to doing it, then it makes their job much harder.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s reason to believe that number is much too big,\u201d said Jonathan Gruber, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was an author of the paper. In his view, the agency\u2019s analysis cited his past work erroneously.The idea of lost happiness is new for health regulation. But it has surfaced as part of a longstanding requirement \u2014 first codified under President Bill Clinton \u2014 that every set of federal regulations with more than a $100 million effect on the economy needs an analysis to prevent the adoption of regulations with high costs and low benefits.The cost-benefit analysis is embedded in a proposal from April that would extend the F.D.A.\u2019s authority, for the first time, to electronic cigarettes and other tobacco products such as cigars and pipe tobacco, with potentially large consequences for the multibillion-dollar tobacco industry.The F.D.A. released a statement on Wednesday detailing the economics behind its analysis, but the explanation did not address the central assertion made by the economists. An F.D.A. spokeswoman, Jennifer Haliski, said that there was \u201cstill a great deal of uncertainty\u201d surrounding the calculation, and that the agency was helping fund research to explore the issue. She emphasized that the whole purpose of a public comment period was to get the best information before the new regulations became final. \u201cComments are encouraged and all will be considered,\u201d she said.If the formula for assessing costs and benefits remains unchanged in the final version of the regulations, it could set a dangerous precedent that would constrain public-policy making for years to come, experts and advocates warned.\u201cThis is the single biggest obstacle facing the F.D.A. in executing the job Congress gave it,\u201d said Matthew L. Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, an advocacy group. \u201cThere\u2019s no way the F.D.A. can do its job if this is applied.\u201dThis approach to cost-benefit analysis could also have broader implications for regulations of the food and beverage industries, which could likewise point to lost pleasure from consumption of sugar, salt or other substances regulators seek to limit.\u201cIf this is a beachhead into this kind of analysis, that should be setting off alarms,\u201d said Lisa Heinzerling, a law professor at Georgetown University and an author of \u201cPriceless: On Knowing the Price of Everything and the Value of Nothing,\u201d a critique of cost-benefit analysis.The economists\u2019 assessment of the agency\u2019s approach is part of a flood of public comments \u2014 more than 69,000 as of Wednesday \u2014 submitted to the F.D.A. on the tobacco regulations. The rules are supposed to become final by next summer, and experts anticipate that legal challenges will soon follow.The economists speaking out on Wednesday said a basic assumption consistent with traditional economic theory lay at the heart of the federal government\u2019s miscalculation on the costs and benefits of the regulations: that most people were rational, well-informed market participants making decisions they would not later regret.But smokers, they said, were different. A vast majority began smoking before age 18, when judgment is impaired. And many want to quit, but are addicted, and forgo the long-term satisfaction of better health for short-term pleasure.\u201cIt would be ridiculous to suggest that a 16-year-old kid who has no idea what addiction means and feels immortal is a rational decision-maker when it comes to smoking,\u201d said Kenneth E. Warner, one of the paper\u2019s authors and a professor of public health at the University of Michigan.Pleasure was not the only problem with the F.D.A.\u2019s economic analysis, the economists said. For example, it did not count the benefits to nonsmokers of less secondhand smoke, or of reductions in infant mortality were fewer pregnant women to smoke, they said.The only previous application of the happiness loss by the F.D.A. \u2014 to the proposal of graphic warning labels on cigarette packaging \u2014 went largely unnoticed, but the current one is drawing attention because of just how much the lost happiness counts.The outside economists began their analysis of the regulations for the graphic warning labels, and said their conclusions applied directly to the new tobacco rules as well. They said the F.D.A.\u2019s analysis \u2014 which was conducted by the agency\u2019s own economists, said Ms. Haliski, the F.D.A. spokeswoman \u2014 relied on standard economic theory that was simply not appropriate in these circumstances, and they urged the agency to reconsider its calculations.\u201cIf you have an analysis that\u2019s strongly biased to find fewer net benefits than realistically should be there, when you get into court cases and political challenges, the regulation is severely weakened,\u201d Professor Warner said.The aspect that dealt with lost pleasure was referred to as a \u201cwelfare gain ratio,\u201d and was rendered in technical language starting on Page 52 of the agency\u2019s \u201cregulatory impact document.\u201d\u201cThese are not dumb people \u2014 this is hard stuff,\u201d Professor Gruber said of the F.D.A. economists. \u201cBut we got an eminent group of people together and we came up with a different conclusion.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Britain\u2019s Flawed Immigration Strategy", "Date": "2014-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe government of Prime Minister David Cameron in Britain is proposing curbs on immigration that would harm the nation\u2019s economy and further erode its already troubled relationship with the European Union. On July 28, Mr. Cameron published a statement proclaiming that \u201ccontrolling immigration is vital\u201d to his government\u2019s long-term economic strategy and pledging \u201can immigration system that puts Britain first.\u201d Then, on Aug. 4, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research published a paper asserting that if Mr. Cameron\u2019s government meets its goals for reducing immigration flows, it would damage the economy, lower household incomes and force higher taxes. Most Britons say they have not yet felt the benefits of economic recovery from the 2008 recession. A British Social Attitudes survey last year revealed that 46 percent of the respondents blame immigration for their troubles. Meanwhile, fears that foreign freeloaders are invading Britain to take social benefits away from hard-working citizens have been fanned by the populist U.K. Independence Party. It wants to take Britain out of the European Union \u2014 the only way, it says, to regain control over Britain\u2019s borders.The evidence simply does not support the notion that Britain is about to be overrun. The hordes of Romanians and Bulgarians that Britons were told would rush in after the European Union lifted employment limitations in January have not materialized. Figures released by the Office for National Statistics in May show that the European Union\u2019s fundamental right to free movement within its borders is working the way it is supposed to: People are moving for jobs, not benefits. Germany\u2019s economy is attracting the most European migrants, many from Southern Europe. But as those economies recover, citizens are moving back. Migration in the European Union is circular. Business benefits from a fluid work force, and, for this reason, Mr. Cameron\u2019s immigration policies have met resistance from banks, companies and universities that depend on foreigners.In a global economy, the world\u2019s work force is increasingly an itinerant one. Talk about curbing immigration, preserving jobs for the English and locking down Britain\u2019s borders fan xenophobic fears. Mr. Cameron would do better to calm these fears and focus on economic strategies that embrace an interconnected world.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hawks Crying Wolf", "Date": "2014-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThat may well be the case. But there\u2019s something you should know: That \u201cvocal minority\u201d has been warning about soaring inflation more or less nonstop for six years. And the persistence of that obsession seems, to me, to be a more interesting and important story than the fact that the usual suspects are saying the usual things.Before I try to explain the inflation obsession, let\u2019s talk about how striking that obsession really is.And this record isn\u2019t unusual. With very few exceptions, officials and economists who issued dire warnings about inflation years ago are still issuing more or less identical warnings today. Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Minneapolis Fed, is the only prominent counterexample I can think of.The point is that when you see people clinging to a view of the world in the teeth of the evidence, failing to reconsider their beliefs despite repeated prediction failures, you have to suspect that there are ulterior motives involved. So the interesting question is: What is it about crying \u201cInflation!\u201d that makes it so appealing that people keep doing it despite having been wrong again and again?At first sight, claims that easy money will cause disaster even in a depressed economy seem different, because the class interests are far less clear. Yes, low interest rates mean low long-term returns for bondholders (who are generally wealthy), but they also mean short-term capital gains for those same bondholders.It\u2019s less clear why. But faith in the inability of government to do anything positive is a central tenet of the conservative creed. Carving out an exception for monetary policy \u2014 \u201cGovernment is always the problem, not the solution, unless we\u2019re talking about the Fed cutting interest rates to fight unemployment\u201d \u2014 may just be too subtle a distinction to draw in an era when Republican politicians draw their economic ideas from Ayn Rand novels.Which brings me back to the Fed, and the question of when to end easy-money policies.Even monetary doves like Janet Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, generally acknowledge that there will come a time to take the pedal off the metal. And maybe that time isn\u2019t far off \u2014 official unemployment has fallen sharply, although wages are still going nowhere and inflation is still subdued.But the last people you want to ask about appropriate policy are people who have been warning about inflation year after year. Not only have they been consistently wrong, they\u2019ve staked out a position that, whether they know it or not, is essentially political rather than based on analysis. They should be listened to politely \u2014 good manners are always a virtue \u2014 then ignored. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "$11 Billion Later, High-Speed Rail Is Inching Along", "Date": "2014-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 High-speed rail was supposed to be President Obama\u2019s signature transportation project, but despite the administration spending nearly $11 billion since 2009 to develop faster passenger trains, the projects have gone mostly nowhere and the United States still lags far behind Europe and China.While Republican opposition and community protests have slowed the projects here, transportation policy experts and members of both parties also place blame for the failures on missteps by the Obama administration \u2014 which in July asked Congress for nearly $10 billion more for high-speed initiatives.Instead of putting the $11 billion directly into those projects, critics say, the administration made the mistake of parceling out the money to upgrade existing Amtrak service, which will allow trains to go no faster than 110 miles per hour. None of the money originally went to service in the Northeast Corridor, the most likely place for high-speed rail.On a 30-mile stretch of railroad between Westerly and Cranston, R.I., Amtrak\u2019s 150-m.p.h. Acela hits its top speed \u2014 for five or 10 minutes. On the crowded New York to Washington corridor, the Acela averages only 80 m.p.h., and a plan to bring it up to the speed of Japanese bullet-trains, which can top 220 m.p.h., will take $150 billion and 26 years, if it ever happens.Florida, Ohio and Wisconsin, all led by Republican governors, canceled high-speed rail projects and returned federal funds after deeming the projects too expensive and unnecessary.\u201cThe Obama administration\u2019s management of previously appropriated high-speed rail funding has been as clumsy as its superintending of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s rollout,\u201d said Frank N. Wilner, a former chief of staff at the Surface Transportation Board, a bipartisan body with oversight of the nation\u2019s railroads.\u00a0When Mr. Obama first presented his vision for high-speed rail nearly four years ago, he described a future of sleek bullet trains hurtling passengers between far-flung American cities at more than 200 m.p.h.\u201cWithin 25 years, our goal is to give 80 percent of Americans access to high-speed rail,\u201d Mr. Obama said in his 2011 State of the Union address. \u201cThis could allow you to go places in half the time it takes to travel by car. For some trips, it will be faster than flying \u2014 without the pat-down.\u201dBut as Mr. Obama\u2019s second term nears an end, some experts say the president\u2019s words were a fantasy.\u201cThe idea that we would have a high-speed system that 80 percent of Americans could access in that short period of time was unadulterated hype, and it didn\u2019t take an expert to see through it,\u201d said Kenneth Orski, the editor and publisher of an influential transportation newsletter who served in the Nixon and Ford administrations. \u201cAnd scattering money all around the country rather than focusing it on areas ripe for high-speed rail didn\u2019t help.\u201dThe Acela, introduced by Amtrak in 2000, was America\u2019s first successful high-speed train, and most days its cars are full. The train has reduced the time it takes to travel between Washington, New York and Boston, but aging tracks and bridges \u2014 including Baltimore\u2019s 100-year-old tunnel where trains come to a crawl \u2014 have slowed it down. It takes two hours and 45 minutes to travel from New York to Washington on the Acela. If the Acela were a bullet train traveling on new tracks, it would take 90 minutes.Another problem is that Amtrak\u2019s funding is tied to annual appropriations from Congress, leaving it without a long-term source of money. \u201cI do what I can do,\u201d said Joseph Boardman, Amtrak\u2019s president. \u201cBut I don\u2019t sit back and wait for $15 billion to rebuild the Northeast Corridor.\u201d For now, Amtrak is rebuilding a stretch of track in central New Jersey that will permit travel at 160 m.p.h. for 23 miles.But advocates say they are hopeful.\u201cOnce something gets built, then we\u2019re going to see more projects get going,\u201d said Ray LaHood, Mr. Obama\u2019s first transportation secretary. Mr. LaHood said it took the Interstate System of highways decades to be completed, and he predicts that high-speed rail will be the same.Mr. LaHood said California seemed the most likely candidate for success with high-speed rail, even though plans for a 520-mile train route between Los Angeles and San Francisco have been mired in controversy.Still, California has begun construction of the tracks and put out bids for a vendor to build the trains. And the new rail project will get an infusion of funds from the state\u2019s cap-and-trade program, which requires business to pay for excess pollution.But Representative Jeff Denham, a California Republican and chairman of the House Transportation subcommittee on railroads, said the state should not be in the railroad business. \u201cHigh-speed rail can be a good idea; I just think it should be left up to the private sector,\u201d he said. Proposed projects in Texas and Florida, he added, were better models.The project will be privately financed, but builders have applied for a $1.5 billion loan from the Federal Railroad Administration. Although it must be paid back with interest over 25 years, with collateral deposited in the interim, critics have called it taxpayer funding. Several counties along the route have also passed resolutions opposing the project.Mr. Lawless said that the 240-mile Dallas to Houston route was ideal for high-speed rail and that it would make travel times between the two cities faster than by car and competitive with airlines. \u201cGiven the traffic, the growth occurring and the dynamics of the Texas economy, plus the movement between the two metro areas, the demand for this project is very substantial,\u201d Mr. Lawless said.Still, even if the California, Florida and Texas projects all succeed, transportation experts say it is unlikely that the United States will ever have the same kind of high-speed rail systems as China or Europe.C. William Ibbs, a professor of civil engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, said countries with successful high-speed rail projects had higher population densities, higher gas prices, higher rates of public-transportation use and lower rates of car ownership. \u201cSo it wouldn\u2019t make any sense to have a high-speed rail train in most areas of the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cThe geography is different and other factors are just too different.\u201d\u201cAn earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to the speed of high-speed trains in Europe and China.

They all signaled success and prosperity. Or, as Mr. Campbell put it: \u201cSomebody who wants to take care of some serious business.\u201dSomebody else. Not him.He didn\u2019t have a suit hanging in the homeless shelter where he lives. So he arrived at a job placement agency last week in a black T-shirt, green canvas shorts and Nike boots. He had a job interview scheduled for 3:30 p.m. \u2014 his first in months \u2014 and he was itching to get going.But the case managers at the agency told him he had one last appointment before he headed out, for something unexpected: a fitting, and a second chance.Between 1979 and 2007, wages for men under 30 with only a high school diploma fell nearly 29 percent, according to a 2011 study by Andrew Sum, a professor of economics at Northeastern University in Boston. And that was before the Great Recession and the weak economic recovery that has followed.Mr. Campbell, who is 32 and has a high school equivalency diploma, can tell you what it\u2019s like to feel the floor collapse beneath your feet. He lost his last job, cleaning a food court, in June 2013, then his apartment, and then the life he once knew.He has been in free fall ever since, relying on food stamps to buy groceries and counting on friends, relatives and the New York City shelter system for a place to sleep.As for clothes? Men in his position often turn to secondhand stores, church donations and gifts from friends and relatives. \u201cIt\u2019s hard,\u201d Mr. Campbell said. \u201cReal hard.\u201dSo when the job counselors directed him to the Suited for Work office last week, he felt as if he had stumbled into a new world. Brand-new suit jackets from designers like Calvin Klein, Perry Ellis and Michael Kors hung from the racks. A kaleidoscope of ties beckoned. Dress shirts sat neatly stacked on the shelves, their pearly buttons calling for nimble fingers.Mr. Campbell had landed at one of the few nonprofits that provide jobless men with free suits and business attire. An array of programs provide professional clothing for women. Very few offer such services to male job seekers, according to the nonprofit staff, who say the trappings of success give struggling men the confidence they need to brave an uncertain job market.Troy Lewis, 48, who was preparing for an interview with a service hiring livery car drivers, walked out last week with a crisp white shirt, a shimmering purple and black tie, and a smart gray suit by Pronto Uomo.Felix Gonzalo, 54, who hopes to land a job as a long-distance trucker, left with a handsome Botany 500 ensemble and a yellow paisley tie.As for Mr. Campbell, he found a charcoal gray Michael Kors suit, a mauve dress shirt and a purple striped tie. He adjusted his collar in front of the floor-length mirror and marveled at the transformation.He hadn\u2019t been sure that he needed a suit for this interview. After all, the company was looking for a restaurant deliveryman, not a supervisor. But the longer he looked, the more convinced he was that he would stand out in a crowd of job applicants.Asked how he felt, Mr. Campbell smiled: \u201cLike new.\u201dWith his job interview less than two hours away, the Suited for Work helpers scrambled to hem his trousers with safety pins and to replace his Nikes with a pair of wingtips.And then he was out the door, on the subway and arriving at his job interview right on time.

Leaves Interest Rates Unchanged, Despite Geopolitical Risks", "Date": "2014-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 The president of the European Central Bank said on Thursday that the Ukraine crisis posed a risk to the eurozone economy, but that the impact was not yet severe enough to warrant a shift in monetary policy.\u201cIf geopolitical risks materialize, it\u2019s quite clear that the next two quarters will show lower growth,\u201d the bank president, Mario Draghi, said at a news conference on Thursday.But the bank left interest rates unchanged on Thursday as it waited to gauge the effects of earlier measures to stimulate the economy and get a clearer picture of the impact of deteriorating relations with Russia \u2014 including an embargo against agricultural imports that Moscow announced on Thursday.\u201cIt\u2019s difficult now to define \u2018what are the options in the future,\u2019 especially if the conflict escalates,\u201d Mr. Draghi said. But he said the central bank was ready to take further action if necessary, including quantitative easing \u2014 the same kind of big purchases of financial assets that the Federal Reserve used to stimulate the United States economy.Mr. Draghi said that the steps taken in June had already contributed to a decline in market interest rates, and that he was optimistic that commercial banks would take advantage of cheap loans that the central bank would begin offering in September. The so-called targeted lending program is intended to funnel credit to countries like Italy, where many small businesses have been unable to hire or invest because they cannot get loans.Mr. Draghi quoted estimates that banks would draw at least 450 billion euros and perhaps as much as 850 billion euros, or $1.14 trillion, under the program, which obligates lenders to pass the money on to businesses and individuals in the form of credit.\u201cWe do expect a sizable pickup,\u201d he said.Inflation in the eurozone in July was 0.4 percent, according to an official estimate, far below the level of about 2 percent that the central bank considers healthy for the economy. Some economists warn that the eurozone could be drawn into a destructive downward price spiral known as deflation that would destroy jobs and incomes.\u201cMario Draghi remained undisturbed\u201d by growing risks to growth, Peter Vanden Houte, an analyst at ING Bank, said in a note to clients. \u201cHaving already decided upon a comprehensive set of measures in June to ward off deflationary pressures, the E.C.B.'s aim was to sit back and wait.\u201dRecent data has dented optimism about eurozone growth. German industrial production rose 0.3 percent in June compared with May, according to data released on Thursday, far below expectations. Many economists now expect data due next week to show that the German economy, the largest in the eurozone, shrank in the second quarter after growing for a year.On Wednesday, Italy reported that its gross domestic product unexpectedly shrank 0.2 percent in the second quarter, dragging the economy back into recession. Some analysts saw the decline in output as an early sign that an escalating sanctions war with Russia could be hurting eurozone growth, but Mr. Draghi suggested Thursday that it was more a result of Italy\u2019s failure to remove impediments to entrepreneurship, investment and hiring.\u201cThere are stories of investors that would like to build plants and equipment and create jobs, but it takes months for them to get authorization to do so,\u201d he said. \u201cThat has nothing to do with monetary policy. It\u2019s mostly the lack of structural reforms.\u201dThe countries that are growing are the ones that had introduced overhauls like lowering taxes and making labor markets more competitive, Mr. Draghi said. He did not name any, but eurozone countries that have taken those steps toward growth include Germany, Portugal and Spain.Mr. Draghi said that trade and financial links with Russia were modest, but acknowledged that the impact of tensions could be greater than expected, especially if they led to an increase in energy prices.\u201cIf one looks at the figures for trade and financial flows, they would by and large reveal a picture of very limited interconnections,\u201d Mr. Draghi said. However, he added that wider effects could occur if Russia and the West continued to add sanctions.In addition, Mr. Draghi said that subsidiaries of Russian banks in the eurozone would have to provide assurances that money they borrowed from the European Central Bank would not be used to evade sanctions that had been imposed by the European Union and the United States.\u201cBanks will have to explain why they need the money, and the national central bank inspectors and supervisors will assess their statements,\u201d he said.The Bank of England also decided on Thursday to keep its benchmark interest rate at a low 0.5 percent, where it has been since 2009. Britain\u2019s robust economic growth, however, has raised speculation that policy makers will have to raise interest rates sooner than expected, perhaps this year.Britain\u2019s central bank also left unchanged its stimulus program of holding 375 billion pounds, or about $632 billion, in government bonds that it has bought over the last five years.Britain and the United States are moving gradually toward raising interest rates to prevent inflation, while the European Central Bank is more focused on the risks from very low inflation.Mr. Draghi noted that the eurozone monetary policy had decoupled from the United States. But if anything, he sounded pleased that the divergence had reduced the value of the euro against the dollar. A lower exchange rate helps exporters by making their products cheaper in foreign markets.The European Central Bank is in the midst of a comprehensive review of the health of eurozone banks, with the results due in late October. Mr. Draghi suggested that Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo was an example of how the increased scrutiny was forcing banks to come clean about their problems.The review has already prompted \u201cdramatic changes in the corporate structure of banks,\u201d Mr. Draghi said.\u201cWe have seen banks raising significant amounts of capital,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is a very important element that should not be underestimated because it\u2019s so crucial to repairing the bank lending channel in the euro area.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Typical was Kitty Lai, an investment adviser wearing an orange T-shirt and a baseball cap emblazoned with the logo of the Hong Kong Federation of Fujian Associations, a group that represents people from the coastal province across from Taiwan. She said shutting down the Central business district would cause chaos.\u201cWe want everything to be stable,\u201d Ms. Lai, 50, said in Mandarin Chinese. \u201cWe want everybody to live harmoniously.\u201dOrganizers of the July 1 rally estimated that more than 500,000 had taken part in that demonstration, which ended with the arrests of hundreds of participants, including some lawmakers, after they staged an overnight sit-in in the Central district.Hong Kong\u2019s police said 111,800 people left Victoria Park on Sunday for the march, more than the 98,600 they recorded for the July 1 march. Yet photographs taken at the peak points of both marches, at the same location, show many more people on the street on July 1. An independent count by Hong Kong University put the maximum number of participants on Sunday at 88,000, compared with a maximum of 172,000 on July 1.The protesters on Sunday wanted to show their opposition to Occupy Central With Love and Peace, an umbrella organization encompassing a wide section of Hong Kong society, including students, Christian religious leaders and some bankers. Occupy Central leaders have vowed to bring Central to a standstill with a sit-in should the national legislature and the city government insist on a plan for nominating the chief executive that bars candidates unacceptable to Beijing. That plan could be set in motion at the end of this month, when the National People\u2019s Congress in Beijing is to issue guidelines to the Hong Kong government on how it can write new election rules.\u201cHong Kong people desire peace. They\u2019re not afraid of speaking out, and the silent majority has spoken,\u201d Robert Chow, a spokesman for the alliance, said in an interview. \u201cWhy should they follow Occupy Central and try to hold Hong Kong hostage? If they really want universal suffrage, negotiate with Beijing. Negotiate with the government.\u201dUnder the laws that have governed Hong Kong since its return to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 from British control, the territory is to move to a system of universal suffrage for picking the chief executive in the 2017 election. But any plan must pass the city\u2019s legislature with a supermajority. Pro-democracy leaders have enough seats in the 70-member Legislative Council to scuttle any proposal should it fail to meet their demands, assuming they stay united.Some business associations, including leading United States accounting firms, have warned that a protest movement that shut or slowed down Hong Kong\u2019s Central district would harm the city\u2019s image and its economy. China\u2019s vice president, Li Yuanchao, has called the Occupy movement \u201cunlawful.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re fine the way we are,\u201d said Anita Kwan, a resident in her 40s, speaking in Cantonese, the native language in Hong Kong and much of neighboring Guangdong Province. \u201cOccupy Central damages Hong Kong\u2019s stability and reputation.\u201dTop Chinese officials overseeing Hong Kong are set to meet with the territory\u2019s legislators in the mainland city of Shenzhen, which abuts Hong Kong, on Thursday in the prelude to the vote by the National People\u2019s Congress.On Sunday in Victoria Park, the police presence was light, and mostly there to help guide the peaceful demonstrators across intersections. Many participants brought along their Indonesian and Filipino domestic helpers, who also donned the T-shirts and hats, with some given Chinese flags to wave.After the demonstrators had left, the detritus of protests, including posters, water bottles and flags, was strewed across the park, in contrast to the aftermath of pro-democracy rallies, when volunteers patrolled the ground, cleaning up everything, including wax from candle drippings.The organizers of Occupy Central said on their Twitter account that the anti-Occupy rally on Sunday should help motivate their own movement. \u201cIf the horrifying vision of HK manifested by anti-Occupy doesn\u2019t make us fight harder for real democracy,\u201d the group said, \u201csomething\u2019s wrong with our side.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Britain\u2019s Recovery Gains Momentum, but Wages Slip", "Date": "2014-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The Bank of England on Wednesday raised slightly its forecasts for growth and inflation in Britain, and gave further indications that it was moving closer to gradually increasing its key interest rates if wages improve.The central bank is concerned about slower growth in pay in Britain, as wages including bonuses dipped in the second quarter from a year ago, and it lowered its annual outlook for wage growth this year.The decline in wages could present a challenge to Britain\u2019s continued recovery, which has outpaced other parts of Europe. The odd cocktail of economic data has also allowed for political posturing less than year before a general election, with the government of Prime Minister David Cameron boasting of the pace of growth and falling unemployment, and the opposition Labour Party focusing on rising prices and stagnant pay.Mark J. Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, said at a news conference to present the central bank\u2019s quarterly Inflation Report that \u201cconflicting signals in the labor market\u201d were complicating the bank\u2019s efforts to determine whether to raise interest rates.The pound declined sharply against the dollar after the report, as investors expecting a possible rate hike this year had their hopes dashed, analysts said. A rate hike by the Bank of England from the low of 0.5 percent appears more likely early next year, analysts said. The pound was trading at $1.67 on Wednesday afternoon, its lowest level since June.Mr. Carney said that interest rates \u201ccan be expected to increase as the expansion progresses,\u201d but that any increases, \u201cwhen they come, are likely to be gradual and limited.\u201dThat expectation appears to be shared by the financial markets, \u200bMr. Carney said\u200b. The markets, he said, were projecting a rate of 2.5 percent by the end of the third quarter of 2017.\u201cSmall, slow increases in bank rate should help mitigate the risk that higher borrowing costs trigger a sharp slowdown in domestic demand,\u201d he said.In the Inflation Report, the bank predicted that the British economy would grow at an annual pace of 3.5 percent in 2014, slightly faster than the 3.4 percent growth it had forecast in May. For 2015, the bank maintained its estimate of 2.9 percent annual growth.The central bank said that it expected inflation to be 1.9 percent by the end of the year, up slightly from its May projection of 1.8 percent, and close to its target of 2 percent. Inflation would remain at slightly lower levels for 2015 and 2016, the bank said. Annual inflation reached 1.9 percent at the end of June, up from 1.5 percent in May, according to the most recent British data.\u201cToday\u2019s report comes across as a solid signal that the majority of BoE rate setters are planning to wait until next year before hiking rates,\u201d Robert Wood, an economist at Berenberg Bank, wrote in a research note. Berenberg had previously predicted that the central bank\u2019s next rate increases could come as early as November.Samuel Tombs, an economist at the research firm Capital Economics, said that the inflation rate had not eliminated the possibility of a rate hike this year, but that it indicated the central bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee was likely to \u201craise rates at a more measured pace than currently anticipated by the markets over the coming years.\u201dSeparately on Wednesday, the Office for National Statistics reported that Britain\u2019s unemployment rate \u200bdipped to 6.4 percent in the second quarter, the lowest level since late 2008.\u200b\u200bHowever, pay including bonuses for the quarter \u200bwas 0.2 percent lower than in the period a year earlier. Excluding bonuses, average pay in Britain was up 0.6 percent from the second quarter of 2013, which means wage growth has not kept pace with increases in prices of goods and services. \u200bIn 2013, bonus payments in Britain spiked in the second quarter as a number of businesses delayed payments normally made during the first quarter in order to allow their employees to take advantage of a lower tax rate.The central bank now expects wages to grow by 1.25 percent in 2014, down from its May estimate of 2.5 percent growth for the year.Mr. Carney also expressed concerns about subdued productivity growth. The Bank of England is projecting productivity \u2014 a measure of gross domestic product per hour worked \u2014 to increase by about 0.25 percent this year and by 1.75 percent in 2016. The average increase was 2.5 percent between 1998 and 2007.Mr. Carney said that a \u201csustained expansion here at home will ultimately require growth in productivity and real incomes, both of which have disappointed.\u201d \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bThe bank expects unemployment to fall to below 6 percent by the end of the year. \u200b Earlier this year, as employment increased faster than expected, the Bank of England backed away from its plan to consider raising key lending rates as soon as unemployment fell below 7 percent. \u200bIn the second quarter, the number of people employed in Britain increased to 30.6 million, driven in part by a jump of nearly 10 percent in the number of people who identified themselves as self-employed. The number of people working increased by 167,000 from the end of March.Iain Duncan Smith, the secretary of state for work and pensions, called Wednesday\u2019s figures \u201cquite remarkable.\u201d Focusing on the fall in unemployment, he said being in a secure job was the best hope for people to see their incomes rise in future. \u201cYour salary can\u2019t rise,\u201d he said, \u201cif you\u2019re not in work.\u201dStephen Timms, the Labour shadow employment minister, said that while the decline in unemployment is welcome, \u201cit\u2019s extremely worrying that the figures have shown pay falling far behind inflation and the change in regular pay being the lowest on record.\u201d\u201cFor Iain Duncan Smith to claim that people are \u2018better off ' in the face of these figures shows just how out of touch this Tory-led government is,\u201d Mr. Timms said.The theme that the average Briton is still feeling squeezed resonates with voters. But polls suggest that Ed Miliband, the Labour leader and likely challenger for Mr. Cameron\u2019s job, has so far struggled to persuade voters that he is a better guardian of the economy than Mr. Cameron.Mr. Wood, the economist from Berenberg, wrote that a decline in unemployment coupled with weak productivity could prompt the Bank of England to begin to raise rates this year if wage growth increased: \u201cThe Inflation Report signals that wage growth would not need to pick up very much in order to justify a hike.\u201dMr. Carney said there had been a little more energy than expected from the British economy.\u201cThis is an expansion, which has momentum,\u201d he said, \u201cand we expect it to continue.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of Britain\u2019s secretary of state for work and pensions.

Among its important criteria is a cost-benefit analysis that strikes us as misguided, if not absurd. Economists at the agency have recommended that the benefits smokers gain if they quit smoking, such as fewer tobacco-caused deaths and diseases, must be discounted by 70 percent to offset the loss in pleasure suffered when they give up their habit. You don\u2019t have to be a genius to see that this turns common sense on its head. Most smokers who shake their addiction, often after multiple attempts to do so, are probably way more pleased that they were successful than crestfallen over the pleasure they have lost. Under a longstanding federal executive order, all regulations that will have a major impact on the economy must be subjected to a cost-benefit analysis showing whether the benefits will be worth the cost. The \u201clost pleasure\u201d approach, a recognized tool among economists, has been used in assessing other products and was even used, ill-advisedly, in assessing the value of graphic warning labels on cigarette packages. Jonathan Gruber, a health economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, whose research was cited to support the F.D.A.\u2019s approach, submitted a comment asserting that the proposed rule \u201cis not justified or even tightly tied to my research.\u201d The agency would be wise to abandon this approach before issuing a final rule.

Ours is a land in constant motion, where people can think with their hands, have traded for centuries and actually invented banking.How did we pull that one off? Plenty of plausible explanations blame the feckless government of Silvio Berlusconi, or the acquiescent administrations of Mario Monti and Enrico Letta that followed, the latter two having imposed the European Union\u2019s \u2014 or rather, Berlin\u2019s \u2014 belt-tightening on a country needing to boost consumption and investment.But blaming Brussels, or anyone else abroad, is wrong. The rest of Europe followed the German diktat, and yet Italy is the only one suffering.Matteo Renzi, our 39-year-old prime minister, was supposed to be the man to sort all this out. When he took office in February, he promised a major policy shake-up every month, with reforms to labor in March, the public sector in April, taxation in May and the justice system over the summer. Mr. Renzi then began a personal crusade to overhaul Italy\u2019s cumbersome Senate.He won the first step toward approval of his political reform bill in the Senate on Aug. 8, but he\u2019s running into opposition: Focusing on the upper house while the economy stutters is like a pilot talking about his airline\u2019s marketing strategy just as the engines stall. Don\u2019t be surprised if the passengers scream.Still, Mr. Renzi has enormous work to do, and the Istat news shows where. What he must do \u2014 but hasn\u2019t done \u2014 is hack a path through the jungle of Italian red tape, which constrains business growth. Trimming this toxic vegetation wouldn\u2019t take much time or money, just determined political courage.To the credit of Mr. Renzi and his predecessors Mr. Letta and Mr. Monti, some useful anti-red-tape legislation has indeed been approved. But that legislation still needs the ministries to draft new, streamlined regulations, which they are loath to do. Italian civil servants and regional administrators will never admit it, but they adore red tape. It\u2019s their job-for-life insurance. In June, 821 major regulations were waiting to be released (133 for Mr. Renzi\u2019s legislation, 354 for Mr. Letta\u2019s, 334 for Mr. Monti\u2019s). Without them, reform is only in name.The World Bank ranks Italy at No. 65 for \u201cease of doing business,\u201d behind Belarus and just ahead of Kyrgyzstan. Consider: Last spring a major telecommunications company hired Cecilia, a friend of mine from Turin, to produce some videos, and it committed in writing to paying her within 30 days. After 45 days of silence, she complained. So the company asked her to fill out several forms online. More silence, and more complaints.The company then asked her to send a paper invoice by mail. It\u2019s mid-August and she still hasn\u2019t received payment. This is, in fact, normal: Private companies in Italy pay after 94 days, and public-sector enterprises after 165 days, against the European Union average of 47 and 107 days, respectively.What about companies that get up and running? An acquaintance from Lodi named Federico runs a successful wholesale pet-food business. Some of his customers have stopped paying. But he still has to fork over income tax and value-added tax \u2014 on income he has not received \u2014 and, of course, he has his own suppliers to pay. Again, that\u2019s not unusual: One in five Italian companies is forced to trim its work force because of cash flow problems.Think property owners get a break? My family owns property near Milan. We have three tenants \u2014 one residential, two business \u2014 who don\u2019t pay their rent. Why not sue? An eviction order alone could take up to two years. The average duration of civil cases is 7.4 years. \u201cFammi causa!\u201d (\u201cSue me!\u201d) has become a brazen refrain in business.After my family sold our grandparents\u2019 house in 2007, the Agenzia delle Entrate \u2014 Italy\u2019s Internal Revenue Service \u2014 demanded extra taxes. We disagreed. Before we could appeal, we had to pay a third of the amount owed up front. We paid, and this year we won the case. At this point, the law requires the agency to return the money, but we have no way of forcing it to do so. So it doesn\u2019t.Matteo Renzi knows this happens to millions of Italians, but he remains an optimist. A few days ago, he compared economic recovery to this year\u2019s rainy summer: \u201cIt didn\u2019t come when we wanted it to, maybe it\u2019s not as nice as we hoped, but it\u2019s on its way.\u201d Unless we tie summer up with red tape, of course, in which case it might miss Italy altogether. And next up is the fall.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Squeeze on the Middlebrow", "Date": "2014-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCross CutsAccording to a widely accepted story, the expansion of the middle class \u2014 the collapse of older social hierarchies, the decline of inherited privilege and the rise of a new meritocratic order \u2014 unfolded according to something like a natural law. The nature of capitalism, we have been taught to believe, tends toward greater equality, wider opportunity and the leveling of archaic, invidious distinctions based on pedigree. Mr. Piketty throws cold water on this conventional wisdom, which has been part of the intellectual birthright of nearly everyone born in the West since the end of World War II.The three decades between roughly then and the 1970s, known in France as \u201cles trente glorieuses\u201d (the \u201cglorious thirty\u201d), are remembered in the United States in various ways, not all of them glorious. The Cold War. The Space Age. The infancy, adolescence and reluctant adulthood of the baby boomers. The civil rights and sexual revolutions. The Golden Age of Middlebrow, whose end we may be mourning whether we realize it or not. That may sound odd, since \u201cmiddlebrow\u201d is the kind of word rarely said without a sneer. How can pretension and mediocrity enjoy a golden age? Like the later, sociologically related terms \u201cyuppie\u201d and \u201chipster,\u201d middlebrow is a name you would never call yourself, but rather a semantic shoe that belongs on someone else\u2019s foot. It is also, however, a workable synonym, in the sphere of art and culture, for democracy.The reasons for her rage are spelled out in vivid, good-humored detail. Woolf is proud to call herself a highbrow, which she defines as a \u201cman or woman of thoroughbred intelligence who rides his mind at a gallop across country in pursuit of an idea.\u201d This designation places her in the company of writers from Shakespeare to the Bront\u00ebs, and also carries an unmistakable, not entirely metaphorical trace of class distinction. Highbrow status is a matter of breeding and belonging. But the highbrow, though an aristocrat, is not a snob.\u201cI honor and respect lowbrows,\u201d Woolf asserts, \u201cand I have never known a highbrow who did not.\u201d (Lowbrows are defined as those who are as committed to living as highbrows are to thinking.) This is because high and low are in alliance against the middle. \u201cI myself have known duchesses who were highbrows, also charwomen, and they have both told me with that vigor of language which so often unites the aristocracy with the working classes that they would rather sit in the coal cellar together than in the drawing room with middlebrows and pour out tea.\u201dWhat makes the middlebrows so contemptible? Woolf\u2019s tautological response is their very middleness, their inability to be either one thing or another, and their habit of \u201cindistinguishably and rather nastily\u201d mixing up art and life (the pure, complementary pursuits of the high and the low) with things like \u201cmoney, fame, power or prestige.\u201dThe natural affinity of the high and low, and their mutual suspicion of the middle, has been a remarkably durable idea, though it has never proven to be anything more than an idea, a nostalgic vision of ideal order. At heart it is a fantasy of aesthetic authenticity secured by static and hierarchical social distinctions. A world of landlords and peasants, of masters and servant, of patrons and workers is one in which art and life harmonize. In such a world, the middle will always be a place of vulgarity and ostentation, of the kind of money-grubbing, backslapping, self-conscious display Woolf (or at least her notional duchess) would flee to the basement to avoid.The categories are easy to scramble because the chart is less an emblem of hierarchy than of mobility. Its categories do not represent class differences; they replace class differences. There are no duchesses and charwomen in Lynes\u2019s tableau, and none of the mystified language of animal husbandry. There are not even necessarily significant gradations of income. Every brow-holder is assumed to be able to afford furniture, clothes, reading material and other amenities, and each is assumed to have leisure time in which to enjoy them.They also all have jobs; no one is living off income from capital. This is clear in the essay, which identifies the highbrow not as an aristocrat or even an artist, but rather as someone likely to work in the academy. The upper middlebrows, who may have more money \u2014 and who fill out the all-important donor class that supports symphony orchestras, libraries and museums \u2014 are well-placed professionals living in the bigger cities.\u00a0What unites the brows is that all of them are, fundamentally, consumers.The high, drawing inspiration from the low \u2014 from \u201cjazz musicians, primitive painters and ballad writers\u201d \u2014 feeds the middle, which grows ever larger, a marvelous circumstance for Lynes, who concludes his essay on a good-humored, optimistic note. \u201cThe highbrows would like,\u201d he notes, perhaps with Woolf in mind, \u201cto eliminate the middlebrows and devise a society that would approximate an intellectual feudal system, in which the lowbrows do the work and create folk arts, and the highbrows do the thinking and create fine arts.\u201dBut, he declares, \u201cthe highbrows haven\u2019t a chance,\u201d and notes that everything refined and difficult has a way of slipping down toward the middle. That means that everyone has an opportunity to rise toward the high. His grid is \u201ca ladder,\u201d not the social ladder of generations past, but one it is nonetheless possible to climb: \u201cIt\u2019s onward and upward just the same.\u201dOnly a highbrow could fail to be charmed by this rosy projection of upward mobility, with its vision of a vast, all-encompassing and yet still pluralistic and lively middle. And as Lynes\u2019s prophecy was realized, there was no shortage of complaint. The subsequent history of American culture over the course of les trente glorieuses is a tale of growth, punctuated by occasional grumbles of dissent.But it wasn\u2019t enough. It couldn\u2019t be, in part because \u201cthe great cultures of the past have all been elite affairs, centering in small, upper-class communities which had certain standards in common.\u201d Macdonald was too much of a democrat to wish for a return to such a state of affairs. But he did register the sense that something \u2014 variously called sophistication, authenticity, seriousness or just art \u2014 was being lost as the old, unbudging, quasi-feudal hierarchy of upper and lower was replaced by the hectic scrum of mass and middle.Maybe something was lost. But it is hard to look back at the middlebrow era without being dazzled by its scale, complexity and size, and without also, perhaps, feeling a stab of nostalgia. More does not always mean better, but the years after World War II were a grand era of more. In Pikettian terms, the rate of growth exceeded the rate of return on capital, and the result was a culture as well as a society that became less stratified and more egalitarian.High culture became more accessible, popular culture became more ambitious, until the distinction between them collapsed altogether. Some of the mixing looks silly or vulgar in retrospect: stiff Hollywood adaptations or comic-book versions of great novels; earnest television broadcasts about social problems; magazines that sandwiched serious fiction in between photographs of naked women. But much of it was glorious.And we live \u2014 happily or grumpily \u2014 with its legacy even as the signs of its obsolescence multiply. The middlebrow is robustly represented in \u201cdifficult\u201d cable television shows, some of which, curiously enough, fetishize such classic postwar middlebrow pursuits as sex research and advertising. It also thrives in a self-conscious foodie culture in which a taste for folkloric authenticity commingles with a commitment to virtue and refinement.But in literature and film we hear a perpetual lament for the midlist and the midsize movie, as the businesses slip into a topsy-turvy high-low economy of blockbusters and niches. The art world spins in an orbit of pure money. Museums chase dollars with crude commercialism aimed at the masses and the slavish cultivation of wealthy patrons. Symphonies and operas chase donors and squeeze workers (that is, artists) as the public drifts away.Universities and colleges, the seedbeds of a cultural ideal consecrated to both excellence and democracy, to citizenship and to knowledge for its own sake, are becoming either hothouses for the new dynastic elite or training centers for the technocratic debt peons of the digital future.In the hectic heyday of the middlebrow, intellectuals gazed back longingly at earlier dispensations when masterpieces were forged in conditions of inequality by lucky or well-born artists favored by rich or titled patrons.Social inequality may be returning, but that doesn\u2019t mean that the masterpieces will follow. The highbrows were co-opted or killed off by the middle, and the elitism they championed has been replaced by another kind, the kind that measures all value, cultural and otherwise, in money. It may be time to build a new ladder.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mr. Obama, Your Move", "Date": "2014-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialSometime in late summer, if predictions are right, President Obama will use his executive authority to protect many unauthorized immigrants from deportation.We don\u2019t know the details. Mr. Obama and the Department of Homeland Security have not yet supplied the who, what, when or even, officially, whether. But Mr. Obama has promised to respond to Congress\u2019s refusal to act on immigration reform. And the most obvious thing is to lift the threat of deportation from immigrants who should be the lowest priority for removal: those with citizen children, jobs, clean records and strong community ties. Some reports put the size of that group at four million to five million.The mere possibility of Mr. Obama\u2019s protecting any of the 11 million immigrants living here outside the law is already making Republicans clutch at their chests and cry out: Oh, the legality! He has done nothing yet, but right-wingers have pre-emptively declared him Caesar, crossing a Rubicon into lawlessness.In truth, Mr. Obama is well within his authority to madden the right. His power to conduct immigration policy is vast. Congress has given the president broad flexibility and discretion to enforce immigration law. It has also given him the resources to deport about 350,000 to 400,000 people a year, as Mr. Obama has done, relentlessly. It could have given him billions more to deport everyone, but it has not.For Mr. Obama to use the tools at hand to focus on high-priority targets \u2014 felons, violent criminals, public-safety and national-security threats \u2014 and to let many others alone would be a rational and entirely lawful exercise of discretion. It is the kind of thing prosecutors, police and other law-enforcement and regulatory agencies do every day. And with the authority to defer deportations of certain immigrants comes the authority, clearly spelled out in federal statute, to give them permission to work. Despite the shrill alarms, deferring deportation is not the dreaded \u201camnesty\u201d that Republicans made a dirty word. It is temporary and revocable. It is not legalization; it is not a path to citizenship; and it permanently fixes nothing. But there is clearly a value to a program, however limited, that tells the enshadowed population: Come out, give us your names; keep working and paying taxes, supporting your families and staying off the dole. And the national interest goes well beyond such practical benefits. Consider the cost, in lawlessness and squandered resources, of indiscriminate immigration enforcement. The wastefulness of chasing millions who pose no threat but keep the economy afloat. The crime and exploitation that flourish wherever the undocumented remain hidden and vulnerable. The rampant wage-and-hour violations that off-the-books workers endure in silence. The civil-rights abuses when cops commit racial profiling, when racist sheriffs stage \u201ccrime suppression\u201d patrols to sweep up those with brown skin. The cost to all workers when unscrupulous employers push pay and working conditions to rock-bottom levels. The ripe conditions for crime in communities where vulnerable immigrants fear and avoid the police.The country understands this, and was once moving toward an overhaul of the immigration system. But Congress has failed at every turn. Even a small-scale idea \u2014 legalizing \u201cDreamers\u201d who were brought here as children and are Americans in all but name \u2014 has been repeatedly stymied by the nativist right. Pressured by those young strivers, Mr. Obama used his authority in 2012 to allow them a two-year reprieve to stay legally and work. Now the president is poised to expand this shield \u2014 possibly to the Dreamers\u2019 parents, siblings, grandparents and perhaps millions of others.If Mr. Obama acts, as he should, and the right wing explodes, it will be worth taking time to consider what Senator Jeff Sessions, Representative Steve King and their hard-core colleagues and allies would have Mr. Obama do. For them, the right number of unauthorized immigrants to welcome is zero; the right time is never. They would let the system rot in place, to maintain the fiction that the country can deport its way to lawfulness. Their dishonesty is repellent, as is their blindness to the lawless status quo, and to the cruelty of denying the hopes of millions whose labor is welcomed but whose humanity is not.Mr. Obama\u2019s critics in Congress belong to a branch of government that has chosen to do nothing constructive about immigration \u2014 not even to resolve this summer\u2019s crisis of migrant children at the border, which they looked at and punted on, before going on vacation. This is, after all, an election year. They have abandoned a difficult job to the care of Mr. Obama. They are in no position to complain when he does it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Call It What You Like, but Not a Chain", "Date": "2014-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdvertisingBut today chain ownership is sometimes viewed as a negative by food aficionados seeking one-of-a-kind food trucks and microbreweries, and locavores celebrating restaurants that use ingredients close to home. Now Legal Sea Foods, which has about 35 locations, most in the Boston area, is railing against the term. Its chief executive, Roger Berkowitz, argues in a series of new commercials that its seafood restaurants should never be called a chain. In another spot, Mr. Berkowitz is hooked up to a lie detector, and his interrogator asks if he is the owner of Legal Sea Foods, to which he responds \u201cYes.\u201d He is asked if it is a chain, to which he responds \u201cNo\u201d as the needles etch straight lines on the scrolling paper. \u201cIs the person who called Legal Sea Foods a chain a complete moron?\u201d asks the interrogator. Stone-faced, Mr. Berkowitz pauses a moment, then responds \u201cNo,\u201d sending the needles scribbling wildly up and down.The spots close with a new tag line for the campaign, \u201cWhere chain is a four-letter word.\u201d The campaign, which also includes print advertising, is by DeVito/Verdi in New York. The company declined to provide estimated advertising expenditures for the campaign, which will be introduced Friday in the six states, and the District of Columbia, where restaurants are.Mr. Berkowitz, who since 1992 has run the company that his father started \u2014 first as a Cambridge fish market in 1950, then a no-frills fish restaurant in 1968 \u2014 has long insisted on using the term \u201cfamily\u201d or \u201cgroup\u201d to refer to his restaurants.\u201cWhen anyone thinks of a chain, they think of cookie cutter, institutionalized, dummied down, and those aren\u2019t the best adjectives,\u201d Mr. Berkowitz said in an interview.\u201cThere\u2019s sort of a built-in prejudice about it that really doesn\u2019t define who we are and what we do.\u201dUnlike many chains, Mr. Berkowitz said, Legal is privately held, and its restaurants are all company-owned rather than franchised. Menus vary among locations, and the company has several iterations, like restaurants called Legal C Bar, which are more bar-focused, Legal Test Kitchen, which are faster and more focused on to-go offerings, and Legal Oysteria, which has a Northern Italian menu. \u201cPeople never associate chains with the kind of passion or quality that we put into our food,\u201d Mr. Berkowitz said. \u201cSo if we\u2019re referred to in a review or something like that and \u2018chain\u2019 is used, whether inadvertent or not, there\u2019s almost just a dismissive aspect to it that I find objectionable.\u201dIn the industry, however, others disagree on how to define \u201cchain.\u201dTechnomic, a restaurant consulting and market research firm, considers a company with 10 or more restaurants to be a chain, said Darren Tristano, its executive vice president. He had no recollection of any of the top 500 restaurant brands that Technomic tracks proclaiming in advertising that they were not chains. (Legal, based on estimated revenue of $186.2 million in 2013, is ranked at 167 on that list). Mr. Tristano lauded Legal as \u201ca brand that\u2019s been around a while and knows its customer.\u201d He added that he could understand why Mr. Berkowitz might feel \u201cpigeonholed\u201d by some of the negative connotations. But he found something particularly ironic about the mere existence of the new advertising campaign.\u201cThe single mom-and-pop type of restaurant does not have an advertising budget,\u201d Mr. Tristano said. \u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t have the economies of scale for purchasing that a 30-plus unit chain has,\u201d he continued, \u201cso if you\u2019re in the industry and you run a restaurant group that\u2019s large, you\u2019re a chain whether you like it or not.\u201dIn 2013, promoting the notion that omega-3 fatty acids found in fish promote brain function, the brand introduced a series of commercials and print ads that featured people doing stupid things. The ads included a man sawing off a branch as he sat on it, another man stopping a ceiling fan with his head, and a women shutting herself in a Laundromat dryer. The tag line: \u201cFish is brain food. We have a fish.\u201dEllis Verdi, president of DeVito/Verdi, said that the campaign about chains was unlikely to cause a drastic change \u2014 for now.\u201cMy expectation is not to change the vocabulary necessarily, because that takes a while,\u201d Mr. Verdi said. \u201cBut we want to at least put it in their minds that this isn\u2019t something that we like to be called or it makes sense to call us.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Luck and a Little Mystery: The Economy Grows Faster Under Democratic Presidents", "Date": "2014-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byToday's EconomistThough I typically resist, my wife often tries to get me to put down the laptop and enjoy the Zen of gardening with her. So you can imagine her surprise when she returned from a trip to find a beautiful clump of nonwild flowers planted in her garden. She loved the welcome-home gift and was ready to bestow upon me many valuable (and increasingly elusive) good-husband points.The thing is, I have no idea how those flowers got there. And like George Washington, I could not tell a lie. But had I in fact been an actual president, I probably would have taken credit.Their answer to the first question is clear: The American economy has grown faster \u2014 and scored higher on many other macroeconomic metrics \u2014 when the president of the United States is a Democrat rather than a Republican.The two looked at key macroeconomic variables averaged over 64 years (16 four-year terms), from Harry Truman to Barack Obama. Mr. Blinder and Mr. Watson focus mostly on the 1.8 percent annual difference in real G.D.P. growth. That is, over the full study, real G.D.P. growth averaged 3.33 percent per year. But under Democratic presidents the economy grew 4.35 percent and under Republicans 2.54 percent.Under Democratic presidents, the economy also spent fewer quarters in recession; added more jobs and more hours worked; and posted larger declines in unemployment and higher corporate profits than under their Republican counterparts. Stock market returns were a lot higher under Democrats as well, but because equity markets are so volatile, that difference is not statistically significant. (By the way, since March 2009, the S.&P. stock index is up 160 percent).I added my own variable, though since it\u2019s only annual, I couldn\u2019t match the dates to terms as well as Mr. Blinder and Mr. Watson: Since 1947, real median family income grew by 1.6 percent over Democratic presidents and 1.1 percent over Republicans\u2019 terms. (The difference is not significant, however).It\u2019s a remarkable set of findings and one that clearly raises the question with which Mr. Blinder and Mr. Watson spend most of their paper wrestling: What explains these differences?Military spending grew a lot faster under Democratic administrations than Republican ones (think President Truman in Korea and Lyndon Johnson in Vietnam), but Mr. Blinder and Mr. Watson find that such spending represents too small a share of G.D.P. to explain much. (True, Ronald Reagan engaged in military Keynesianism, but Eisenhower quite sharply cut the \u201cmilitary industrial complex.\u201d)Instead, the two economists find they can explain half of that 1.8 percent G.D.P. difference through differences in productivity growth, favorable oil shocks, more favorable international conditions and (slightly) more optimistic consumer confidence.By now, you may be asking what any of this has to do with flowers in my wife\u2019s garden. It\u2019s this: Much as I could not take credit for flowers I hadn\u2019t planted, Democratic presidents can\u2019t legitimately take credit for those factors. Productivity, oil shocks and better global conditions are best filed under \u201cluck.\u201dThat\u2019s arguable, of course. One can weave stories about how presidents affect these variables, especially consumer confidence (though I\u2019ve always found consumers\u2019 moods correlate with gasoline prices, so that\u2019s probably connected to oil). I can easily do so myself: George W. Bush contributed to considerable conflict affecting oil supply chains; Mr. Obama has both drawn down that conflict and at least presided over extensive development of domestic energy production.And to state the entirely obvious: Presidents themselves will always claim credit for anything good that happens on their watch.But as difficult as this may be in such partisan times, I wouldn\u2019t push any of this too far. In fact, in a career of data analysis \u2014 in which I\u2019ve made thousands of tables and graphs plotting changes over time \u2014 I cannot recall one that compared presidential terms. That\u2019s because they are swamped by the business cycle \u2014 the booms and busts that are far more obvious and dramatic movers of the economy.Sure, key themes of my work are that expansive fiscal policy is hugely important in responding to downturns, and investment in public goods has positive, long-term impacts on productivity and growth. But identifying such differences among presidents is impossible. Historically both Democratic and Republicans do a lot of both. Their actions interact with the economy in ways that can\u2019t be untangled. The interstate highway investments of Eisenhower (R) surely contributed to the productivity acceleration enjoyed by Kennedy (D).So, what should one make of this work?First, the fact that half of the gap remains unexplained means that this is still largely an open question. There\u2019s lots of variance left to fight over.Second, while over the broad sweep of history a convincing answer to this question may be unknowable, that\u2019s less the case with the near term. The fact that bad fiscal policy \u2014 sharp deficit reduction when the economy was still weak \u2014 has hurt the current recovery is knowable and important. Though here, too, there\u2019s ambiguity: The recent austerity is mostly the work of Republicans, but the president has also at times bought into it.Finally it is glaringly obvious that complex, advanced economies need well-functioning federal governments that can accurately diagnose and prescribe; they need governments that can absorb factual information and respond to threats and opportunities. These requirements hold regardless of the president\u2019s party, and the fact that we do not currently have such a federal government is without doubt what\u2019s most important and most scary.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Antigraft Campaign Expands to a Coal-Rich Northern Province", "Date": "2014-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Newly disclosed investigations into senior politicians in Shanxi Province, an area in northern China rich in coal and opportunities for graft, reveal an emerging front in Communist Party leaders\u2019 efforts to show they are serious about eradicating corruption.On Friday, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s central agency for uncovering graft, announced that two senior Shanxi politicians faced investigation for \u201cserious violations of discipline and the law,\u201d a euphemism for corruption and related abuses of power.One was Bai Yun, a member of the provincial party\u2019s Standing Committee; the other was Ren Runhou, a deputy governor who was formerly a chairman of a Shanxi mining company.Shanxi Province, with its dense web of officials, coal wealth and resource deals, appears to be President Xi Jinping\u2019s next proving ground for trying to convince officials and the public that he is serious about ending entrenched graft in the party\u2019s ranks.The inquiries into Ms. Bai and Mr. Ren were disclosed nearly a week after the Central Commission said it was investigating two other senior officials in Shanxi, a development that followed a succession of other inquiries this year. The public security chief of Taiyuan, the provincial capital, was dismissed, and reports said he faced allegations of graft. Other reports said Zhang Xinming, a coal baron in Shanxi who is trailed by controversy, had been taken away by investigators after an inquiry into a state company that made a disputed mine purchase from him.Including the announcement about Ms. Bai, six former or current members of the Shanxi party\u2019s Standing Committee, the province\u2019s most powerful governing body, have come under investigation this year. At least 17 other officials in the province have been investigated on suspicion of corruption or other abuses of power, according to a count from the Central Commission\u2019s website.As China\u2019s economy and energy demand boomed over the past decade, Shanxi prospered from coal and associated industries. It also grew deeply corrupt. The inquiries are likely to ensnare more officials who peddled access to mines, land, credit, business orders and promotions, Mr. Gao said.\u201cIt has coal; coal brought money; that brought corruption,\u201d he said of Shanxi. \u201cWith all the money around, officials threw themselves into buying and selling posts, and with the posts, they could get more coal and more money.\u201dOn Friday, the commission announced that yet another prominent politician had been placed under investigation for \u201csuspected serious violations of discipline and of laws.\u201d The official, Bai Enpei, is a senior member of the National People\u2019s Congress \u2014 the party-controlled legislature \u2014 and was a former party chief of Yunnan Province in southwestern China.Ling Jihua has not been publicly accused of any misdeeds by the government. But the inquiries into his brother and other officials have left him vulnerable, Mr. Gao said.The party\u2019s graft inquiries have become a ritualized procession: The Central Commission, or a local branch, names officials under investigation for \u201cviolations of discipline\u201d; their colleagues gather to endorse the inquiry, denounce their former comrades and vow loyalty to the party and to Mr. Xi; and the state-controlled news media issues reports about the misdeeds and sordid lives of the fallen officials. The situation has happened in Shanxi in the past week.China Resources Holdings and China Resources Power engineered the purchase of three mines and other facilities in Shanxi in 2010, which aggrieved shareholders said were worth much less than the $1.6 billion or so that China Resources arms and a partner state firm paid for a controlling stake, according to documents filed in a lawsuit in Hong Kong. China Resources denied any wrongdoing but later said it was cooperating with the inquiry into Mr. Song.\u201cThe Shanxi case has just started,\u201d Li Jianjun, a freelance Chinese journalist who has pursued the allegations about Mr. Zhang and China Resources, said in an interview. \u201cIt must continue upward. There were umbrellas protecting the corruption,\u201d he said, using a Chinese term for official patrons.Kiki Zhao contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}

Elites that can handle the revenue loss, like Northwestern University, are shrinking their first-year classes instead of enrolling weaker students. In a tough climate, many of the best prospects turn to greener pastures. Last year, Northwestern\u2019s law school enrolled about one in 20 applicants.Judith C. Areen, executive director of the Association of American Law Schools, acknowledges the challenges within her field but suggests that potential applicants take the long view of the shrinking pool of law students.\u201cIt\u2019s not a panacea,\u201d she says, but three or four years from now \u201cyour odds of finding a job are clearly better.\u201dAmong the reasons: Financial firms have cut jobs following a slowdown in the mortgage industry, federal agencies have slowed hiring amid spending cuts, and employers have filled positions with candidates with bachelor\u2019s degrees instead of M.B.A.s, which command higher salaries. \u201cGraduates from the top M.B.A. programs can expect to find good opportunities,\u201d the report says, \u201cbut M.B.A.s with little professional experience may have more difficulty landing a job commensurate with their education.\u201dBusiness schools, of course, see the bright side, and tout the flexibility of their degrees. \u201cThere\u2019s this idea that an M.B.A. means this narrow path, a Wall Street career,\u201d says Michelle Sparkman Renz, director of research communications for the Graduate Management Admission Council. \u201cThere are wider opportunities across many sectors today, including technology.\u201dOnce enrolled, students are advised to seek out internships, which go a long way \u2014 perhaps more than ever \u2014 in securing a job. \u201cCompanies are more selective today because of the economy,\u201d Ms. Sparkman Renz says. \u201cThey\u2019re putting more into the hiring process.\u201dThat said, physicians\u2019 debt/salary picture looks a lot better than dentists\u2019. Median debt for medical school graduates is $175,000, for dentists $200,000. But according to Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Education and the Workforce, experienced physicians and surgeons earn a median of $207,000; dentists earn about $125,000.As for shortages, the nation\u2019s schools have many, especially in math, physics and chemistry. Special-education instructors and middle-school teachers are in high demand. But K-6 teachers are more plentiful, and there\u2019s a surplus of biology teachers. Getting certified in more than one subject can help applicants secure a position, which is why Ms. Coffman says prospective teachers should not put all their eggs in one basket. \u201cMaybe you want to be an elementary schoolteacher,\u201d she says, \u201cbut adding special education to that makes it more likely you\u2019ll find a job.\u201d\u201cAnybody who\u2019s working in a specialized field is going to need that master\u2019s degree,\u201d says William E. Kelly, director of external affairs for the American Society for Engineering Education and former dean of Catholic University\u2019s engineering school. \u201cI tell students to stay broad initially, and then specialize.\u201dLanding a spot in the nation\u2019s most sought-after graduate programs is no cinch, especially with more and more applicants from outside the United States. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s program received 8,200 applications last year, and offered a spot to about 1,300. Boston University admitted 880 of about 3,500 applicants.There\u2019s financial incentive to a master\u2019s as well. A second credential can help secure six figures.And with the aging of the nation\u2019s infrastructure, there\u2019s room for more growth.

{"Headline": "Inequality Is a Drag", "Date": "2014-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor more than three decades, almost everyone who matters in American politics has agreed that higher taxes on the rich and increased aid to the poor have hurt economic growth. Liberals have generally viewed this as a trade-off worth making, arguing that it\u2019s worth accepting some price in the form of lower G.D.P. to help fellow citizens in need. Conservatives, on the other hand, have advocated trickle-down economics, insisting that the best policy is to cut taxes on the rich, slash aid to the poor and count on a rising tide to raise all boats.But there\u2019s now growing evidence for a new view \u2014 namely, that the whole premise of this debate is wrong, that there isn\u2019t actually any trade-off between equity and inefficiency. Why? It\u2019s true that market economies need a certain amount of inequality to function. But American inequality has become so extreme that it\u2019s inflicting a lot of economic damage. And this, in turn, implies that redistribution \u2014 that is, taxing the rich and helping the poor \u2014 may well raise, not lower, the economy\u2019s growth rate.You might be tempted to dismiss this notion as wishful thinking, a sort of liberal equivalent of the right-wing fantasy that cutting taxes on the rich actually increases revenue. In fact, however, there is solid evidence, coming from places like the International Monetary Fund, that high inequality is a drag on growth, and that redistribution can be good for the economy.But how is that possible? Doesn\u2019t taxing the rich and helping the poor reduce the incentive to make money? Well, yes, but incentives aren\u2019t the only thing that matters for economic growth. Opportunity is also crucial. And extreme inequality deprives many people of the opportunity to fulfill their potential.Think about it. Do talented children in low-income American families have the same chance to make use of their talent \u2014 to get the right education, to pursue the right career path \u2014 as those born higher up the ladder? Of course not. Moreover, this isn\u2019t just unfair, it\u2019s expensive. Extreme inequality means a waste of human resources. And government programs that reduce inequality can make the nation as a whole richer, by reducing that waste.The same thing, I\u2019d argue, will end up being true of Obamacare. Subsidized insurance will induce some people to reduce the number of hours they work, but it will also mean higher productivity from Americans who are finally getting the health care they need, not to mention making better use of their skills because they can change jobs without the fear of losing coverage. Over all, health reform will probably make us richer as well as more secure.Will the new view of inequality change our political debate? It should. Being nice to the wealthy and cruel to the poor is not, it turns out, the key to economic growth. On the contrary, making our economy fairer would also make it richer. Goodbye, trickle-down; hello, trickle-up. Advertisement"}

Mr. Baltakis said the villa was known as the Poppy and Sunflower House, and the tiles depict stylized sunflowers. A second fireplace, with poppy motifs, is across the apartment in one of the bedrooms. The light-filled living area, which faces the street, has built-in bookshelves and storage that doubles as seats. The flooring is dark-stained oak for durability, Mr. Baltakis said, with the exception of the original pine in one of the bedrooms.A small guest bedroom is reached via a door from the great room; the other two bedrooms, including the master suite, are off the entry corridor. The blue-tiled master bathroom retains the original tub, which is mounted on a contemporary wood stand. A washer and dryer and a walk-in closet are also off the main corridor, as is the second bathroom.MARKET OVERVIEWThe market in Vilnius sets the tone for the rest of the country, he said. \u201cMarket trends always start in Vilnius and later, in 12 to 24 months, they spread into other main cities of Lithuania.\u201dBut with that confidence came looser lending standards, Mr. Vaitkunskas said, similar to conditions in other countries that set the stage for the global housing and credit crisis that began in 2008. Home prices fell by as much as 40 to 50 percent, agents said, with many properties falling into foreclosure. Lithuania, a onetime \u201cBaltic Tiger,\u201d was shaken by unrest over economic austerity measures. The country\u2019s economy has since recovered, and with banks selling off the last foreclosed properties, the housing market has stabilized, Mr. Vaitkunskas and other agents said. Prices in the luxury segment have risen about 5 percent in the last year, he said.Two clouds of uncertainty are hanging over the real estate market and the larger economy. First, the recent tension between the West and Russia fueled by the situation in Ukraine has made investors cautious and wary of a punitive sanctions battle. \u201cWe are members of NATO \u2014 people are feeling rather safe,\u201d Mr. Vaitkunskas said. \u201cBut if there is a war or Ukraine escalates a little more, it could escalate a global economic downturn.\u201d A less pressing concern is the effect of Lithuania\u2019s joining the eurozone on Jan. 1, 2015. \u201cThe owners think prices will go up; the buyers are hoping they will not go up,\u201d he said. \u201cMy personal opinion is that the euro definitely brings more stability and it takes out the current risk\u201d of having a currency unique to Lithuania. WHO BUYS IN VILNIUSBUYING BASICSThere are no restrictions on foreign buyers in Lithuania. Transaction costs are very low, Mr. Vaitkunskas said.

{"Headline": "Junta Leader Is Named New Premier of Thailand", "Date": "2014-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe army general who led the overthrow of Thailand\u2019s elected government in May was named prime minister on Thursday by a rubber-stamp legislature, sealing the military\u2019s acquisition of near-absolute power in a country once considered a regional beacon of political freedom.Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha was chosen as prime minister by the National Legislative Assembly, whose members were handpicked by the junta last month. There were no dissenting votes, and General Prayuth, who was attending a military ceremony outside of Bangkok and was not present, was the only candidate.Thailand has a long history of generals seizing power, but the military this time has been more aggressive in rooting out democratic institutions than after the last coup in 2006. All forms of popular elections have been suspended, including those for local councils that first appeared well over a century ago when Thailand was still an absolute monarchy.King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who is 86 and ailing, has endorsed the junta and was expected to formally approve General Prayuth\u2019s selection as prime minister.Thailand\u2019s military says it will eventually restore democracy. But the junta has not provided a firm timetable for elections, and an interim constitution introduced by the military says that democracy, when it is restored, will be \u201csuitable for a Thai context,\u201d a vague qualification that has yet to be defined.Surachart Bamrungsuk, a professor at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok and an expert on the Thai military, describes the current system as a \u201csoft dictatorship\u201d and says that the top generals are trying to cement their place in the country\u2019s future.\u201cWhat they want is a kind of guided democracy where the military has a supervisory role,\u201d Professor Surachart said.Even those skeptical of the bloodless coup admit that the military has significant support, especially among the urban middle class.\u201cA lot of people who supported the coup see it as a necessary pause for democracy; they are buying into what the coup leaders are saying,\u201d said Sarinee Achavanuntakul, an investment banker turned blogger who has been critical of the coup.Military rule is popular with Thais who are tired of street protests and polarized politics, she said. \u201cI think there\u2019s a false normalcy now,\u201d she said.Political rancor has been pushed underground. The normally divisive and cacophonous process of passing an annual budget was dispensed with in a few hours this week when members of the National Legislative Assembly, most of whom are either current or retired soldiers, voted unanimously to pass it. Politicians \u2014 defined as anyone who has held a position in a political party in the last three years \u2014 are barred from membership in the assembly.Thongchai Winichakul, a professor of Southeast Asian history at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, says the junta is harnessing disdain for politicians and a yearning, among some Thais, for virtuous authoritarianism.\u201cBuddhist political philosophy has always featured an enlightened despot,\u201d he said.But Professor Thongchai predicts that ultimately the generals will be unable to manage the country, the second largest economy in Southeast Asia, and will meet resistance to their rule.\u201cPaternalistic dictatorship won\u2019t work anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cThe society is too complex.\u201d Previous military strongmen in Thailand operated during a time when the country was poor and agrarian, he said; Thais today are much more politically aware and demanding.General Prayuth has decreed an expansion of spending on railways and roads, and regularly makes pronouncements on matters well beyond the normal duties of a career soldier. In a recent speech he addressed the Ebola outbreak in Africa, trash management, begging syndicates, education, tourism, household debt and surrogacy.The military says its mission is to bring \u201chappiness back to the people\u201d and has announced a number of populist policies since coming to power, including a raise for civil servants, free movie tickets and putting World Cup soccer games on free television channels.General Prayuth, who gives weekly addresses to the country, speaks in a folksy style and often brushes off serious issues with attempts at levity. Unlike previous Thai military strongmen, he had a relatively low profile before becoming the chief of the army in 2010.Even a military officer who researched a book with him says he knows little about General Prayuth\u2019s career and personal life.\u201cVery few people know his background,\u201d said the officer, Col. Khajornsak Thaiprayoon, a lecturer at the Command and General Staff College in Bangkok who helped publish the book, \u201cThe Royal Thai Armed Forces and Non-Traditional Threats.\u201dA military spokesman said no r\u00e9sum\u00e9 was available for General Prayuth. The general does not appear to have ever served in battle, but he was instrumental in organizing the crackdown against protesters in Bangkok in 2010 that left more than 90 people dead.General Prayuth, who is 60, faces legally mandated retirement from the military next month; his appointment as prime minister will allow him to continue to lead the junta.Professor Surachart, the military expert, says the junta\u2019s acceptance by the public will depend in large part on whether the ruling generals keep their hands clean.\u201cThe big question is will they revert to the corrupt practices of the past,\u201d he said.Previous military strongmen in Thailand amassed staggering levels of wealth. The estate of Sarit Thanarat, who seized power in a coup in 1957 and ruled for six years, was valued at $140 million when he died, a sum equivalent to more than $1 billion in today\u2019s dollars. The general\u2019s fortune became public after 20 people who claimed to be his wives, mistresses and children sought legal action after his death.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Big Dreams at the Art Factory", "Date": "2014-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cMass MoCA has become a really important asset in North Adams,\u201d said Jamie Bennett, executive director of ArtPlace America, which awards grants to encourage such \u201ccreative placemaking\u201d pursuits around the country. Ripe for growth, Mass MoCA will now spread into nearly all corners of its 26-building campus. It will double its exhibition space to 260,000 square feet \u2014 more than DIA:Beacon\u2019s 240,000 square feet in Beacon, N.Y., and just shy of the total gallery space at the sprawling Los Angeles County Museum of Art. But the expansion will again test Mass MoCA, which has teetered several times before and since its opening in 1999. Most notably, the museum brushed with financial disaster in 2006, thanks to the exploding costs of a vast, unfinished installation by the Swiss artist Christoph B\u00fcchel. It blew past its $165,000 limit to about $385,000, driving the budget \u201cto the brink,\u201d Mr. Thompson said, when Mass MoCA had no endowment and no cash reserve. An ensuing dispute \u2014 Mr. B\u00fcchel charged that Mass MoCA had mismanaged the project and had allowed some people to see the work before completion, while the museum called his demands unreasonable and said he had abandoned the project \u2014 landed in court, and though the parties eventually settled, both sullied their reputations in the process.Since then, in some eyes, Mass MoCA has lost some of its appetite for risk. The expansion conceived by Mr. Thompson, aside from putting new pressure on the museum\u2019s small staff, $7 million annual budget and minuscule $3 million endowment (plus $12 million in reserves), may further challenge the museum\u2019s stated identity as \u201can experimental platform for art making.\u201d His plans call for Mass MoCA to devote half its exhibition space to art that already exists. More recently, alongside new works by artists like Teresita Fern\u00e1ndez and Darren Waterston, both now on view, Mr. Thompson has added galleries for works by contemporary masters. It started with a 25-year renewable venture with the Yale University Art Gallery that brought 105 of Sol LeWitt\u2019s large-scale wall drawings to Mass MoCA, uniting them in one spot for the first time on nearly an acre of wall space. One day last month, he showed off a second semi-permanent installation, which opened last September: three massive works by Anselm Kiefer borrowed from the Hall Art Foundation and installed in a renovated water tank building. The foundation paid for the revamping of the building, landscaping and most of the increased operating costs. \u201cWe would never have done it ourselves,\u201d Mr. Thompson said. \u201cWe focus on emerging and midcareer artists who want to make something large, and we like to fabricate the art with them. Kiefer has his own studio and doesn\u2019t need our help. But he found the spaces here to be very compelling.\u201d Together, the LeWitt and Kiefer exhibitions have muddied Mass MoCA\u2019s profile as a presenter of experimental art. Much of the public comes to see them. It was the Kiefer opening and the display of Xu Bing\u2019s \u201cPhoenix,\u201d two gigantic birds made of detritus, that pushed 2013\u2019s attendance far above the more typical 120,000 visitors. Critical reaction has been split. \u201cChristoph B\u00fcchel dragged Mass MoCA\u2019s name through the mud, but it still has a significant reputation,\u201d said Dean Sobel, director of the Clyfford Still Museum in Denver. \u201cThey are as interested in exploring the fringe and what\u2019s new as most significant contemporary art museums are in this country.\u201dBut some curators at those museums, while declining to speak on the record for collegial reasons, disagree. Among the words they used to describe Mass MoCA\u2019s curatorial program are \u201cless ambitious than it once was,\u201d \u201cmore middlebrow\u201d and \u201cgun shy.\u201d Michael Darling, chief curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, noted, though, that since the recession, many museums have focused more on artists with name recognition. \u201cThere\u2019s more wariness about taking on something too new or too experimental among us, including Mass MoCA,\u201d he said.Still, the artists Mass MoCA have selected credit it for allowing experimentation. Mr. Waterston, a painter, was invited to use a large wall as his canvas. Instead, he proposed \u201ca much more ambitious project, on a very different scale, requiring more resources and more space,\u201d he said. \u201cI was responding to the nature of Mass MoCA,\u201d he added, \u201cand the kind of projects it is known for, projects that otherwise would never be realized.\u201d The work he created, \u201cFilthy Lucre,\u201d is a reimagining of James McNeill Whistler\u2019s masterpiece of lavish decoration, \u201cHarmony in Blue and Gold: The Peacock Room,\u201d which was the subject of a major row in 1876 between Whistler and a Liverpool patron over style, content and money. Mr. Waterston concocted it as a dramatic ruin: warped bookcases, overturned ceramics, a melting mural. The favorable review in The Boston Globe said that the work \u201cghoulishly satirizes the extreme wealth exemplified by Gilded Age industrialists, and draws a clear line to today\u2019s 1 percent, buyers who snap up wildly expensive art on a whim and drive an overheated market.\u201d \u201cFilthy Lucre\u201d will travel next year to the Freer and Sackler Galleries of the Smithsonian Institution, which owns Whistler\u2019s \u201cPeacock Room.\u201d Mr. Waterston praised the \u201cincredible range of skills\u201d of the artisans that Mass MoCA employs, who were key in its fabrication. \u201cEven a huge institution like the Smithsonian could never have done it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it completely set me on a whole other trajectory. I\u2019m not just a painter anymore.\u201d Performers like David Byrne have also used Mass MoCA as a petri dish. Citing Mr. Byrne\u2019s \u201cHere Lies Love,\u201d his musical about Imelda Marcos, as an example, Mr. Thompson said, \u201cDavid called and asked to work out aspects of it here,\u201d which led to a five-night run there in June 2012. Will the expansion swamp that identity? It calls for little change in space and budget for performing and homegrown visual arts programs (music, dance and theater festivals, as well as six or seven special exhibitions a year). Instead, the 120,000 square feet of new gallery space will be filled with installations like Mr. Kiefer\u2019s. Mr. Thompson is talking with four potential partners \u2014 artists, foundations and collectors \u2014 and he insists that these deals, with most expenses paid by the partner, are a strength, not a weakness. \u201cThere are enough institutions that program their own voice,\u201d he said. \u201cMultiple voices, sometimes contrary voices, strike me as more interesting.\u201d Undoubtedly, state officials were encouraged to ante up for the expansion by this low-risk formula and North Adams\u2019s striking unemployment rate. Before Mass MoCA opened, it was seven times the state average, and at 8.1. percent this June, it was still higher than the 5.5 percent state rate. A bigger Mass MoCA, according to its own projections, is likely to draw 185,000 visitors a year, with many expected to linger in the area, spending money in hotels, restaurants and stores. To complete Mr. Thompson\u2019s plan, Mass MoCA must raise $30 million from private donors, about half for the museum\u2019s endowment. \u201cThe expansion is unquestionably good for the region and the community; the challenge is to pull it off,\u201d said Stephen C. Sheppard, director of Williams\u2019s Center for Creative Community Development. \u201cThey will need to connect with people who share their vision and who\u2019ll support it.\u201d State money will allow the expansion to begin, with the opening of new spaces, if all goes quickly, in 2016 \u2014 30 years after Mass MoCA was proposed.

But the Outback is a station wagon, clearly at odds with more frivolous transports we\u2019ve owned, which have included a 1971 BMW 2002, a 1984 Volkswagen GTI, a 1986 Toyota MR2 and the surprisingly entertaining 2000 Ford Focus ZX3 hatchback that our Subaru replaced. But relocating to the White Mountains of New Hampshire \u2014 to a house in a snow-prone region with a steep driveway \u2014 we concluded that the Outback was the perfect choice. Its 8.7 inches of ground clearance and all-wheel drive would also make traveling a rough, muddy road to go hiking or kayaking less worrisome. We consoled ourselves with the idea that the Outback, despite a name that suggested adventure, wasn\u2019t about fun but about getting someplace to have fun. It helped. A little.The 2011 Outback has been, nevertheless, a likable and comfortable tool, a conclusion widely shared in these parts. A parking lot in New Hampshire often looks like a meeting of an Outback club. But the 2011 does fall far short of engaging its driver, an issue remedied by the 2015 model.The latest Outback is the fifth generation of what is probably Subaru\u2019s most important vehicle. Last year the company sold about 425,000 vehicles in the United States; 118,000 of them were Outbacks. An example of the popular category known as crossovers \u2014 it\u2019s car-based but dressed in a sport-utility-vehicle disguise \u2014 the Outback\u2019s competition includes the Chevrolet Equinox, Ford Edge, Hyundai Santa Fe, Jeep Cherokee and Toyota Venza.All Outbacks have all-wheel drive. The least expensive version with a 4-cylinder engine costs $25,745, including an $850 destination charge. The most expensive is the 6-cylinder 3.6R Limited, at $33,845. The model I tested was the midrange 2.5i Premium with a 4-cylinder engine and a starting price of $27,845; Partial Zero Emissions Vehicle equipment added $300. The only option was a $2,195 package that included a sunroof, navigation and power rear lift gate, for a total of $30,340.Subaru says the 2015 model has new underpinnings, which it shares with the revised Legacy sedan. The appearance has been updated with a new grille, a windshield that\u2019s less upright and some smoother lines that lessen the appearance of its being bundled up in an unflattering winter coat. The overall length grew by 0.6 inches, to 189.6 inches. But the biggest change to the body is noticed on a rough road, where the Outback feels exceptionally solid compared with my weak-sister 2011 model. Subaru says it has increased the torsional stiffness \u2014 a measure of the chassis\u2019 resistance to twisting \u2014 by 59 percent, largely through the more generous use of high-strength steel.That\u2019s just one of the elements that contributes to making the new Outback more interesting to drive. Another is a reworked suspension. The third is steering that is quicker and has more weight, though still short on delivering a feel for the road. Body lean and upward motions are now far more tightly controlled. The vehicle is keener to head into a turn, and it doesn\u2019t demand fiddly steering corrections when that turn includes uneven road surfaces. If the driver is pushing too hard and overwhelms the grip of the front tires, the computer will briefly apply the brake on the front inside wheel to help tug the Outback back on course. 12 PhotosThe result is that the latest Outback is far more rewarding and confidence-inspiring to drive quickly, though it is hardly a sport wagon like the turbo Forester XT.There is a downside to the suspension work. On a rough road our 2011 is notable for its ability to soothe and smooth. The 2015\u2019s ride is significantly stiffer and there\u2019s more of a jolt when encountering broken pavement or tar expansion strips. The new Outback still has 8.7 inches of ground clearance, something appreciated in deep snow or on an unpaved road.As before, there\u2019s a choice of two engines. The 2.5-liter 4-cylinder has been extensively reworked, cutting noise and vibration and while improving fuel economy; output has increased to 175 horsepower, from 173. The 3.6-liter 6-cylinder \u2014 largely carried over from last year \u2014 is still rated at 256 horsepower. All models now use a continuously variable automatic transmission. Previously, a somewhat clunky 6-speed manual was available on the base model while the 6-cylinder had a 5-speed automatic. The 4-cylinder provides adequate acceleration thanks to the C.V.T.\u2019s quick response. Subaru claims a zero to 60 run of about 9.3 seconds, so this is not the vehicle for a quick pass on a mountain road, but it keeps up with traffic. The upside is that the fuel economy is impressive, particularly for a vehicle with all-wheel drive. The federal rating is 25 miles per gallon in town and 33 m.p.g. on the highway. That\u2019s an improvement over 2014 models of 1 m.p.g. city and 3 on the highway. Over some 400 miles, traveling two-lanes and Interstates, I averaged just better than 31 m.p.g. without any special effort to economize.Subaru says the 6-cylinder, also a boxer design, takes the Outback to 60 m.p.h. in 7.3 seconds. The fuel economy is rated at 20 m.p.g. city and 27 m.p.g. highway. That\u2019s better by 3 m.p.g. in the city, and 2 more on the highway, than last year.Inside, the first pleasant surprise comes when settling into the driver\u2019s seat and pulling the door closed. The interior door handle doesn\u2019t just have soft-touch plastic, it feels plush. That luxury feel is not carried over to the rest of the Premium trim, but the surroundings are handsome, including the weave of the cloth used on the seats. The basic controls are mostly intuitive, and there is adequate storage space. The cargo capacity behind the second row is rated at 35.5 cubic feet, an increase of 1.2 cubic feet. Subaru has also added more sound-deadening material so the Outback is quieter. Improvements to the 4-cylinder and continuously variable transmission also reduced vibrations and noise, making long trips less tiring.The 2015 Outback and its sedan sibling, the Legacy, received a Top Safety Pick+ rating in crash tests conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a research group financed by the insurance industry.\u00a0Like other automakers, Subaru offers a collision-prevention system. Called EyeSight, it uses forward-looking cameras to detect objects in the vehicle\u2019s path and automatically applies the brakes. Based on its tests, the insurance group gave EyeSight a rating of Superior. The least-expensive EyeSight comes on the Premium model and costs $1,695 as part of a package that also includes blind-spot detection and a power rear liftgate.After a week or so of driving the 2015, my wife, Cheryl, mentioned our 2011 and asked: \u201cDoes this mean we have the crummy one?\u201dWell, the 2015 Outback is significantly better in everything, from handling to fuel economy without surrendering its core role as practical all-weather transportation. Crummy might be a bit harsh, a criticism that would just make us feel bad about our years-ago choice, but the 2015 is much, much better. Advertisement"}

And now there is La Gar\u00e7onne: the physical manifestation of an almost decade-old clothing website for Francophile minimalists whose budgets and sartorial daring have graduated from Agn\u00e8s b. and A.P.C. to more-obscure brands like Vetements and A D\u00e9tacher.Online records show that on the eve of 2009, with the economy reeling like the Robert Downey Jr. character in \u201cLess Than Zero,\u201d I ordered a pair of Dickensian gray wool mittens by Ligne 6 Martin Margiela from the site. They weren\u2019t cheap, even at 70 percent off, and were soon consumed by moths.Maybe it was bourgeois of me then to consign them to the textile-recycling heap? For under bare light bulbs and bobbing Noguchi-style lanterns, the new store proudly showcases garments in various stages of intentional deterioration and distress, like a cream-colored pullover designed by Tsumori Chisato, which was peppered with jagged holes ($425).I can see how, if worn confidently by a particular sort of woman, this sweater may serve as comment on the ravages of our age (with a commensurate check to Doctors Without Borders, one might hope). But it would transform another sort of woman, a.k.a. me, into an ambulatory cat-scratching post.\u201cWatch me unravel,\u201d Weezer sang in \u201cUndone\u201d 20 years ago. \u201cI\u2019ll soon be naked, lying on the floor.\u201dMost of what\u2019s sold at La Gar\u00e7onne, though, suggests not grunge dishabille but a life of enviable polish, self-command and \u2014 contradictory though it may seem \u2014 studied indifference to material things.\u201cI\u2019m living out of a suitcase,\u201d a customer confided at the cash register, which looked like an espresso bar: stools pulled up, iPads atop, rack of magazines behind (the water offered was sparkling, as if to give the inflated transactions extra buoyancy). \u201cI\u2019m hoping to Uber.\u201d She was wearing not the summer\u2019s ubiquitous fedora but a bowler; shades of \u201cThe Unbearable Lightness of Being,\u201d the Milan Kundera novel that everyone was toting around after the sexy movie version came out in 1988.This is probably putting too fine a point on it, but I sensed something very late-1980s, generally, about La Gar\u00e7onne \u2014 not embroidered, Lacroix-y goofy pouf skirt late-\u201980s, but avant-garde, darkly arbitraging Michael Douglas late-\u201980s.

Then there were the drop-crotch lyocell carpenter shorts by R13 ($365), which I could not only not pull off, but also could not pull off fast enough. Having already passed through Hammer Time once with the gift from my aunt of a flowered, ruffled Kenzo two-piece, also prematurely consigned, I have no need to do so again.But I do hope to return to La Gar\u00e7onne.

Recessive from the street, it is quietly insinuating into its plush surrounding landscape: aspiring to solidity, if not impossible permanence.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "French Cabinet Is Dissolved, a Victim of Austerity Battles", "Date": "2014-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 The collapse of the French government on Monday exposed widening divisions both within France\u2019s leadership, and Europe more broadly, over austerity policies that many now fault for threatening to tip the eurozone back into recession.The dispute broke into the open when Mr. Vall\u2019s outspoken economy minister, Arnaud Montebourg, insisted in an interview over the weekend that austerity had gone too far. \u201cThe priority must be exiting the crisis, and the dogmatic reduction of deficits should come after,\u201d he told the newspaper Le Monde.He also took direct aim at the policies of Angela Merkel, the German chancellor. \u201cGermany is caught in a trap of austerity that it is imposing across Europe,\u201d he said.The cabinet reshuffle precipitated by those comments was the second major shake-up since Mr. Hollande took over the presidency in 2012. Since then, the French economy has been flat and Mr. Hollande has been dogged by some of the lowest approval ratings for a French president in decades.The government collapse did more than throw France\u2019s politics into disarray. It also bared the growing disagreement between France and Germany \u2014 Europe\u2019s largest economies \u2014 over whether Ms. Merkel\u2019s prescription of austerity threatened to turn a five-year euro crisis into a long-term malaise of low growth and high unemployment.The announcement in Paris coincided with a visit by Ms. Merkel to Spain, where she praised Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy for austerity measures that have included a freeze on public salaries and more flexible labor laws. While Mr. Rajoy credits the steps with restoring faint growth to Spain\u2019s economy, the changes have not been popular. During the visit, the chancellor was forced to delay a planned speech after throngs of protesters booed her.Asked about events in France, Ms. Merkel told reporters that she wished Mr. Hollande success, but declined to comment on French domestic politics. The tension with the French government, however, has been evident.In early August, after Mr. Hollande was quoted telling French reporters that a change in economic direction might be needed in Europe, a German government spokeswoman, Christiane Wirtz, crisply commented that the German government \u201csees no reason to undertake any correction in its policies,\u201d and certainly not because of \u201crather glib statements from Paris.\u201dLast week, Mr. Hollande acknowledged the problems his government faced, saying in an interview with Le Monde that austerity policies the country had been compelled to follow to meet the eurozone\u2019s budget deficit target had made it nearly impossible to achieve a recovery after six months of zero growth and more than a year of weak economic activity. The eurozone consists of the 18 members of the European Union that use the euro.As a result, he said, France will no longer try to meet a deficit reduction target this year, and may fall behind on deficit reduction next year as he seeks to put in place 50 billion euros worth of spending cuts he has already pledged to make through 2017. Mr. Hollande acknowledged that growth is so weak in France that it was unlikely to rebound any time soon.His warning that growth had been jeopardized was the most strident repudiation yet of the policies that Ms. Merkel and the union\u2019s bureaucrats insisted countries follow at the height of the euro crisis, when there was a palpable danger that the monetary union might break up.But a rising chorus of critics and economists now say that the austerity approach has left European governments little leeway to employ the kind of growth measures necessary to restore demand.Paul de Grauwe, a professor of political economy at the London School of Economics, said that the collapse of the French government underlined a split within France and Europe as a whole over whether austerity measures, coupled with structural changes, were enough to restore Europe\u2019s sagging economic fortunes.\u201cThe Merkel view has been discredited, not in Germany, but pretty much everywhere else,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are starting to see that the paradigm of the past three years is not enough. Confidence has not flowed and we are still waiting for growth.\u201dWhile Mr. Hollande and Ms. Merkel have tussled in the past over the future economic direction of Europe, the French news media, citing advisers close to Mr. Valls, said his anger was fueled in part by concern that Mr. Montebourg had crossed a line by voicing such strident dissent publicly and that he was threatening to upend a relationship with Germany that is considered the motor of European integration.\u201cIt\u2019s either him or me,\u201d Mr. Valls said to Mr. Hollande, according to Le Monde.A new government is to be formed on Tuesday and Mr. Valls is expected to remain as prime minister; Mr. Montebourg resigned on Monday and was expected to remain sidelined.The tension at the core of the eurozone comes after years of admonishments from Germany to rein in runaway debts and deficits. Those policies, pushed when the threat of the eurozone breaking up seemed urgent, are now blamed by many of Germany\u2019s neighbors for making it harder, rather than easier, to mend tattered balance sheets and to reduce high unemployment.The eurozone now faces the threat of sliding back into its third recession in five years, after the currency bloc failed to grow at all between April and June. By contrast, the United States economy is recovering and unemployment is declining.Even though Mr. Hollande had pledged to cap austerity, Mr. Montebourg suggested over the weekend that the president had already overreached with a plan to slash spending and raise taxes to reduce the nation\u2019s deficit. He also warned that if the French government did not shift course, it risked losing support to populist or extremist parties.The turmoil among the Socialists comes as the center-right is buffeted by a leadership crisis and as the far-right National Front is gaining ground and seeking to fill the electoral vacuum. Elsewhere in Europe, countries like Greece and Portugal, which adopted stringent austerity measures as conditions for receiving international bailouts, are still struggling to recover.Spain, whose government last year pledged to ease up on austerity, is only starting to see the return of some growth. In Italy, where the economy recently slid back into a recession, Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has also backed away from austerity and called on Ms. Merkel and other European leaders to make growth a priority.Ms. Merkel has acknowledged the European economy needs to grow faster. But she has maintained that countries cannot backslide on commitments to improve their financial balance sheets.France, like many other countries, was compelled to adopt some austerity measures at the height of the euro crisis, when financial markets punished countries with high debts and deficits through higher interest rates. Today, those rates have fallen sharply, but a growth rebound has still been slow in coming.David Jolly, Aurelien Breeden and Ma\u00efa de la Baume contributed reporting from Paris and by Alison Smale from Berlin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For a Career Guide, 42 Years of Soft Landings", "Date": "2014-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWorkstationRichard Bolles does not mince words. \u201cLet us put the matter simply and candidly,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe whole process of the job hunt in this country is Neanderthal.\u201dAccording to Mr. Bolles, now 87, the job-hunting process is still somewhat Neanderthal. But it is certainly less so because of \u201cParachute,\u201d which he continues to update annually. The book has sold more than 10 million copies and has been translated into 20 languages. If you roll all 40-plus editions together, it is the best-selling book ever published by Ten Speed Press (now owned by Random House). And it\u2019s still going strong. Mr. Bolles was kind enough to lend me his only copy of that 1972 edition, so I could compare it with the 2015 version, which came out this month. Then as now, the subtitle is: \u201cA Practical Manual for Job Hunters and Career Changers.\u201d Beyond that, I wondered what had stayed the same in the book. When I went through the 42-year-old copy, I was struck by how pertinent most of its advice still was. Yes, it contains references to \u201cpersonnel departments\u201d (even the newer name for those, \u201chuman resources,\u201d is starting to sound dated) and the wording may occasionally sound sexist to modern ears (\u201cYou must identify the man who has the power to hire you and show him how your skills can help him with his problems.\u201d)But three main points in the book still hold, as Mr. Bolles explained in a personal note he sent along with the book:\u25a0 The traditional job-hunting system is a numbers game that is \u201cheavily loaded toward failing the job hunter.\u201d\u25a0 A \u201ccreative minority\u201d has come up with nontraditional, highly successful methods of job hunting that involve choosing the places you want to work and approaching the people there who can hire you.\u25a0 Before choosing those places, job hunters must look inward, figuring out what they would most love to do \u2014 and where, geographically, they want to do it. Those three concepts are as relevant in 2014 as they were in 1972, as are the shock of rejection, the loss of self-esteem, and the depression that can result from a prolonged round of job hunting, which Mr. Bolles also covers. Those parts of the book have stayed the same because human nature doesn\u2019t change, he said. But many aspects of the most recent edition of \u201cParachute\u201d would sorely perplex readers from 1972. \u201cWhat is this Google he speaks of?\u201d they would ask, after reading Mr. Bolles\u2019s admonition that \u201cGoogle is your new r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\u201d And he peppers his commentary with references to LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter. At the same time, the book endures because Mr. Bolles \u201cfocuses not only on the job search process but the emotional and psychological side\u201d of job hunting, she said. \u201cWhether you searched for a job in 1984, 1994 or 2014, you were most likely confronted with similar issues.\u201d The first Ten Speed edition was a little over 200 pages; the book now comes in at more than 350, as Mr. Bolles continues to enrich and update it, expanding on concepts both universal and technical. Shortly after the first edition, he added a self-inventory to help people identify their skills, traits and preferences. The 1972 Ten Speed edition is actually not the very first version. Mr. Bolles self-published initially, printing out a limited number of copies at the Copy Copia in San Francisco. He illustrated it with lithographs he was able to obtain free. Held together by a flimsy plastic binder, it was originally a guide for clergy members who were losing their jobs in a changing economy. Mr. Bolles himself was in that group. An ordained Episcopalian minister, he was in his early 40s when he was laid off in 1968 from his job as pastor of Grace Cathedral in San Francisco. He then got a job as a minister to chaplains who served on university campuses in nine Western states. Many of the ministers\u2019 jobs, and church jobs in general, were being cut. The ministers said to him: \u201cYou\u2019ve been fired \u2014 tell us what to do,\u201d he recalled. The traditional route was to go back to school and retrain for work in another field, but that was not feasible for most of them \u2014 especially if they had families to support.Mr. Bolles did not know what to tell the ministers, but he did have a large travel budget. So he toured the country doing research on the realities of job hunting, and wrote up the results. Then he began devoting himself to the book full time. That\u2019s been his job ever since. (About that catchy, enigmatic title: When he was first gathering information for the book, he would hear people say that \u201cthey were ready to bail out\u201d of their jobs. At one point he playfully responded, \u201cWell, then, what color is your parachute?\u201d) Somehow \u2014 he says he does not know how \u2014 the crude-looking manual ended up in the hands of people at the Pentagon, General Electric and other organizations, and he started getting orders from non-ministers. And Phil Wood, founder of Ten Speed Press, approached him about adapting his 128-page guide for the general public. After that, it hit the best-seller lists. Mr. Bolles has followed his own advice, by pursuing what he most loves to do. After making one momentous career change in midlife, he has continued working long past the age when most people have retired. He says his work is not repetitive, as there is always so much more to learn. He sometimes changes the structure of the book from one year to the next to keep things interesting, he said. Married to his fourth wife, with four children and 10 grandchildren, he lives in Danville, Calif., not far from where he once served as a minister. The proceeds from \u201cParachute,\u201d he acknowledged, have allowed him to live well. But that isn\u2019t the main reason he keeps revising the book, and giving talks about it, year after year, he said. As he wrote in the note he sent me with the 1972 book: \u201cThis work \u2014 revising, rewriting, updating and teaching the book each year \u2014 is now my life, and my reason for being on Earth.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Political Mischief in the Philippines", "Date": "2014-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialPresident Benigno Aquino III of the Philippines is now hinting at running for a second term in 2016, which would require a constitutional amendment. He has also suggested limiting the power of the Supreme Court, which, on July 1, declared parts of Mr. Aquino\u2019s economic program illegal. That, too, would require adjusting the Constitution. These threats jeopardize Philippine democracy.Mr. Aquino wants more time to complete his reform programs, but there will always be unfinished business. The 1987 Constitution limits the president to a single six-year term. The Constitution was promulgated under his mother, Corazon Aquino, after the overthrow of the 20-year dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos. Despite her efforts, the presidency remained a fount of patronage and a source of corruption. Mr. Aquino\u2019s two immediate predecessors, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo and Joseph Estrada, were charged after they left office with illegally feeding from the public trough. Ms. Arroyo was charged with misusing state lottery funds. Mr. Estrada was removed from office and convicted of various corruption charges, but he was pardoned in 2007. Mr. Aquino believes that the Supreme Court has grown too powerful and that someone needs to reassert executive authority. By a 13-to-0 vote, the court struck down a spending program he created to stimulate the economy. It ruled that he had exceeded his authority in disbursing funds and that parts of the program consisted of irregular pork-barrel spending. Mr. Aquino came to power in 2010 vowing to rid the Philippines of corruption. At that time, the country ranked 134th in Transparency International\u2019s corruption index. In 2013, it ranked 94th. Mr. Aquino should uphold the Constitution of a fragile democracy if only out of respect for his father, who was assassinated in the struggle against Marcos, and for his mother, who died in 2009 after leading the \u201cpeople power\u201d that triumphed over the excesses and abuses of the presidency. In practical terms, that means he should stop butting heads with the court and gracefully step down when his term is up.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo to Be Split Up in Rescue by Portugal", "Date": "2014-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe troubled lender Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo will be shut down, and its healthy businesses transferred to a new bank, as part of 4.9 billion euro rescue plan financed primarily by the Portuguese government, European and Portuguese officials said early on Monday. While the Portuguese government will provide most of the money for the rescue in the form of a loan, the heaviest losses will be absorbed by Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo shareholders and some creditors. The plan will serve as an early test of new European rules intended to make sure that investors, and not just taxpayers, most directly deal with the fallout when banks fail. With total assets of \u20ac76.6 billion, or about $103 billion, at the end of March, Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo is nowhere near large enough to rank among the eurozone\u2019s largest banks. Still, the rescue will be costly for a country that emerged from an international bailout only months ago. Problems at Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo, undone by its exposure to its struggling corporate parent, also raise questions about what other troubles may still lurk in the European banking system. In another recent bank failure, Corporate Commercial Bank in Bulgaria closed on June 20 after a three-day run in which some $700 million \u2014 about a fifth of the bank\u2019s deposits \u2014 was withdrawn. The announcement early on Monday came just days after the Bank of Portugal, the country\u2019s central bank, had offered assurances that Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo could raise enough money from private investors to recover from a first-half loss of \u20ac3.58 billion. On Monday the Bank of Portugal portrayed the rescue as being paid for by the country\u2019s bank resolution fund, which is bankrolled by financial institutions. The government will loan the fund \u20ac4.4 billion of the \u20ac4.9 billion cost of the bailout, however. Eventually, the new bank will be sold in an attempt to recover the taxpayer loan. The European Commission, which approved the plan, said it complied with new rules intended to minimize the cost to taxpayers while preventing disruption to the financial system. As part of the rescue plan, the bank\u2019s sound assets \u2014 including deposits and loans that are likely to be repaid \u2014 will be moved into a so-called bridge bank to be renamed Novo Banco, according to a statement released by Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo. The bank\u2019s problem assets will remain with the existing bank, which will be shut down over time. Shareholders in the old bank, as well as creditors who agreed to accept more risk, may well lose all of their money. That group includes the Esp\u00edrito Santo Financial Group, one of the holding companies of the Esp\u00edrito Santo family, which has been a dominant force in the country\u2019s economy for decades and is blamed for the bank\u2019s troubles. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, one of France\u2019s biggest lenders, is also a major shareholder. So-called senior creditors whose contracts gave them greater privileges will retain claims on the new bank and stand to recover at least a portion of their money. Vitor Bento, an outsider favored by Portugal\u2019s central bank, was recently named the top executive at Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo and will serve as the head of Novo Banco. The Bank of Portugal said customers would be able to conduct transactions normally, and employees of the bank will be transferred to the new entity, which will retain the company logo. \u201cFor our customers and staff only one thing has changed \u2014 their bank is now stronger and safer than it was before,\u201d Mr. Bento said in a statement. \u201cThe key uncertainties that have been hanging over the institution for some time have now been removed.\u201dAfter Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo reported a big loss, Portugal\u2019s central bank said it would push for legal action against directors involved in any fraudulent activities. Regulators are investigating possible accounting fraud and abuse of privileged information by the Esp\u00edrito Santo family. Portuguese and other authorities have been investigating potential accounting fraud and abuse of privileged information in Portugal, Luxembourg and other financial centers used by the Esp\u00edrito Santo family, which has run the bank for generations. The family\u2019s interests span finance, property, energy and health care assets in Portugal, Brazil and other countries.The bailout is a setback for Portugal just months after the country emerged from a \u20ac78 billion, three-year bailout financed by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. The country was one of those hit hardest in the eurozone debt crisis, but it won plaudits from its creditors for cleaning up its public finances and bringing its economy out of recession.The near-collapse last week of Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo, one of Portugal\u2019s largest lenders, unnerved investors, but it appears that Portugal will be able to afford the rescue.Portugal has sufficient reserves, about \u20ac15 billion over all, according to a recent report by Moody\u2019s Investors Service, the credit rating agency. Portugal still has available just over half of the \u20ac12 billion that was allocated to rescue banks, as part of the \u20ac78 billion international bailout.In fact, during the Portuguese crisis, Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo was the only major listed bank not to ask for any rescue funding. The decision was seen at the time as a sign of solidity, but has more recently raised suspicions that the bank did not ask for help because it was \u201cdoing everything possible not to open their accounts,\u201d said Antonio Roldan Mones, an analyst at the Eurasia Group in London.Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo\u2019s \u20ac3.58 billion loss for the first six months of 2014 was the largest ever for a Portuguese bank.The bank\u2019s stock has been under pressure since late May, after the disclosure that an audit by the Bank of Portugal found that Esp\u00edrito Santo International was in \u201cserious financial condition.\u201dBut its problems became far clearer in early July, after one of the family\u2019s companies failed to pay back a loan on schedule, in that way also revealing a convoluted corporate structure in which the bank was used by the Esp\u00edrito Santo family to extend loans to prop up shaky industrial assets.The European Commission was \u201cclosely monitoring\u201d the situation and was in touch with the Portuguese authorities, a spokesman said on Sunday. A spokesman for the European Central Bank, which will assume overall responsibility for overseeing eurozone banks in November, declined to comment.In July, Ricardo Esp\u00edrito Santo Silva Salgado, the family patriarch and former head of Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo, was arrested and ordered to post bail of \u20ac3 million as part of a money-laundering and tax evasion investigation.His arrest came only days after he stepped down from the bank. Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo provides something of a preview of what may happen in October when the European Central Bank discloses the results of an exhaustive review of bank holdings in the eurozone. The review is intended to uncover precisely the kind of hidden problems that have undone Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo.The central bank review is expected to expose an unknown number of other banks with problem loans or other woes that they have failed to disclose to regulators or shareholders. There has been concern that the central bank\u2019s findings could destabilize the eurozone financial system. The European Union still lacks a comprehensive system for dealing with troubled banks, meaning countries must finance their own bailouts.Raphael Minder contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Soaking Up Catalina, Tourists Pose a Dilemma", "Date": "2014-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe plan worked. Tourists have been flooding off ferries here in near-record numbers this year.There is just one problem: Catalina is quickly running out of water, a situation that is threatening to curtail the island\u2019s economic resurgence.With the island\u2019s reservoir approaching a record low, draconian conservation measures are going into effect. Starting this week, every business and home will be required to cut water use by 25 percent.While several other communities in California face a more imminent danger of the taps running dry, Catalina is in a unique position because of the tourist economy here. With about one million visitors a year, the amount of water that the island requires each summer is many times more than what its 4,000 full-time residents consume. And strict water rationing may imperil the island\u2019s viability as a summer destination: Already, tourists have been feeling the drought\u2019s squeeze on Avalon, the island\u2019s only city.Signs in hotel rooms beg guests to keep showers brief. Some restaurants are beginning to serve food on paper plates to reduce dishwashing. When customers ask for water, they are offered bottled water for 50 cents. Hotels plan to start sending some of their sheets and towels to be laundered on the mainland, a huge expense.If the drought continues into next year, even these measures may not be enough. By spring, a 50 percent reduction in water use could be mandated. At that point, hotels would be likely to close some rooms, and jobs here would begin to evaporate.Unlike cities on the mainland, about 22 miles away, Catalina cannot simply pipe in water from elsewhere. Instead, the island offers a sobering glimpse of the sacrifices, both personal and economic, that are necessary to survive in California without imported water \u2014 a prospect that more California communities may have to face as the population continues to grow and the climate gets even drier.\u201cWe think we\u2019re ahead of what a lot of California will have to deal with in the future,\u201d said Ben Harvey, the city manager of Avalon, where almost all of the island\u2019s residents live. \u201cPlease, come visit the island, but do you really need that shower? Go jump in our bay water.\u201dArranged around a glittering turquoise bay, Avalon has been a popular summer getaway for Southern Californians since William Wrigley Jr., the chewing-gum mogul, bought the island in 1919 and Hollywood stars like Charlie Chaplin became frequent visitors.Potable water has always been a problem; a century ago, it was barged over from the mainland. Currently, about a quarter of the island\u2019s summer water supply comes from a seawater desalination plant, a dependable but very expensive source that opened in 1991. The rest comes from groundwater wells.Residents already pay up to five times more per gallon than their counterparts in Los Angeles. And they have complained that Southern California Edison, the utility company that controls water here, has not done enough to accommodate the island\u2019s growth.\u201cThere has been a real outcry about Edison,\u201d said Ann Marshall, the mayor of Avalon. \u201cThey should have done more to keep up with the population,\u201d which has more than doubled since 1970.Ron Hite, Edison\u2019s district manager for Catalina, said that on an island, planning for a drought as extreme as this one would have been all but impossible.\u201cWe\u2019re isolated from any other resource, unlike our counterparts on the mainland, which have aqueducts,\u201d Mr. Hite said. \u201cWe built infrastructure to plan for recurring drought, but not for the most severe drought in 120 years.\u201dA reprieve may be on the way: a deeper well, which can tap water in the island\u2019s bedrock that has so far been out of reach. But it will not be completed for months or even years. In the meantime, Catalina residents, most of whom work in tourism, have taken to counting every drop of water they use. Most turn off the water while they are soaping up in the shower. Their cars have gone unwashed for months.Getting tourists to cut back can be more difficult. Aggressive conservation does not exactly make for a relaxing vacation, and businesses have tried to shield them from the water restrictions so they will keep coming back.Mariella Zapata, who recently visited the island with her family, said the manager at their rental property had asked them to shower \u201cfor like a minute.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying,\u201d Ms. Zapata, 55, said. \u201cBut we cannot take one-minute showers.\u201dLocals spoke with ire of watching tourists carelessly waste water.\u201cWhen they come back from the beach with their kids, they\u2019ll just hose them off outside for however long,\u201d said Susanna Savitt, 16, a high school student who has grown up here. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of annoying.\u201dThis summer, Susanna has an internship working for the island\u2019s nature conservancy, which holds the rights to most of its land. Her co-workers, she said, have had to set out crates of water for the local bison, which were brought here for a movie shoot in the 1920s and have roamed the interior ever since.\u201cThey can\u2019t drink out of the lakes because they\u2019re all dry now,\u201d she said.Just about everyone on the island agrees that, over the long term, another water source is needed, even if rain this winter ends the strict water restrictions. Until then, just about all new construction will remain on pause. A new hotel with a swimming pool, for example, could be built only if the owner reduces water elsewhere by the same amount.But residents disagree fiercely about where that water should come from, or how much more growth should be allowed.Randy Herrel, the chief executive officer of the Santa Catalina Island Company, which owns most of the developable land on the island, said Avalon needed to keep developing new attractions for tourists. More desalination, he said, would be the answer.Maps and charts updated weekly show the latest extent of the drought in the United States.\u201cWe\u2019re at an advantage because we\u2019re an island,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have access to unlimited amounts of water, and we\u2019re not dependent on Northern California or the rain. We may have a better opportunity to provide water for the future than places like Riverside or Bakersfield,\u201d both inland cities in Southern California.Aside from bringing water over from the mainland by barge, desalination is the most expensive option. Mayor Marshall said the city was looking at other alternatives, including treating wastewater, a process commonly known as toilet-to-tap.\u201cThere are local people who cannot continue to pay an exorbitant rate for water while they\u2019re cleaning hotel rooms and washing dishes,\u201d she said.Margaret Bray, who owns two restaurants here with her husband, credited the recent development boom with reviving their business. Still, she said, developers need to proceed more carefully from now on, at least until the island has a more secure water supply.\u201cI think we need to put a moratorium on all the construction that\u2019s going on, especially the construction that includes many, many, many pools, which we don\u2019t need right now,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat happens if the wells dry up and all those new buildings are here now?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ukraine Tensions Depress an Already Falling Market", "Date": "2014-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe stock market fell sharply on Tuesday over new concerns that tensions could flare between Russia and Ukraine.The market had been moderately lower all day, depressed by a disappointing earnings forecast from Target and a report showing China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, slowing.The selling accelerated in afternoon trading. At one point, the Dow Jones industrial average fell nearly 200 points, but it recovered some of its losses in the last 30 minutes of trading.Several traders pointed to news reports of a buildup in Russian troops on the Ukraine border and a Polish politician\u2019s comments that Russia was poised to invade or pressure Ukraine\u2019s eastern border as catalysts for the selling.The United States and Europe last week imposed stiffer sanctions on Russia. On Tuesday, Russia called for a meeting of the United Nations Security Council to discuss the Ukraine situation.The tensions were \u201coutweighing any good economic data\u201d investors had to work with Tuesday, said Tom di Galoma, a bond trader at ED&F Man Capital.The Dow lost 139.81 points, or 0.8 percent, to 16,429.47, its lowest level since mid-May. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index dropped 18.78 points, or 1 percent, to 1,920.21. The Nasdaq composite index fell 31.05 points, or 0.7 percent, to 4,352.84.The tensions between Russia and Ukraine have been a headache for investors for months. But the stakes are rising, investors say.Europe\u2019s recovering economy is dependent on Russian natural gas for heat and electricity, and winter is several months away. Germany imports nearly all of its supply from Russia, and France also satisfies much of its energy needs from Russia.\u201cEurope\u2019s economy is far more exposed to Russia than the U.S.,\u201d said Randy Frederick, a managing director at Charles Schwab.Tuesday\u2019s losses add to what has been a tough couple of weeks for the market. The S.&P. 500 fell 2.7 percent last week, its worst five-day performance since June 2012. While the market recovered some on Monday, Tuesday\u2019s losses wiped out those gains, leaving the Dow and S.&P. 500 lower for the week.Investors did get two positive reports on the American economy.The Institute for Supply Management said the nation\u2019s services sector expanded in July at the fastest rate in more than eight years, the latest sign of an economy gaining speed in the second half of the year. Its index came in at 58.7, versus the 56.5 economists had predicted. Any figure above 50 indicates expansion. The survey covers businesses that employ 90 percent of the work force, including retail, construction, health care and financial services companies.Meanwhile, June factory orders also rose more than expected, the Commerce Department said, rising 1.1 percent compared with the 0.6 percent increase economists had forecast. The increase was led by rising demand for aircraft, industrial machinery and computers and electronics.Among individual stocks, Target dropped $2.67, or 4.4 percent, to $58.03 after the company lowered its second-quarter earnings forecast. Target said the huge data breach it experienced last year was costing far more than previously expected. Consumers remain cautious about shopping at the store, Target said.In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.49 percent, from 2.48 percent late Monday, while its price dipped 1/32, to 100 3/32.Advertisement"}

He says most farmers are staying in business with federal subsidies or foundation grants.\u00a0His solution?\u00a0Forgive farmers their college debts, start programs to enable farmers to buy land, guarantee affordable health care and subsidize family farms instead of factory farms.I\u2019m happy to report that many young farmers are making a good financial go on their enterprises by following protocols completely the opposite of Mr. Smith\u2019s assumptions and solutions.We view government help and programs, from health care to land acquisition, as bringing more harm than good and enjoy a can-do libertarian spirit. We don\u2019t want subsidies for anybody, including ourselves. The writer is a lecturer and the author of \u201cYou Can Farm.\u201d To the Editor:Bren Smith argues that \u201cthe much-celebrated small-scale farmer isn\u2019t making a living\u201d and expresses concern that these farmers can\u2019t afford health care and other services.While many smaller farms don\u2019t make money, these farmers are generally doing well. They earn substantial off-farm income, and as a result, don\u2019t look to their farms for their livelihoods.Parents should let their children grow up to be farmers, but as with any industry, there\u2019s no guarantee that every business model is going to be profitable. The writer is a research fellow in agricultural policy at the Heritage Foundation.To the Editor:Bren Smith issues a clarion call for farmers to start their own organizations and set the agenda of the food movement. But making the economics of small-scale farming work will take more than that.In my experience in starting farmers\u2019 markets in New Haven, farmers want to focus on farming \u2014 and as Mr. Smith points out, theirs is challenging work.The onus is better placed on all of us as eaters to support healthy, local food and the viability of the local farm economy through policy change aimed at the root causes of our unsustainable food system. We can vote with our forks and also at the ballot box, and elect policy makers who promote family farming.As the food movement grows up, there will continue to be more of us who understand the issues on the ground and who can use the tools of law and policy to address them. Law schools across the country, including Yale, have been devoting resources to the study of food law in the service of doing just that. The future is bright. To the Editor:Bren Smith got it right in advocating that small-scale farmers growing for local markets work to shift subsidies from factory farms to family farms, among other sensible measures.I\u2019m one of those struggling farmers selling fresh, nutritious produce for less than the cost of my labor, a form of self-exploitation fostered by the prevailing cheap food policies. We can\u2019t change things alone.Foodies are going to have to pay a lot more for sustainably produced food and join broad coalitions to make it affordable to the disadvantaged. Last Saturday, my customers were paying twice the going rate for unusual garlic varieties. It keeps me farming, just barely.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Theory on Long-Term Economic Trends and a Sudden Crash", "Date": "2014-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Great StagnationThe paper, presented Friday morning at the annual gathering of economists and central bankers at Jackson Hole, Wyo., argues that the share of Americans with jobs has declined because the labor market has stagnated in recent decades \u2014 fewer people losing or leaving jobs, fewer people landing new ones. This dearth of creative destruction, the authors argue, is the result of long-term trends including a slowdown in small business creation and the rise of occupational licensing.\u201cThese results,\u201d wrote the economists Stephen J. Davis, of the University of Chicago, and John Haltiwanger, of the University of Maryland, \u201csuggest the U.S. economy faced serious impediments to high employment rates well before the Great Recession, and that sustained high employment is unlikely to return without restoring labor market fluidity.\u201dTheir findings contribute to the growing genre of papers that purport to show that the weakness of the American economy is caused largely by problems that predate the recession \u2014 and that the Federal Reserve can\u2019t remedy them with low interest rates.One of the clearest measures of the economic malaise is that the share of American adults with jobs fell from 62.7 percent at the end of 2007 to 58.3 percent at the end of 2009, and that it has since rebounded only slightly to 59 percent as of July.At the same time, those who do have jobs are more likely to stay put. The high-profile change in the number of jobs that the government reports each month is a tally of the larger numbers of jobs created and eliminated. In recent decades, that churn has steadily declined. So has movement by workers among existing positions. The net effect is that the share of workers either leaving a job or taking a new one has steadily declined from about a third of the total number of workers in the 1990s to about a quarter of workers last year.The basic idea at the heart of the paper is that the lack of churn in the labor market is making it harder for younger people to find jobs, and those who don\u2019t are more likely to remain outside the labor force\u201cThose who seek work are likely to find a suitable job in a fluid labor market,\u201d the authors write. \u201cThey then travel a path that involves human capital accumulation, strengthening their attachment to employment. In contrast, some marginal workers fail to find suitable employment quickly in a labor market characterized by reduced fluidity. So their market-relevant human capital depreciates, and their attachment to work weakens. These effects are likely to operate with particular force for younger worker, for whom labor market experience or its absence can powerfully influence whether they follow a path characterized by \u2018specialization\u2019 in market work or alternative nonmarket uses of time.\u201dOr more pithily, \u201cJoblessness today begets joblessness in the future.\u201dThe paper says that a 1 percentage point decline in the churning of the labor market lowers the employment rate by 0.77 of a percentage point, a huge effect. For the most vulnerable workers \u2014 young men who don\u2019t complete high school \u2014 the employment rate drops by 1.44 points.Mr. Davis and Mr. Haltiwanger attribute some of this decline to the aging of the work force; as people get older, they tend to change jobs less frequently. The decline in the creation of new companies is also playing a role. In effect, companies are getting older, too. This has been particularly pronounced in the retail sector, where giants like Walmart and McDonald\u2019s offer relatively stable employment.The paper argues that economic policy also plays an important role. The cost of training workers has increased, partly because the share of all workers who require government licenses has grown by one estimate from about 5 percent in the 1950s to 29 percent in 2008. This discourages hiring. So do legal changes that have made it more difficult to fire employees, the paper says. It also mentions health insurance as a reason that employees may stay put.In the view of Mr. Davis and Mr. Haltiwanger, the recession just made a bad situation worse.The economy clearly had problems before the crisis. Indeed, those problems contributed to the crisis.But economists and policy makers will have to reconcile the assertion that these trends were the dominant factors with the reality that the employment rate rose in the years before the recession, then dropped sharply during the recession.The new paper, like others of its genre, basically requires belief in a big coincidence: that a short-term catastrophe happened to coincide with the intensification of long-term trends \u2014 that the economy crashed at the moment that it was already beginning a gradual descent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chrysler\u2019s Quarterly Income Rose 22 Percent", "Date": "2014-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFew could have predicted that five years after Chrysler and General Motors tumbled into bankruptcy and were bailed out by the federal government, it would be Chrysler surging in profits while G.M. struggled.But that is what happened in the second quarter, as Chrysler, the smallest of the three major Detroit automakers, had double-digit growth in its profits \u2014 earning more money than G.M. for the first time in recent memory.Chrysler said on Wednesday that net revenue for the quarter was $20.5 billion, up a striking 14 percent from a year ago. That was largely driven by sales of its Ram pickups and Jeep brands, which benefited from strong demand as sport utility vehicles continued to enjoy a renaissance among consumers. Chrysler\u2019s global sales rose 12 percent for the quarter, and in July, Jeep sales alone were up 41 percent, their best such month ever.Analysts said that the bets Chrysler had made in recent years, like making Ram its own brand and introducing the Cherokee, a smaller S.U.V., were paying off.\u201cThey really have everything moving forward in the right way,\u201d said Karl Brauer, a senior analyst with Kelley Blue Book. \u201cThey\u2019ve positioned themselves extremely well over the last two years, and we\u2019re seeing the results of that now.\u201dSergio Marchionne, chief executive of both Chrysler and Fiat, said more growth was ahead for Chrysler \u2014 particularly internationally \u2014 now that the company can leverage Fiat\u2019s distribution channels overseas. Mr. Marchionne, in a conference call, called Chrysler\u2019s previous international efforts haphazard, and said Fiat\u2019s networks were already bearing fruit for Chrysler.But Mr. Marchionne acknowledged that he was \u201cgrossly dissatisfied\u201d with the profit margin Chrysler vehicles like Jeeps earned in the United States last quarter, as heavy discounting on older models cut into profits. Increases in sales volume combined with higher selling prices of more popular models outweighed those discounts to power Chrysler to its 22 percent increase in net income.\u201cIt\u2019s something we need to control as we go into the second half because our sales performance is very strong and I think there\u2019s some potential for us to focus a little bit more on margins,\u201d he said.Wednesday\u2019s earnings report was another sign that Chrysler will continue to be the profit engine that powers Fiat, which has struggled along with the sputtering European economy.Mr. Marchionne fended off questions about jittery investors who have driven Fiat\u2019s stock price down this week on the Milan Stock Exchange over concerns that the Fiat-Chrysler merger may run into trouble. Fiat shareholders gave their approval last week to formally combine Chrysler and Fiat into a single corporation, to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Doing so would give the company access to the lucrative capital markets in the United States. The new company itself will be based in London and registered in the Netherlands.But current Fiat shareholders can choose to cash out rather than own shares in the new company. They have until Aug. 20 to decide. Fiat is authorized to spend 500 million euros ($670 million) for such merger costs. Mr. Marchionne said speculation that too many shareholders might cash out was being overplayed.With Fiat now the full owner of Chrysler, the shareholder issue would not affect the actual joint operations. Mr. Marchionne said the companies were \u201cpart of one single economic entity.\u201d \u201cThat party was over on Jan 1, 2014,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed\u2019s Goldilocks Economy Just Right for Stock Investors", "Date": "2014-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesTwo decades ago the notion of a Goldilocks economy was very much in vogue. It was a snappy way of saying that the economy was growing at a nice, steady pace \u2014 fast enough to create jobs but not so rapidly that it would lead to runaway inflation. Much the same could have been said these days, though Goldilocks hasn\u2019t been invoked all that often to describe the recent environment. That may be because the Federal Reserve has been such a commanding presence that it has overshadowed everything else, Seth J. Masters, the chief investment officer of Bernstein Global Wealth Management, said in a telephone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s as though Goldilocks entered the house of the three bears and found the porridge was being heated in a big microwave oven,\u201d he said. \u201cSure, it\u2019s just the right temperature inside but there\u2019s a reason for it. It\u2019s hard not to focus on the microwave.\u201d For several years now, Paul Hickey, co-founder of the Bespoke Investment Group, has been calling the current setup the \u201cBernanke-locks economy,\u201d because, in his view, stimulative policies begun under Ben S. Bernanke, the former Fed chairman, created a pleasant environment for stock investors. And Mr. Hickey said last week that Wednesday\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting showed that those policies haven\u2019t changed under the current chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen.\u201cIf anything, she\u2019s more dovish than Bernanke,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Fed is still on the same track.\u201dWhatever you call it, the benign economic environment has supported a bull market since 2009, and though there were a few rocky days last week, the main market ingredients seemed to remain in place. For example, on Wednesday a government report on gross domestic product in the second quarter showed that the economy was growing smartly, even rapidly, at a 4 percent annualized rate; yet the Federal Reserve declared that inflation was low enough to allow the slowly moderating pace of its expansive monetary policy to remain on track. In a statement on Wednesday, the Federal Open Market Committee said the central bank would continue to ratchet down its bond purchases as planned, yet it also said its policies would \u201cmaintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative.\u201d The Fed already holds more than $4 trillion in bonds, up from less than $1 billion when the financial crisis started, and it\u2019s still buying more.\u201cThe Fed remains a very big player in the bond market, and it will continue to pull down interest rates for a long time,\u201d Bill Stone, chief investment officer at PNC Wealth Management in Pittsburgh, said in a telephone interview. The Fed also indicated that it expects to hold short-term rates near zero for \u201ca considerable time,\u201d even if the jobs picture improves. On Friday, the Labor Department reported that 209,000 positions were created in July \u2014 the sixth consecutive month in which the figure topped 200,000. That hadn\u2019t happened since 1997.In addition, although it\u2019s been rising lately, inflation remains within the 2 percent range that the Fed desires. The Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge \u2014 it\u2019s cursed with the bureaucratic name of \u201cthe core personal consumption expenditure deflator\u201d \u2014 rose at a 2 percent annual rate in the second quarter, up from only 1.2 percent and 1.3 percent in the two previous quarters. Furthermore, despite some disappointments, overall corporate earnings continue to outpace the domestic economy as well as most Wall Street expectations. As of Thursday, with 71 percent of the companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index reporting, more than 68 percent beat Wall Street estimates for the second quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, which projected that earnings per share grew at a 7 percent rate. Put all of that together and despite a 2 percent drop in the S.&P. 500 on Thursday, many analysts like the chances that the bull market in stocks will keep running. \u201cWe\u2019re cautiously optimistic,\u201d KC Mathews, chief investment officer of UMB Bank in Kansas City, Mo., said in an interview.While a market correction \u2014 a drop of 10 percent or more \u2014 wouldn\u2019t be a surprise, he said, he expects the market to keep climbing. \u201cEarnings are strong, interest rates are low, the economy is growing,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are problems, to be sure, but it seems likely that they can be managed.\u201dAmong those problems are stock valuations. One commonly used measure, the price-to-earnings ratio of stocks in the S.&P. 500, based on consensus earnings expectations, stands at 15.6, said Mr. Masters of Bernstein Global Wealth Management. Another common measure, the trailing 12-month P/E ratio, is 17.8, according to Bloomberg. Either way, those values are higher than they were five years ago, when stocks were something of a bargain, and the Fed said in mid-July that in certain pockets \u2014 biotech and small-cap stocks, for example \u2014 valuations are somewhat \u201cstretched.\u201dMr. Masters said that stocks are \u201cfairly valued,\u201d especially with interest rates so low. Bond prices, which move in the opposite direction of interest rates, are, conversely, extraordinarily high, he said, and stocks look comparatively good.\u201cStocks are extremely appealing because of bond yields and prices,\u201d he said.An unexpectedly sharp rise in inflation would upset this balance, however. To combat an inflation surge, the Fed would presumably need to raise interest rates abruptly, and the potential for stock market disruption would be high. In its statement last week, however, the Fed said, \u201cThere remains significant underutilization of labor resources\u201d in the economy \u2014 an indication that it believes that wage inflation is unlikely for some time. Then there\u2019s the ever-present possibility of a big external shock \u2014 say, a spiraling of oil prices set off by conflict in the Middle East, or a recession arising from a violent conflict of major proportions. \u201cWe can\u2019t predict the occurrence of things like that, of course,\u201d said Mr. Stone of PNC Wealth Management. \u201cThat\u2019s the definition of a \u2018black swan\u2019 event. You don\u2019t know it\u2019s coming. You want to be diversified and safe in your investments in any case. But at the moment, we don\u2019t see anything like that on the horizon.\u201d What are visible now are continuing global conditions that by historical standards are highly abnormal, and largely favorable for stocks. Interest rates aren\u2019t just low in the United States. They remain extraordinarily low in many parts of the world, thanks in part to the Fed and to central banks in Europe, Japan and other regions. In a note to clients last week, Scott Minerd, chief investment officer at Guggenheim Partners, said that fears of sharply rising interest rates in the United States are misplaced when 10-year government notes in Germany remain near 1 percent. With further turmoil around the world, interest rates in the United States could even move lower. And that could provide further steam for the American stock market. From this perspective, it\u2019s not just the Federal Reserve that has engineered a latter-day Goldilocks economy: It\u2019s a global phenomenon. And while conditions are far from perfect and surely won\u2019t last forever, they\u2019ve been awfully good for stock investors for a very long time. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Time Management: One-Year M.B.A.s", "Date": "2014-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreamline, accelerate, graduate. Educators have been scurrying to figure out how to cut short just about every field of professional study, be it law, medicine or business.Graduate business programs were first truncated in Europe in the late 1950s, half a century after the two-year degree was introduced by Dartmouth. But one-year M.B.A.s are only starting to catch on in the United States with cost- and time-conscious students.He believes this: \u201cYou get the exact same benefit as the two-year program \u2014 the same professors, the community, the G.B.S. network, all the on-campus resources and Goizueta brand \u2014 in less time and for less money.\u201dEnrollments are up 26 percent for Goizueta\u2019s program over last year. Cornell enrolled its largest one-year M.B.A. class on its Ithaca campus this year, and has opened a new program focused on the global digital economy at Cornell Tech in New York City. A long program was a concern when designing an M.B.A. for techies, said Douglas M. Stayman, associate dean for M.B.A. programs at Cornell\u2019s Johnson School of Management. \u201cThe tech economy moves quickly, and if people are out of it for a long time, it\u2019s an issue.\u201d (The one-year M.B.A. runs about $93,000 versus $116,000 for the two-year.)The Graduate Management Admission Council counts 189 one-year programs, compared to 173 four years ago, and 55 percent of them have reported increases in applications over last year.Proponents say a year is sufficient for students with strong quantitative or analytical skills who are willing to clear their schedules to study. Typically, students start in May, and cram in almost a year\u2019s worth of foundational business classes in four months. In September, they fall in with students who are in their second year of a traditional program, taking elective classes, joining industry-related and cultural clubs (essential for network-building), participating in case competitions and interviewing at companies. Students in the one- and two-year programs graduate as a class, with the same degree, the following May.The pace of the one-year degree \u2014 essentially completing three-quarters of the academic credits of a two-year degree in half the time \u2014 can limit the appeal. \u201cOne-year is for people who are accelerating their careers, not changing their careers,\u201d Mr. Stayman said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have time to do career exploration.\u201dEmployers interview during the fall, so students with five months of M.B.A. study under their belts are competing with students with 15 months, including an internship. One-year students need to have enough of a career history to make the case that they don\u2019t need that internship.The positive spin, said Alex Sevilla, assistant dean and director of Florida\u2019s M.B.A. programs: \u201cA student can say to a recruiter, \u2018I voluntarily chose the one-year program, and that gives you some indication of my horsepower.\u2019 \u201dAccording to G.M.A.C.\u2019s 2013 student poll, fewer job seekers from one-year programs (53 percent) had received offers by March than had students in the final year of two-year programs (61 percent). While one-year students reported an average 70 percent increase over pre-M.B.A. earnings, their earnings boost was 9 percent lower than what two-year students reported.There are other drawbacks. Students don\u2019t have time to spend a semester abroad. They forfeit some electives. They can join clubs but can\u2019t lead them (presidents are picked the spring before they arrive). And elite business schools like Harvard, Wharton and Stanford don\u2019t have one-year M.B.A.s. \u201cWe haven\u2019t felt comfortable offering a one-year M.B.A. here,\u201d said Madhav Rajan, who oversees Stanford\u2019s full-time M.B.A. program. \u201cI think there would be huge demand if we ever went that route, but given the content we want to disseminate, that\u2019s not something we\u2019ve pursued.\u201cYou get to know your classmates and interact with your professors over two years,\u201d Mr. Rajan said. \u201cThe whole notion of our M.B.A. is that it\u2019s a transformative experience.\u201d Samantha Stainburn is an education writer in New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sales of New Homes Fall, but Supply Is Growing", "Date": "2014-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Sales of new single-family homes fell for a second month in July, but a surge in the supply of properties on the market and slower price gains are expected to help stimulate demand in the months ahead.Other data on Monday showed activity in the nation\u2019s services sector slowed again in August. The reports, however, did little to change views the economy is on a solid growth path, given relatively strong job growth and manufacturing activity.\u201cThe housing market continues to recover,\u201d said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities. \u201cThe fundamentals of strengthening job growth and hopefully stronger wage gains are still favorable.\u201dThe soft July sales pace is at odds with other data that has suggested the housing market recovery is back on track after buckling in the second half of last year.Data last week showed an increase in home construction and increased confidence among home builders about future sales and buyer traffic. Sales of used homes hit a 10-month high in July.Economists took the new homes sales data with a grain of salt given it is highly volatile from month to month. Compared with July last year, new home sales were up 12.3 percent.Separately, the financial data firm Markit said its preliminary purchasing managers index on the services sector dipped to 58.5 this month from 60.8 in July. Still, the index remained well above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction, and it continued to mirror the strong gains seen in manufacturing.The reports suggested that economic growth would proceed at a steady clip in the third quarter, after bouncing back from a weather-related slump at the start of the year.A run-up in mortgage rates and a shortage of homes on the market that pushed up prices had cut into sales in the second half of last year, leading the Federal Reserve to express concern at the sluggish housing recovery.\u201cWe believe that ongoing volatility in housing will be one factor keeping the Fed from raising rates prematurely,\u201d said Gennadiy Goldberg, an economist at TD Securities.But housing inventory is picking up and home price appreciation is slowing. The inventory of new houses on the market increased to nearly a four-year high, helping to restrain prices.The median sales price increased 2.9 percent from a year earlier, a sharp slowdown from June, when prices were up 7.8 percent year-on-year.At July\u2019s sales pace it would take six months to clear the supply of houses on the market, the highest since October 2011.

{"Headline": "Nepal Enthralled by Visit of India Premier, Who Hits \u2018the Right Notes\u2019", "Date": "2014-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKATMANDU, Nepal \u2014 In a visit that has transfixed this impoverished country, the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, told Nepal\u2019s legislature on Sunday that its effort to write the nation\u2019s Constitution was a sacred process.\u201cYou are writing a treatise just like the rishis in the past wrote the Vedas and Upanishads,\u201d Mr. Modi said, referring to Hindu sages and the religious scriptures they wrote.The 50-minute speech, the first by a foreign leader before Nepal\u2019s legislature, the Constituent Assembly, was clearly intended to urge Nepal\u2019s leaders to finish the country\u2019s Constitution, delayed for years.Perhaps just as important, Mr. Modi avoided suggesting how Nepal\u2019s legislators should resolve their remaining controversies over how to delineate states, whether to empower a president or prime minister, and whether Hinduism should be declared the state religion. Nepal, like India, is majority Hindu. \u201cMy work is neither to give directive nor to interfere with your work in Nepal,\u201d Mr. Modi said, \u201cbecause Nepal itself is a sovereign nation.\u201dIndian and Nepali analysts praised Mr. Modi.\u201cHe hit all the right notes,\u201d said Manjeet Kripalani, executive director of the Indian Council on Global Relations. A deeply fractious country, Nepal has been unusually united in its embrace of Mr. Modi, the first Indian prime minister in 17 years to make a state visit here. Nepali and Indian flags fluttered throughout a warren of muddy streets in the capital, Katmandu, and large banners were hung across major intersections welcoming him. \u201cLong Live Nepal-India Friendship,\u201d they declared.When Mr. Modi stepped off his airplane, a 19-gun salute boomed over the city. He was greeted by an obviously ailing Prime Minister Sushil Koirala, who recently returned from treatment in the United States for lung cancer.Mr. Modi\u2019s visit has inspired unusual consensus here that Nepal set aside decades of mistrust and accept Indian offers to help develop Nepal\u2019s hydropower and tourism potentials. Such optimism has flowered before here only to be crushed by Indian indifference or Nepali mistrust, but there is real hope that this time will be different. Mr. Modi\u2019s campaign messages of economic development and good governance resonated strongly in Nepal, which has been deprived of both for decades. \u201cThis is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to begin fresh and build a level of trust that needs to be developed to define relations for the next 50 years,\u201d said Sridhar K. Khatri, former executive director of the South Asia Center for Policy Studies in Katmandu. A last-minute dispute over the wording of a major hydropower development agreement meant that the two sides signed only minor agreements on Sunday. But there is considerable hope that the power deal will materialize.\u201cHis visit has brought great hope,\u201d Ayush Shrestha, a 29-year-old marketing executive, said at a Katmandu restaurant. \u201cIt has led even our own political parties to sit down, put aside their differences and discuss the agenda with Modi.\u201d \u201cThe warm embrace Modi has received in Nepal raises the question of whether China is really the threat to India\u2019s influence that some feared,\u201d Ms. Kripalani said.Ruled for centuries by monarchs, Nepal has 125 ethnic groups, 127 spoken languages, scores of castes and three distinct ecosystems that have long divided its 27 million people into feuding communities, making political consensus difficult and hurting the country\u2019s economy.But nearly everyone seems exhausted by a continuing power crisis that leaves Katmandu mostly dark at night. A 1996 deal in which India was to build a massive dam in Nepal led to considerable political opposition at the time, but most of those who opposed that deal now advocate more such arrangements.\u201cEven the Maoists now acknowledge that we need to cooperate with India because we don\u2019t have the money on our own to develop our hydropower,\u201d said Prashant Jha, author of a book on contemporary Nepali politics.Before his speech, some analysts worried that Mr. Modi would urge Nepal to adopt a constitutional provision declaring the country a Hindu state, as royalist factions have advocated. An avowed Hindu nationalist, Mr. Modi is scheduled to visit the Pashupatinath temple, one of Hinduism\u2019s holiest places, on Monday, an arrangement made in part to coincide with a religiously auspicious day.In his speech, Mr. Modi described Nepal as a \u201cfederal democratic republic,\u201d dropping the \u201csecular,\u201d long a fraught word in Indian politics as well. But he did not call for explicit Hindu identification and said Nepal was \u201cthe birthplace of Lord Buddha.\u201dAll in all, Mr. Modi got high marks. \u201cModi is giving us a good moment,\u201d Bhekh B. Thapa, a former Nepali minister of foreign affairs and finance, said in an interview. \u201cWhether it will yield results, time will tell.\u201dBhadra Sharma contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When She Talks, Banks Shudder", "Date": "2014-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Admati\u2019s simple message is that the government is overlooking the best way to strengthen the financial system. Regulators, she says, need to worry less about what banks do with their money, and more about where the money comes from.Companies other than banks get money mostly by selling shares to investors or by reinvesting profits. Banks, by contrast, can rely almost entirely on borrowed funds, including the money they get from depositors. Ms. Admati argues that banks are taking larger risks than other kinds of companies because they use other people\u2019s money, and the results are that they keep crashing the economy.Her solution is to make banks behave more like other companies by forcing them to reduce sharply their reliance on borrowed money. That would likely make the banking industry more stodgy and less profitable \u2014 reducing the economic risks, the executive bonuses and, for shareholders, both the risks and the profits.\u201cMy comparison is to speed limits,\u201d Ms. Admati said in an interview near the Stanford campus. \u201cBasically what we have here is the market has decided nobody else should be driving faster than 70 miles an hour and these are the biggest trucks with the most explosive cargo and they are driving at almost 100 miles an hour.\u201dFor all her success in stimulating debate, however, Ms. Admati and like-minded critics face long odds. Since the financial crisis, the government has already required banks to reduce their reliance on borrowed money by increasing capital standards, which dictate the share of funding that must come from equity. Mr. Obama recently described that increase as massive, and officials are considering further increases for the largest banks. But the net effect is tiny in comparison to the change sought by Ms. Admati. Officials worry that larger changes would hamstring American banks, driving business both to other kinds of domestic financial firms and to foreign rivals.He compared the situation to a pair of parallel highways, echoing Ms. Admati\u2019s metaphor. \u201cIf you lower the speed limit on one highway, you\u2019ll have fewer accidents on that highway,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the other road will just get more crowded.\u201d\u201cThis is not fun,\u201d she said of her campaign. \u201cBut I know that this is a bad system. There is no justification for this \u2014 zero. The only reason we are staying where we are is that the status quo has staying power. And if we are stuck with the status quo, then we are going to have to suffer the consequences.\u201d\u2018Something Is Very Wrong\u2019Before the financial crisis in 2008, Ms. Admati spent most of her time working with complicated financial models. She had never paid much attention to banking or to public policy. But as the crisis unfolded, she began reading and talking with colleagues \u2014 \u201clike a doctor from another field of medicine visiting the emergency room,\u201d she said \u2014 and grew increasingly disconcerted by what she learned.Ms. Admati said she started asking one question repeatedly: Why were banks behaving so differently? Companies with more debt are more vulnerable to financial setbacks. Banks were in the danger zone, so why not raise more equity?Banking is the only industry subject to systematic capital regulation. Borrowing by most companies is effectively regulated by the caution of lenders. But the largest lenders to banks are depositors, who generally have no reason to be cautious because federal deposit insurance guarantees repayment of up to $250,000 even if the bank fails. This means the government, which takes the risk, must also impose the discipline.In the decades before the financial crisis, banks gradually convinced regulators to reduce capital requirements to very low levels. In the aftermath, banks acknowledged that some increases were necessary \u2014 they had just needed enormous bailouts, after all \u2014 but they fought to minimize those increases. The day after Ms. Admati\u2019s article ran, the same paper ran one by Vikram S. Pandit, then the chief executive of Citigroup, arguing that the proposed standards were excessive. \u201cThe last thing the global economy needs is another economic dampener,\u201d Mr. Pandit wrote.\u2018Add a Digit\u2019The industry\u2019s more serious argument is that equity is more expensive than debt. If governments require banks to raise more equity, the industry warns, the results would be higher interest rates, less lending and slower economic growth.Ms. Admati says large banks should be required to raise at least 30 percent of their funding in the form of equity, about six times more than the current average for the largest American banks. This would not affect the ability of banks to accept deposits; it would not even affect their borrowing from other sources. Instead, she says, banks should be required to suspend dividend payments, thus increasing their equity by retaining their profits, until they are sufficiently capitalized.\u201cThere is no more clear case of choosing the banks over the public than the payouts,\u201d she said of regulators\u2019 decisions to let banks resume dividend payments after the crisis. \u201cThey can tell you all day long they\u2019re working on \u2018too big to fail,\u2019 but while they\u2019re working on it they cannot allow banks to be getting closer to failure.\u201dShe freely concedes that there is no particular science behind her 30 percent equity figure. The point, she says, is that 5 percent is the wrong ballpark. The proper baseline, in her view, is what the market imposes on other kinds of companies.\u201cWe have too much belief that we can be precise,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t mean 20 percent. I don\u2019t mean 30 percent. I mean add a digit. I mean a lot more.\u201dAs she waited, she said she was glad that policy makers finally seemed to be listening. But, she said, she was frustrated by the lack of progress and not sure about how to press ahead.Then she excused herself and went to check once more to see if Senator Warren was available.An article last Sunday about Anat R. Admati, a Stanford finance professor who is seeking stronger regulation of banks, misstated the month in 2014 in which she debated banking issues at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. It was January, not February.Advertisement"}

The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index rose 4.91 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,986.51, fewer than two points below its record closing in late July.The Nasdaq composite index was mostly unchanged on the day, dipping 1.03 points, to 4,526.48.Many of the Fed\u2019s policy makers believe the nation\u2019s economy is improving enough that the bank should start considering when it is going to start raising short-term interest rates, according to minutes from the Fed\u2019s latest policy meeting.The debate on when the Fed should raise the rates, which have been near zero since late 2008, has intensified in recent months as the central bank scales back its other economic stimulus program.The Fed has been winding down its bond-buying program since December, and it is expected to end it completely before the end of the year. Despite worries that the Fed\u2019s exit might be a negative for the market, stocks have remained resilient. The S.&P. 500 is up 7.5 percent so far this year.Jonathan Corpina, a floor trader at the New York Stock Exchange with Meridian Equity Partners, said investors were prepared to see the Fed eventually raise interest rates. \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking about raising interest rates for so long, I don\u2019t think the Fed is going to surprise anybody when they finally do it,\u201d Mr. Corpina said.The Fed minutes prompted some investors to sell bonds. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.43 percent from 2.40 percent late Tuesday, while its price fell 7/32, to 99 17/32. On Friday, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, will give a speech at the central bank\u2019s annual conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo.

The company said the Ford and General Motors recalls had hurt its ability to have cars available for customers. Hertz also said its purchase of Dollar Thrifty was not saving as much money as originally hoped. J. M. Smucker shares fell $1.03, or 1 percent, to $102.42 after the food products company cut its full-year sales outlook. The company, which owns such coffee brands as Folgers, also said higher coffee prices were squeezing the company\u2019s profit margins.PetSmart shares rose 82 cents, or 1 percent, to $70.52 after the company said it was exploring a sale.

Their two daughters, Leah and Sophie, become third-culture kids whose conception of home is wherever their \u00adnuclear family happens to reside that year.Sonnenberg writes about expatriate life with an easy authority. She relays how the exoticism is reliably offset by locals routinely telling you what\u2019s wrong with the United States.

A house that longs for the family who once occupied it narrates the opening section. Sonnenberg introduces these stylistic conceits slyly, and when tragedy befalls the Kriegsteins, the conceits blunt the impact.

Sonnenberg knows expatriate families don\u2019t need the supernatural to engage in counterfactual speculation, as the bare facts of their shared life provide plenty of fodder for imagining a parallel universe.

This sets up an interesting contrast between the psychologies of mom and daughter: one never wanting to be fully known, the other never expecting to be found familiar. It is a dynamic that whets the appetite for what\u2019s to come in American expat literature \u2014 for a future in which Americans, perhaps no longer liberators insistent on a win, aren\u2019t assumed to be recognizable before they even get off the plane.

It was the third straight quarter of profit decline and Samsung\u2019s weakest results since the second quarter of 2012.Net profit was 6.25 trillion won, compared with 7.77 trillion won in the second quarter last year. Profit for the mobile division fell to 4.42 trillion won, from 6.28 trillion won a year ago, also the lowest in two years.Samsung was downbeat about its third-quarter prospects, and said that for its mobile division, it expected a decline in average sale price from the April-to-June period.\u201cConsidering intensifying competition of price and specifications, as well as the release of new competing models, it is difficult to expect earnings to improve from the second quarter,\u201d Kim Hyun-joon, a senior vice president of Samsung, said about the mobile business during a conference call with analysts.Kim Hyun-su, fund manager at IBK Asset Management, said: \u201cThere needed to be a positive guidance for third-quarter results, but it looks like the company is saying the outlook isn\u2019t too bright aside from its semiconductor business.\u201dSamsung reported a profit of 1.86 trillion won for its chip division, and said it expected shipment growth for both DRAM and NAND memory chips to outpace the broader market this year. Samsung said it planned 24 trillion won in capital expenditure this year, about the same as last year, with 14.4 trillion won of that for the chip business.The research firm IDC noted that Samsung\u2019s second-quarter global smartphone market share slipped to 25.2 percent from 32.3 percent a year ago, underscoring its troubles.\u201cNothing on the smartphone end has particularly changed, and there likely won\u2019t be any change in the story aside from effects of cost reduction,\u201d said Lee Min-hee, an analyst at IM Investment.Executives of Samsung\u2019s mobile division returned a quarter of their bonuses for the first half of the year and have downgraded to economy seats for shorter flights. But analysts say the pressure on the business to turn around will persist and could lead to a reshuffling if the current management cannot deliver.Samsung said that it expected handset shipments to pick up by 10 percent in the third quarter from the second, and that it planned to release a new premium smartphone with a new design and material.With its flagship Galaxy S5 smartphone outsold by the Apple iPhone 5s in May and its less expensive devices feeling the squeeze from Chinese rivals like Xiaomi, Samsung also vowed to revamp its mid-to-low-tier lineup with more aggressive pricing and a smaller set of products.As Apple prepares to introduce a larger iPhone, posing a challenge to Samsung\u2019s specialty of outsize high-end devices, the spotlight is on Samsung\u2019s next Galaxy Note handset, expected to be introduced in September. The company once again hinted at a significant change in design for the device but offered no specifics on Thursday.\u201cThey\u2019ll have to make sure that the Note 4 isn\u2019t a flop,\u201d Tom Kang, an analyst at Counterpoint, said before the earnings release.Advertisement"}

More important for the agency, the newspaper, with a circulation of 12,000 and distributed every other month, has drawn steady interest from advertisers hoping to gain a foothold in an emerging market.\u201cWe had so many of our clients come to us asking, \u2018How can we advertise down in Eagle Ford Shale?\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Kathy Rudkin, chief executive of the agency. \u201cHow can we get to the actual employees and managers who are working in the field?\u201dMs. Rudkin, 46, is not the only publisher trying to capitalize on one of the country\u2019s hottest shale plays. Drillers\u2019 mad dash to the Eagle Ford has spurred something of a printing boom, as publishers court new advertisers and audiences \u2014 including industry executives, natives of transformed communities and oil workers with little to do in isolated towns. Along with The Boom, at least three other shale magazines have cropped up since 2013. Though they have different looks and slightly different focuses, each is a direct result of the drilling surge. That growth comes as many print newspapers and magazines elsewhere have slashed staff or shuttered their offices as they struggle to deal with consumers\u2019 shift to online and mobile news sources.During the early days of Eagle Ford drilling, about five years ago, advertisers had few ways to reach across sparsely populated and spread-out communities, and oil workers were particularly elusive because many do not have permanent addresses in the area, publishers say. Free shale publications moved in to fill that gap. Publishers caution, however, that South Texas is still a difficult market, and it drains plenty of time and money to deliver their products to hundreds of locations across the Eagle Ford. \u201cIt definitely is a boom, but maybe it\u2019s not enough to sustain 20 to 30 publications,\u201d said Sandra Castillo-Swallow, publisher of Texas Eagle Ford Shale Magazine and The Play. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to do it.\u201d\u201cWhile I don\u2019t think the industry is perfect in every way, we need to recognize the benefits,\u201d she said.The Boom \u2014 the brainchild of Ms. Rudkin, whose nephew, an oil field trucker, complained of having little to do when not working \u2014 is a hodgepodge of BuzzFeed-style lists and short articles addressing a range of topics. Stories occasionally touch on shale economics, but most cater to more general interests. Its sections give workers tips on managing money (\u201cPayzone\u201d), working out (\u201cPumped\u201d) and cooking (\u201cGrill Baby Grill\u201d).The newspaper\u2019s creators cull most of its material from websites with permission, but they occasionally hire freelancers and produce some content in-house. \u201cI love it that nobody knows we\u2019re doing it,\u201d Olga Garces, a graphic designer, said of the fact that an all-female team was producing a magazine aimed at men. Ms. Garces, 34, a lifelong Texan who has friends in the Eagle Ford and who listens to country music, said she had no trouble keeping The Boom authentic. \u201cIt is honky-tonk and Texan, and I feel like I can relate a lot,\u201d she said.jmalewitz@texastribune.org Advertisement"}
{"Headline": " S.U.V.s and Trucks Lift Monthly Vehicle Sales", "Date": "2014-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySport utility vehicles are back, and in July they helped bolster auto sales nationwide.On Friday, General Motors, Ford and Chrysler all reported hefty sales gains helped by S.U.V.s as well as a rise in rebates, zero-percent financing and cheap lease deals.Chrysler\u2019s sales rose 20 percent from a year ago, relying almost exclusively on S.U.V.s and trucks. Jeep sales were up 41 percent, the best sales month ever for the brand. Chrysler\u2019s passenger cars, by contrast, dipped 1 percent.Ford, whose sales lagged in June, rebounded strongly in July because of a wave of growth in its S.U.V.s, including double-digit gains for the Explorer, the Escape and the Expedition. Ford sales were up 10 percent over all in July compared with the previous year, beating analysts\u2019 expectations.The auto industry as a whole in the United States is expected to sell about 1.4 million vehicles for the month, an increase from last year. The seasonally adjusted annual selling rate for light vehicles was estimated in the high 16 million range \u2014 G.M. itself predicted 16.7 million \u2014 making July the fifth consecutive month that the annual estimate has topped 16 million.Steven Szakaly, chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers Association, said that with gas prices stable, interest rates low and the economy in rebound, it was not surprising that S.U.V. sales were booming again.\u201cThere are many people in America who just don\u2019t want to drive a small car,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s going back to the light trucks that they love.\u201dSales of G.M.\u2019s large S.U.V.s, its most profitable vehicles, have been robust in recent months, and in July their sales were up 32 percent compared with the previous year.The Chevy Tahoe\u2019s sales rose 52 percent, the GMC Yukon was up 48 percent, and the even larger Yukon XL jumped 27 percent. While Cadillac was the only G.M. brand to post a sales loss in July, its large Escalade S.U.V. was the exception: Escalade sales nearly doubled. Sales of even the fanciest version, the Escalade ESV, whose retail price can reach $90,000, increased 107 percent.Crossover sport utilities are also proving wildly popular and have become one of the most competitive battlegrounds in the market.\u201cYou\u2019re seeing some customers that may have considered a car before come into the segment,\u201d said John Felice, Ford\u2019s United States marketing vice president, in a conference call on Friday.G.M., which owns the large S.U.V. market but faces stiff competition for crossover buyers, has nevertheless remained strong: Its crossover sales were up 26 percent in July.Vehicles like Buick\u2019s compact S.U.V., the Encore, led the way, with a 28 percent jump. The Encore is now up nearly 80 percent for the year, helped by G.M.\u2019s extra rebates aimed at bringing in new buyers.Eustace Phillip, a professor from Canton, Mass., is one of them. He and his wife bought an Encore June 15, even though they had not even heard of it before that day. Mr. Phillip said they had planned to look at Toyota\u2019s Avalon sedan, but his wife did not like the feel of it. A dealer suggested an Encore, and while they had never owned an S.U.V., they were drawn to the extra space and higher seating position.\u201cShe opened the door, sat inside, and was hooked,\u201d he said. \u201cWe went from zero interest in buying it, to test driving it, to signing on the dotted line.\u201dMr. Phillip said G.M.\u2019s incentives also helped seal the deal: a $1,000 rebate plus a $500 \u201csecret bonus for Father\u2019s Day.\u201dJuly is the 11th consecutive month that S.U.V.s and trucks have outsold cars, according to the auto research firm Edmunds.com, the longest streak since 2005.Jessica Caldwell, a senior analyst at Edmunds, said that truck sales generally peaked in the fall and winter, then gave way to cars in the spring and summer. This year, though, that hasn\u2019t happened.\u201cIt\u2019s very surprising,\u201d she said. \u201cThey started to get hot last fall, and you might have thought things would slow down in February or March, but it just hasn\u2019t stopped.\u201dMost other automakers also reported gains for July. Toyota sales were up 12 percent from a year ago, and Nissan\u2019s rose 11 percent. Honda, however, dropped 4 percent.An earlier version of this article misstated the proportion of fleet sales to regular retail sales for G.M. Fleet sales accounted for about two-thirds of sales, not \u201croughly half.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Marketers Are Sizing Up the Millennials", "Date": "2014-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMillennials have been called a lot of names. Narcissistic, lazy, indecisive. They have been labeled the boomerang generation for the many unable or unwilling to leave their parents\u2019 home, or even more negatively, the Peter Pan generation because they supposedly won\u2019t grow up.But now marketers, manufacturers and retailers are recognizing the group\u2019s potential as something important to their bottom line: the consumers who will drive the economy in the decades ahead.Since the 1960s \u2014 the era of \u201cMad Men\u201d \u2014 the baby boom generation, born between 1946 and 1964, has dominated corporate strategies behind selling nearly everything. Still constituting one-fourth of the nation\u2019s population, baby boomers created an economy fueled by credit cards and trips to shopping malls as they came of age in a time of relative affluence. For all the rebelliousness of the \u201960s and early \u201970s, most ended up buying houses in the suburbs, eating at fast-food restaurants, and acquiring spacious minivans and S.U.V.s despite having relatively small families.But now young adults in their 20s are moving to surpass baby boomers as the largest age group, changing the way everything is sold, even breakfast drinks and mattresses.\u201cOur whole consumer model is based on the baby boom,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chief economist for Mesirow Financial. Now, the coming generation is \u201csetting up a whole new consumer model.\u201dPerhaps the biggest change is that today\u2019s young adults \u2014 in part because they came of age in a harsher economic climate, in part because they have many more choices \u2014 are putting off major life decisions as well as the big purchases that typically go with them. As a result, their consumer behavior is unpredictable. \u201cThey\u2019ve learned to live life in a different way,\u201d Ms. Swonk said.There are more 23-year-olds \u2014 4.7 million of them \u2014 than any other age, according to census data from June. The second most populous age group was 24, and the third was 22. There is no official age range for millennials but the generation generally is defined as being born between the early 1980s and early 2000s. By 2020, they will account for one-third of the adult population.At the same time, millennials are the most educated generation in American history. Far more members of this generation are going to college than of past generations.The largest slice is now graduating and emerging in a postrecession landscape where the job market is still troubled but starting to show signs of improving. Many of the new college graduates have student debt to pay off. And wage growth for younger college graduates has risen slowly since the recession, lagging that of all full-time workers and making expensive purchases more difficult.But they also have significant earning potential in the years to come and, because of the sheer size of the group, have the ability to reshape the economy in ways that haven\u2019t happened since the huge baby boom generation was hitting the job market and moving into first homes.Nathan Lipsky, 23, exhibits many characteristics of his generation that are prompting upheaval in numerous industries. Though he earns a good salary in a job in the financial services industry in Kansas City, Mo., Mr. Lipsky said buying a house and getting married were not on his radar for the near future.\u201cRight now it\u2019s purely career-focused,\u201d said Mr. Lipsky, who lives with his parents. \u201cThis is a very selfish time in life.\u201dMortgage lenders and automobile manufacturers, who deal with the largest purchases most people make, have yet to figure out how to successfully tap this group of consumers. Mattress companies are another striking example.In an article called \u201cMeet the Millennials: Getting to Know Your Next Big Customer,\u201d the trade publication BedTimes Magazine offered tips for marketing to young adults who are stalling on traditions like marriage that in the past have prompted mattress shopping. The article advised mattress companies to sponsor a music concert or create online quizzes about mattresses.\u201cTricky to sell to,\u201d the article said, \u201cthey must be approached on their own terms.\u201dIt\u2019s worth remembering, of course, that baby boomers puzzled marketers in their day as they embraced consumer crazes \u2014 Frisbees, bell bottoms and stereo systems \u2014 even though they craved self-expression and many took part in counterculture activities. They, too, were described like millennials: selfish, entitled and unwilling to grow up. Even as they entered their 30s, the writer Tom Wolfe labeled the era the \u201cMe Decade.\u201d\u201cThere is no strong reason to believe that millennials are dramatically different than the generations of Americans that preceded them,\u201d Jason Furman, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, said last month at a housing forum on how millennials have fared in the years after the recession. \u201cRather, it is the unlucky economic times with which they were presented that explains much of their challenge.\u201dStill, many young adults are proving particularly baffling to marketers and researchers. While baby boomers have long exhibited consistent brand loyalty, 20-somethings \u201ctrade up and trade down,\u201d said Jeff Fromm, who runs FutureCast, a millennial trends consulting company, and wrote a book about marketing to millennials.Last September, the fashion magazine Teen Vogue worked with Goldman Sachs in a survey of young women ages 13 to 29 to come up with a list of the most popular brands sought by the cohort. Both Target and Louis Vuitton made the top 20 list.Leslie Coronel, who is entering her junior year at Amherst College in central Massachusetts, said she was careful to shop for most groceries at major chains where she can buy bread at a discount. Yet she often stops at the bakery at Whole Foods for more expensive treats. She does nearly all of her other shopping online, and when she goes to a clothing shop, she heads straight to the sales rack. But if she finds an expensive dress or shoes she really likes, she splurges.Such behavior has spawned a cottage industry of consultants who collect fees from companies clamoring to figure out what this age group wants.The Center for Generational Kinetics in Austin, Tex., was founded four years ago and has worked with about 100 clients including Mercedes-Benz, Four Seasons Hotels, General Electric and numerous retailers who want advice on how to appeal to millennial tastes.\u201cWhat worked five years ago doesn\u2019t work now in terms of marketing and selling and advertising,\u201d said Jason Dorsey, the center\u2019s chief strategy officer. \u201cThis has created a lot of urgency as more and more of these millennials enter the market and start to have money or spend money they don\u2019t have.\u201dGeneral Mills, one of the country\u2019s largest food companies, last year revamped its frozen pizza brand, Totino\u2019s, with black packaging and spicy flavors in an effort to appeal to millennials. The new Totino\u2019s Bold products are marketed with zombie videos on YouTube instead of the picture of the matronly chef Rose Totino clad in red-and-white checkered apron that graced newspaper ads in the 1980s, when the target consumer was baby boomer mothers.\u201cThis is an incredibly big part of our mission when there\u2019s an age group as large as this is,\u201d said Maria Carolina Comings, a marketing manager for General Mills.Breakfast drinks are also experiencing millennial-related upheaval. Marketers have found that young adults want something besides orange juice or coffee in the morning. Many of them, who exercise more than their parents at that age, have energy drinks for breakfast.PepsiCo already has responded to that change with Kickstart, a drink it created with millennials in mind that combines Mountain Dew flavor with 5 percent fruit juice. The company markets its citrus and fruit punch flavors of the caffeinated drink as a breakfast beverage.Adapting to this new group of consumers should be worth it. While baby boomers, not surprisingly, outspend millennials by a wide margin, millennials already represent $1.3 trillion in consumer spending, out of total spending of nearly $11 trillion, according to a study by Moosylvania, a digital marketing company in St. Louis. Young adults, the study found, need a lot of reassurance but don\u2019t like to be marketed to.\u201cNo one truly understand millennials,\u201d the researchers summarized. \u201cNot even millennials.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Time Warner fell sharply after 21st Century Fox said it was dropping its $80 billion offer to buy the media company. And Sprint plunged after it abandoned its effort to acquire T-Mobile US.The stock market has become more volatile in recent weeks, and slumped last month to its first monthly decline since January. Investors are weighing signs that the nation\u2019s economy is strengthening against the threat of an escalating conflict between Russia and Ukraine, as well as the prospect of the Federal Reserve raising its benchmark interest rate sometime next year.\u201cOn the one hand the U.S. economy is really starting to look good, but on the other hand the markets are certainly jittery about what\u2019s going on in Ukraine and Russia,\u201d said Anastasia Amoroso, global markets strategist at J.

The S.&P. 500 is still up 3.9 percent so far this year, but it has dropped 3.5 percent from its record close set July 24.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 13.87 points, or 0.1 percent, to 16,443.34. The Nasdaq composite index rose 2.2 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 4,355.05.Molson Coors rose $3.87, or 5.8 percent, to $71.08 after the company said its second-quarter profit rose 9 percent as better pricing offset a global decline in the volume of beer sales.Investors also focused on two merger bids that unraveled.Sprint plunged $1.38, or 19 percent, to $5.90 after the company said it was abandoning its pursuit of T-Mobile US. Sprint would have struggled to persuade regulators to approve a merger of the nation\u2019s No. 3 and No. 4 cellphone carriers. T-Mobile dropped $2.85, or 8.4 percent, to $31.06.Time Warner fell $10.95, or 12.9 percent, to $74.24 after Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox said it was dropping its attempt to take over the company. The deal would have combined two of the world\u2019s biggest media conglomerates. 21st Century Fox rose $1.03, or 3.3 percent, to $32.33.Stocks may oscillate in a trading range in coming days as investors follow developments in Ukraine and assess their impact on the global economy, said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital.The American economy is unlikely to be directly affected by the economic fallout from the escalating tensions between Russia and the West. Europe, though, is dependent on Russian natural gas for heat and electricity. Germany imports nearly all its natural gas from Russia, and France also gets a significant amount of its energy from Russia.\u201cI don\u2019t think the market is afraid of any military intervention, but it certainly is focusing on the negative aspects of an economic war,\u201d Mr. Cardillo said.In economic news, the nation\u2019s trade deficit fell in June to its lowest level since January as imports dropped sharply, led by lower deliveries of cellphones, petroleum and cars.The trade deficit fell 7 percent in June to a seasonally adjusted $41.5 billion, from $44.7 billion in May, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.Exports rose 0.1 percent to $195.9 billion, a record high. Imports fell 1.2 percent, the most in a year, to $237.4 billion.The unexpected decline suggests that growth may have been stronger in the second quarter than the government initially estimated. The economy grew at a 4 percent annual rate in the April-June quarter, the government said last week. But that figure included an estimate of the June trade deficit that was higher than Wednesday\u2019s figure.Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a note to clients that the figures indicated growth might have been as high as 4.3 percent in the second quarter. In the bond market, interest rates dipped. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note declined to 2.47 percent from 2.49 percent on Tuesday, while its price rose 6/32, to 100 9/32.Advertisement"}

And the forces shaping the race between him and his opponent, Cory Gardner, are the same ones that are shaping the parties\u2019 national fortunes.Will President Obama\u2019s dismal approval ratings doom Democrats? Will Republicans\u2019 habit of nominating social conservatives \u2014 Gardner fits the bill \u2014 alienate so many women, independents and millennials that the party defeats itself? Right now the Senate contest here is a tossup.In many ways, Colorado is the new Ohio, a political bellwether. The percentage of its voters who chose Barack Obama in each of the last two presidential elections almost precisely matched the percentage of voters who did so nationwide. And nearly all the currents that buffet national politics swirl around the Rockies, which run like a ragged spine through a state that\u2019s both very flat and very tall, bursting with agriculture and booming with high tech, outdoorsy and urbane, a stronghold of the religious right (Colorado Springs) and a liberal utopia (Boulder).In other ways, \u201cColorado is the new California,\u201d in Hickenlooper\u2019s words. It floats trial balloons \u2014 marijuana being one example, education reforms being another \u2014 while other states watch to see which take flight and which wheeze and crumple to earth.That\u2019s partly because it\u2019s a place without foregone conclusions. The Colorado electorate is divided almost exactly into one-third Republican, one-third Democratic and one-third neither of the above. So conservative and liberal proposals alike are pushed in the Legislature and put before voters; discussion isn\u2019t proscribed by the one-party dominance that you find in a red or blue state.\u201cWe really duke things out,\u201d said Chris Onan, a co-founder of Galvanize, a firm here that provides seed funds, office space and other support for tech start-ups. \u201cThere\u2019s never just one position.\u201dEven the state\u2019s weather is in flux and in extremis. Colorado is a meteorological drama queen, and the sorts of cataclysms that climate change could bring \u2014 raging wildfires, biblical flooding \u2014 have recurred here with scary frequency.\u201cIt\u2019s almost Old Testament,\u201d said Hickenlooper. \u201cWe had 13 federal declarations of disaster in four years. I think that\u2019s more than any other state in the history of the country.\u201dHickenlooper, a Democrat, is also up for re-election. And his race, against Bob Beauprez, a former Congressman, has been tighter than political analysts had initially expected it to be.But an even more interesting contest is the one in the state\u2019s Sixth Congressional District, where the efforts of a three-term Republican incumbent, Mike Coffman, to fend off a fierce Democratic challenge will hinge largely on his ability to woo Latino voters. Their share of the electorate here, as in the nation, has risen significantly, and they now represent roughly 20 percent of the state\u2019s population. In recent Colorado elections, they have heavily favored Democrats.\u201cFor its predictive value in seeing where the Hispanic vote nationally is going to go, the Sixth District could be key,\u201d Eric Anderson, a political analyst here, told me. It\u2019s \u201ca petri dish inside the petri dish\u201d of the state, he added.Although Coffman previously supported measures to declare English the official U.S. language and to deny automatic citizenship to babies born in this country, he\u2019s not singing those songs anymore. No, he\u2019s practicing his Spanish, in weekly sessions with a tutor. His Democratic challenger, Andrew Romanoff, is fluent.Money from outside the state is pouring into the Coffman-Romanoff battle, as it is into the one between Udall and Gardner, which is clearly going to be the most expensive Senate race in Colorado\u2019s history. And the Latino vote could give Udall the edge he needs.But the Udall campaign\u2019s emphasis until this point is in line with a Democratic strategy nationwide for the midterm elections. In three of the six TV commercials that it has released, the focus is on Gardner\u2019s anti-abortion record, and the hope is to cast him as a dutiful and menacing foot soldier in the \u201cwar on women\u201d that Democrats decry.Udall\u2019s campaign also reflects the Democratic dread of Obama\u2019s unpopularity. When the president traveled to Colorado recently for a fund-raiser for Udall, there was no hug or handshake between the two men, and a photo of both of them would have required a very wide-angle lens. Udall stayed far outside the state.Gardner\u2019s strategy, evident in his constant invocations of Obamacare, is to lash Udall to the president and to tar the Obama administration as a force for ever bigger government.WHEN I asked Udall\u2019s campaign spokesman, Chris Harris, how much of a handicap Obama posed, he didn\u2019t defend the president\u2019s record but instead stressed Udall\u2019s independence and dissents.\u201cIf any Democrat has been a pain in the White House\u2019s you-know-what lately, it has been Mark,\u201d he said, making clear that Udall \u201cfollows his own compass\u201d and had held the administration\u2019s \u201cfeet to the fire over the N.S.A.\u201d That detail suggested Democrats\u2019 worry that the National Security Agency\u2019s privacy infringements are especially repellent to the party\u2019s young voters.It\u2019s surprising that Udall and Hickenlooper aren\u2019t in better shape, given that Colorado\u2019s unemployment rate has fallen to 5.5 percent from over 9 in late 2010. Business Insider just ranked Colorado\u2019s economy the best among the 50 states.But Colorado distills the national mood in the following sense, too: While raw numbers have improved, reality hasn\u2019t caught up, and people feel a pessimism that transcends the day\u2019s statistics. In a statewide poll in late June, only 27 percent of Coloradans said the country was on the right track, while 65 percent said it was on the wrong one.Colorado has shown us the horror of gun violence: the blood bath at Columbine High School in 1999, the massacre in Aurora in 2012. And in their aftermath, it demonstrated the push for \u2014 and perverse resistance to \u2014 better gun control. Its legislature enacted new firearms restrictions in early 2013, only to see the National Rifle Association lead successful recall efforts against two of the Democrats who voted for them.Because Colorado is a mecca for both energy companies and wilderness lovers, it\u2019s been engaged in an impassioned debate over fracking that\u2019s both echo and preview of standoffs elsewhere.Hickenlooper, a former geologist trying to walk a fine line between the camps, once exhibited his conviction in the safety of fracking by drinking fracking fluid. Colorado likes unstuffy politicians who break the mold, which is something candidates with national ambitions increasingly try to do.It\u2019s an impulse that most Americans can appreciate. And that they share.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Dozen States File Suit Against New Coal Rules", "Date": "2014-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Twelve states filed a lawsuit against the Obama administration on Friday seeking to block an Environmental Protection Agency proposal to regulate coal-fired power plants in an effort to stem climate change. The plaintiffs are led by West Virginia and include states that are home to some of the largest producers of coal and consumers of coal-fired electricity. Republicans have attacked the E.P.A. proposal as a \u201cwar on coal,\u201d saying that it will shut down plants and eliminate jobs in states that depend on mining. But the rule is also opposed by the Democratic governors of West Virginia and Kentucky. \u201cThis lawsuit represents another effort by our office to invalidate the E.P.A.\u2019s proposed rule that will have devastating effects on West Virginia\u2019s jobs and its economy,\u201d the state\u2019s attorney general, Patrick Morrisey, said in a statement.Mr. Morrisey said his office would \u201cuse every legal tool available\u201d to protect coal miners and their families. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to see more announcements like we saw with Alpha Natural Resources yesterday,\u201d he said.The suit was filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. The other plaintiffs are Alabama, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota and Wyoming.The E.P.A. rule, announced by President Obama on June 2, is aimed at slashing carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants, the nation\u2019s largest source of planet-warming pollution. Under the rule, each state would have to design and submit a plan to cut carbon pollution, which must then be approved by the E.P.A.The states\u2019 lawsuit contends that the E.P.A. lacks legal authority in the matter. The agency wants to release the final rule under the terms of the Clean Air Act, which requires the federal government to regulate all substances defined as pollutants. The E.P.A. determined in 2009 that carbon dioxide met the definition of a pollutant, a decision that has withstood numerous legal challenges.But the states say that the E.P.A. may not issue separate regulations on power plants using different sections of the Clean Air Act. In 2011, the E.P.A. issued regulations governing mercury emissions; thus, the plaintiffs say, it does not have the authority to issue a new regulation on carbon emissions from the same power plants. Scott Segal, a lawyer who represents companies and utilities lobbying against the rule, predicted that the lawsuit was the first of more to come. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if one gets kicked to the Supreme Court,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Africa Needs Science, Not Aid", "Date": "2014-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsWASHINGTON \u2014 When John F. Kennedy came to the University of Michigan to campaign for president in the fall of 1960, Africa was plagued with trade and governance challenges far more daunting than those it faces today. The young senator recognized that African nations \u2014 like other countries emerging from colonialism \u2014 were preoccupied with developing basic literacy and manpower. And so he urged students to go abroad and help them. The spirited response resulted in one of America\u2019s greatest gifts to the world: the Peace Corps.Next week, President Obama is convening a U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit in Washington; the stated objective is \u201cInvesting in the Next Generation.\u201d But the summit\u2019s focus on private sector deals won\u2019t necessarily further that goal. There is a way to make a lasting and low-cost investment in Africa\u2019s next generation: Mr. Obama must bring education \u2014 and science and technology in particular \u2014 to the forefront of the debate about African development.Africa is experiencing an economic upswing, but its growth is predominantly based on extracting natural resources rather than increasing industrial productivity. African economies are still dominated by low-level processing of natural resources and the production of simple consumer goods for local consumption. Most of these nations are far from making any internationally significant technological breakthroughs.What ultimately distinguishes \u2014 and continues to handicap \u2014 Africa is its lack of mastery of modern science and technology. Without advanced competency in these areas, nations cannot harness the full power of scientific research and technological tools to solve the many health, energy and development challenges confronting them.Scientific and technological advancement will help eradicate poverty and promote homegrown economic development by providing Africa with the tools to address its own challenges and expand its industrial productivity. And promoting such advancement is a much more lasting investment that offers surer and higher returns than continuously funneling aid dollars for short-term fixes.A growing number of African leaders and organizations have realized the value of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education in developing industrial capacity and a trained workforce in fields like health and energy. Corporate-funded research centers in Africa already exist, but achieving major breakthroughs will require international partnerships between government, business and academia.At home, the Obama administration has consistently made STEM education a core policy and budgetary priority.America should now embrace a science-led agenda in Africa by partnering American institutions of higher education, scientific research centers and technological entrepreneurs with African countries to help them bolster economic growth and reduce dependency on foreign aid. Greater cooperation in these areas will increase trade and drive the expansion of African market opportunities for the United States.Science and technology cooperation has long been part of America\u2019s policy toward China, India, Pakistan and Israel. Since 1959, beneficiaries of American-Israeli scientific cooperation have won 43 Nobel prizes. The United States currently has over 50 scientific agreements and partnerships with foreign governments, but none with any African country. This must change.Next week\u2019s summit and future American policy toward Africa must address the scientific and technological capabilities needed to transform African economies, establish new forms of exchange and cooperation and reallocate resources to finance this.The money is already there.There are a variety of ongoing programs that could serve as a foundation: The United States Agency for International Development\u2019s Higher Education project, the National Academies\u2019 African Science Academy Development Initiative project, the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and Power Africa. PEPFAR and Power Africa, for example, both seek to solve problems \u2014 the AIDS crisis and energy shortages \u2014 that require advanced scientific and technological competency. However, these programs are currently implemented through development aid instruments. Because they are donor-initiated projects, they don\u2019t reflect African nations\u2019 own shifting priorities toward improving their indigenous science and technology capabilities.Instead of continuing to focus on delivery of developed products \u2014 like manufactured drugs and solar-energy panels \u2014 to passive consumers, a reallocation of a small percentage of the more than $30 billion in government funds slated for these two programs between 2014 and 2018 could establish a new $1 billion regional fund for joint research activities that would strengthen existing institutions and help establish new ones to train the next generation of Africans in science and engineering disciplines so that they can take ownership of solving their own problems.America should also initiate a program to recruit and train 100,000 African graduate students in STEM fields at American institutions over the next 10 years while making it easier for American scientists to teach and conduct research in Africa. American scientists would become better educated about Africa\u2019s development challenges and the influx of visitors doing cutting-edge research would improve the standard of African teaching and research.Fifty-four years after J.F.K. asked Michigan students \u201cHow many of you who are going to be doctors are willing to spend your days in Ghana?\u201d another young and inspiring American president must ask the same of America\u2019s higher education establishment and scientific community so that African nations can continue on the road to fulfilling their true potential.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Conflict Leaves Industry in Ashes and Gaza Reeling From Economic Toll", "Date": "2014-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip \u2014 For nearly four decades, Al Awda Co. has stocked Gaza\u2019s shelves with sweets and snacks, starting as a humble refugee-camp bakery and growing into a 180,000-square-foot factory with 600 workers.On Wednesday, all that was left was a faint whiff of chocolate amid the sour smell of a fire that burned for three days.A barrage of Israeli artillery turned Al Awda into a charred graveyard of machinery and material. The $1.3 million German control panel that powered the place became a metal cabinet of fried wires. Some 300 tons each of sugar, flour and margarine \u2014 gone. Metal roofs collapsed, cinder-block walls had gaping holes, floors were carpeted in rubble.\u201cI didn\u2019t even go to the third floor; I don\u2019t want to see what\u2019s there,\u201d said Mohammed Al Telbani, 61, who founded the business in 1977. \u201cI\u2019m used to building. I\u2019m not used to destruction.\u201dDuring Israel\u2019s monthlong air-and-ground assault on the Gaza Strip, the world\u2019s attention has focused on the more than 1,800 Palestinians killed and the more than 30,000 homes destroyed or damaged. But as a temporary truce held and talks toward a longer-term cease-fire began Wednesday, business leaders said that 175 of Gaza\u2019s most successful industrial plants had also taken devastating hits, plunging an already despairing economy into a deeper abyss.Ali Hayek, head of Gaza\u2019s federation of industries, said these factories directly provided perhaps 5,000 of the most stable jobs in this impoverished Palestinian sliver, where the latest estimates of unemployment are as high as 47 percent. The collateral damage is exponential: Sabha, Gaza\u2019s only producer of tomato paste, has contracts with 5,000 farmers, Mr. Hayek said. Legions of drivers will be without cargo. Rebuilding anything is that much harder with 63 construction companies offline, including several cement makers.The destruction of Al Awda alone threatens its suppliers of milk, plastic wrapping, flour and cardboard boxes. Then again, Hamada, a huge flour mill in Gaza City, and Khozendar, Gaza\u2019s only carton-maker, are also gone, Mr. Hayek said, along with 21 food companies, 10 clothing manufacturers and the entire industrial zone in the northern town of Beit Hanoun.\u201cAfter 30 days of war, the economic situation has become, like, dead,\u201d said Mr. Hayek, whose group represents 3,900 businesses employing 35,000 people. \u201cIt seems the occupation intentionally destroyed these vital factories that constitute the backbone of the society.\u201dThe damage to Gaza\u2019s infrastructure from the current conflict is already more severe than the destruction caused by either of the last two Gaza wars.Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, a spokesman for the Israeli military, said Wednesday that he did not have a specific explanation for the attack on Al Awda, but that \u201ccategorically, we do not target factories.\u201d\u201cWe target facilities that have been involved in rocket manufacturing,\u201d he said, \u201cor locations that rockets have been launched from.\u201dPalestinian officials plan to ask international donors for $6 billion to rebuild Gaza this fall. But after Israel\u2019s 2008-9 Operation Cast Lead, in which more than 1,000 small businesses and workshops were wiped out, a promised $4.7 billion never materialized, people in Gaza say.Omar Shaban, an economist who lives in the central Gaza town of Deir al-Balah and has known Al Awda and its owner since childhood, has long been talking about the structural dysfunction in Gaza. Israel severely restricts imports, exports, farming and fishing. The government payroll is bloated and a black market had thrived, fueled by hundreds of tunnels to Egypt, used for smuggling goods. Exacerbating the crisis, the new Egyptian government closed most of those tunnels last summer, idling even internationally funded construction projects. The Hamas-run government lost millions in tax revenue, its employees lost paychecks, and prices for diesel, cars and consumer products shot up.Now, after the loss of the factories, Mr. Shaban said, \u201cThe condition of our society needs new terms that do not exist in any textbook.\u201d\u201cWe should stop asking about the percentage of unemployment and start talking about the percentage of employment,\u201d he said. \u201cI try hard to draw the boundary of the problem \u2014 it\u2019s borderless. It\u2019s a long list of cause and result, cause and result; this will lead to that and will lead to that. It\u2019s a circle of impacts that will cause another problem.\u201dThough he is wealthier than all but a few of Gaza\u2019s 1.7 million residents, Mr. Telbani\u2019s story is Gaza\u2019s story. Like some two-thirds of the population, he is classified as a refugee, his family having lost its home in Beersheba at Israel\u2019s founding (his company\u2019s name, Al Awda, means \u201creturn\u201d). Like many men of his generation, his first jobs were inside Israel, in restaurants and construction projects.But after years of exporting its snacks and sweets to the United States, Europe and the United Arab Emirates, Al Awda has only managed to get a few trucks of inventory to the West Bank over the last decade because of Israel\u2019s blockade.In Gaza, Al Awda is more than a staple of pantry shelves and party platters. Schoolchildren take factory tours as field trips. It is a symbol of Palestinian resilience and entrepreneurial possibility.The daily tally of rocket attacks, airstrikes and deaths in the conflict between Israel and Hamas.Mr. Telbani said the company had more than $1 million in sales each month for its dozens of products \u2014 the classic Family Wafers in strawberry, lemon and other flavors, along with biscuits, pretzels, chocolate-covered marshmallow creams, corn puffs, ice cream and juice. He estimated it would take $20 million to rebuild the factory.Eyad Mohammed Telbani, 37, the oldest of Mr. Telbani\u2019s 12 children and deputy chief of the business, said that when the war began, during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, he and three brothers-in-law had slept at the factory\u2019s entrance and taken their pre-dawn breakfasts and post-fast iftar dinners there.A few shells hit the six-building factory, just east of the main Saladin Street in Deir al-Balah, 10 or 12 days ago, the younger Mr. Telbani said. Then, on Thursday \u2014 exactly a year after his brother Alian, 26, was killed at the factory during a robbery \u2014 the real assault came, at about 8 a.m.More shells came while firefighters tried to extinguish the flames, he said. The next day, even more.Above the administrative office, the third-floor apartment where one of the elder Mr. Telbani\u2019s three wives lived with her three small children is in ruins. Metal pots lie amid the broken tiles in what was the kitchen; a standing fan is half buried in a small bedroom. A red fire extinguisher sits in the doorway.On the second floor, Mr. Telbani\u2019s own grand quarters are intact: A woman mopped the broad tile floor under faded ceiling friezes and chandeliers. But his bedroom overlooking the shipping area reeks of smoke.The minarets of the mosque next door, which Mr. Telbani paid to build six years ago and named Al Awda, were also hit. Two containers of medicine that the Red Crescent society had stored in the ice cream factory when it ran out of refrigerator space were destroyed, along with 40,000 treats.On Wednesday, the second day of a promised three-day halt in hostilities, a couple of dozen men were on site, sliding boxes of \u201cThe First Wafers\u201d down a makeshift metal chute and onto trucks. But even these may be unusable because of smoke damage.Ahmad Tawashi, 30, has been working at Al Awda as a technician for five years, making the minimum rate, about $250 a month. His wife is about to deliver their fourth child, and he wonders how he will pay the hospital bill.If his home had been destroyed, Mr. Tawashi said, he could work to earn enough money to rebuild. But without the factory, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what will happen.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Natural Gas Production Falls Short in China", "Date": "2014-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHOUYANG, China \u2014 Jin Peisheng, a drilling rig foreman, knows the challenges of trying to extract natural gas from a coal seam under the cornfields here in north-central China.Cracks in the subterranean coal are flooded with water that needs to be pumped out before the gas will emerge. The coal seams are so cold that gels injected into the well, which are meant to help release the gas, sometimes become gummy and block the flow instead. And there is constant concern about hitting the labyrinths of active coal mines that honeycomb the area.\u201cThe big uncertainty is what\u2019s underground \u2014 if there\u2019s a tunnel, that\u2019s a big danger. It would be dangerous for the miners,\u201d Mr. Jin said.Faced with severe air pollution from coal and a rising dependence on energy imports, China has been eager to follow the United States by rapidly increasing natural gas output. Replacing coal with natural gas has also been central to Beijing\u2019s hopes to limit emissions of global warming gases in China, the world\u2019s largest producer of carbon dioxide by a wide margin.But China\u2019s ability to extract sufficient natural gas is in serious doubt. Despite heavy investment and strong government support, China\u2019s natural gas production is growing at a slower pace than its decelerating economy. China\u2019s production of natural gas increased just 6 percent last year and 4.4 percent in 2012.China\u2019s main problem is that shale gas production has fallen far short of expectations. That has left the country relying on alternative methods considered also-rans by American standards, like pumping natural gas from coal fields.Now, the Chinese government appears to be acknowledging the shortfall. Wu Xinxiong, the director of the National Energy Administration of China, unexpectedly said in a speech this summer that China\u2019s target for domestic natural gas production in 2020 was only 30 billion cubic meters for shale gas and another 30 billion cubic meters for coal seam gas. Just two years ago, the National Energy Administration estimated that China would produce 60 billion to 100 billion cubic meters of shale gas alone by 2020.If Mr. Wu\u2019s forecast comes true, shale gas and coal field gas would each supply only 1 percent of China\u2019s electricity generation needs in 2020.\u201cIf the population and economy keep growing, and extensive energy use continues, sustaining China\u2019s energy supply will be hard,\u201d Mr. Wu warned.Gas production has been slow to rise despite energetic efforts by Beijing to make it financially attractive for energy companies, including direct subsidies for shale gas production. The Chinese government also announced on Aug. 13 that it would raise urban wholesale prices for natural gas at the end of the month by roughly 18 percent for industrial users.With domestic supplies increasing slowly, China has been looking elsewhere. It agreed in May to buy gas from Russia under a 30-year, $400 billion deal. And it has begun importing liquefied natural gas from Qatar, Australia and Yemen.The natural gas is sorely needed. Beijing plans to retire four coal-fired power plants by the end of this year and replace them with gas-fired plants in an effort to reduce air pollution.But China does not have enough gas for a larger-scale conversion of power plants to gas. So the national government has already told smaller, less influential cities to stick with coal for now, and has discouraged businesses from investing heavily in gas-fired equipment.Gas had looked like one of the few remaining ways for China to reduce its addiction to coal. China\u2019s nuclear power program slowed after Japan\u2019s triple meltdown in Fukushima. Efforts to expand hydroelectric power have run into environmental concerns as well as the huge cost of resettling people from areas flooded when dams are built to make artificial lakes. Solar power and wind power are growing rapidly, but from small bases.The revised figures from Mr. Wu represented China\u2019s first official acknowledgment of what Western experts have been saying for many months: The country will not approach the success of the United States in shale gas anytime soon.Shale gas deposits lie much deeper in China than in the United States, which greatly increases drilling costs. Chinese shale also tends to be laden with clay and is much wetter than American shale, making it harder to crack the shale and release the gas through pumping liquids and sand underground, the process known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.After 40 million years of powerful earthquakes as the Indian subcontinent plowed into southern Asia, the main shale gas seams in western China are jumbled underground, instead of lying flat like a stack of pancakes, as in the United States, said Jeff Layman, a partner in the Beijing office of Baker Botts, the big Houston energy law firm.In March, Sinopec, a Chinese oil giant, announced the country\u2019s first commercially viable shale gas deposit, located outside Chongqing, and predicted annual production would reach a hefty 10 billion cubic meters by 2017. But the company has released few details, prompting foreign energy experts to begin asking whether all of the seams are truly shale, although Sinopec insists they are.Neither Sinopec nor its rival, PetroChina, has announced any other large fields despite extensive drilling. Both of these state-controlled companies said in March that they were still drilling actively for shale gas in China even as they cut their worldwide exploration budgets for oil and gas after weak results.Sinopec and PetroChina, which will hold earnings conferences on Monday and Thursday, respectively, are targets of broad government inquiries into possible corruption, including in their contracts with outside vendors. This has made their executives reluctant to approve further shale drilling contracts, said a Chinese oil industry executive who insisted on anonymity because of the legal issues involved.Lower expectations for shale gas have resulted in greater interest in another category of unconventional gas, so-called coal bed methane. In this process, natural gas is gathered by drilling into underground coal seams.The United States, Australia and other countries have used this method for several decades. But they often tap the natural gas before coal extraction begins, to reduce the risk that gas will explode in coal mines.China\u2019s problem is that many of its coal fields already have working mines. China has 13 percent of the world\u2019s coal reserves but 47 percent of the world\u2019s production. Many Chinese coal mine operators have opposed nearby coal bed methane production, fearing that pumping sand and chemicals into wells to liberate gas might have the unintended effect of driving gas into their mines.The Chinese government has negotiated with mine operators and villages here in Shouyang, 220 miles southwest of Beijing, to authorize a large coal bed methane project, led by Far East Energy Corporation, based in Houston. Michael R. McElwrath, chief executive of Far East Energy, said he believed the project would improve coal field safety by removing explosive gas from subterranean seams.But the Shouyang coal field is unusual within China because the coal is fairly permeable, allowing gas to flow underground. If there are no more discoveries of permeable coal, Mr. McElwrath said, \u201cwe will have a nice little project but the industry will not take off.\u201dFar East Energy faces its own issues. In June, the company announced that it had shut a quarter of its 160 wells for various reasons, such as gummy gels or a lack of gas-gathering pipelines; it plans to restart most of those wells later. \u201cWe are considering a variety of strategic transactions to fund the coming year\u2019s drilling activities,\u201d Mr. McElwrath said, declining to elaborate.Crews have been working here over the last several years, laboring in a countryside of yellow dirt so soft that even small streams cut steep-flanked gorges 50 feet deep or more.

{"Headline": "Demand Up, U.S. Economy Shows Gains", "Date": "2014-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe American economy is gaining renewed momentum, with data released on Tuesday suggesting strong demand by businesses for airplanes, machinery and other manufactured items, as well as rising confidence among consumers, despite a cooling in the housing market.That strength, though, was exaggerated by a huge surge in demand for airplanes made by Boeing.Excluding the always-volatile transportation sector, core capital goods orders fell by 0.5 percent in July, but remain up more than 11 percent over the most recent three months on an annualized basis.\u201cThe U.S. economy is on solid ground,\u201d said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS. \u201cEurope is struggling, Japan is struggling, but all of this suggests the U.S. is doing quite well.\u201dEurope has been hurt by the austerity policies in place across much of the Continent, he said, noting that growth essentially stalled in the second quarter. After a very weak first quarter, Mr. Behravesh estimates the United States economy will grow at a rate of roughly 3 percent over the remainder of 2014.By contrast, he said, growth in Europe is running at under a 1 percent pace, while the Japanese economy is expanding at about 1.5 percent on an annualized basis.A healthier job market and the recent surge in stocks, which has lifted the S.&P. 500 into record territory, has helped consumer confidence to rebound. On Tuesday, the Conference Board reported in its monthly survey that its main consumer confidence measure rose in August to its highest level since October 2007, before the start of the recession.\u201cHousing has had a strong recovery in recent years and now it\u2019s leveling off,\u201d Mr. Behravesh said. \u201cIt won\u2019t be the engine of growth that it\u2019s been, but that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. We can worry about soft housing prices, but there is no bubble in the making.\u201dGuy Berger, United States economist at RBS, added that after a strong performance in 2012 and 2013, homes aren\u2019t as undervalued as they were previously.\u201cWith rents going up in recent years, it became more favorable to buy,\u201d Mr. Berger said. \u201cThe easy gains are behind us in terms of housing.\u201dMore significant than any cooling in housing is that businesses are beginning to invest more aggressively again, he added, citing the strong figures for durable goods orders Tuesday.\u201cThe main takeaway from today\u2019s data is that businesses\u2019 spending is moving at a faster pace,\u201d he said. \u201cSome is catch-up, and some is acceleration, but it looks set to continue in the third quarter.\u201dEconomists had expected a big jump in durable goods demand last month because Boeing had announced it received orders for more than 300 planes in July. Still, the eye-popping 22.6 percent gain caught some observers off-guard, even if the impact on the overall economy from aircraft orders is modest.Airplane orders can have an outsize impact on monthly durable goods data because of the high dollar value of each jet, sometimes causing the figures to swing sharply. Aircraft like Boeing 747s and 777s, for example, can cost nearly $400 million each.\u201cAircraft made a big splash, but are relatively inconsequential in terms of the broad economy,\u201d said Michael Gapen, senior United States economist at Barclays.But he noted that the Commerce Department also revised up its estimate view of June orders of core durable goods, which include factory equipment and the like, now estimating that they rose at a 5.4 percent rate rather than 1.4 percent. That meant that the slight decline in the same figure for July still represented a relatively strong level of demand.Indeed, the healthy data for June and July prompted Mr. Gapen and the economics team at Barclays to increase their estimate for third quarter growth to a rate of 2.7 percent from 2.4 percent.That increase in economic output parallels more recent gains in the labor market, which has lagged overall economic performance for much of the current recovery. When data on unemployment in August is released by the Labor Department in early September, Mr. Gapen expects the jobless rate to fall slightly to 6.1 percent, with employers adding roughly 200,000 jobs.By the end of 2014, Barclays estimates the country\u2019s jobless rate could sink to 5.8 percent, the lowest level in more than six years.\u201cThe moderate to healthy rates of business investment,\u201d Mr. Gapen said, \u201cpoint to some momentum that may feed into the second half of the year.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "This Time, a Different Kind of War Between Israel and Hamas", "Date": "2014-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byQuick HistoryTHE collapse of a 72-hour cease-fire in the Gaza fighting only two hours after it began marked a new phase in the violence, as the reported capture of an Israeli officer by Hamas gave the Palestinian militants a powerful bargaining lever and fired an all-out effort by Israel to get its soldier back.One of Israel\u2019s cardinal principles is to do everything possible to secure the release of any captured Israeli. The last Israeli soldier to be captured by Hamas, Gilad Shalit, was freed after more than five years of captivity in exchange for 1,027 Palestinian and other prisoners.The latest development added to the maze of political struggles around the Gaza fighting \u2014 among Arabs, among American factions, between Israel and Washington \u2014 that had already severely constrained Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s efforts to mediate a cease-fire.In other major developments of the past week, the C.I.A.\u2019s inspector general found that C.I.A. officers had hacked computers of the Senate Intelligence Committee. The internal report confirmed charges leveled by Senator Dianne Feinstein last March, prompting a furious outcry from many senators on both sides of the divide.On the Ukrainian front, Russia began to take stock of serious economic sanctions against its banking, energy and military sectors ordered by the European Union and the United States. Though long reluctant to take action that would hurt their own economies, the Europeans were galvanized into action by Russia\u2019s cynical response to the downing of a Malaysian jet by the secessionist rebels the Kremlin actively supports in eastern Ukraine.A New Calculus This miniwar between Israel and Hamas is very different from previous ones.A central difference is in the way the \u201cArab spring\u201d has altered the political calculations of the Arab states and their feelings toward Hamas. Egypt, now back under military rulers hostile to Islamists, along with Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf autocracies, have not-so-secretly welcomed Israel\u2019s campaign to crush Hamas. That has reduced the ranks of mediators Washington can draw on to lean on the Islamic militants. Mahmoud Abbas, the leader in the West Bank, has little sway over Hamas, despite a purported political alliance formed in April; the United Nations, which joined Washington in seeking a cease-fire, has no credibility with Israel after decades of lopsided votes against the Jewish state. So Mr. Kerry has been compelled to work through Qatar and Turkey, two states that can still communicate with Hamas.But Hamas itself has no urgent reason to end the fighting. As in the past, the huge toll in civilian lives, along with the tragic strikes on schools, beaches and homes, have roused an international outcry against Israel. Hamas evidently believes that sustaining the fighting can eventually rouse enough international pressure on Israel to compel it to open Gaza and release Palestinian prisoners.Israel, for its part, appears convinced that it can crush, or at least severely weaken, Hamas through sanctions and force. Though Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was reluctant to order an incursion into Gaza, since it began he has been intent on continuing long enough to destroy Hamas tunnels and rockets and batter the Hamas leadership. The Israelis, moreover, have succeeded in sharply blunting Hamas\u2019s rockets with the Iron Dome missile defense system, which has intercepted a number of rockets headed for population centers.It is also no secret that Mr. Netanyahu and President Obama have strained relations, and Mr. Kerry\u2019s mediating efforts have been sharply assailed in Washington for pressing Israel to end its attack. The best Mr. Kerry was able to achieve against these obstacles was a 72-hour cease-fire. Now that has collapsed, and if Second Lt. Hadar Goldin is indeed in the hands of Hamas, it is even more difficult to see how the bloodshed can be stopped.Spy vs. SenatorThe acknowledgment by the C.I.A. that its officers had in fact snooped on the computers of a Senate committee investigating the C.I.A.\u2019s controversial \u201cenhanced interrogation\u201d and secret-prisons program under the George W. Bush administration further escalated the feud between Congress and the spy agency. It also led to demands for the ouster of the agency\u2019s director, John O. Brennan.At the heart of the long-running dispute is a 6,000-page report by the Senate Intelligence Committee that is still classified. But it is known that the report is highly critical of the secret program, and a 600-page summary of the report that is in the process of being declassified is said to conclude that the C.I.A.\u2019s use of methods like waterboarding after 9/11 failed to produce any significant information. The investigation was stormy from the outset, with Republicans withdrawing from the investigation and the C.I.A. disputing many findings.Last March, Senator Feinstein publicly lashed out at the C.I.A. over its monitoring of her committee\u2019s investigators. On Thursday, the C.I.A. effectively vindicated her when the agency\u2019s inspector general, David B. Buckley, said his investigation found that five agency members \u201cimproperly accessed or caused access\u201d to a computer network used by the committee staff.Mr. Brennan apologized to Senator Feinstein and the ranking Republican on the committee, Saxby Chambliss of Georgia. But that was not enough to dispel the anger among lawmakers, who viewed the snooping as a major violation of the separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches.A footnote on the spy front: Edward J. Snowden\u2019s one-year temporary political asylum in Russia ran out on Thursday, and there was no confirmation that it was being extended.Sanctions GaloreOn the Ukrainian front, the announcement of stern new sanctions on Tuesday by the European Union and the United States was followed by defiant declarations from Moscow and more fighting in eastern Ukraine. But international inspectors were finally able to reach the site of the Malaysian jetliner that was shot down on July 17.While insisting that the European Union and American sanctions would not hurt Russia, Moscow contributed to its own sanctions on Ukraine, adding fruit juice to the list of Ukrainian products banned from Russia. A Russian official said sunflower seeds, sunflower oil, soybeans and cornmeal were next on the list.The photograph of John Kerry with the Quick History column last Sunday had the wrong credit.

{"Headline": "Washington Meeting of African Leaders Opens to Protests", "Date": "2014-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Hundreds of protesters gathered outside the State Department on Monday, the start of a summit meeting here of more than 40 African heads of state, to denounce some of the leaders as \u201ctorturers\u201d and \u201ckillers.\u201dThe protesters, who were mostly from Ethiopia and the Democratic Republic of Congo, said they were angry that the White House was looking to enhance economic ties with repressive governments. \u201cStop financing dictators,\u201d the crowd chanted. \u201cPresident Obama, shame on you.\u201d\u201cNow he is sitting with strongmen,\u201d Mr. Metho said. \u201cWhere are the strong institutions?\u201dOn Tuesday, Mr. Obama will host the leaders at the White House for dinner and will then take part in a series of meetings on Wednesday, mostly focused on increasing United States investment in Africa and promoting peace and stability on the continent. As the summit meeting began, the White House also announced that it would institute new programs and foreign assistance aimed at promoting gender equality in Africa.The sessions on Monday began with a forum on supporting civil society, and the leaders heard from Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible to succeed for your people unless they have a chance to shape the policies of their government, identify problems and root out injustices and find ways for groups to resolve their differences peacefully,\u201d Mr. Biden said.Secretary of State John Kerry also addressed the leaders and met one-on-one with Joseph Kabila, president of the Democratic Republic of Congo.

The program, known as AGOA, lowers the tariffs on certain African goods imported to the United States, while countries in Africa are not obligated to lower the duties on any United States goods. It has been credited with helping to diversify and improve other sectors of the African economy, but oil still accounts for three-quarters of the African goods imported by the United States duty free.The program requires reauthorization by Congress next year, and one of the questions is whether South Africa should continue to benefit from preferential trade status, as some say that its current economic growth means that it should extend a preferential tariff system to some United States goods as well. But while speaking at a luncheon hosted by the National Press Club on Monday, President Jacob Zuma of South Africa dismissed this idea.\u201cWe look forward to a seamless, unconditional and long-term renewal of AGOA with South Africa included among the beneficiaries,\u201d Mr. Zuma said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Six Charts That Explain the Jobs Report", "Date": "2014-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBy the NumbersThe new jobs numbers are a mild disappointment, with emphasis on the mild. Yes, the total of 209,000 jobs reported to have been added to United States payrolls was a bit below the 230,000 economists were expecting, and well below the revised 298,000 of June. And yes, the unemployment rate ticked up to 6.2 percent from 6.1 percent.But those numbers are hardly the stuff of catastrophe, and the fine print Friday was more positive. Revisions to previous months\u2019 job growth numbers were slightly positive, for example, and the unemployment rate rose because some 329,000 people joined the labor force, driving up the labor force participation rate a bit.The result: Nothing about these numbers should change your basic assessment of how the economy is doing, unless you had some outlandish view of how the economy was doing to begin with. Gradual, steady expansion in the job market, and the economy more broadly, continues apace.That doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t pick apart the new numbers for some insight into how things are evolving. Here are the key trends to know.First, the most basic of numbers: American employers reported having an additional 209,000 jobs on their payrolls in July. While that was below forecasts, it is comfortably within the range of job creation of the last few years.And the uptick in the unemployment rate also was not enough to undo a sharp fall over recent months. The overall trend in the jobless rate is decisively downward.But of course the unemployment rate doesn\u2019t tell the full story. The jobless rate can rise for both good reasons (more people looking for work) and bad reasons (fewer people having a job).This is a month in which the uptick was for good reasons, with the aforementioned 329,000 increase in the labor force. While that drove the portion of Americans in the labor force (that is, either with a job or looking for one) up to 62.9 percent, it remains far below levels of just a year or two ago.But where is this job growth coming from? The numbers in the latest report were amazingly broad-based, with no major sector of the economy shedding positions. The strongest gains were in professional and business services.But what about worker pay? There, the news out of the latest report remains mediocre. The average length of the workweek for private sector workers was unchanged at 34.5 hours. Average hourly earnings ticked up only a penny, to $24.45 an hour (don\u2019t spend it all in one place).Add it all up, and average weekly earnings rose only a trivial amount, up 35 cents a week, or four one-hundreths of a percent. Inflation data for July has not been published yet, but based on recent readings, the 2 percent gain in private-sector hourly pay over the last 12 months is barely enough to keep up with rising prices. A new report Friday, for example, showed a 1.7 percent rise in consumer prices for the 12 months ended in June.And for a rare bonus sixth chart (for something we only noticed after our initial pass through the report), take a look at the payroll employment gains over the past year. Since 2012, the number has bounced around between 2 million and 2.5 million. But with the July report, the number has finally broken out of that range and recorded a 12-month job gain of 2.57 million.That is the speediest rate of job creation for any 12-month period in the current expansion, and is a pace of job creation last exceeded in the 12 months ended in April 2006. Progress has been glacially slow, but the pace of job creation is indeed on a gradual upward trend.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Beep,\u2019 Says the Bellhop", "Date": "2014-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCUPERTINO, Calif. \u2014 Think of it as the Terminator\u2019s human-friendly sibling.In a hotel lobby across the street from Apple\u2019s corporate campus, a desk clerk places a razor in the bin of a three-foot-high robot and taps in a room number on a display. The robot, \u201cBotlr,\u201d chirps an R2-D2-style acknowledgment and rolls off to an elevator and its final destination.\u00a0On Aug. 20, the Aloft hotel here will begin testing this robotic bellhop, a wheeled service vehicle designed to shuttle items from the hotel lobby desk to guest rooms. Whether a gimmick or a sign of things to come, Botlr is the latest among a new generation of robots \u2014 like Google\u2019s self-driving car, Aetheon\u2019s Tug hospital supply robot and Caddytrek\u2019s electric golf caddy \u2014 that are starting to walk or roll around the everyday world.Not surprisingly, these robotic baby steps toward the mainstream have led to hand-wringing: What are the consequences of smarter-than-us artificial intelligence as seen in movies like \u201cHer\u201d and \u201cTranscendence\u201d? And will the next stage of machine automation lead to more job elimination?Aloft Hotels and Savioke (pronounced \u201csavvy-oak\u201d), the Silicon Valley start-up that designed Botlr, insist that they are not interested in automation as a labor-saving tool. They say they are simply polishing the small hotel chain\u2019s tech-embracing brand while hoping to add some efficiency.\u201cI see this as an enhancement to our customer service,\u201d said Brian McGuinness, Starwood Hotels\u2019 senior vice president for its Specialty Select brands, which include the 100 Aloft hotels expected to be opened in 14 countries by next year. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a replacement for our human talent.\u201dIndeed, for all the discussion of robots intruding on everyday life, a robot\u2019s ability to perform anything beyond basic tasks is still very much the stuff of lab experiments. Most robots are, in fact, either simple autonomous vacuum cleaners made by companies like iRobot or several types of lawn mowers and trimmers. The International Federation of Robotics reported that 16,067 professional service robots were sold internationally in 2012, only 2 percent more than the 15,776 sold in 2011.\u201cThe collaborative robot application, whether it\u2019s in factories, hospitals or restaurants, has a big future,\u201d said Jeff Burnstein, president of the Robotic Industries Association. \u201cBut it\u2019s been very slow in terms of nonfactory applications to emerge. It\u2019s still going to be a while.\u201d\u00a0Starwood uses the Aloft hotel near the Apple campus as a test bed for the technology-oriented hotel chain\u2019s newest gadgets and services. They experiment with things like easy ways to get digital content from your smartphone and tablet onto your hotel room\u2019s television screen. And, of course, you can unlock the door of your hotel room with an app on your smartphone.So it was only natural that hotel executives were receptive when Savioke, a robotics start-up in Santa Clara, Calif., cold-called Starwood earlier this year with the proposal that the Aloft chain add a service robot to its array of \u201ctech forward\u201d gadgets and services.Beyond having a butler\u2019s \u201ccollar\u201d painted on its chest, Botlr is not humanoid in appearance and it is not meant to appear male or female. Indeed, it looks a little bit like R2-D2 might appear if it had been put on a diet. Or perhaps like a miniaturized nuclear power plant\u2019s cooling tower.It would not generate a second glance if it were stationary in a hotel lobby. But on the move, it can reach speeds of up to four miles per hour. That\u2019s about the pace of a brisk walk, and adequate for Botlr to hustle razors, toothbrushes, smartphone chargers, snacks and even the morning paper to any of the hotel\u2019s 150 rooms in two to three minutes.When the robot reaches the guest\u2019s door, the system calls the room, alerting the guest to the delivery.The robot, which has a camera and other sensors, can recognize that the room door has been opened and then lift the lid on the storage bin that holds the delivery. A flat panel display at the top of the robot is used for the guest to enter a \u201creview\u201d rather than giving a tip. In return for a positive review, the robot will do a small dance before it departs.Perhaps the most impressive capability of the new robot is its ability to independently make its way to upper floors. When it reaches the elevator, it wirelessly sends a command for the door to open and then maneuvers into the elevator car, taking care to stay out of the way of any human passengers.When it returns to the lobby, Botlr can plug itself into a recharging station while it awaits its next errand.Savioke was founded last year by Steve Cousins, a former IBM and Xerox Parc research manager who more recently was president and chief executive of Willow Garage, a Silicon Valley robotics laboratory founded in 2006 by Scott Hassan, who wrote Google\u2019s first search engine.Before entering into an agreement with Starwood to deploy delivery robots, Mr. Cousins said that Savioke was interested in a range of service industry applications like assisted living facilities and hotels. The company would not disclose how much the robots cost.Like Mr. McGuinness, Mr. Cousins deflected questions that robots would displace jobs, and pointed out that the company\u2019s motto was \u201cRobots for humanity.\u201d\u201cOver time we want to help all people, but especially people with disabilities,\u201d he said. He added that he shared the perspective of economists who believe that while technology may destroy particular job types, over all the economy will continue to grow and new kinds of jobs will be created by high tech.The number of jobs in the world, he argued, has grown since society began automating.\u201cIf you really want to create a lot of jobs, just outlaw tractors,\u201d he said. \u201cThe work force would have to go back on the farm, but nobody is willing to do that.\u201dAs a hotel application, however, he said he saw the initial version of his simple delivery robot as freeing up the hotel desk clerk from having to run up to the room, giving the staff more time with the guests.Botlr will have a Twitter hashtag, #MeetBotlr, but Mr. Cousins said he did not expect robotics technology to advance quickly enough to permit the robot to mimic the obsequiousness of a human bellboy looking for a nice tip. Or even a favorable review.An article on Tuesday about the use of a robot to deliver items to guest rooms at the Aloft hotel in Cupertino, Calif., misspelled the surname of the president of the Robotic Industries Association in some editions. He is Jeff Burnstein, not Bernstein.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Central Bankers\u2019 New Gospel: Spur Jobs, Wages and Inflation", "Date": "2014-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisJACKSON HOLE, Wyo. \u2014 The last time the economic policy conference held here every August devoted its agenda to labor markets, it was 1994 and the Federal Reserve\u2019s vice chairman scandalized the audience by suggesting central banks worried too much about reducing inflation and not enough about unemployment.Twenty years later, heresy has become gospel. Leaders of the world\u2019s major central banks made clear in speeches at this year\u2019s conference, which ended Saturday, that they were focused on raising employment and wages. The pursuit of lower inflation has been replaced by a conviction that inflation is actually too low for the good of the economy.Haruhiko Kuroda, who leads the Bank of Japan, said it was committed to increasing its own campaign until annual inflation rose to 2 percent.Looming over the conference, however, was the reality that central banks had made limited progress toward achieving these new goals. They also face mounting questions about how much more they have the power to do. The Fed and the Bank of England have achieved slow progress, but both confront growing internal opposition from critics who say monetary policy is reaching the limits of its ability to improve economic conditions. The European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan have accomplished little, and they must decide how much harder to try. Dennis P. Lockhart, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said it was \u201cvery challenging\u201d to determine \u201chow much work is left to be done by monetary policy.\u201d But in a reflection of the sea change in central banking, he added that he would rather err on the side of driving down unemployment rather than retreating too soon. (According to commonly held economic theories, pushing unemployment too low normally would cause inflation to rise.) \u201cI would be concerned about being early or premature and then, for whatever reason \u2014 which could be something out of the blue \u2014 finding that in fact we have a reversal on our hands,\u201d Mr. Lockhart said. \u201cThat\u2019s more of a concern to me than being maybe a little slow to begin the normalization of interest rates.\u201dMr. Draghi similarly suggested that something fundamental had changed.It was dogma for a generation that central banks should focus above all on stabilizing inflation, and that doing so would stabilize the economy, too. The impression that this worked was reinforced by a long period of apparent success that a former Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, once called \u201cThe Great Moderation.\u201dThe crisis and its aftermath, however, suggested that this relationship between inflation and economic stability was just a coincidence. In the cautious formulation of Ben Broadbent, a deputy governor of the Bank of England who addressed the conference on Saturday, \u201cthe divine coincidence may no longer apply.\u201dThe Fed operates under a congressional mandate to maximize employment as well as minimizing inflation. In practice, it had largely ignored that mandate until employment failed to recover in the aftermath of the crisis. Now Ms. Yellen, like Mr. Bernanke before her, has made job growth the central focus of Fed\u2019s stimulus campaign.Mr. Broadbent said the Bank of England, required by law to focus on inflation, had also concluded that it needed to consider labor markets, too.\u201cThe performance during most of the inflation-targeting period suggests that we could have done better with some other kind of target,\u201d he said.But in focusing on jobs, both banks have found another old truth crumbling under their feet. The unemployment rate, long taken as the best indicator of the labor market, has proved to be an unreliable gauge in this recovery.In 2012, the Fed started a drive to push the most common measure of unemployment \u2014 which only counts those actively looking for work \u2014 below 6.5 percent. Success came more quickly than it expected, but officials concluded that the progress in the unemployment rate overstated the health of the labor market because many more people than in the past were not even looking for work. Tellingly, wages have remained relatively stagnant, suggesting that employers are still finding an overabundance of workers.The Bank of England said last year that it aimed to push unemployment below 7 percent within two years. It took only eight months, but there, too, wage growth has disappointed.James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, said the unemployment rate, currently at 6.2 percent, remained the best gauge of the economy. \u201cIt\u2019s been our workhorse indicator and there\u2019s a good reason for that,\u201d he said.But both the Fed and the Bank of England have said they are now looking at wage inflation as well as price inflation to gauge how close the economy is to running at capacity.\u201cMost of us have come to the conclusion that we can\u2019t just look at the unemployment rate anymore,\u201d Mr. Blinder said in an interview. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge change and a kind of confession of our ignorance or uncertainty about the labor market.\u201dJohn C. Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said the Fed was mounting an intensive research effort \u2014 and benefiting from the parallel efforts of academics \u2014 to better understand labor markets.Mr. Williams contrasted these research successes with the 1970s, when he said policy makers were slow to understand structural changes in the economy, in part because they failed to look and in part because they failed to listen.\u201cThey were unrealistic about how low you could get unemployment, and although adjustments eventually occurred, it took a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I look at what\u2019s been happening here, research started immediately and now we have the data and resources to evaluate our views much more quickly.\u201d Mr. Williams said that while the exact location of the finish line might be unclear, it was clear the Fed remained some distance away. \u201cWe\u2019re still in a situation where the indicators are clearly on the side that the economy is too weak,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen unemployment gets closer to a normal level, then these judgments become more difficult.\u201d Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Lost in America", "Date": "2014-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMore and more I\u2019m convinced that America right now isn\u2019t a country dealing with a mere dip in its mood and might. It\u2019s a country surrendering to a new identity and era, in which optimism is quaint and the frontier anything but endless.There\u2019s a feeling of helplessness that makes the political horizon, including the coming midterm elections, especially unpredictable. Conventional wisdom has seldom been so useless, because pessimism in this country isn\u2019t usually this durable or profound.Americans are apprehensive about where they are and even more so about where they\u2019re going. But they don\u2019t see anything or anyone to lead them into the light. They\u2019re sour on the president, on the Democratic Party and on Republicans most of all. They\u2019re hungry for hope but don\u2019t spot it on the menu. Where that tension leaves us is anybody\u2019s guess.It included the jolting finding that 76 percent of Americans ages 18 and older weren\u2019t confident that their children\u2019s generation would fare better than their own. That\u2019s a blunt repudiation of the very idea of America, of what the \u201cland of opportunity\u201d is supposed to be about. For most voters, the national narrative is no longer plausible.The poll also showed that 71 percent thought that the country was on the wrong track. While that represents a spike, it also affirms a negative mind-set that\u2019s been fixed for a scarily long time. As the Democratic strategist Doug Sosnik has repeatedly noted, more Americans have been saying \u201cwrong track\u201d than \u201cright track\u201d for at least a decade now, and something\u2019s got to give.But to what or whom can Americans turn?So we can expect to see a huge turnover in Congress after the midterms, right?That\u2019s a rhetorical question, and a joke. Congress wasn\u2019t in any great favor in 2012, and 90 percent of the House members and 91 percent of the senators who sought re-election won it. The tyranny of money, patronage, name recognition and gerrymandering in American politics guaranteed as much. Small wonder that 79 percent of Americans indicated dissatisfaction with the system in the Journal/NBC poll.Conventional wisdom says that President Obama\u2019s anemic approval ratings will haunt Democrats. But it doesn\u2019t take into account how effectively some Republicans continue to sully their party\u2019s image. It doesn\u2019t factor in how broadly Americans\u2019 disapproval spreads out.Conventional wisdom says that better unemployment and job-creation numbers could save Democrats. But many Americans aren\u2019t feeling those improvements. When asked in the Journal/NBC poll if the country was in a recession \u2014 which it\u2019s not \u2014 49 percent of respondents said yes, while 46 percent said no.The new jobs don\u2019t feel as sturdy as the old ones. It takes more hours to make the same money or support the same lifestyle. Students amass debt. Upward mobility increasingly seems a mirage, a myth.\u201cPeople are mad at Democrats,\u201d John Hickenlooper, the Democratic governor of Colorado, told me. \u201cBut they\u2019re certainly not happy with Republicans. They\u2019re mad at everything.\u201d That\u2019s coming from the leader of a state whose unemployment rate is down to 5.3 percent.And it suggests that this isn\u2019t just about the economy. It\u2019s about fear. It\u2019s about impotence. We can\u2019t calm the world in the way we\u2019d like to, can\u2019t find common ground and peace at home, can\u2019t pass needed laws, can\u2019t build necessary infrastructure, can\u2019t, can\u2019t, can\u2019t.In the Journal/NBC poll, 60 percent of Americans said that we were a nation in decline. How sad. Sadder still was this: Nowhere in the survey was there any indication that they saw a method or a messenger poised to arrest it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "While Some in G.O.P. See Obama\u2019s Competence as Rich Vein to Mine, Others See Little Reward", "Date": "2014-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical MemoWASHINGTON \u2014 In the Republicans\u2019 campaign for the grand prize of the midterm elections, control of the Senate, some party strategists say the key to winning a majority comes down to one word \u2014 competence \u2014 and voters\u2019 perception that President Obama lacks it. Apparently, that is debatable, even among Republicans.The year \u201c2014 is going to be defined as a competency election, and which party does a better job of saying they can make the government function,\u201d said Brad Dayspring, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. \u201cRight now, the perception is that it\u2019s doing everything wrong\u201d under Mr. Obama.There is little dispute that Mr. Obama is a significant drag on Democratic candidates given his low approval ratings, especially in Southern states where many competitive Senate races are unfolding. But even some Republicans say that Mr. Obama\u2019s competence is not this election\u2019s defining issue, or much of an issue at all except among conservatives who have never liked him.\u201cHis problem is that too many people aren\u2019t sure they like where he\u2019s led us, or that they want to go further for two more years,\u201d said Stuart Rothenberg, editor of the nonpartisan Rothenberg Political Report. \u201cThey think he\u2019s smart. They do think he\u2019s a little distant and a little detached. But is the problem that he\u2019s incompetent? I don\u2019t think that people think that.\u201dAlex Castellanos, a Republican strategist, said that making competence a campaign centerpiece was \u201cthe fool\u2019s gold of politics\u201d \u2014 rarely successful.\u201cDo Republicans really want to make the argument that if only President Obama were a better manager, Obamacare would have been great for the country?\u201d he said. \u201cThat our outdated and bureaucratic V.A. system would have run like a clock? Do we really want to make the argument that our sclerotic, paralyzed, overburdened government just needs one guy to manage it better?\u201dAnother Republican strategist, who asked not to be identified criticizing party colleagues, said that raising the question of governing competence could be double-edged for Republicans. Indeed, many Democrats are reminding voters that the Republicans who run the House shut down the government last fall at a cost of $24 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and have repeatedly been divided and dysfunctional, most recently in struggling to pass a bill to address the border crisis.\u201cTime and time again, House Republicans have shown they are completely incapable of governing,\u201d said Matt Canter, a spokesman for the Senate Democrats\u2019 campaign committee. \u201cNothing says incompetence like the Republican brand.\u201dOf House Republicans who are candidates in five Senate battlegrounds \u2014 Arkansas, Colorado, Louisiana, Montana and West Virginia \u2014 the two in Montana and West Virginia are considered all but certain to win seats currently held by Democrats, while the other three are in tight races.Yet Andrew Kohut, founder of the nonpartisan Pew Research Center, is among those who say such findings do not suggest that the midterm elections will be a referendum on Mr. Obama\u2019s competence. \u201cThe public is unhappy with the performance of both parties in Washington,\u201d he said.What will shape the results? Mr. Kohut said that all elections were basically a referendum on the times and that, more than five years after the recession and 2008 financial collapse, \u201cwe\u2019ve got a chronic case of pessimism.\u201d That leaves Democrats at a disadvantage, he said, despite Republicans\u2019 record-low popularity, since \u201cDemocrats are seen as in charge because Obama is the president. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s more complicated than that.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re talking about a lot of different elections here, and they\u2019re not all about one thing,\u201d said Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster whose clients include Senate candidates. Typically, the president\u2019s party loses seats in midterm elections, he said, and to the extent that Mr. Obama is hurting Democrats among voters, \u201cthat does not necessarily mean their views of the president\u2019s competence is the reason.\u201d He added, \u201cWhat it means is that people are much more partisan today.\u201dJoel Benenson, a pollster for Mr. Obama, said: \u201cThe issue in this election is going to be the economic contrast between Democrats and Republicans. And it\u2019s a very strong contrast for Democrats, because Democrats have an agenda and a set of policies that demonstrate they are squarely fighting for working- and middle-class Americans.\u201dDavid Winston, a Republican pollster who advises House leaders, gave his party the edge, but he agreed that the midterm elections were \u201cgoing to come down to one basic issue: jobs and the economy, and who the voters have more confidence in, in terms of what\u2019s being proposed.\u201d\u201cCompetence plays into that: Can you get it done?\u201d he added. \u201cBut it\u2019s just a piece.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Turkey\u2019s Premier Is Proclaimed Winner of Presidential Election", "Date": "2014-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byISTANBUL \u2014 Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has led Turkey for more than a decade, is set to become the country\u2019s first popularly elected president, apparently cruising to a victory on Sunday that positioned him to be the dominant political figure here for at least five more years.The news media declared the victory even though official results will not be published for several days. It came after the most tumultuous year of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s tenure in national politics, when he was challenged by sweeping antigovernment protests and a corruption investigation focused on him and those around him. He has emerged not only as a survivor but as someone who, analysts predict, will look to expand his power from the office of the presidency.Mr. Erdogan took 52 percent of the vote, the highest percentage in his political career, according to provisional results published by the semiofficial Anadolu News Agency, which proclaimed him the winner. Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, a former diplomat who was the candidate of the main secular and nationalist parties, received 38 percent.Thousands massed at the headquarters of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s Justice and Development Party, or A.K.P., in Ankara and erupted in applause late Sunday when he appeared on a balcony to greet them.\u201cI will not be the president of only those who voted for me,\u201d Mr. Erdogan, 60, said in a speech carried live on television, often interrupted by loud cheers. \u201cI will be the president of 77 million. I will be the president who embraces all with affection.\u201d He continued: \u201cToday, no one should have the feeling that they have lost, as Turkey\u2019s future is brighter than yesterday. The direction of the nation is much brighter than yesterday.\u201dFireworks were set off at the end of his address, in which he advocated reconciliation, a common theme in his previous victory speeches. \u201cI want us to build a new future with an understanding of societal reconciliation, while considering our differences as our richnesses and bringing forward our common values,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said.Turnout was about 74 percent, CNN Turk reported, relatively low for Turkey, presumably because many had assumed Mr. Erdogan would win. Even though the election felt like a coronation, a great deal is at stake for the Turkish political system. Arguing that he has a popular mandate to do so, Mr. Erdogan is expected to maximize the powers of the presidency \u2014 a post that is less powerful than that of prime minister, limited in part by the Constitution and in part by tradition.To lead from the presidency he would, in practice, need to retain the reins of the Islamist A.K.P., despite being required by law to step down as its official head. By doing so, analysts say, Mr. Erdogan could then choose a malleable figure to be prime minister. He is also expected to push for legislation that would establish a presidential system, much like in the United States, a change that would upend the nature of Turkish politics.While the office is often described as ceremonial, Turkey\u2019s president has the ability to veto legislation, appoint judges and call national security meetings. And analysts say Mr. Erdogan is likely to exercise powers that former presidents chose not to use, such as calling cabinet meetings.Under Mr. Erdogan\u2019s watch, Turkey\u2019s military has been sidelined from its traditional role in politics through a series of controversial trials. The country has also become an economic power, and Mr. Erdogan\u2019s constituency of religious conservatives benefited greatly through higher incomes and better public services.\u201cThis country needs a strong, fierce president who can secure the economy and fight foreign threats and terrorists,\u201d Habiye Dorsay, 43, said after voting in the Uskudar district. \u201cNo one other than Erdogan is capable for the job.\u201d\u201cHe is power happy and arrogant, serving only half of the population that supports him, while the other half he deems irrelevant,\u201d said Eren Kurban, 32, who voted in the Besiktas neighborhood.Mr. Erdogan is to be inaugurated as president on Aug. 28, replacing his longtime partner in Turkish Islamist politics, Abdullah Gul. Many speculate that it will ultimately be Mr. Gul who becomes prime minister after national elections next year.Past presidents who previously served as prime minister, like Turgut Ozal and Suleyman Demirel, underestimated the autonomy and resilience of their parties and became disgruntled as they lost control of governance. If Mr. Erdogan is able to orchestrate the appointment of a compliant interim prime minister, he is expected to influence decisions and continue to run the government until he fulfills his long-term ambition of replacing the parliamentary system with a presidential one.Having served three terms as prime minister, Mr. Erdogan is prevented from seeking a fourth by the internal rules of his party.\u201cMembers of the A.K.P. fear and respect Erdogan at the same time,\u201d said Soner Cagaptay, director of the Turkish Research Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \u201cIt won\u2019t be hard for him to pull rank over the party, even when he resigns from the A.K.P.\u201dCeylan Yeginsu reported from Istanbul, and Sebnem Arsu from Ankara, Turkey.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Two Good Omens for Housing Market", "Date": "2014-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter a harsh winter, the nation\u2019s modest housing recovery appears to be back on track. Home construction increased sharply in July, the Commerce Department reported on Tuesday, as Home Depot, whose fate is tied closely to the housing market, announced a strong quarter. The government said housing starts last month were up nearly 16 percent over June, and almost 22 percent over 12 months ago. For Home Depot, the country\u2019s largest home improvement retailer, the uptick in demand gave second-quarter earnings a lift. Big-ticket purchases, like appliances, windows and water heaters, increased. The company also reported strong growth among its high-spending professional clients \u2014 which indicates that they have work. \u201cWe believe, in many ways, it\u2019s because of housing, and the fact that housing, while not as robust as last year, continues to recover,\u201d Carol B. Tom\u00e9, Home Depot\u2019s chief financial officer, said of the company\u2019s strong results.Though Tuesday\u2019s numbers from both the government and Home Depot were each higher than analysts anticipated, economists did not expect to see similar types of surges in housing in the months to come. Some of July\u2019s gains reported by the Commerce Department were in the South, a huge market that showed improvement in both single and multifamily construction after drying out from an exceptionally rainy and muddy spring. Other bright spots in Tuesday\u2019s report were in the multifamily sector, but economists regard those month-to-month numbers as volatile. Last month\u2019s housing starts were at an annual rate of 1.093 million units, the highest reading since November. Single-family housing starts in July increased 8.3 percent over the revised June figure of 606,000, and were at a rate of 656,000. The July rate for multifamily housing was 423,000, showing the strongest level of starts since 2006. In another positive sign, July applications for building permits, which foreshadow construction plans for future, were up 8.1 percent over the previous month.Most analysts viewed July\u2019s big leap as having little impact on overall trends in housing, where price increases are slowing down.\u201cWith the stock of homes for sale well above its cycle lows, price gains slowing and new-home sales flat, it is hard to see why construction would keep rising,\u201d Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a note to clients.Several major factors are holding up the housing recovery. Household formation is almost flat, and well below the 50-year average, said Tom Showalter, chief analytics officer at Digital Risk, which provides mortgage services and risk analytics to lenders. Also, wage growth, which drives housing prices, is still sluggish. A growing economy and improvements in the job market must continue to keep the housing market on track, Mr. Showalter said. He expects home price appreciation to level off and potentially become negative by the end of the year.\u201cWe\u2019re getting some increased demand, so that\u2019s very good,\u201d Mr. Showalter said. \u201cThe question is, Can the economy sustain the demand? And that\u2019s a big if.\u201d The most crucial housing metric to home improvement retailers is home price appreciation, Ms. Tom\u00e9 said. When people see their home as an investment, she said, they are more likely to spend money on it than if they see their home as an expense. So as home values rise and people see more equity in their home, they are more likely to spend money to spruce it up. While home price appreciation growth is lower than it was last year, Ms. Tom\u00e9 said, \u201cIt\u2019s still good news; it\u2019s still headed in the right direction.\u201d The company said it now expected diluted earnings per share to be up about 20.2 percent, to $4.52 for the year. Its previous guidance was $4.42.The good news comes at a crucial time of the year for Home Depot as spring is the most important selling season for home improvement retailers. Those warming months are when consumers head into the garden to tend their flowers or go up on a ladder to patch the roof or replace the windows. But weather can be a big factor in a consumer\u2019s decision to start a home improvement project that will require many hours outdoors.For the first quarter, which includes the beginning of the spring selling season \u2014 and the end of an extraordinarily cold and difficult winter \u2014 the company reported disappointing results. Sales at existing stores in the Northeast declined from the year before, and sales at existing stores in its Southern and Western divisions increased.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed Official Warns \u2018Disappointing\u2019 Growth Could Foretell Future", "Date": "2014-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySounding a somber note even as the economic outlook in the United States brightens, the Federal Reserve\u2019s No. 2 official acknowledged on Monday that global growth had been \u201cdisappointing\u201d and warned of fundamental headwinds that might temper future gains.The official, Stanley Fischer, who took over as vice chairman of the Fed in June, noted that although the weak recovery might simply be fallout from the financial crisis and the recession, \u201cit is also possible that the underperformance reflects a more structural, longer-term shift in the global economy.\u201d\u201cYear after year, we have had to explain from midyear on why the global growth rate has been lower than predicted as little as two quarters back,\u201d he said. \u201cThis slowing is broad-based, with performance in emerging Asia, importantly China, stepping down sharply from the postcrisis surge, to rates significantly below the average pace in the decade before the crisis.\u201dMr. Fischer said it was difficult to determine how much of the slackness was because of cyclical factors and how much represented a more fundamental, structural change in advanced economies.But he warned of three pronounced headwinds that have held back growth in the United States: a still anemic housing market, cuts in federal government spending and weaker global growth that reduced demand for American exports.A report on Monday by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development warned that German economic growth might be slowing. Germany has been one of Europe\u2019s rare bright spots, continuing to prosper even as countries on the periphery like Greece, Portugal and Spain struggle after the debt crisis of 2010-12.After a very weak start to the year amid harsh wintry weather, economic growth in the United States has been increasing. Economists estimate that the American economy expanded at an annual rate of 4 percent in the second quarter, and are looking for the growth rate to remain at around 3 percent for the rest of 2014.As a result, despite Mr. Fischer\u2019s cautious tone on Monday, the Fed is planning to begin raising short-term interest rates next year, the first time it has tightened monetary policy since the onset of the recession.On Wall Street, Mr. Fischer\u2019s caution was not greeted negatively. Some traders were encouraged that it appeared that the Fed was in no rush to raise interest rates.In addition to the three headwinds Mr. Fischer blamed for slowing growth in the last five years, he cited several long-term factors that could inhibit prosperity in the future.One major worry is the slowing growth in the size of the American labor force, both because of demographic factors like the retirement of baby boomers and the legions of workers who have given up looking for jobs.Noting that the proportion of Americans in the work force has been dropping steadily since 2000 \u2014 it has fallen to 62.9 percent now from 67 percent then \u2014 he said, \u201cMany of those who dropped out of the labor force may be discouraged workers.\u201dAnd while some people may return to the work force as the unemployment rate continues to drop \u2014 it now stands at 6.2 percent compared with 8.2 percent two years ago \u2014 he cautioned that \u201cskills and networks may have depreciated some over the past years.\u201dLooking further ahead, Mr. Fischer also waded into one of fiercest debates in economics \u2014 the question of whether recent anemic growth is a temporary, cyclical phenomenon or a more fundamental one that will last for decades or more.Despite the gloomy tone of other parts of his speech, on this question Mr. Fischer hinted that he remains something of an optimist.\u201cPossibly we are moving into a period of slower productivity growth,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I for one continue to be amazed at the potential for improving the quality of the lives of most people in the world that the I.T. explosion has already revealed.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Growth Without Jobs", "Date": "2014-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThose cautionary views were validated on Friday, when the employment report for July showed slower job growth, flat earnings, stagnant hours and stubbornly high long-term unemployment. The challenge now, as always, is to translate official concern over the job market into change for the better. The economy added 209,000 jobs last month, a decent enough figure in and of itself, but a slow start to the third quarter compared with the average monthly gain of 277,000 last quarter. Worse, July\u2019s relatively slow pace of growth may not be sustainable. Many of last month\u2019s job gains were in automobile manufacturing, which could reflect a statistical blip from shorter-than-usual factory shutdowns in July rather than new positions added.In its statement, the Fed said it was basically a tossup whether the economy would speed up or slow down. Faster growth, however, generally requires a healthy real estate market and that requires a healthy job market, especially for younger workers. But in July, the jobless rate for workers ages 25 to 34 was 6.6 percent, compared with 6.2 percent over all. Among young people who are working, many are in low-wage or part-time jobs, or jobs that otherwise do not make use of their education or experience. So it is not surprising that the sale of new homes plummeted recently at the fastest pace in nearly a year. Sales of existing homes have risen, a positive sign but a questionable trend given the still-ailing job market. The most likely scenario is for the economy to continue to muddle along at an overall annual pace of 2 percent to 2.5 percent. The Fed has affirmed its commitment to keep interest rates low until the labor market recovers, but the real test of its resolve will come if and when inflation meets or exceeds its preferred annual rate of 2 percent. In a sluggish economy with significant employment slack, continued stimulus policy would be called for even if inflation exceeded the target, but whether the Fed will oblige is unknown. None of that is enough to counter significantly the forces responsible for job growth that is too weak, wages that are too low and workweeks that are too short. For that, a functional political climate is needed, one in which leaders find compromise solutions to the nation\u2019s problems. Without that, the Fed\u2019s modest prediction that the economy has an even chance of getting better may in fact be too optimistic. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed Dissenters Increasingly Vocal About Inflation Fears", "Date": "2014-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 An increasingly vocal minority of Federal Reserve officials want the central bank to retreat more quickly from its stimulus campaign, arguing that the bank has largely exhausted its ability to improve economic conditions.The debate, reflected in an account of the Fed\u2019s most recent policy-making meeting published on Wednesday, is likely to dominate the gathering of central bankers and economists at Jackson Hole, Wyo., Thursday through Saturday.Fed officials are convinced that the economy is gaining strength after the years of false starts, but a majority of policy makers, led by the chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, favors a slow retreat from the Fed\u2019s efforts to encourage job creation. They note that millions of people still cannot find jobs, while inflation remains relatively weak.At the July meeting, however, a number of officials described a growing risk that the Fed\u2019s control of inflation is being loosened by its focus on job creation. They note that the economy has improved more quickly than expected in recent months. The remaining damage caused by the Great Recession, in this view, can no longer be repaired by keeping interest rates low through the Fed\u2019s primary policy tool.Officials, in other words, disagree about the proximity of the finish line.Some analysts saw evidence that the Fed\u2019s internal critics were exerting growing influence over the course of policy, suggesting that the Fed was becoming a little more likely to raise interest rates before the middle of 2015, now considered the most likely time for the Fed to begin raising rates from the near-zero level it has maintained since late 2008. \u201cSome of the centrists appear to be acknowledging the rapid improvement in labor market conditions,\u201d wrote Paul Dales, senior United States economist at Capital Economics.Others said the debate was merely becoming more polarized, with the majority remaining firm in its views. \u201cWe continue to believe that the Fed will not move until at least mid-2015 despite some of the hawkish rhetoric which has recently grown louder,\u201d wrote Michael Dolega, senior economist at the TD Bank Group.Investors, too, appeared to share the uncertainty about the meaning of the minutes. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose after the Fed released the minutes at 2 p.m., then disgorged some of those gains, but still closed up for the day at 2.43 percent. Stocks first fell, then rebounded to pass the earlier high. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index ended at 1,986.51, up 0.25 percent on the day.Ms. Yellen is scheduled to speak Friday morning at Jackson Hole, and she is expected to discuss the state of labor markets. The annual conference, hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, has sometimes served as a platform for Fed leaders to signal policy changes, but more often as a highly publicized chance to explain their views.The conference, this year on the theme of \u201cRe-evaluating Labor Market Dynamics,\u201d also is expected to offer an opening to Ms. Yellen\u2019s critics, both internal and external, to press their side of the case. The president of the Kansas City Fed, Esther George, is among the strongest advocates of a faster retreat by the Fed.One potential motivation for an earlier retreat has lost some of its urgency. The account said officials did not see much evidence that markets were overheating.\u201cParticipants noted evidence of valuation pressures in some particular asset markets, but those pressures did not appear to be widespread and other measures of vulnerability in the financial system were at low to moderate levels,\u201d it said.But the unemployment rate has fallen more quickly than the Fed predicted at the beginning of the year. It stood at 6.2 percent in July. Price inflation has lately shown some signs of reviving, although it remains below the 2 percent annual pace the Fed regards as healthy.Most officials, according to the minutes, take the view that the unemployment rate overstates progress in the labor markets, because an unusually large number of Americans have stopped looking for work but are likely to resume their searches as the economy improves. Ms. Yellen has frequently espoused this view.Wage growth also remains slow. The Fed for the first time described the slow pace of wage gains as a threat to growth.But the question, increasingly, is whether these problems can be solved, or significantly improved, by easy monetary policy.The Fed\u2019s staff economists, who prepare a forecast for the policy makers, once again in July reduced their estimate of the maximum sustainable pace of growth and, in effect, their judgment of how many people were likely to return to work.The account underscored that Ms. Yellen and her allies are not saying that the minority is wrong, but that the evidence is unclear. Policy, the Fed has said repeatedly, marches to the beat of the economic data. \u201cMany participants noted that if convergence toward the committee\u2019s objectives occurred more quickly than expected, it might become appropriate to begin removing monetary policy accommodation sooner than they currently anticipated,\u201d the account said.One committee member, Charles I. Plosser, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, dissented at the July meeting, arguing that there was already reason enough for the Fed to change course. The minutes said officials also were \u201cincreasingly uncomfortable with the committee\u2019s forward guidance\u201d that the Fed expects to maintain its key short-term rate at its low level for some time.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Europe\u2019s Economy Stumbles, Britain Offers Some Glimmer of Hope", "Date": "2014-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Britain, once described as the \u201csick man of Europe,\u201d now looks like the region\u2019s bright spot.Buoyed in part by stimulus efforts, Britain has been showing healthy gains in recent months, a nascent rebound highlighted by the latest economic revisions on Friday. Its improving fortunes call further attention to the new weakness in the eurozone, which is again flirting with the prospect of recession.The situation shows the tenuous nature of the European recovery, which has been punctuated by successes and setbacks.Such divergence was on display in the second quarter.The eurozone stumbled; Germany\u2019s gross domestic product contracted 0.2 percent over the first quarter, according to data released on Thursday. The French economy, the second-largest in the 18-member bloc, stagnated.By comparison, Britain\u2019s showed resilience, increasing 0.8 percent in the second quarter, according to the updated data released on Friday. On a year-over-year basis, its G.D.P. rose 3.2 percent, up slightly from the preliminary estimate of 3.1 percent published last month.Even so, Britain\u2019s economy remains in a shaky position \u2014 like that of much of Europe.Britain has grown faster mainly because of a combination of cheap money, an easing in austerity measures and a booming \u2014 some say overheating \u2014 property market. Core economic sectors like manufacturing, though, have recently lost steam. And exports could be hurt by the rising value of the pound, up 10 percent from a year ago.It has also been playing catch-up. Britain\u2019s economy reached its precrisis levels only in the second quarter of this year, while Germany and France hit that mark three years ago.\u201cBasically the U.K. is growing faster than the core eurozone countries after doing very, very poorly over the past seven years,\u201d Robert Wood, an analyst at Berenberg Bank, said. \u201cThis is by no means an amazing economic achievement.\u201dThe environment presents a conundrum for British policy makers.If they keep credit cheap for much longer, they risk stoking a bubble. But if they take their foot off the stimulus pedal too soon, demand might collapse and with it the recovery.Bolstering the housing market and people\u2019s ability to buy homes they could otherwise not afford has been one way for the conservative government of Prime Minister David Cameron to lift the construction sector and fuel a recovery. Its so-called Help-to-Buy program offers first-time buyers interest-free credit or guarantees part of the property loan.But such efforts have also contributed to skyrocketing home prices. House prices were up 10 percent year on year in June and were nearly twice that in London.After gross mortgage lending surged 17 percent in the 12 months through June, Mark J. Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, hinted in July that higher rates might be needed to cool the market. But he has not budged and most analysts predict the bank will keep interest rates at their 0.5 percent low through early next year.That\u2019s because the recovery has been schizophrenic. Although unemployment has fallen to levels unthinkable a year ago \u2014 it currently stands at 6.4 percent \u2014 that has not translated into higher productivity or wages.Pay for workers in Britain is expected to grow just 1.25 percent in 2014, at half the pace predicted as recently as May, and below the rate of inflation of about 2 percent. And for the best part of five years, Britain has recorded no growth in productivity \u2014 a measure of G.D.P. per hour worked. The Bank of England is projecting productivity to increase about 0.25 percent this year and 1.75 percent in 2016.Mr. Carney said at a news conference this week that a \u201csustained expansion here at home will ultimately require growth in productivity and real incomes, both of which have disappointed.\u201dAdding to the skittish mood is a jumpy business establishment. Confidence among bosses fell between the second and third quarters of 2014, according to data collected by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales and Grant Thornton, a professional services company.A big wild card for Britain is how the slowdown in the eurozone and the fallout from the crisis in Ukraine affects the economy in coming months.Economists say tensions in Ukraine and sanctions against Russia may hurt Britain somewhat less than its European neighbors. Britain has fewer business links there than countries like Germany, particularly in the energy sector targeted by the sanctions.But there are likely to be ripple effects, as Britain\u2019s trading partners in Europe are hit. Warning that the sanctions will be felt at home, the British foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, said recently, \u201cYou can\u2019t make an omelet without breaking eggs.\u201dThe uncertainty already appears to be taking a toll. British manufacturing, for example, lost steam in the second quarter, rising just 0.2 percent from April through June, its slowest pace in more than a year.\u201cThe U.K. domestic economy looks good. It\u2019s growing strongly and is likely to keep growing strongly,\u201d Mr. Wood of Berenberg said. \u201cBut an economic powerhouse in Europe it is not.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Turkey\u2019s Premier Tries to Keep Power, as President", "Date": "2014-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by10 PhotosANKARA, Turkey \u2014 Just before Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s motorcade swept into the airport here, workers rolled up a red carpet that had been used for the departing president and put down a turquoise one for Mr. Erdogan.Turquoise was the primary color of the Ottoman Empire, and Mr. Erdogan\u2019s preference for it is a subtle, yet telling, symbol of his ambitions as he campaigns to become president \u2014 crisscrossing the country in a bid to expand his pre-eminence over Turkish political life and become, as many of his critics put it, a modern-day sultan.On Sunday, Turks, for the first time in history, will vote for their president, a position that on paper is largely, but not entirely, ceremonial. As the campaign has unfolded, any sense of its historical importance has been eclipsed by a sense of certitude: Mr. Erdogan is widely expected to win, and widely expected to govern the country from the presidential palace.\u201cWhen you look at our Constitution, there is no article that limits actions of a president,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said in a recent interview on his plane, as he returned to Ankara, the Turkish capital, from a campaign stop in Mersin, a port city on the Mediterranean coast. \u201cIt names the president as the head of state, that\u2019s it.\u201dIn running for president, Mr. Erdogan is hoping to secure a legacy greater even than that of the revered founder of modern Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. Mr. Erdogan, already in power more than a decade, hopes to preside over the nation for another 10 years and be the leader at the 100th anniversary of the Turkish republic in 2023.For better or worse, he has already left an imprint on Turkish public life almost as large as Ataturk\u2019s. He has sidelined the military from a role in politics, and broken down secular taboos to allow more religious expression, such as the wearing of head scarves on college campuses and in Parliament. He has achieved enormous popularity among his religiously conservative base, with a politics that fuses faith and populism, and his economic policies have improved the lives of many who felt like second-class citizens under Turkey\u2019s old secular system.\u201cHe made Turkey a country of prestige, of confidence,\u201d said Nuri Guven, 34, cheering for Mr. Erdogan at the rally in Mersin.At the rally, holding his fist in the air, Mr. Erdogan said to his supporters, \u201cAllah is enough for us, people are enough for us, Turkey is enough for us.\u201dTurkey, a NATO member, has long been a strategic ally of the United States. At the outset of the Arab Spring revolutions, in 2011, President Obama developed a close personal relationship with Mr. Erdogan, seeing Turkey as a model to emulate for countries upended by revolution.Nowadays, Mr. Erdogan no longer speaks directly to Mr. Obama, he said.\u201cWhy did the U.S. remain silent when a popularly elected Morsi was ousted in a military coup?\u201d Mr. Erdogan said in the interview. \u201cWhy did the West remain silent? And so, they also asked us to remain silent. When we called it a military coup, they looked at us in a wrong way, and there, ties were cut. We will, however, continue to say the same thing.\u201dMr. Erdogan\u2019s rule has come at the cost of deep polarization in Turkish society.The public is divided almost exactly in half between those who support Mr. Erdogan and his Islamist Justice and Development Party, and others who despise him for what they regard as his authoritarian streak. His opponents, though, are also sharply divided, between nationalists, those loyal to the secular principles of Ataturk, and more liberal, urban Turks who formed the backbone of a protest movement that convulsed the streets of Istanbul and other cities last summer. Two candidates are running against Mr. Erdogan: Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, a former diplomat, and Selahattin Demirtas, the candidate of a pro-Kurdish party.But neither of these candidates has been able to unite the various factions among Mr. Erdogan\u2019s opponents, and so Mr. Erdogan is almost certain to win in the voting this Sunday. If he does not receive at least 50 percent of the votes on Sunday, the election would go to another round, on Aug. 24, between the top two finishers.\u201cIt\u2019s almost a foregone conclusion that Erdogan will win,\u201d said Sinan Ulgen, a former Turkish diplomat affiliated with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Brussels.So certain are Turks of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s imminent victory that the national teachers union recently published a test preparation book that lists Mr. Erdogan as having been elected president in 2014.Nevertheless, the stakes are high for Turkish politics. As president, Mr. Erdogan is expected to wield more power from an office that has traditionally been subordinate to the prime minister \u2014 for example, chairing regular cabinet meetings under a constitutional provision that has been exercised rarely in the past. He is also likely to push for constitutional changes to create a powerful presidential system, and while he is required by law to sever ties with his party, few believe he will do so in practice.An open question is who would replace him as prime minister. Analysts say that for Mr. Erdogan to govern from the presidency he would have to install a compliant party figure as the head of Parliament.Mr. Ulgen said, \u201cThis is really the big question that will determine the short-term evolution of Turkish politics.\u201dSebnem Arsu reported from Ankara and Mersin, Turkey, and Tim Arango from Baghdad.

{"Headline": "Efforts to Revive Rich California Mine Hit Strong Resistance", "Date": "2014-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEVADA CITY, Calif. \u2014 It is quiet at Tim Callaway\u2019s gold mine, with its crumbling concrete, rotting wood and the occasional butterfly accustomed to undisturbed access. But there is plenty of commotion over what\u2019s below the surface: an unseen 240,000 ounces of gold.To reach it will take more than dynamite. Mr. Callaway, 62, who calls himself \u201ca steward of the land,\u201d must take on an alliance of local residents, many of them city escapees, who protest that reopening the mine would threaten their water and the tranquillity they came here for.\u201cWhy is gold mining practically extinct in this state?\u201d Mr. Callaway asks, before providing his own answer: \u201cIt\u2019s not because of lack of resources. It\u2019s because most companies are not willing to go through this tortuous ordeal.\u201dBut he is. After mining here in the 1990s, Mr. Callaway has returned to San Juan Ridge, near the scenic Yuba River 60 miles northeast of Sacramento, to dig for gold in a way that he says is environmentally sound.The battle is being waged in the forested Sierra foothills where forty-niners once roamed, and it is hard to escape reminders of why it is called Gold Country: historical markers, museums, the county seal depicting a fortune hunter panning in a local stream. By 2012, there were only 17 working mines in the state, but at about $1,300 an ounce on the world market, gold still offers a tantalizing payoff. In this area, \u201conly about half the resources have been mined,\u201d said Charles N. Alpers, a research chemist with the United States Geological Survey.And Mr. Callaway personifies what is left of a mining tradition. He has lived in and around Gold Country for much of his life. Like his father and grandfather before him, he has been a gold miner in California and Nevada. He collects miners\u2019 diaries and vintage equipment.But Gold Country has undergone profound change.Friends and followers of his philosophy, that human life is no more valuable than that of other living things, built homesteads nearby. Today, the 3,000 residents of the ridge include artisans and organic farmers, some of them marijuana growers. Seven miles outside Nevada City, the county seat, they all rely on wells for water.\u201cWe were a contemporary, forward-looking, scientific, not Nimby group,\u201d said Mr. Snyder, 84, using a term for not in my backyard. He said that \u201cseparating tiny flecks of gold from huge pieces of gravel\u201d in an area rich with bears, bobcats, birds of prey and other wildlife made no sense.The group vehemently opposed companies wanting to operate an open pit mine, a common practice on sparsely populated federal lands in Nevada, where the bulk of American production takes place.\u201cIt was going to be a complete ecological disaster,\u201d said Kurt Lorenz, vice president of the association, who has lived on the ridge for 36 years. \u201cIt would mean our living here was untenable.\u201dTwo decades ago, Mr. Callaway set out to mine the ridge, addressing the group\u2019s concerns head-on. He proposed an underground mine, not an open pit, and said that instead of using cyanide to extract the gold \u2014 also common elsewhere \u2014 he would use water and gravity.When it became clear that Mr. Callaway was going to win county approval, the association acquiesced.\u201cWe thought, O.K., maybe this time we can make it work and we can make this gold disappear,\u201d said Liese Greensfelder, a science writer who has lived in the area since 1977 and dedicated much of her career to the anti-mining campaign. The Taxpayers Association decided to support Mr. Callaway while insisting on a mitigation agreement in case the mine damaged their water.It was, Mr. Callaway says, the first industrial production at the mine since the Depression. But the moment of common cause came to an abrupt end after miners hit a vertical four-inch fault in the bedrock. Millions of gallons of water gushed into the mine, draining a dozen nearby wells, including one at the Grizzly Hill School.Mr. Callaway paid for new wells and bottled water for several of the nine years the school imported water.\u201cMining is a treacherous business,\u201d said Mr. Alpers of the Geological Survey. \u201cSometimes you don\u2019t know what you\u2019ll find.\u201dIn 1997, faced with an unstable mine floor and a drop in gold prices, the mine closed. \u201cWe\u2019d barely gotten started,\u201d Mr. Callaway said.A consultant had determined that there were 257,000 ounces of gold in the San Juan Ridge mine, but Mr. Callaway extracted only 17,000 ounces before the mine closed.Two years ago, with gold prices near record highs, Mr. Callaway, the chief executive of San Juan Mining, reappeared, this time telling residents that an alternative approach, horizontal drilling, would avoid another calamity.But the Taxpayers Association is not willing to give him a second chance. Members are concerned not only about another accident but also about the possibility that the daily operation of the mine could siphon off millions of gallons of water, especially in drought years. \u201cIt could cause chronic dewatering problems,\u201d said the group\u2019s president, Sol Henson, 35, a hydrologist who grew up here and has a cabin among the pines.Members of the group have become expert in subsurface water movement and heavy-metal contamination of groundwater. They raised $40,000 and spent thousands of hours educating themselves. In April, they packed a local theater to hear experts and watch a locally produced documentary about the anguish of residents whose water was affected the last time Mr. Callaway opened his mine.Mr. Callaway rejects the association\u2019s argument.\u201cThe idea that the whole community would be depleted of water has no basis,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s just a function of a political campaign being waged against the project.\u201dMr. Callaway says he has spent $1.8 million in the permit process and expects to pay an equal amount before it is over. The cost includes monthly monitoring of local wells. Over 100 homeowners signed up to have their well water tested.But by March, Mr. Callaway stopped paying for most of the measurements.In a letter to Nevada County planning officials, Mr. Callaway said politics, not science, was driving the decision about \u201cwhat is a reasonable amount of data collection.\u201d He balked at providing a blank check for more well water studies.To no one\u2019s surprise, the Taxpayers Association disagreed. It hired Tom Myers, a consultant on mining\u2019s impact on water supplies, who told county officials that the wells should be monitored for two years \u201cto assess the potential impacts of the proposed reopening of the mine.\u201dMr. Henson, the hydrologist, favors three years of testing: a dry year, a wet year and a normal one.\u201cThey felt they were burned in the \u201890s,\u201d said the Nevada County planning director, Brian Foss, who must arbitrate the dispute. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to relive it.\u201dWhile the Taxpayers Association members think about preserving the homes and 200 existing jobs on the ridge, Mr. Callaway makes a straightforward economic case. He says his mine will provide 70 new jobs and $365,000 in annual county tax revenue. \u201cNot everyone can flip burgers and work at antique stores,\u201d he said.County planning officials are expected to meet with Mr. Callaway soon to try to resolve the impasse over water monitoring. An environmental impact report, required by state law, will be written by independent consultants, at Mr. Callaway\u2019s expense. After written commentary and public hearings, it will be up to county officials to decide the future of the mine on San Juan Ridge. If Mr. Callaway succeeds, he expects to have a permit by 2016 and open the mine the following year.But he is growing frustrated. \u201cYou can\u2019t have profits, grow the economy, provide jobs and tax revenue without impacts,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a society, we have to accept there is a price to pay.\u201dAn article on Saturday about opposition to efforts to revive mines in California\u2019s Gold Country referred incorrectly to one mine that may be reopened near Nevada City, Calif.

{"Headline": "A Taste of Barcelona\u2019s Evolving Dining Scene", "Date": "2014-07-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChoice TablesThat has led to the emergence of a new restaurant scene, where accessibility is favored over lavish ingredients, but with creativity remaining as the driving force \u2014 still drawing from, and reimagining, the great traditions of Catalan cuisine. The big names remain, but are offering meals in more modest settings \u2014 and at relatively lower prices \u2014 that are less about providing once-in-a-lifetime experiences than just consistently great ones.Albert Adri\u00e0 has been the trailblazer, opening up restaurants left and right, and in the process transforming the Parallel theater district. At his casual bar, Bodega 1900, you can pair El Bulli\u2019s famed spherical \u201colives\u201d with a blended vermouth. At Tickets, just across the street and featuring a big-top circus d\u00e9cor, you\u2019ll find adventurous tapas like avocado and crab cannelloni. Next up is a multipart Mexican restaurant called Hoja Santa, scheduled to open in September.Other restaurateurs have followed suit. There are new tapas bars from Michelin-starred chefs and beachside shacks in Barceloneta, including one from an El Bulli disciple serving globally inflected hot dogs.Many feared the recession might destroy the city\u2019s culinary superstardom; instead, those challenges have helped breathe new life into it. Here are a few of the standouts.Restaurant Ferm\u00ed PuigAt Drolma, which closed in 2011 and which was at the time one of the city\u2019s most expensive restaurants, Ferm\u00ed Puig served indulgent, over-the-top dishes like tuna belly topped with caviar. His latest project, while still refined, is much more reserved.\u201cBefore, in Drolma, I was officiating as a bishop in a cathedral,\u201d Mr. Puig said. \u201cNow I am a small parish rector, but happy.\u201dAt his eponymous restaurant, which opened last year, there are projectors displaying contemporary portraits of locals, which reflect off mirrors on the opposite wall. Marble floors lead to a glass-enclosed cellar. But the atmosphere is much less assuming than Drolma\u2019s opulent domain inside the Hotel Majestic.\u201cAnxiety over economic circumstances has stimulated the ingenuity and creativity to create new proposals at interesting prices,\u201d Mr. Puig said. \u201cI think it is a very attractive moment for the renewal of the city\u2019s gastronomic offerings.\u201dThe small menu is playful, moving between classic Catalan cuisine and more global flavors. One of the two appetizers, the Brick de Gambas, featured shrimp wrapped in a phyllo-like dough, fried, and spiced with ras el hanout. A main course of monkfish tail offered both crisp skin and perfectly moist flesh.\u201cYou want something strong, intense,\u201d suggested the sommelier for a glass of wine with my kid goat loin, which was one of Mr. Puig\u2019s signature dishes from Drolma. \u201cSomething Catalan is usually a safe bet.\u201dIt was. The thick rich sauce and sage-infused flavor of the falling-off-the-bone tender meat paired beautifully with the Les Terrasses Velles Vinyes Priorat.PaktaAlbert Adri\u00e0's other recent venture, a Japanese-Peruvian hybrid that opened in 2013 in Poble Sec, feels like an Andean sushi bar. Or maybe a cevicheria in Tokyo. There\u2019s a long minimalist wooden bar on one side of the narrow one-room space, with a few tables on the other. Loomlike displays of brightly colored yarn cover the walls and ceiling.\u201cSome people say it\u2019s more Japanese,\u201d said the Peruvian-born Jorge Mu\u00f1oz, one of Pakta\u2019s two chefs (the other is the Japanese-born Kyoko Li). \u201cThen if you ask someone else they say it\u2019s more Peruvian. Really, it\u2019s a little of Japan, a little of Peru, a little of the Mediterranean.\u201d Then he shook his hands together as if he were about to roll dice, and released. \u201cAnd a touch of Ferran and Albert.\u201dThere are two menus: the longer Machu Picchu and the (still substantial) Fujiyama; I went with the former.Courses shifted between dishes with a Japanese bent, like a series of nigiris with touches of Peruvian ingredients like smoked aj\u00ed amarillo, to the more Peruvian, like the causas, usually a pur\u00e9ed and layered potato dish, in which the potato appeared as a foam on top of mushroom tempura. A highlight, both in concept and taste, was the succulent chicken anticuchos, or skewers, served yakitori style on a little konro grill.The distance between Spain and the menu\u2019s two countries of inspiration didn\u2019t seem to faze Mr. Mu\u00f1oz. Case in point: He told me that getting fresh huacatay, an Andean herb, was nearly impossible in Barcelona, so he grows his own on his apartment balcony.Roca Moo\u201cThere is an increase of more radical proposals for tapas, of bistronomic restaurants following the stream from Paris, and creating a new vision of casual cuisine that mixes Catalan culture with the opening of the world,\u201d Josep Roca told me after my meal.The main restaurant has two tasting menus, one of contemporary Catalan plates and another with Joan Roca\u2019s classic dishes from El Celler. For dinner I could only get squeezed in at 10:30 \u2014 not late by Spanish standards, but too late for the full Joan Roca menu. Luckily, most of the dishes were available \u00e0 la carte and I could even add the wine pairing from the tasting menu for each dish for about four or five euros each.Roca touches were ever-present, starting with amuse-bouches like a small pastry shell stuffed with cochinita pibil and the bonbon filled with Campari. Foie gras balanced perfectly with chunks of mandarin; a glass dome appeared and then was lifted, revealing a plume of thick smoke, whose flavor lingered in thin, deep red slices of squab carpaccio.Then there was the legendary Viaje a la Habana, which first appeared at El Celler in 2000. The perfect replica of a cigar was actually rum sponge cake smoked with a Partag\u00e1s Serie D No. 4. While the idea of tobacco smoke with food has never appealed to me, this did. It ended the meal with the heady buzz of a real cigar, but was easier on the lungs.Boh\u00e8mic\u201cOh you have to order those; they\u2019re famous here,\u201d said the waitress, Maite Manduley, of the patatas bravas at Boh\u00e8mic. She seemed to be excited about everything on the menu \u2014 in fairness, she is the chef\u2019s mother.Francesc Gimeno built a reputation as a high-concept chef while working his way around Barcelona\u2019s restaurant scene. With the help of his family, who work alongside him, he opened this one-room bistro with just a handful of tables plus a few sidewalk seats and bar stools. Even with his low-cost menu he is regularly putting out some of the city\u2019s most creative cuisine, though perhaps not at the level that he would like.\u201cWe still have 60 percent of the idea in my head,\u201d Mr. Gimeno said. \u201cI hope to one day have enough money to let my imagination fly at 100 percent.\u201dWe ordered half of the small menu and the percentage seemed fine to us. Those patatas bravas, crisp and slathered in mayo and fried tomato sauce, were probably the best I\u2019ve ever had. A slow-cooked egg on a bed of foie gras emulsion was as light as a mayonnaise. A sort of chimichurri made of fermented cabbage came with a little treasure chest of salts to sprinkle on it, including a smoked yellow Norwegian salt and a black salt from Hawaii.Before the pork ribs were served, Mrs. Manduley brought them out on a cutting board. The scent of the sizzling pork, cooked sous-vide for 48 hours, filled the dining room. This lead to almost every other table ordering it, setting off a wonderful chain reaction of scents when those orders were brought out. The taste was just as pleasing: The meat was incredibly tender and the soulful flavor of the herbs that seasoned it lingered on in my taste buds long after it was taken away.When it was time for dessert, Mrs. Manduley reappeared, this time armed with a siphon. She sprayed a tart rhubarb foam into a martini glass over a lemon sorbet with pastis gelatin, ginger perfume and honey cress sprouts \u2014 a wonderfully light end to the meal.Restaurant AngleAs a judge on \u201cMasterChef Spain\u201d and the owner of two Michelin stars at ABaC, Jordi Cruz has seen his popularity grow. In mid-2013 he moved Angle from its original location outside the city to its center, into a sleek, white second-floor space in the Cram Hotel. I visited for lunch, just before a holiday weekend. It was completely empty; only a waiter stood by as light jazz hummed softly overhead.Their loss: Mr. Cruz is just as adventurous with his technique here as at ABaC. I sampled dishes like ceviche with grated cucumbers and scallops accompanied by clear noodles made of soy and covered in ponzu sauce. A roasted guinea fowl was filled with foie gras cream and cubes of Pedro Jim\u00e9nez that had a touch of sweetness.It was followed by a blue cheese ice cream with a caramelized pine nut cookie and pine nut foam. The final item was a tube of what appeared to be lipstick, perched on a cold stone. Inside was a black currant and anise seed sorbet, a fitting end to a dining adventure in a city where things are often not what they seem.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "High in the Rockies, a Chill Marijuana Debate \u200b", "Date": "2014-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorial ObserverGUNNISON, Colo. \u2014 Getting a feel for Gunnison, Colo., a town in the Rockies about four and a half hours southwest of Denver, takes a bicycle and a few minutes. On Main Street and nearby blocks you will pass a Wal-Mart, a pizza place called Pie-Zans, a bike-repair-and-espresso shop, the offices of The Gunnison Country Times, the campus of Western State Colorado University and Traders Rendezvous, which claims to have the state\u2019s largest collection of antlers and mounted animal trophies. Ride long enough and you will find seven churches and five liquor stores, six if you count the Safeway.What you will not find are any stores selling marijuana. These are not allowed.To see the new Colorado after Amendment 64, which legalized recreational cannabis, you have to drive a half-hour north, to Crested Butte. It has three dispensaries selling marijuana buds and pipes and cannabis-infused candies and drinks. They are off the main drag; their presence is low-key, even deferential.The towns are not drastically different. Crested Butte, population 1,550, is for skiers and tourists; its main street is more colorfully painted, more self-consciously alpine. Gunnison, population 5,854, has deep roots in ranching and mining. It\u2019s for hunters towing A.T.V.'s, students and underpaid faculty members at the university, and high-caliber athletes devoted to the strenuous life. A classic Gunnison sight is a $6,000 mountain bike racked atop a $700 Subaru.This is how it feels in Colorado, in Denver and beyond: Even people and places not overeager to embrace marijuana are not cowed by legalization. Seven months after plunging into the what-if world of legal marijuana, Colorado feels years ahead of the rest of the country in cannabis understanding. If you go to Colorado, as many out-of-town reporters have, armed with adolescent stoner jokes, you should know that Cheech and Chong were famous 40 years ago. Many of the advocates and entrepreneurs leading the revolution are in their 20s and 30s and will not relate. And the majority of Coloradans who are going on with their lives, living apart from the world of weed, will not find you funny.Gunnison has two would-be ganja-preneurs, Jason Roland and Todd Houle, pressing for legalization so they can open a store. The closest they have to an adversary might be Matthew Kuehlhorn, director of the Gunnison County Substance Abuse Prevention Project, which works in the public schools. He puts himself on the tolerant end of those who want to discourage marijuana use, and refuses to exaggerate its dangers. \u201cYou can\u2019t get the toothpaste back in the tube,\u201d he said. \u201cSo now we\u2019re finding ways to reduce harm and continue on forward.\u201d He wants marijuana taxes to be earmarked for youth programs. Mr. Roland and Mr. Houle agree. The City Council isn\u2019t so sure.The real drug problem in town, several Gunnisonians said, is alcohol \u2014 no surprise in a skiing-ranching-college town. Western State Colorado University has had to live down a reputation as a party school (locals call it \u201cWasted State\u201d), and officials there do not think legal marijuana is going to help. The dean of students, Gary Pierson, said the school tries hard to send a drug-free message. Even authorized medical-marijuana users have to medicate off-campus.I asked Chris Dickey, publisher of The Country Times, whether his paper had editorialized for or against Amendment 64. He couldn\u2019t remember. \u201cWe have other issues. It\u2019s a small town; the economy\u2019s always kind of limping along. The environmental issues are always a pressing concern. The status of our local education institutions. Those are the things that impact people\u2019s lives.\u201dGeorge Sibley, a writer who came to the Gunnison Valley in the 1960s, said the key to grasping local politics in the Mountain West is knowing your altitude. \u201cAbove 8,000 feet, it\u2019s almost always Democrat, and down-valley it\u2019s almost always Republican,\u201d he said. \u201cDown-valley it\u2019s more agricultural, self-reliant, Jeffersonian-type Republicanism. But up-valley, it was miners, originally, and union people, and then it became posturban liberals with urban backgrounds.\u201dBy this theory, Crested Butte, at 8,885 feet, breathes solidly liberal air. Gunnison, at 7,703 feet, is more in the zone of political flux. Mr. Sibley said he expected legalization to win, which suited him fine. But he said there was a silent faction in town, how big he wasn\u2019t sure, that would vote against marijuana shops simply to preserve the status quo.\u201cI actually think it\u2019ll be slow,\u201d Mr. Sibley said. \u201cBut life will not be very much different. There will be a significant new tax source for the community, and everybody will be even more used to it than they are now. You\u2019re never going to stop it, of course, because if you put a challenge in front of a bunch of high school kids ...\u201dHe let the thought finish itself.Advertisement"}

Done right, with sufficient follow-through, the event should strengthen American ties to a continent that is expected to outpace China and India in population by 2040 and is widely viewed as the world\u2019s last major economic frontier.The event is a determined, and splashy, initiative by Mr. Obama to push back against other countries doing business there, especially China, which is investing heavily in infrastructure projects and using Africa as a source of vital oil and metals. It is also an opportunity to counter critics who say he has devoted insufficient attention to the continent.Administration officials have been eager to persuade Africa that America\u2019s democratic capitalistic system can offer advantages that China\u2019s authoritarian system cannot. As Susan Rice, the national security adviser, said last week, \u201cWe don\u2019t see Africa as a pipeline to extract vital resources, nor as a funnel for charity.\u201d She described a broader vision in which the United States is committed to being a partner to create jobs, resolve conflicts and develop the human capital needed to build a better future.The world has largely associated Africa with desperate struggles against war, poverty, famine and dictatorial leaders. But there are positive trends, too. Africa is home to six of the 10 fastest-growing economies in the world, an emerging middle class and markets that are increasingly open to foreign investment. In short, there is money to be made there.There is also a growing threat from militants in some countries. And, as human rights groups point out, the summit meeting\u2019s focus on trade, investment and counterterrorism cannot be allowed to dilute the Obama administration\u2019s willingness to press for good and honest governance, fair elections and human rights, all essential for long-term stability and growth.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Version 1.0: More Boost Than Eco", "Date": "2014-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBehind the Wheel7 PhotosThe standard-issue Ford Fiesta is powered by a 1.6-liter 4-cylinder that generates a modest 120 horsepower at 6,350 r.p.m. and 112 pound-feet of torque at 5,000 r.p.m. The lofty r.p.m. numbers for the power and torque peaks tell you all you need to know: This car is largely gutless unless you\u2019re riding it to the redline. Even then, the base Fiesta won\u2019t strain your sternocleidomastoid with undue G forces.Ford offers two possible upgrades. One is a turbocharged 1.6-liter 4, found exclusively in the Fiesta ST. That vicious little chupacabra makes 197 horsepower and is intended for people who like to party. The other option is less dramatic but more intriguing: For an extra $995 on top of your $16,405 2014 Fiesta SE sedan (or $16,905 hatchback), Ford will sell you a 999 cc 3-cylinder that is both more powerful and more efficient than the 1.6-liter 4-cylinder. This is the 1.0 EcoBoost, turbocharged and equipped with direct fuel injection, tied with the Smart Fortwo\u2019s 3-cylinder for the title of the smallest auto engine in the United States market. It\u2019s available only with a 5-speed manual transmission and steel wheels fitted with aerodynamic covers, probably to prevent the price from straying too far upward (besides its expensive hardware, the 1.0 is built in Germany, while the 1.6 hails from Brazil). The Fiesta 1.0 EcoBoost tests a hypothesis thus far unexamined on our shores: Will Americans pay a premium for a car with an engine block that\u2019s the size of carry-on luggage?The Fiesta\u2019s twee turbocharger spins as fast as 248,000 r.p.m. Under moderate driving conditions, the maximum boost pressure is 14.7 pounds per square inch, providing 125 pound-feet of torque at 2,500 r.p.m. But the Fiesta, like the Porsche 911 Turbo, can also allow a temporary overboost, raising maximum boost to 20 p.s.i. and generating 148 pound-feet of torque for as long as 15 seconds. Backing off the throttle resets the timer. Given the generous parameters for the Fiesta\u2019s overboost mode \u2014 who keeps the throttle floored for more than 15 seconds? \u2014 one might suspect that Ford made the distinction simply because the concept of overboost might lead your 1-liter Fiesta to be mentioned in the same sentence as a 911 Turbo. In which case, mission accomplished.But horsepower is horsepower, and the 1.0 still doesn\u2019t have an embarrassment of it. Its main advantage over the 1.6-liter lies in its low-r.p.m. torque and the consequent improvement in around-town acceleration. A 1.0 Fiesta doesn\u2019t have to work as hard to nip from light to light, which is fortunate because you won\u2019t want to listen to its exertions. That\u2019s partly a result of the uneven blat emitted by its odd number of cylinders, and partly because Ford doesn\u2019t seem to know how to combine EcoBoost virtues with a rewarding soundtrack. I own a car with a 3.5-liter EcoBoost, and it sounds like a whale with indigestion, all groans and clicks from the intake and injectors. Sometimes I don\u2019t know whether to take it to the dealer or to the scientists at Woods Hole.But thanks to the 5-speed\u2019s gear ratios, which are so far apart they need counseling, you won\u2019t have to listen to the 1.0 unless you deliberately whip it up. Both fourth and fifth gears are overdrives, aimed squarely at fuel economy rather than sportiness. And fuel economy is obviously a big part of the 3-cylinder\u2019s appeal.To that end, the 1.0 returns impressive mileage, earning the 2015 model an E.P.A. rating of 31 miles per gallon in town and 43 m.p.g. on the highway. It\u2019s hard to be blas\u00e9 about a nonhybrid that gets 43 m.p.g., but am I wrong to want something more? Plenty of larger sedans earn 40 m.p.g. ratings, and it\u2019ll take a lot of driving before you realize much savings from the margin from 40 m.p.g. to 43.Further complicating the EcoBoost argument is that at least some of its efficiency derives from Ford\u2019s SFE package, which is automatically included when you opt for the 1-liter. The SFE trim includes a smoother underbody, small wings at the base of the wheel arches and those 15-inch steel wheels with aerodynamic covers and low-rolling resistance tires. Sedans also get a trunk lid spoiler, which is standard on the hatch. So equipped, a 2015 1.6-liter Fiesta SFE earns an E.P.A. combined rating of 32 m.p.g. The EcoBoost\u2019s combined rating is 36 m.p.g. That\u2019s not, fair to say, a huge difference. Thus I conclude that the appeal of the 1.0 lies less in the Eco than in the Boost.There\u2019s a geek factor here, a satisfaction in knowing that you\u2019re on the front edge of the smaller-displacement trend that began, oh, when Pierce-Arrow stopped building the Model 6-66 Raceabout (13.5 liters, it was). While the Fiesta 1.0 EcoBoost makes a legitimate case for itself on paper, I suspect its following will come less from rationalists than from the crowd that finds its small-bore, high-tech approach inherently cool. Compared with the base model, the 1.0 is a little bit more powerful, a little more fuel efficient and about a thousand times more interesting. In software terms, 1.0 refers to the first version of something. In that respect, this Fiesta is indeed American Tiny Motor Car version 1.0, a smart concept in search of early adopters. Early adopters who can drive a stick. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uncertainty for Workers Losing Jobs at Atlantic City Casinos", "Date": "2014-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATLANTIC CITY \u2014 As the summer season winds down, the air in this beachfront resort carries the sense of foreboding that precedes a tsunami. Casino shutdowns and mass layoffs are about to hit the boardwalk, leaving thousands of people out of work and unsure where to go or what to do next.Sarah Rivera is one of them. After more than a quarter-century spent dealing cards and taking bets on rolling dice and spinning wheels, Ms. Rivera will lose her job when the Showboat Hotel and Casino closes for good on Sunday, the first of three casino closings scheduled to happen by mid-September. After attending a briefing on Saturday about how to start a job search and apply for unemployment insurance benefits, Ms. Rivera was bewildered. Nearly two months had passed since Showboat\u2019s owner, Caesars Entertainment, announced the shutdown, but many longtime employees had only recently given up hope that their jobs would somehow be saved.\u201cIt\u2019s horrible,\u201d said Ms. Rivera, who is in her mid-40s. \u201cThis is not an easy thing to go through. It\u2019s really overwhelming at times. You kind of find yourself lost, and confused.\u201dNow, with Revel Casino Hotel set to close after the Labor Day weekend and Trump Plaza shutting two weeks later, it is clear that the industry that revived Atlantic City can no longer sustain it. The three casinos have warned state officials that they will be laying off more than 6,500 workers \u2014 about one-fourth of all the casino employees in the state.The effect on a city that already had an unemployment rate of about 13 percent will be seismic, said James W. Hughes, the dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. After the pending layoffs, the number of casino jobs will have been cut in half in just eight years, about three times as fast as the state\u2019s manufacturing industry declined, Mr. Hughes said.\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen a shrinkage of that magnitude in any industrial sector in New Jersey in that period of time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really is unprecedented.\u201dFinding jobs for all of those about to be displaced will be difficult, Mr. Hughes said, because \u201cthere\u2019s not a great range of options in terms of other industries\u201d in the area around Atlantic City. \u201cGaming was the engine driving the economy of that area and the engine is slowing dramatically,\u201d he said.At the briefing Ms. Rivera attended, she and more than 50 of her co-workers were advised to look for jobs as far as a 75-minute drive away. \u201cI encourage you to look at where one hour and 15 minutes can take you,\u201d said Elaine Williams, a representative of the state\u2019s Department of Labor and Workforce Development. Unfortunately for New Jersey, a drive of that length could transport those workers to Pennsylvania and nearly to Delaware, two states where casino gambling has been on a rapid rise. Out-of-state casinos \u2014 most notably Maryland Live, which is more than 150 miles away \u2014 have been among the most eager recruiters in Atlantic City lately.Of the eight job fairs that the state labor department set up for Showboat employees, the highest attendance by far was at the one focused on casino jobs, including those in other states, said Catherine Starghill, the department\u2019s director of work force field services.\u201cCertainly we want all of these job-seekers to stay here\u201d in New Jersey, Ms. Starghill said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to take away from the local economy.\u201d For that reason, she said, the department is emphasizing training programs \u201cto redirect employees to some of the other opportunities.\u201d The need to develop new skills for other types of work will be so great, she said, that the department is drawing up plans to seek emergency federal funding. The union that represents many of the workers, Local 54 of Unite Here, is also teaming with the labor department to counsel laid-off workers next week at the Atlantic City Convention Center, Ms. Starghill said. On the casino floors, much of the talk among the workers last weekend was about relocating. A young maintenance man at the Showboat said he would move to the east coast of Florida to help his father open a bowling alley. A young woman who deals poker games a few steps from the boardwalk said she planned to go to Charlotte, N.C., possibly to return to school.The prevailing sentiment about the prospects for those who wanted to remain in the area was summed up by Nick Merlino, a longtime poker dealer who works part time at the Showboat: \u201cThey\u2019re screwed,\u201d he said.Mr. Merlino, 73, said he doubted that most of the thousands of workers could find new jobs before their unemployment benefits run out after 26 weeks. Many of them will have to take part-time jobs and collect partial benefits for much longer than that, he predicted.\u00a0Most of the casino employees live outside Atlantic City, but the dislocation of so many workers is sure to drive up the unemployment rate in Atlantic County, which already was the highest in the state. The three closings will have an even bigger effect on the tax base of Atlantic City, said Michael P. Stinson, the city\u2019s director of revenue and finance. At its peak a few years ago, all of the property in the city was valued at more than $20 billion, he said. By next year, that assessment may be down to $10 billion or less, and the city\u2019s costs of borrowing are certain to rise, he said. Ms. Rivera, who lives in Mays Landing, N.J., said she had dabbled in real estate sales while working full time at the Showboat. But that was before the financial crisis devastated the housing market in the region. Many people who might choose to relocate are still stuck with homes that are worth less than what they owe on their mortgages, she said.Those who, like her, have worked in the casinos for decades are in for a hard transition, Ms. Rivera said. \u201cYou get accustomed to a rate of pay, a way of life. The casinos were a good way for someone like me to make a reasonable amount of money with no college degree,\u201d she said.Even though she said her pay had not increased in the last 10 years, she was wistful about her impending layoff and worried about her future. Unemployment benefits and severance pay will barely cover the bills for her and her ailing mother, she said. Even the severance she will receive seems like a slap in the face, she said, explaining that dealers rely on tips from gamblers for much or most of their income. But the eight weeks of severance pay she has been promised is based solely on her hourly wage of $9.30. Peering into a future that probably will take her away from the boardwalk, she concluded: \u201cI need to get a job now. If I can\u2019t get a job now, I might not be able to get one in nine months.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saudi Prince Is Identified as Target of Paris Heist", "Date": "2014-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe case has now become notable not merely for its place in a lengthening string of cinematically choreographed robberies that have tarnished Paris\u2019s image. It has also offered a glimpse of the lavish lifestyles of the global elite, especially from the Persian Gulf states, who regularly make Paris their playground, even at a time when many French are feeling the pinch of a lackluster economy.The police have refused to identify the Saudi royal in question, but the French news media on Tuesday reported that he was Prince Abdul Aziz, 41, who is known for his extravagant taste.The prince once ordered architects to build him a replica of Spain\u2019s imposing Alhambra palace near Riyadh. He travels with a retinue of 50 bodyguards and servants, according to experts who have studied the kingdom, and has property holdings across the United States and Europe and a personal fortune estimated in the billions of dollars.On Sunday, according to Le Monde, the prince was just concluding a getaway that included a 45-day stay at the palatial Four Seasons Hotel George V, one of the world\u2019s most expensive hotels, with stunning views of the Eiffel Tower. As he traveled in a convoy to Le Bourget airport to leave in a private jet, the lead car, a Mercedes minivan, was stopped by eight armed men.While the prince was safely seated in another car, the thieves hijacked the minivan, with a Saudi driver, bodyguard and attendant still inside, before making off with about $335,000 in cash stuffed in a suitcase in the trunk, as well as documents the French news media described as sensitive, even as the Saudi Embassy emphatically denied that important documents had been stolen.The Saudis in the vehicle were soon forced out, and the charred Mercedes and a BMW driven by the robbers were later found in the woods, along with two 500-euro bills, medicine, and some documents in Arabic, according to Le Monde.The police said the seamlessness of the robbery suggested that it was an inside job and that Prince Abdul Aziz may have been betrayed by someone in his large entourage.Antoine Basbous, an expert on Saudi Arabia, said that Saudi princes often traveled with suitcases filled with cash, which they used to pay their phalanx of assistants and for luxury items or services in exclusive venues where credit is not always accepted. The prince once offered an \u20ac80,000 tip at a hip restaurant on the Spanish island of Ibiza, the Spanish newspaper El Mundo reported.Concerns are growing in the French capital that a recent spate of carjackings could deter Arab billionaires and their families from visiting. The police said summer was an attractive time for thieves, since Paris was flooded with moneyed tourists from the Middle East, Russia and China, some of whom offer cash in exchange for discounts on items like diamonds and designer dresses.Prince Abdul Aziz, for his part, emerged unscathed from Sunday\u2019s attack, during which the assailants did not fire their weapons. He has since left Paris, according to French news reports. His destination, they said, was Ibiza.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Owning Overrated? The Rental Economy Rises", "Date": "2014-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySharing EverythingThings that you can now rent instead of buying: a power drill, a song, a tent, an office for an hour, a Prada handbag, a wedding dress, a painting, a dog, your neighbor\u2019s car, a drone.This new way of consuming \u2014 call it the Netflix economy \u2014 is being built by web start-ups that either rent items themselves or serve as middlemen, connecting people who want something with people who own it. They are a growing corner of the broader sharing economy, in which people rent out rooms in their homes on Airbnb or drive people in their cars with Uber or Lyft. Soon, tech entrepreneurs and investors say, we\u2019ll be able to rent much of what we always thought we must own.It is no coincidence that many of these companies \u2014 like Rent the Runway for designer dresses and Getaround for private cars \u2014 were born during the financial crisis, when people needed new ways to save money, as well as new ways to make it. The ones that have survived and grown during the recovery could herald a cultural shift away from the overconsumption that has driven so much of American culture \u2014 not to mention American debt.Then again, it might just be a new way to fuel conspicuous consumption, albeit in a more financially responsible and potentially less wasteful way. In other words, for some it is less about saving the planet than being seen in the latest, unaffordable Versace gown.\u201cOur value set has changed as a younger generation,\u201d said Jennifer Hyman, co-founder and chief executive of Rent the Runway. \u201cWe are now in a state of mind where we want to acquire more experiences. The 1990s \u2018MTV Cribs\u2019 show-off-how-much-money-you-have generation is over.\u201d (The customer who rents that $1,895 Versace gown for $80 might disagree.)So could the answer be to forgo ownership of everything else?In many ways, renting is just a continuation of what people have always done \u2014 borrowing a cup of sugar or a pick-up truck from a neighbor. The difference is that technology has made borrowing possible at a broader scale, and between strangers. Social networking profiles and rating systems offer a level of trust and verification, and mobile phones equipped with GPS take much of the work out of pairing people. Examples are TurningArt for renting artwork, Pley for renting Legos and LiquidSpace for renting an office by the hour.Still, the services raise questions for consumers \u2014 mainly around trust. What happens if someone stains the dress being rented, crashes the car or loses the dog? (The companies have different ways to deal with the risks, including insurance policies, contracts and fees.)\u201cI will not go across town to rent a vacuum cleaner when Amazon can have one on my doorstep tomorrow for only $20 more than it would have cost me to rent it,\u201d said Mr. Williams, who now has a start-up called Simplist. \u201cI will, however, go across town to rent a motorcycle that will make indelible memories at a fraction of that bike\u2019s full cost.\u201dRent the Runway, which was started in 2009, said that so far this year, new customers and orders were more than double those of last year. Last month, it expanded beyond fancy dresses to accessories like bags and jewelry, which customers can rent for as long as they desire. Ms. Hyman said this service competes with fast-fashion retailers like Zara, from which people buy things to wear for just a few months.As for how much this trend will change consumer culture, consider this: People who rent items often end up buying them. Maybe in this economy, people just need a little hand-holding before making big splurges. And particularly for things that wear out, Ms. Schor said, buying might even be the most ecological and economical choice.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Ferguson, Black Town, White Power", "Date": "2014-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorPOLITICS, wrote the political scientist Harold Lasswell in 1936, is about \u201cwho gets what, when, and how.\u201d If you want to understand the racial power disparities we\u2019ve seen in Ferguson, Mo., understand that it\u2019s not only about black and white. It\u2019s about green. Back in 1876, the city of St. Louis made a fateful decision. Tired of providing services to the outlying areas, the city cordoned itself off, separating from St. Louis County. It\u2019s a decision the city came to regret. Most Rust Belt cities have bled population since the 1960s, but few have been as badly damaged as St. Louis City, which since 1970 has lost almost as much of its population as Detroit. This exodus has left a ring of mostly middle-class suburbs around an urban core plagued by entrenched poverty. White flight from the city mostly ended in the 1980s; since then, blacks have left the inner city for suburbs such as Ferguson in the area of St. Louis County known as North County. Ferguson\u2019s demographics have shifted rapidly: in 1990, it was 74 percent white and 25 percent black; in 2000, 52 percent black and 45 percent white; by 2010, 67 percent black and 29 percent white. Municipal reliance on revenue generated from traffic stops adds pressure to make more of them. One town, Sycamore Hills, has stationed a radar-gun-wielding police officer on its 250-foot northbound stretch of Interstate.By contrast, consider the city: After decades of methodically building political power, blacks in St. Louis City elected a black mayor in 1993 and black aldermen or alderwomen in nearly half the city\u2019s wards, and hold two of three seats on the powerful Board of Estimate and Apportionment, which must approve all city contracts. Well-established churches, Democratic ward organizations and other civic institutions mobilize voters in black wards. But because blacks have reached the suburbs in significant numbers only over the past 15 years or so, fewer suburban black communities have deeply ingrained civic organizations. That helps explain why majority-black Ferguson has a virtually all-white power structure: a white mayor; a school board with six white members and one Hispanic, which recently suspended a highly regarded young black superintendent who then resigned; a City Council with just one black member; and a 6 percent black police force.Many North County towns \u2014 and inner-ring suburbs nationally \u2014 resemble Ferguson. Longtime white residents have consolidated power, continuing to dominate the City Councils and school boards despite sweeping demographic change. They have retained control of patronage jobs and municipal contracts awarded to allies. The North County Labor Club, whose overwhelmingly white constituent unions (plumbers, pipe fitters, electrical workers, sprinkler fitters) have benefited from these arrangements, operates a potent voter-turnout operation that backs white candidates over black upstarts. The more municipal contracts an organization receives, the more generously it can fund re-election campaigns. Construction, waste and other long-term contracts with private firms have traditionally excluded blacks from the ownership side and, usually, the work force as well. But there\u2019s a potential solution that could help Ferguson reinvest in itself and also help African-Americans compete for a bigger share of the pie: consolidation with surrounding municipalities, many of which face similar challenges. The St. Louis region has seen some preliminary support for the idea, with resistance concentrated in smaller political units whose leaders are loath to surrender control.Consolidation would help strapped North County communities avoid using such a high percentage of their resources for expensive public safety overhead, such as fire trucks. It could also empower the black citizens of Ferguson. Blacks incrementally gained power in St. Louis City in part because its size facilitates broader coalitions and alliances. Another benefit of consolidation is the increased political talent pool. Many leaders just aren\u2019t interested in running a tiny municipality. In shrinking cities, politics is often a nasty, zero-sum game. But consolidation could create economies of scale, increase borrowing capacity to expand economic opportunity, reduce economic pressures that inflame racial tension, and smash up the old boys\u2019 network that has long ruled much of North County. When the state patrol and the national television cameras leave Ferguson, its residents will still be talking about how they can move forward. And they may be ready to expand the conversation so that it\u2019s not just about black and white, but green.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Imagining What Democrats Would Say to Obama", "Date": "2014-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From WashingtonWASHINGTON \u2014 Democratic lawmakers left for their summer recess this weekend worried about the midterm elections and despondent over President Obama.Congressional Republicans were torn asunder by internecine warfare, but there was also palpable anxiety among Democrats. Based on conversations with a dozen top Democrats, mostly members of Congress, here is what they might write in a private letter to Mr. Obama:Dear Mr. President,We write this in a constructive spirit, knowing you\u2019ve been dealt a difficult hand in foreign policy and face legislative gridlock at home. Yet without significant changes, the next three months could be perilous for you and our party.First, erase the F-word \u2014 fatalism \u2014 from your rhetoric and mind-set. Too often, what you convey is that we\u2019re gripped by political paralysis at home and at the mercy of irrational acts overseas.We share your frustration. But fatalism isn\u2019t an option for the leader of the free world. Moreover, this mind-set lets congressional Republicans off the hook. Make them accountable \u2014 make them respond to your initiatives, not the other way around.A painful illustration of this is immigration. Republicans have neutralized the issue, for now, by blaming you for the congressional stalemate and for creating a crisis as undocumented children stream across the border. The reality is that the Senate-passed, bipartisan immigration bill would get a majority in the House today, but Republican leaders, scared of the right-wing base, won\u2019t permit a vote.Yes, this influx of children from Latin America is a tragedy, but the number of illegal border crossings is only a fraction of what it was a decade ago, under a Republican president. And spending on border control has increased more than 50 percent during your tenure. You drew some of these lines at Friday\u2019s news conference. How many voters know this?By all means, use an executive order to give work permits to, and avoid deportation of, the parents of those young undocumented \u201cDreamers.\u201d Call it family values. The Republicans will go berserk, but the more vitriolic they get, the greater the probable voter backlash in November.Your congressional relations have improved slightly, though we know not to expect golf outings or trips to Camp David.We get upset, however, when \u2014 as often happens \u2014 the policy is right but carried out in the worst possible way. Witness the swap for the American prisoner Bowe Bergdahl, who was being held by the Taliban. You had to get him out, and the release of prisoners from Guant\u00e1namo was the only way. The photo op with his parents was a bad idea. You couldn\u2019t give Congress the 30-day notice required, but you should have personally briefed Senator Dianne Feinstein and Representative Mike Rogers, the heads of the intelligence committees, as well as Senator John McCain, the night before the exchange.And you went to Texas for a fund-raiser and didn\u2019t stop to visit the border because, your aides said, you don\u2019t do photo ops. What about the Thanksgiving turkey? The White House always stages events; the premium should be on trying to stay presidential. On the big issues, there\u2019s good news on the economy. Trumpet it. Too many people are still struggling, but your ambivalence only fuels unjustified public pessimism.On foreign policy, it seems there are crises everywhere that don\u2019t have a lot to do with United States policies. We understand why you\u2019re intervention-shy: Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya offer sobering lessons on the limits of American power. But don\u2019t just react to President Vladimir Putin of Russia, take the offensive against him more.With all due respect, you have to broaden your circle of advisers; the episodes we\u2019ve cited reflect White House insularity.Mr. President, you still have the biggest megaphone in the world and 900 days left to use it. Seize every one. Good luck. We hope we\u2019re there with you. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "New Cabinet in Turkey Mirrors That of Last Premier ", "Date": "2014-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byISTANBUL \u2014 Turkey\u2019s prime minister-designate, Ahmet Davutoglu, announced a new cabinet on Friday that is dominated by holdovers from the administration of his predecessor, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Mr. Erdogan is now the president and seeking to maintain a grip on power after moving to what until now has been a largely ceremonial office.Mr. Davutoglu moved swiftly, announcing his cabinet less than a day after receiving the mandate from Mr. Erdogan to form the new government. There were changes to only three cabinet ministries out of 21, while two figures close to Mr. Erdogan were installed as new deputy prime ministers. Mr. Erdogan approved the list without delay.The continued presence of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s appointees at the head of key ministries like finance, interior, defense and energy left little doubt that the president would retain strong influence over the government, despite constitutional provisions meant to distance the president from engaging in day-to-day politics.\u201cIf I had not known about Mr. Davutoglu, I would have looked at the cabinet list and said it was just another Erdogan government,\u201d said Soner Cagaptay, the director of the Turkish research program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \u201cPretty much everyone appointed by Erdogan remains in power, which allows him to be present in the cabinet when he is not actually present.\u201dWhen Mr. Erdogan was inaugurated on Thursday, he emphasized his desire for Turkey to join the European Union. Mr. Davutoglu sought to bolster that effort by naming Mevlut Cavusoglu, the current European Union affairs minister, as the new foreign minister.Before the announcement, there was widespread talk in Turkey that the Foreign Ministry would go to Hakan Fidan, the head of the Turkish intelligence agency. But he was left out of the cabinet, freeing him to remain intensely involved in the peace process with Kurdish rebels in the southeastern part of the country.Mr. Fidan was assigned by Mr. Erdogan to lead the negotiations with the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, known as the P.K.K., which has been pushing for autonomy for decades and is regarded as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the European Union and the United States.Mr. Cavusoglu\u2019s experience dealing with European leaders is expected to help him refresh Turkey\u2019s ties with the West, which have been battered in recent years by concerns about Turkey\u2019s commitment to democratic principles. Those concerns have been fueled by the government\u2019s tightening control over the news media, its intimidation of government critics and the brutality shown by the police during civilian protests and demonstrations.Another challenge facing Mr. Cavusoglu is the growing jihadist threat along Turkey\u2019s borders, where Islamic militants control critical territories in Iraq and northern Syria. Forty-nine Turkish diplomats and consular workers have been held hostage by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria for more than two months.The two new deputy prime ministers are Yalcin Akdogan, an influential adviser to Mr. Erdogan, and Numan Kurtulmus, the former leader of a staunchly Islamist political movement who was personally persuaded by Mr. Erdogan to join his Justice and Development Party last year. Mr. Akdogan especially is expected to act as a bridge between the president and the cabinet.\u201cWe will know about our exact duties once they are allocated in the next cabinet meeting,\u201d Mr. Kurtulmus said on the CNN Turk television network. Speaking of the cabinet as a whole, he said, \u201cThe main axis was kept the same as expected \u2014 after all, it\u2019s not about a government change, but fulfilling some procedural changes.\u201dMr. Davutoglu appeared to address desires for financial stability, notably on the part of foreign investors, by leaving the core of the previous cabinet\u2019s economic team untouched. Deputy Prime Minister Ali Babacan, Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek and Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci will remain in their posts.Mr. Erdogan, who became Turkey\u2019s first popularly elected president in August, has said he plans to continue to play an active political role despite the constitutional provisions that bar the president from campaigning actively or maintaining ties to a political party. He has said he plans to regularly lead cabinet meetings.Mr. Erdogan\u2019s opponents have expressed concern that his presidency would mean further authoritarianism in Turkish politics.The Parliament will convene in the first week of September for a vote of confidence on the new cabinet.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "ThyssenKrupp Earnings Bounce Back", "Date": "2014-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe data suggest that ThyssenKrupp is continuing to recover after several difficult years. The improvement comes after a rough 2013, in which its stock price plunged and it was forced to raise capital by selling new shares.ThyssenKrupp\u2019s stock price was up 1.7 percent in midday trading in Europe.\u201cWe are moving in the right direction,\u201d the company\u2019s chief executive, Heinrich Hiesinger, said in a statement.Mr. Hiesinger, a former executive at Siemens who became chief of ThyssenKrupp in 2011, has tried to revive the company\u2019s fortunes by cutting costs and by selling assets like a money-losing steel plant in the United States that it jettisoned last year.ThyssenKrupp\u2019s chief financial officer, Guido Kerkhoff, said by telephone on Thursday that the company was benefiting from investments to expand nonsteel businesses like auto components and elevators in countries like China and India, as well as from cost-cutting that was \u201chelping us to catch up where we are lagging behind.\u201dAlthough it remains the largest steel maker in Germany, ThyssenKrupp, like its rival Voestalpine in Austria, is making its major investments in activities beyond steel, which remains a difficult business because overcapacity around the world is keeping a downward pressure on prices.The bulk of the company\u2019s profit in the second quarter came from a unit that makes elevators and escalators, and from another division, called Industrial Solutions, that includes activities like building fertilizer plants and making giant machines for mines. ThyssenKrupp also has a large business that furnishes components for automobiles and other machinery.\u201cMost of the earnings are now related to capital goods,\u201d Jeff Largey, an analyst at Macquarie Securities in London, said. \u201cThyssen is more of an industrial conglomerate.\u201dThyssenKrupp\u2019s profit in the quarter from European steel making, which is highly cyclical, rose more than sixfold to \u20ac92 million, or about $123 million, before interest and taxes.ThyssenKrupp\u2019s future performance is likely to depend greatly on whether the economies in Europe and those of important countries like China continue to grow and are not set back by instability in the Middle East. The company said it was seeing improvement in the construction industry in Western Europe, which has been in the doldrums for several years. ThyssenKrupp also said that the auto sector, a major consumer of steel, was benefiting from stable growth in the United States and a recovery in Europe.ThyssenKrupp does not seem to have been hit yet by the events in Ukraine; Mr. Kerkhoff noted that Russia and Ukraine amounted to less than 1 percent of its total sales.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "NATO\u2019s Second-Class Members", "Date": "2014-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWARSAW \u2014 During her recent visit to Latvia, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany assured the Baltic states of German and NATO solidarity with them in the face of a potential armed conflict between Ukraine and Russia. As President Obama did earlier here, Ms. Merkel assured her audience that NATO\u2019s obligations did not exist \u201conly on paper.\u201d She is expected to repeat that promise on Saturday, when she is scheduled to appear in Kiev.Any assurance that something is indeed binding merely reflects the existence of doubts. In this case, the uncertainty is based on the absence of NATO soldiers in the alliance\u2019s new member states, including Poland and the Baltics, which feel threatened as they observe Russia\u2019s destructive actions in the region.That absence is a longstanding concession to Russia, which fears NATO encroachment \u2014 one of the few remaining forms of control that Russia exercises over its former satellites. With the passage of time, this surrender of logic to geopolitics is becoming increasingly incomprehensible. Why should a country that is not party to NATO exercise any influence over it?There is no need to pretend: Those members who have no NATO bases are simply a gray area of second-class membership. What has become clear is that not all NATO members are equal. First-class members \u2014 Britain, Germany, Italy \u2014 are those everyone knows would be immediately defended by NATO forces if attacked. Second-class members like Poland and the Baltics would most likely be ravaged for weeks or months before NATO forces made an appearance.Of course, the first-class members would never admit as much. Instead, they play down the risk. Hubert Wetzel, a columnist for the newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, wrote that stationing troops in Poland and the Baltics to check Russia was \u201cunnecessary\u201d \u2014 a rather careless characterization, given Russia\u2019s recent actions against Ukraine.Mr. Wetzel added that such a move could also surprise and provoke Russia, the original reason for keeping NATO troops out of these countries. But they are already NATO members; why would troops signal anything other than the commitments that already exist on paper?But Mr. Wetzel makes a weightier argument, too. NATO has already agreed with Russia that there would be no NATO bases in new member states, and agreements should be honored. Otherwise, the balance between partners will be disrupted.Fair enough. But Russia has already upset that balance by breaking the fundamental assumption of peaceful coexistence between states: that borders and international law are supreme. It has created a dangerous precedent, and even a new type of war, a model to which any future aggressor can turn. The incentive to do so will be greater the more tolerance there is toward Russia\u2019s actions. NATO was created to maintain the very order that Russia has just disrupted. President Vladimir V. Putin has undermined the very meaning of the alliance.Meanwhile, the weak-kneed stance of the older NATO members, and in particular Germany, undermines the very impressive improvements that have been made in recent decades in its relationships with its eastern neighbors \u2014 improvements that also benefit Germany\u2019s economy. Polish-German relations are better than at any other point in history.But those relations are being undermined by the brute reality of German-Russian economic ties. Russia is among the world\u2019s greatest exporters of raw materials, and Germany is among the greatest exporters of finished goods. Germany and Russia\u2019s common interests are one of the largest business relationships in Europe.And while Ms. Merkel may have some tough words for Mr. Putin, the real position of the German government and business community is better illustrated by the chummy hugs and kisses shared over the years by Mr. Putin and former Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, who has deep connections with the Russian oil company Gazprom, or by the words of another former chancellor, Helmut Schmidt, who said: \u201cPutin\u2019s behavior is understandable. Imposing sanctions on Russia is stupid.\u201dNor are we talking only about people at the apex of power, but about a general social attitude. There exists a kind of special German feeling of affinity with Russia. According to public opinion polls, more than half of Germans believe that the annexation of Crimea must be accepted, and that Ukraine belongs in the Russian sphere of influence.What\u2019s odd is that the NATO member with bases closest to Russia is none other than Germany; if Russia attacked Poland or the Baltics, German troops would be among the first to respond. With that in mind, why does Germany resist moving NATO troops farther east, where they will be in a better place to face down, or even prevent, Russian aggression?Fifteen years have passed since Poland joined NATO, and 10 years for the Baltics \u2014 a very long time to maintain a \u201cgeopolitical quarantine\u201d as a concession to the former Soviet Union.Instead, German leaders continue to talk about \u201cde-escalation\u201d of the conflict \u2014 a word that, in its present context, sounds more like the infamous \u201cappeasement\u201d of Munich in 1938. Then, the empty words of Western politicians enabled a single lunatic from Germany to unleash the catastrophe of World War II. This time, do not send us words, but soldiers.Advertisement"}

Instead, those lifts could be uprooted from the mountains.\u201cPark City prides itself on its comity,\u201d said Myles Rademan, a longtime resident and former town official who carried the Olympic torch when the Winter Games were held in Utah in 2002. \u201cWe worked hard to build our reputation as a place that gets along. This is all kind of a shock to our system.\u201dFor years, the resort had a lease that would make even a rent-controlled tenant in Manhattan jealous. While the proprietors owned the parking lots and much of the land at the base of the mountain, they leased the actual ski slopes, paying $155,000 a year for 2,800 acres of prime downhill terrain. It was an almost unimaginable bargain in a town where an unfinished house lot is on the market for $1.9 million.That mistake touched off three years of legal jousting and public spats that culminated in a judge\u2019s ruling this spring clearing the way for the company that owns the ski slopes, Talisker Land Holdings, to evict the resort from the mountain and hand the lease over to a new tenant.Enter Vail Resorts, the Colorado ski behemoth that runs 10 mountain resorts across the country, but had none in Utah until this dispute erupted. In 2013, Vail signed a lease for $25 million annually with Talisker to run a ski resort down the road from Park City Mountain Resort, the Canyons Resort. The deal also gave Vail, for no additional charge, the right to lease the disputed ski slopes, depending on how the legal fight played out.Park City Mountain\u2019s owners are based in town and have deep ties to the community, giving them some sympathy as locals discuss the morass at barbecues and coffee shops.But people here say the conflict is more complicated than a tale of a tiny local resort facing off against a wintertime Goliath. In addition to running Park City Mountain, the Powdr Corporation operates eight ski resorts across the country, including in Vermont, Colorado and Nevada. It filed a lawsuit against Talisker, seeking $7 million in damages and arguing that it had made a good-faith effort to renew the lease and was being kicked out after decades because of a harmless error.\u201cIt\u2019s draconian,\u201d said Alan Sullivan, a lawyer for Park City Mountain. \u201cThe delay in our side\u2019s providing notice was insignificant. It didn\u2019t cause anyone any harm. And basically the penalty is the forfeiture of over $100 million in investment.\u201dPark City Mountain does not plan to go quietly. If forced to leave, the ski resort said it would take its snow-making equipment, the ski lifts and almost anything else it owned that was not fixed to the ground.In addition, the resort has pointed out that it still owns the front door onto the mountain. Anyone who wants to ski on the terrain would have to cross its base area or park in its lots to get to the slopes. Mr. Sullivan also said that Park City Mountain owned water rights that were critical for early-season snow-making.\u201cIt would be impossible for Vail or anybody else who comes on the property to make snow,\u201d he said.Park City Mountain hopes to make its case to the Utah Supreme Court, while Vail and Talisker have said that the law and facts are on their side and that they want to resolve the dispute. This year, Vail offered to buy the base area, but Park City Mountain scoffed at the idea.A judge has ordered both sides into mediation, and they say they are working in good faith to reach a resolution. In late July, Talisker floated an offer that would let Park City Mountain stay this winter as the case plays out in court, provided the resort put up a bond likely to be in the millions. Both sides are expected to discuss that offer in court this month.But one way or another, said John Lund, a lawyer for Talisker, Park City Mountain\u2019s owners will have to go.\u201cThey clearly have lost their rights up there,\u201d he said.Hotel bookings for this winter have not suffered yet because of the standoff, but winter is coming, and shop owners and restaurateurs are getting edgy with no resolution in sight. The mayor has said that the posturing provides no solutions and no relief to businesses and workers. A group of local business owners and developers has begun trying to explain the economic harm of a lost ski season.\u201cIt\u2019s damaging to real estate values \u2014 it\u2019s damaging to lease rates, not to mention a couple thousand people who won\u2019t have jobs,\u201d said Hans Fuegi, who runs the Grub Steak Restaurant. \u201cThere are huge consequences. We\u2019ve never faced anything like this.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Polishing Its Past and Preparing Its Future", "Date": "2014-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUpdateO.K., you think you know Cape Ann, the North Shore peninsula that has been faintly patronized as Cape Cod\u2019s little sister.It\u2019s there as you remember it: the granite coast, the sea spume, the panoramic view at the working port in Gloucester, the improbably picturesque harbor at Rockport and the antiquing and fried-clam indulgences of Essex. And of course, there\u2019s the celebrated harbor excursion past Ten Pound Island, and the Singing Beach in Manchester-by-the-Sea. Also, omnipresent, is the bewitching light that obsessed Winslow Homer, Andrew Wyeth, Edward Hopper, Stuart Davis, Marsden Hartley, Fitz Henry Lane and Gordon Parks.But it\u2019s time to rethink what you already know. Cape Ann, Massachusetts, has become the little vacationland that could, furthering a renaissance for a community built around its 400-year-old principal port, Gloucester, now facing maritime-industry decline. As the cape is seeking to maintain a sustainable base of seafaring, manufacturing and tourism, it is focusing on its longtime reputation as a bastion of culture and a growing center for inventive cuisine.Part of this rejuvenation is underway at the 1871 Gloucester City Hall, undergoing a $10 million restoration. With a 148-foot clock tower and a 3,500-pound bronze bell from 1870, it is an ornate Second Empire landmark inspired by Independence Hall in Philadelphia.Gloucester City Hall is locally sacred for its fishermen\u2019s memorial mural on the wall at the main mahogany staircase, with the names of 5,000 who have died, the basis of the \u201cMan at the Wheel\u201d cenotaph in the harbor that was celebrated in the 2000 George Clooney film \u201cThe Perfect Storm.\u201dCity Hall\u2019s cheerful, site-specific, allegorical W.P.A. murals depicting the vigor of democracy and civic virtue (open to the public on weekdays) are now \u2014 post-restoration \u2014 \u201cbig, bright and largely unknown,\u201d said Catherine Ryan, a Gloucester art consultant and historian.The mur are definitely not like many garden-variety, stolid worker-laborer depictions from the New Deal. Painted between 1935 and 1943 by Charles Allan Winter, Frederick J. Mulhaupt and two other artists, they incorporated local politicians and ordinary citizens as models; their descendants are still in the area.Next to city hall square is the Cape Ann Museum, scheduled to reopen Aug. 19 after a five-year renovation. \u201cWe hope our update will create a new hub for Cape Ann,\u201d said Ronda Faloon, the director.The renovation involved reconfiguring the 44,000-square-foot interior of the intimate, residential museum, adding galleries, a sculpture garden and park, a new lobby and orientation area, and new infrastructure in the museum\u2019s historic 1710 and 1804 houses.The museum\u2019s treasures include everything from an art installation of recovered shipwreck china to an exquisitely built, three-ton, 10-foot-tall 1861 Fresnel lens with more than 1,000 glass prisms, from the Thacher Island Lighthouse. There are Homer watercolors, etchings and drawings; 25 Stuart Davis drawings; and the pre-eminent collection of paintings and drawings by Fitz Henry Lane, the Gloucester-born maritime artist.The museum also sponsors \u201cHopper House\u201d walking tours and offers a colorful new self-guided map highlighting 26 of the best-known houses that the prominent realist artist Edward Hopper depicted. He said of his work in Gloucester that \u201cwhen everyone else would be painting ships and the waterfront, I\u2019d just go around looking at houses.\u201dThe posts are part of the Gloucester HarborWalk, a free, multimile, historic, civic and artistic public-access walkway that zigzags in and out of historic locales, piers, plazas, docks and parks. Call it stealth wayfinding, since it affords an intimate view of the harborfront, giving access to the town\u2019s history \u2014 and the water itself \u2014 without disturbing the working port, or cutesifying it.Given Cape Ann\u2019s relationship with artists, local paintings are just about everywhere, including restaurants such as Latitude 43, a six-year-old seaside cynosure that has 400 seats, including its outdoor deck, as well as a frenzied two-chef sushi pit. Rotating painting exhibitions are always on the menu.Travelers aren\u2019t just going there, of course. Gloucester, with a population of 44,381, according to the census, had some 547,000 visitors last year, the city says. This is still a port where oilskin sou\u2019westers are proudly worn, but the marine economy now represents a third of the city\u2019s jobs, in comparison to 92 percent 150 years ago, according to the city.On the HarborWalk jaunt, visitors learn that it is a transitional time for fishermen, trying to make a living in an era of declining fisheries, changing fish populations, increasingly stringent regulation and global price wars.But the port, as any visitor can witness, is very much alive. Aside from the city\u2019s busy whale-watch tours and fishing charters, there are harbor cruises in schooners of the sort immortalized in \u201cCaptains Courageous\u201d by Rudyard Kipling. The 58-foot-long Ardelle is the newest, a contemporary replica of a classic wooden fishing schooner, called a pinky. Its template was the Maine, built in 1845, plying the waters until 1926 as a working vessel.The construction of the Ardelle was part of an attempt \u201cto keep thousand-year old nautical skills alive,\u201d said Harold A. Burnham, the schooner\u2019s builder and skipper. \u201cIf you don\u2019t do something to keep these original traditions alive, they will be gone forever. They are disappearing in front of our eyes.\u201dMr. Balf hopes visitors will understand that \u201cwe are trying to build an economic model similar to the market for sustainable agriculture,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are fighting hard here, to stay alive as a viable port.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Egypt\u2019s Fondness for Foreigners", "Date": "2014-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAIRO \u2014 \u201cI love Egypt and cannot live anywhere else, but as long as Europeans live in the country without restraint or laws, I find it impossible to live here. I suffer, I feel alienated and the injustice pains me.\u201dThat paragraph was written not by a modern Egyptian militant but by Nubar Pasha (1825-99), a Christian of Armenian descent, who was Egypt\u2019s first prime minister. Nubar served under six Egyptian rulers, including Muhammad Ali, who ruled for 43 years (1805-48) and established a modern state.At first, Nubar was devoted to defending the trammeled rights of Egyptians \u2014 abolishing an oppressive system under which peasants had to work for no pay on government land. In 1875, however, he instigated so-called mixed courts. Based on the French legal code and presided over by European judges, the courts were designed to encourage foreigners to do business and settle in Egypt.They succeeded. By the early 20th century, Egypt was a remarkably cosmopolitan country, with large Italian, Armenian, English and French communities \u2014 at least until the 1950s and the political turmoil of the Suez affair. The Greek population once numbered 250,000; now, fewer than 4,000 Greeks remain in Cairo and Alexandria.Egyptians refer to foreigners as \u201ckhawagas,\u201d a term of Persian origin that means \u201cmister\u201d or \u201crespected sir.\u201d Khawagas played an important role in the development of Egyptian society.Egypt\u2019s first medical school was established by the French physician Antoine Clot in 1827. Egypt also became acquainted with cinema before many Western countries, thanks to an Italian associate of the Lumi\u00e8re brothers, Henri Dello Strologo. Shortly after the first demonstration of a motion picture in Paris in 1895, Alexandria followed suit with its first screening.Although there was often tension about foreign ownership of so much of the economy, Egypt had a great capacity for turning the khawagas into real Egyptians. Perhaps the greatest of modern Greek poets, Constantine Cavafy (1863-1933), lived and died in Egypt, where he worked as a civil servant and stockbroker. One of the finest actors in Egyptian cinema was Stephan Rosti (1891-1964). Born to an Austrian father and an Italian mother, he worked in the Egyptian postal administration before turning to acting.This Egyptian capacity for tolerance and assimilation is now in doubt. Last year, the bank HSBC named Egypt the least foreigner-friendly of 37 countries surveyed, and the Deutsche Welle broadcast service reported on \u201cthe wave of xenophobia\u201d against foreigners in Egypt. Protests, whether organized by Islamists or their opponents, it was said, often end with demonstrators ripping up photographs of President Obama and chanting anti-American slogans.Have Egyptians succumbed to xenophobia? To answer that, let\u2019s clear up one or two misunderstandings. True, most Egyptians don\u2019t trust the United States because it has turned a blind eye to human rights abuses when doing so has suited Washington, and it has consistently backed dictatorial regimes. Opposition to American policies, though, does not translate into hatred for Americans. Egyptians may protest against Mr. Obama, but individual Americans are not victimized because of his policies. Another mistake is to interpret Egyptians\u2019 struggle against certain forms of capitalist exploitation as a sort of xenophobia. In 1932, for example, the Egyptian author Muhammad Hussein Heikal praised the part played by the khawagas in the development of Egypt, even as he criticized excessive foreign ownership of Egypt\u2019s resources.The charge of xenophobia was also leveled at Gamal Abdel Nasser when he nationalized large enterprises in 1961. What was seen in the West as an anti-foreigner move was, in fact, a continuation of the socialist program he\u2019d begun directly after he came to power in 1952 with land reforms favoring the peasants.A third misconception confuses government policy with the attitudes of ordinary people toward foreigners. Albert Pardo, an Egyptian-born French Jew, illustrates this in his memoirs.Pardo lived in Egypt until 1956, when the country came under attack by France, Britain and Israel. Pardo received a summons to the Ministry of the Interior, where he was told by a military officer that he and his family had eight days to leave Egypt. The officer added menacingly that the arrest warrant would not include his wife and children, so who knew what would befall them if he were in custody. The same treatment was meted out to thousands whom the regime deemed to be hostile aliens.Pardo took the warning, and a few days later, he and his family were packed and ready to leave Egypt forever. They were surprised to find scores of Egyptians waiting in the street for them: storekeepers and their employees, and more neighbors than Pardo even recognized. They had all turned up at 6 in the morning to take their leave of the Pardo family and to reassure them that they would surely be back soon. \u201cThe only thing I want to remember about Egypt is those good, dignified and tolerant people,\u201d Pardo wrote. \u201cA lifetime later, I still feel more Egyptian than French.\u201dFor my part, I can only thank Monsieur Pardo. During the 18 days of the 2011 revolution, I used to invite foreign journalists to Tahrir Square, where they were well received by the protesters. It was generally when President Hosni Mubarak\u2019s officers felt desperate that concerted attacks on international reporters occurred.When Egypt has lapsed into xenophobia, it has always been because of the paranoia and aggression of dictators, not of the people. Many Egyptians feel that Western governments misunderstood their support for the ouster of the Muslim Brotherhood government of President Mohamed Morsi, but they do not bear a grudge and they certainly have no hostility toward foreigners.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sophie Masloff, Ex-Mayor of Pittsburgh, Dies at 96", "Date": "2014-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySophie Masloff, a Democrat who campaigned with a big black pocketbook, charmed voters with homespun verbal gaffes and from 1988 to \u201994 was the first woman and the first Jew to serve as mayor of Pittsburgh, died on Sunday at a hospice in Mount Lebanon, Pa., a suburb of Pittsburgh. She was 96.Her death was confirmed by Joseph Sabino Mistick, her chief of staff when she was mayor. Mrs. Masloff, who lived in Pittsburgh all her life, had only a high school education, had worked most of her life as a court clerk and was the 70-year-old president of the City Council when, under the City Charter, she was named interim mayor, succeeding the popular Mayor Richard S. Caliguiri, who died of a rare blood disorder 20 months from the end of his third term.He was a hard act to follow. In the late 1970s and early \u201980s he had led Pittsburgh through wrenching changes: from the death of Big Steel to the birth of a robust, diversified economy, with a new downtown skyline; sharp declines in population and jobs; and a renaissance in education, culture and quality of life. Mrs. Masloff seemed hopelessly miscast. Her public speaking was unsophisticated; she sometimes wrote words on her hand to jog her memory. She delegated so much authority that aides often had to jump in and answer questions for her at public meetings and news briefings.But she pledged to continue innovative ventures with the alliance of corporations, universities and civic groups that had reshaped Pittsburgh, and to create more jobs and curtail urban flight. And in a city of 390,000 that still had scores of ethnic working-class neighborhoods and an aging population, her homey Pittsburgh demeanor was a political advantage. She called herself \u201can old Jewish grandmother,\u201d and her streetwise Pittsburghese, delivered in a high, nasal rasp, was pitch-perfect: \u201cWhat? Yunz don\u2019t remember?\u201dHer malapropisms on visiting rock stars were endearments of a sort. The Who became \u201cthe How.\u201d It was \u201cBruce Bedspring\u201d and \u201cthe Dreadful Dead.\u201dWhen people called out on the street, they\u2019d say, \u201cHi, Sophie.\u201d Or, \u201cHow ya doin\u2019, Sophie?\u201dIn 1989, after beating five candidates in a primary \u2014 virtually assuring her election as mayor in heavily Democratic Pittsburgh \u2014 she ran unopposed and won a full four-year term. She soon shed the grandmotherly allusions, which had played into opponents\u2019 criticisms of her managerial skills. But the rhetorical flourishes went on. \u201cAs Henry the Eighth said to each of his wives,\u201d she told audiences too many times, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t keep you long.\u201d Once, posing for photographs with a Yugoslav official, she said, \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve never been to Czechoslovakia.\u201d\u201cMadame Mayor,\u201d the indignant statesman intoned, \u201cI\u2019m from Yugoslavia.\u201d\u201cI know that,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut the truth is, I\u2019ve never been to Czechoslovakia.\u201dMrs. Masloff vowed to avoid tax increases, threatened to close city accounts unless banks invested more in housing, laid off city workers and fought deficits with budget cuts. Despite protests, she signed a law barring discrimination against gay men and lesbians in housing, jobs and restaurant service. But by 1993, several high-tech companies and thousands of jobs had moved to suburban industrial parks with more space and lower taxes. There had been long newspaper and transit strikes. Pittsburgh remained livable, with low crime, affordable housing, good schools and a rich cultural scene. But critics said the mayor lacked vision. And what had once been seen as colorful Sophie-speak had begun to rankle voters.She did not run again. In a statement on Sunday, the current mayor of Pittsburgh, William Peduto, called Mrs. Masloff \u201ca trailblazer camouflaged in grace and humor\u201d and said she \u201cpersonified Pittsburgh \u2014 she was kind and approachable, but you dared not underestimate her.\u201d Sophie Friedman was born in Pittsburgh on Dec. 23, 1917, to Louis and Jennie Friedman, immigrants from Romania. Her father, an insurance salesman, died when she was an infant; her mother, who never spoke English, rolled cigars in a factory to support Sophie and two daughters and a son from a previous marriage. She spoke only Yiddish until she attended public school. After graduating from high school in 1935, she worked as a bookkeeper and secretary.In 1939 she married Jack Masloff, a security guard, who died in 1991. She is survived by her daughter, Linda Busia, two grandchildren and a great-granddaughter. In 1938 she became a clerk in the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas. She worked there for 38 years, eventually becoming assistant chief clerk. She also became a Democratic Party worker, and after 40 years of service was elected to the City Council in 1976. She said her major accomplishment on the Council was bringing cable television to Pittsburgh.After stepping down as mayor, she attended several Democratic National Conventions, as she had since the \u201950s. In an interview with The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review on her 90th birthday in 2007, she recalled the span of her life.\u201cWe were very, very poor, and it was horrible as a child,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I came through it \u2014 and just think of the great honor I had. What an incredible honor it was for me to be elected mayor of Pittsburgh. My mother, if she were alive, would never have believed what happened to me.\u201dEmma G. Fitzsimmons contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Never Rich Enough", "Date": "2014-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBig CityOn an evening during the last stretch of summer, 385 people arrived at the studios of LTV, a cable-access programmer in Wainscott, on the East End of Long Island, for a town-hall meeting to discuss mounting aural assaults from commuter helicopters going to and from Manhattan. The issue had been igniting tempers all season \u2014 especially in the communities of Shelter Island, the Springs and parts of the North Fork, areas where a lot of the noise has been absorbed and where local self-perception runs less toward the glossy and indulgent than it does elsewhere on the East End.\u201cIn 2007 we banned helicopters,\u201d Jim Dougherty, Shelter Island\u2019s town supervisor, told me, pointing out that none of his constituents ever complained about the prohibition. \u201cSo it is the height of irony that we should become the dustbin for the East Hampton airport.\u201dHelicopter traffic at the airport this summer has increased by close to 40 percent over last and with it has come a comparable rise in tension between the very affluent and the exceptionally rich.\u201cQuality of life truly is being diminished for commercial greed and the convenience of the same people who burned the economy,\u201d a longtime Shelter Island summer resident said to me.\u201cWhen I look up at small planes and choppers I see a fleet of middle fingers across the sky.\u201dAt the turn of the last century it was the bourgeoisie in New York and other major cities who might have envisioned similar gestures of contempt directed at them by robber barons fleeing to Saratoga and Newport during July and August via the era\u2019s own elaborate and expensive means of transport, private rail cars or yachts.Richard Hofstadter, in his classic work of historical analysis \u201cThe Age of Reform,\u201d published in 1955, argued that it was the disgust and disruption felt by those who had previously occupied the highest ranks of the social order toward the new superseding class of self-lavishing bankers and industrialists that ultimately allowed the Progressive movement to flourish. The undermining of status radicalized the formerly complacent, and class politics took shape because one segment of the population had so much money that the merely respectable could now identify with the actually poor.\u201cTo face the insolence of the local boss or traction magnate in a town where one\u2019s family had long been prominent was galling enough,\u201d Hofstadter wrote, \u201cit was still harder to bear at a time when every fortune, every career, every reputation, seemed smaller and less significant because it was measured against the Vanderbilts, Harrimans, Goulds, Carnegies, Rockefellers and Morgans.\u201d A survey of Progressive Party leaders in 1912, he noted, revealed how overwhelmingly urban and middle-class they were. None were farmers and only one came from labor.It is easy, of course, to mock the grievances of those driving their $40,000 Volvos to $1 million summer houses against those spending thousands on helicopter rides to their $10 million houses as distinctions without a difference.As in the early 20th century, however, the subject of inequality, especially in New York, began to dominate conversation in our own age, once those near, but hardly reigning at, the top started to feel acutely affected by it. And today, the urban upper-middle class again animates progressive politics. A current example is the candidacy of Zephyr Teachout, a Manhattan legal academic, who with her running mate, Tim Wu, another Manhattan legal academic, is challenging Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo in the Democratic primary on the grounds that he has been too submissive to the interests of big money, and that Wall Street generally has wielded too much influence \u2014 too much of it pernicious \u2014 over the lives of New Yorkers.This was obviously the sentiment shared by New Yorkers who elected Bill de Blasio as mayor last year. Then, in the months leading up to the mayoral primary, a high-end downtown real-estate broker explained his leftward shift to me, and the reasons he intended to vote for Mr. de Blasio. Included among them, he said, were the struggles he witnessed in families \u201cwith $2.5 million apartments\u201d who were juggling multiple school tuitions and so on. In the primary, exit polling suggested, Mr. de Blasio received similar percentages of votes among those making more than $100,000 and among those making $50,000 to $100,000.The fight against helicopters on Long Island has involved many in local politics for the first time and empowered others to realize that they can call upon government to rectify imbalances that may seem like variances in lifestyle, but have broader resonance. What may fail to result in easy victory might in the end serve as an incentive to a more expansive activism.Email: bigcity@nytimes.com Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lending in China Slowed Drastically in July", "Date": "2014-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Chinese lending unexpectedly and drastically slowed in July to the lowest level since the depths of the global financial crisis, as a weak property market appeared to drive down demand for new loans, despite recent moves to ease credit.A broad measure of new credit was 273.1 billion renminbi, or $44.3 billion, in July, the central bank reported on its website Wednesday. That is the lowest monthly total since October 2008, the month before China announced a huge stimulus program that was seen as crucial to the country\u2019s success in avoiding the deep recessions in the United States and Europe.The plunge in new credit puts more pressure on China\u2019s economy, which is on track this year to grow at the slowest pace in a generation, since the slowdown after the 1989 crackdown on the student democracy movement in Tiananmen Square. Economists said the figures might prompt the government to accelerate its efforts to increase growth, including reducing the amount of funds that banks must set aside as reserves.\u201cToday\u2019s monetary data should not be viewed lightly,\u201d Liu Li-Gang and Zhou Hao, economists with the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, said in a note. \u201cIt means that the financial system is engaging a rapid deleveraging process, which could have significant repercussions on the real economy.\u201dIn an unusual step, the People\u2019s Bank of China, the central bank, issued a separate statement that offered some explanations for the weakness of the July credit figures.It cited stricter supervision of the so-called shadow banking sector, the off-balance sheet lending by banks and trust companies. The sector\u2019s explosive growth in recent years, much like the expansion of subprime lending in the United States a decade ago, has spurred talk of a looming banking crisis in China.The central bank also said that July was traditionally a slow month for lending. It noted that lending \u2014 when averaged with the strong growth in June, during which credit expanded by almost 2 trillion renminbi \u2014 was at a normal level.August may see a pickup in lending. In the early part of this month, the central bank said that new lending averaged 30 billion to 50 billion renminbi a day, a pace that, if maintained, would result in a big rebound. Credit would \u201cmaintain steady growth,\u201d the bank said.Economists had forecast far higher levels of new credit, which China officially labels as \u201csocial financing\u201d and includes all nongovernment borrowing from banks, bond markets, trusts and other sources. Standard Chartered Bank estimated new lending would be more than five times as high as the actual figure. Another measure, new local-currency loans, came in at 385.2 billion renminbi in July, about half of the projected amount and the lowest monthly total since December 2009, when the People\u2019s Bank of China was slowing the huge surge in credit that was part of the stimulus.Mr. Liu and Mr. Zhou, the economists, said that the weak credit numbers made it \u201cimminent\u201d that the People\u2019s Bank of China would lower the so-called required reserve ratio for banks to lift confidence.The slowdown in lending fit with other Chinese economic figures released Wednesday that suggest the economy is losing steam.For example, fixed-asset investment, excluding rural households, rose 17 percent in the first seven months of the year, the slowest pace since 2001, according to figures from Bloomberg. Factory production slowed to a 9 percent gain in July from 9.2 percent in June, and retail sales growth was slightly below expectations.Wang Tao, an economist at UBS based in Hong Kong, said in a note that she did not see the lending slowdown as a sign that the government was tightening credit and said lending in August should improve.Chinese stock markets were little changed after the news. While markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen fell more than half a percent after the midmorning announcement, they later rebounded and closed nearly flat. The Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong, dominated by mainland companies or companies with strong financial bonds to mainland China, ended up 0.8 percent.Advertisement"}

Often \u2014 not always, of course, but far more often than the free-market faithful would have you believe \u2014 there is, in fact, a good reason for the government to get involved. Pollution controls are the simplest example, but not unique.So, do you believe that would be enough? Really?

But libertarian visions of an unregulated economy do play a significant role in political debate, so it\u2019s important to understand that these visions are mirages. Of course some government interventions are unnecessary and unwise. But the idea that we have a vastly bigger and more intrusive government than we need is a foolish fantasy.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Arizona Treasurer Wins G.O.P. Primary for Governor", "Date": "2014-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPHOENIX \u2014 Doug Ducey, the state\u2019s treasurer and former chief executive of an international chain of ice cream parlors, defeated five opponents in the Republican primary for governor on Tuesday. His victory reaffirms the hold of the Republican Party\u2019s conservative establishment on Arizona politics despite a record turnout among independents, a more centrist constituency that makes up the largest voting bloc in the state.\u201cArizona has long been a state that gains its strength from common-sense state capital leadership, and Doug Ducey is the right candidate to continue that tradition as governor,\u201d Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, chairman of the Republican Governors Association, said in a statement.Early Wednesday, with 99 percent of the ballets counted, Mr. Ducey had 37 percent of the vote, with Scott Smith in second place with 21.6 percent.Mr. Ducey amassed a diverse group of supporters, including Tea Party members, Chamber of Commerce leaders and even the retired pitcher Randy Johnson, a local legend of sorts for his role in the Arizona Diamondbacks\u2019 only World Series title, in 2001.He has argued that his business experience has readied him to lead the state. On the campaign trail, he courted voters over ice cream and liked to say that he helped build the chain, Cold Stone Creamery, from a local company into an international business \u201cwithout tax breaks for chocolate-dipped cones.\u201dHe is staunchly anti-abortion and pledged to use \u201cfencing, satellites, guardsmen, more police and prosecutors\u201d to secure the border.His Democratic rival in November is Fred DuVal, a former member of the state\u2019s Board of Regents and deputy director of intergovernmental affairs under President Bill Clinton. Mr. DuVal had no opposition in the primaries.In another key primary race in Arizona, Mark Brnovich, a former prosecutor and state gaming director, defeated Tom Horne, the incumbent, to become the Republican Party\u2019s nominee for attorney general. Mr. Horne, a Harvard-educated lawyer who was the driving force behind the push to require proof of citizenship for people registering to vote in Arizona, had been besieged by allegations of campaign finance improprieties over the use of his office and workers in his campaign.Mr. Brnovich received 53 percent of the vote, while Mr. Horne had 47 percent.Voters also cast ballots in nine congressional races and in at least most of them, the results were not unexpected. In the Second Congressional District, based in Tucson, Martha McSally, a retired Air Force colonel, handily won the Republican nomination. Her victory sets the stage for a rematch of 2012, when she lost to Ron Barber, a Democrat, by less than one percentage point. An aide to former United States Representative Gabrielle Giffords, Mr. Barber was picked to run for her seat when she was forced to resign after she was wounded in a mass shooting at a political event in 2011.In the Seventh Congressional District, a heavily Hispanic Democratic stronghold in Phoenix, voters chose Ruben Gallego to replace United States Representative Ed Pastor, who is retiring in December after 11 terms in Congress. Mr. Gallego, an Iraq war veteran and former state legislator, defeated Mary Rose Wilcox, a former Maricopa County supervisor and longtime activist, despite Mr. Pastor\u2019s endorsement of her. There were no Republicans running in the primary.Andy Tobin, the speaker of the Arizona House of Representatives, remained locked in a surprisingly tight race against two lesser-known opponents for the Republican nomination in the First Congressional District, in northern Arizona \u2014 Adam Kwansman, a state legislator, and Gary Kiehne, a millionaire rancher who self-financed his campaign. With 73 percent of the precincts reporting, Mr. Kiehne was ahead of Mr. Tobin by 407 votes.Republicans were banking on Ms. McSally and Mr. Tobin to regain control of the state\u2019s congressional delegation, where Democrats hold five of the nine seats. An analysis by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report lists both contests as \u201ctossups\u201d in the general election.The winner in the First Congressional District will face the Democratic incumbent, Ann Kirkpatrick, who faced no primary opponent.Mr. Smith, the former mayor of Mesa, was considered the most moderate among the Republicans running for governor. He focused his campaign less on border security, a prime theme for his opponents, and more on the economy, which is still suffering from the aftereffects of the recession. Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, lent him her endorsement and financial support, in part because he backed her decision to expand Medicaid coverage, a move opposed by most Republicans in the state because of its perceived connection to President Obama\u2019s health care overhaul.\u201cI\u2019ve run hard in the primary against able and worthy opponents,\u201d Mr. Ducey told supporters at his victory party at a downtown Phoenix hotel on Tuesday, Ms. Brewer by his side. \u201cI\u2019ll keep running as your nominee and with the honor of your support, we will win the election for governor.\u201dLizette Alvarez contributed reporting from Miami.Advertisement"}

While the soft data is unlikely to shake the Bank of Japan\u2019s conviction that the economy can ride it out, it could add pressure on the bank for further monetary easing if the weakness in exports and consumption is prolonged. Japan, the world\u2019s third-largest economy, shrank an annualized 6.8 percent in the second quarter, less than a median market forecast of 7.1 percent, Cabinet Office data showed on Wednesday. Private consumption, which makes up about 60 percent of the economy, took a hit from the sales tax increase to fall 5 percent in the quarter.

They live in places like England, Wales or New York.However, they hope an emotional appeal to their Scottish brothers and sisters, and a public petition calling on Scots to reject independence, will help Scotland vote \u201cno.\u201dDan Snow, a television presenter and one of the organizers of the campaign, said he felt \u201cpassionately\u201d about Britain.\u201cI don\u2019t have a vote in the Scottish referendum, but I certainly have a view and I really hope that our shared country stays together,\u201d he said in a statement.The Let\u2019s Stay Together campaign, befitting its artistic membership, takes a mellower approach than other efforts also opposed to Scottish independence. Politicians who oppose separation have been accused of trying to scare Scots about the economic consequences of going it alone. Campaigners against independence also highlight its risks, stressing that the three main British political parties say they would refuse a currency union with an independent Scotland and that Scots would be unable to use the British pound sterling. On Thursday, pro-independence campaigners shrugged off the latest initiative. \u201cIt\u2019s great to know that Scotland has so many friends and admirers, and we know they will all continue to be our friends and admirers after we vote yes on Sept. 18,\u201d said the campaign for independence, known as Yes Scotland, in a statement.\u201cWe\u2019re sure that everyone who genuinely has Scotland\u2019s interests at heart will be delighted in future years to see a fairer and more prosperous Scotland emerge using the great opportunities of independence to grow our economy and make an even bigger contribution on the global stage,\u201d the statement continued.It remains to be seen if English or Welsh celebrities will be able to win the votes of patriotic Scots.

{"Headline": "The Risk of a New Cold War", "Date": "2014-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorRussian and Western perspectives on the crisis in Ukraine are bound to diverge, but the tragedy of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 should bring us together. This is not only because we can appreciate and feel saddened by the scale of the human loss, but also because the incident is a harbinger of the wider danger we are in. Of profound concern is the possibility of an unintended escalation of the conflict in eastern Ukraine to a direct NATO-Russia military confrontation. To avoid such a development, policy makers need to relearn some important crisis management lessons from history.Just consider that even before the Flight 17 disaster, we had seen a huge deterioration in mutual trust between Russia and the West. Russian and NATO military forces are being deployed ever closer to each other. A number of frozen conflicts, like Transnistria (a breakaway province of Moldova, on Ukraine\u2019s western border), already haunt Europe; these have the potential to widen the theater of possible confrontation between Russia and the West beyond Ukraine. In addition, there is very little contact or exchange of information on what our respective militaries are doing, and the existing crisis management arrangements \u2014 both between NATO and Russia and the European Union and Russia \u2014 are inadequate. And, always in the background, there are large numbers of nuclear weapons on both sides on high states of alert.Many potentially useful mechanisms for dialogue, like the NATO-Russia Council, which in normal times might meet monthly and offer a forum for discussing difficult issues, are also being closed down.The upshot is that the current crisis is deepening even as our mutual capacity to discuss, manage and control it is either shrinking by the day or nonexistent.First, there needs to be a concerted effort by all parties to ensure military and political restraint not only inside Ukraine, but outside as well. History tells us that one of the most difficult aspects of major-power crisis management is maintaining control over events.A recent incident in which a Russian warplane flew close to the guided-missile destroyer Donald Cook in the Black Sea should serve as a warning. Political leaders should review their military rules of engagement to ensure restraint at all levels of command and to reduce any potential for an actual exchange of fire. Similarly, Russia and the West both need to use all their respective influence to ensure that there are no flare-ups in any of the other frozen conflicts in the region.Second, we badly need to improve military-to-military communication and engagement between NATO and Russian commands. If the Cold War taught us anything, it was that steps to reduce the fear of a surprise military attack by one party increase the decision time that leaderships have in a crisis. That acts as a crucial stabilizing influence.We also urge all sides to pursue exchanges of data on the activities of military forces when they are out of garrison and to allow military liaison missions to monitor such movements. Those measures would substantially reduce mutual fear and suspicion.Third, we need to keep alive some direct dialogue between Russia and the West. The NATO-Russia Council was set up to enable contact and communication between the two sides when the relationship was better. But given the current circumstances, it should meet more frequently, not less.We also need a major international conference to discuss fundamental issues at the heart of the Helsinki Final Act, the 1975 accord that established territorial integrity and human rights as central to the European security order. It is clear that a chasm of differing interpretations and alternate narratives has opened up between Russia and the West on those matters.Looking further forward, since Ukraine\u2019s economy will, ultimately, have to be helped by, and integrated with, the economies of both the European Union and Russia, both of those parties should continue a dialogue on possible future cooperation between the European Union and the Eurasian Economic Union. We know we are a long way from seeing such cooperation today, but there is no reason detailed technical work on the relationship should not continue.If NATO partners and Russia do not act to steer events in the way we set out, our fear is that the future course of this crisis will be shaped by circumstances independent of our respective political wills. If we allow that to happen, it may be chance, rather than good judgment, that will decide our countries\u2019 fates.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Proposing New Capital Is Old Idea in Argentina", "Date": "2014-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Argentina\u2019s president, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, said this week that the country should start discussing moving the capital from Buenos Aires, she pointed to Santiago del Estero as a potential choice, making that provincial city in northern Argentina a contender to join a long list of other places in the global hinterlands chosen to be national capitals.Few Argentines expect the idea, recently floated by Juli\u00e1n Dom\u00ednguez, the leader of Argentina\u2019s lower house of Congress, to advance very far. Still, the proposal reflects longstanding tension between Buenos Aires, with its European-style architecture and elegant boulevards, and Argentina\u2019s provinces, where most of the country\u2019s agricultural and mineral wealth is generated. Many Argentines feel that Buenos Aires commands too much influence over the rest of the country.Mr. Dom\u00ednguez, reported to be considering a presidential run in 2015, says that moving the capital to Santiago del Estero, a city of about 250,000 people in the province of the same name, would rebalance political power in Argentina and unleash the potential of a neglected region strategically located between the Pacific and the Atlantic Oceans.Countries around the world have shifted their capitals for centuries, forging new cities like Washington and Canberra, Australia. While the proposal in Argentina remains somewhat vague, it seems less about building a new capital from scratch, as Brazil did with Bras\u00edlia, than about transferring the capital to an existing city, as Kazakhstan did with Astana.Others believe that Mrs. Kirchner has little intention of seeing the idea materialize. Carlos Germano, a political analyst in Buenos Aires, described it as a maneuver by Mr. Dom\u00ednguez to establish himself among the candidates who want the presidential nomination for the Front for Victory, Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s party, in elections next year.\u201cIt was a symbolic declaration,\u201d Mr. Germano said of Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s comments about shifting the capital. \u201cNothing more.\u201dProposing to transfer the capital from Buenos Aires has long been a fixture of Argentine politics. Mr. Dom\u00ednguez says doing so would fulfill the dream of Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn, a leader in the independence struggle against Spain.In the 1850s, Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, the Argentine writer and statesman, suggested moving the capital to Mart\u00edn Garc\u00eda, an island in the R\u00edo de la Plata, the river that forms part of the border with Uruguay. Other suggestions included the cities of Rosario and C\u00f3rdoba; as recently as the 1980s, Raul Alfons\u00edn, then the president, proposed transferring the capital to the small city of Viedma in Patagonia.Jonathan Gilbert contributed reporting from Montevideo, Uruguay.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alaska Referendum Upholds Tax System for Oil Companies", "Date": "2014-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 A hard-fought ballot referendum that would have overturned Alaska\u2019s system of taxing oil industry profits, put to voters last week but until now considered too close to call, has failed by a narrow margin, with absentee ballots counted this week nailing down the outcome.Mr. Parnell pushed his tax overhaul through the state\u2019s Republican-controlled Legislature last year, replacing a system called Alaska\u2019s Clear and Equitable Share that had been Ms. Palin\u2019s hallmark achievement \u2014 signed in 2007, before she became the Republican vice-presidential nominee. Mr. Parnell\u2019s opponents, led by Democrats, said his plan was too generous to the oil companies in tax breaks and incentives, and they gathered enough signatures to put the question of repeal to voters.Supporters of the tax system, in a campaign largely financed by the oil companies, fought back. In a barrage of television ads, supporters said that Mr. Parnell\u2019s plan was showing results in encouraging new investment and oil production \u2014 adding jobs and tax revenue crucial to Alaska\u2019s economy \u2014 and that going back to Ms. Palin\u2019s system risked disaster.With the new results posted late Tuesday night, the repeal measure failed by 8,443 votes out of about 172,000 cast.A leader of the repeal drive, State Senator Bill Wielechowski, said the narrow defeat and the pledges the oil companies had made, especially that production would increase, were important in creating pressure to make the new system as good as promised.\u201cWe\u2019ve got them on the record now, and we have an army of Alaskans who are going to be ready to hold them accountable,\u201d said Mr. Wielechowski, Democrat of Anchorage. \u201cIf they live up to their promises, that\u2019s a victory for Alaska.\u201dFor Mr. Parnell, who is running for a second full term in November, the ballot measure was also in some ways a personal referendum. But with the vote so close, his two leading opponents \u2014 a Democrat and an independent who were both in favor of repeal \u2014 may try to keep the tax debate alive, people in both parties said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Financial Crisis", "Date": "2014-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShortlistIn his latest explication of the international system, the noted foreign affairs scholar and prolific author Mandelbaum grapples with the core questions facing the world today. He takes as his starting point the global financial crisis of 2008-9, and from the outset challenges the \u201cimpression that the days of worldwide economic growth had come to an end.\u201d They did not, and have not, he eloquently argues. Mandelbaum (with whom I share an editor, though I don\u2019t know him) examines the major fault lines in the world today, using a series of poetic metaphors: \u201cthe roof\u201d for the question of who will provide stability; \u201cthe gates\u201d for the challenges of trade and attempts to control its sometimes destructive effects; \u201cthe river\u201d for the constant and often unfettered flow of money around the world. He also turns to the key role of what are called the BRIC countries \u2014 Brazil, Russia, India and China \u2014 as well as the vast teeming world formerly known as \u201cdeveloping.\u201dThough the prose is lucid, the book as a whole suffers from a certain thinness. It reads as a primer. But for those not steeped in these issues, it will no doubt be informative. Mandelbaum\u2019s prognosis is guardedly optimistic. He believes that ultimately the forces of technology and the globalization that enriches ever more people worldwide are simply too powerful to be thwarted by fickle politics and always-looming risks. Shocks there will be, he concludes, but none likely sufficient to disrupt the \u00adtrajectory. Rarely does a book state its thesis with such simple clarity and then proceed to illuminate it. Drezner, a professor at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, announces in the first paragraphs that the conventional wisdom about the aftermath of the great financial crisis of 2008 is wrong. Rather than a litany of failed measures from governments and various international organizations, \u201cglobal economic governance responded in an effective and nimble fashion. In short, the system worked.\u201dWhy do so many believe that it did not? The main reason, Drezner says, is a culture of the media and the elite that nostalgically views national governments and international organizations like the I.M.F. as having worked better in the past. Not so, Drezner argues. They never worked well. But during the 2008-9 crisis, they collectively managed to stave off further crisis and restore international growth. Today, the global economy is increasing at a decent clip, and most countries outside of Europe and the United States managed to avoid the crisis\u2019s worst effects.Drezner puts American leadership at the center of the success story, as well as the largely cooperative relationship between the United States and China (at least in the realm of economic issues). Yet what is most intriguing about his argument is the way he depicts global governance as a teeming system of interlocking institutions, each acting responsibly. That stability, Drezner shows, more than the leadership of one hegemon, was probably the key.A mainstream Marxist may be an oxymoron, but Kunkel is as close as we get. He is something of a literary wunderkind whose literary debut a number of years ago established him as a promising new voice. Yet his passions include not just novels but also essays and criticism of a decidedly and self-avowedly Marxist bent. This new volume compiles several of Kunkel\u2019s previously published essays along with an introduction. If there is an animating theme \u2014 and it is at times difficult to identify a piquant one in the leaden prose that seems de rigueur for postmodern Marxists \u2014 it is that \u201cglobal capitalism or neoliberalism under U.S. hegemony . . . has inflicted economic insecurity and ecological anxiety.\u201d That point seems fairly uncontroversial, and to the extent that it has become a central part of the political debate about inequality and growth in general, Kunkel is perhaps more mainstream than Marxist (or perhaps Marxism is more mainstream than we think).The various essays touch on thinkers like David Harvey, who has added some new twists to old theories about the inevitable breakdown of capitalism, and polemicists like David Graeber, who has written a detailed history of how debt is in fact an instrument for elites to maintain control. Kunkel criticizes the left for failing to offer alternatives that can replace our flawed financial system. Fair enough, but he likewise limits himself to criticism and leaves larger questions only scantily addressed.Even five years after the financial crisis of 2008-9 crested, there is zero consensus about its causes. Just about anyone who can be blamed has been: rapacious bankers, venal elected officials, corrupt or incompetent regulators, na\u00efve home buyers.

{"Headline": "When Sanctions Lead to War", "Date": "2014-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 As Ukraine battles separatists and Russia appears poised to invade, many historians and scholars are warning of ominous similarities to the outbreak of World War I in 1914. But they are ignoring a more important comparison: 1941. The United States and Europe have until now relied almost exclusively on the threat of severe economic sanctions to prevent a Russian invasion of Ukraine. But sanctions \u2014 even crippling ones \u2014 won\u2019t necessarily avert this. For 20 years, economic sanctions have become Washington\u2019s preferred policy to demonstrate resolve without using force. Yet the United States has not imposed harsh sanctions on major powers; Iran has been the toughest target, and it hasn\u2019t unconditionally surrendered its nuclear program.Washington has not tried to compel another major power with sanctions since 1940-41, when America imposed them on Imperial Japan, culminating in an oil embargo and the seizure of Japanese assets in July 1941. At that time, the United States sought to deter Japan from seizing Southeast Asia and demanded that Tokyo withdraw from Indochina and China. Japan in turn concluded that American sanctions made the occupation of Southeast Asia essential, as well as the devastation of the United States Navy.Today\u2019s policy makers would do well to study the American and Japanese choices that produced Japan\u2019s attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. American officials at the time widely assumed that Japan wouldn\u2019t dare challenge the United States because, as then Assistant Secretary of State Dean Acheson later put it, \u201cNo rational Japanese could believe an attack on us could result in anything but disaster.\u201d And they offered no \u201ccarrots\u201d to Tokyo \u2014 only a weak stick, because, like President Obama today, Franklin D. Roosevelt never clearly threatened force.Meanwhile, Japan viewed the American position as a demand to forgo its role as a great power \u2014 something unacceptable to a proud empire. Japan preferred to fight rather than cave in. Moreover, Japanese leaders saw little distinction between economic sanctions and warfare and realized that sanctions would make their country weaker over time \u2014 something that encouraged them to strike sooner rather than later. They also believed the United States was politically weak and would give up if the costs got too high or the war lasted too long. This history has present-day implications. Harsh economic sanctions against Russia are unlikely to deter an invasion without an unambiguous warning that the United States will ensure Moscow\u2019s defeat. If Russia does intervene, it will do so expecting even harsher sanctions and may see them as an act of war. Like Imperial Japan, Moscow might conclude that it is irresponsible to wait for new sanctions to gut the Russian economy before taking further military action to break the West\u2019s will. One way to challenge the West would be to invade Estonia or Latvia. As far-fetched as it may seem, some angry Russian politicians are already discussing this idea. To the Kremlin, European states look like a collection of struggling economies that couldn\u2019t sustain a bombing campaign against Libya and routinely refuse to provide bases or troops to NATO. How would they react to the invasion of a small Baltic nation?Western leaders comfortably assume that Moscow wouldn\u2019t dare to attack a NATO member \u2014 believing that America\u2019s and NATO\u2019s conventional-weapons superiority and nuclear arsenals will deter aggression against member states. But the old logic of nuclear deterrence might not apply in this situation. Indeed, if President Vladimir V. Putin doesn\u2019t believe that Mr. Obama would actually use nuclear weapons in an escalating war, then the Cold War model of deterrence could fail.Attacking a NATO member would carry enormous risks and costs for Russia and is unlikely unless Mr. Putin believes his political survival is at stake. As Mr. Acheson wrote of the Japanese General Hideki Tojo, \u201cNo one in Washington realized that he and his regime regarded the conquest of Asia not as the accomplishment of an ambition but as the survival of a regime.\u201d If Mr. Putin feels similarly, what will he do about it? General Tojo\u2019s life was literally on the line in 1941, along with the lives of his closest political and military allies. While Mr. Putin and his allies seem less personally invested in Russia\u2019s Ukraine policy, they may believe that a major humiliation could be destabilizing and threaten their rule.The Kremlin\u2019s earlier decisions have left it with bad options. Letting Kiev crush the separatists could actually make things worse for Mr. Putin if American and European leaders think ongoing sanctions could force him to give Crimea back, too. In that case, Mr. Putin would have to absorb a significant strategic and political defeat, only to face a new choice between escalation and a bigger defeat. Avoiding such dangerous possibilities requires a policy that effectively deters an all-out Russian invasion but also avoids making Mr. Putin desperate. Washington must explicitly promise that America will do whatever it takes to prevent a Russian invasion of Ukraine from succeeding, and remain flexible by accepting a serious and wide-ranging dialogue about Ukraine. Kiev now has an opportunity to leverage its recent successes to secure a favorable settlement; American officials should encourage Ukraine\u2019s president, Petro Poroshenko, to do just that when he meets Mr. Putin in Minsk next week.Some Americans will complain that negotiating rewards Mr. Putin\u2019s aggression. But Russia\u2019s own policy has already done huge damage to the country\u2019s economic future by scaring off Western (and even Russian) investors and prompting European governments and voters to reassess their energy ties to Moscow. Those realities will endure for some time, with or without sanctions. The terrible irony of today\u2019s American-Russian confrontation is that just like Roosevelt facing Japan, Mr. Obama has set America on its current course precisely to avoid war. Hopefully he, and Mr. Acheson\u2019s successors at the State Department, will soon recognize the great risks they are taking.Advertisement"}

The 41-year-old youngest son of King Fahd, who died in 2005, is best known for his lavish lifestyle, flitting from one jet-set playground to another with a huge retinue, eliminating initial suggestions that the attack may have been political.On Sunday, Prince Abdul Aziz had concluded a stay at the Four Seasons Hotel George V, a luxurious Paris hotel owned by another Saudi prince where the top suites go for $2,200 a night, and was headed for Le Bourget airport when a band of gunmen in two B.M.W.s halted his convoy and drove off in the lead vehicle: a Mercedes passenger van with cargo that included a suitcase stuffed with at least 250,000 euros in cash (about $330,000). Three members of the prince\u2019s entourage were released unharmed, and the burned-out van \u2014 along with one of the B.M.W.s \u2014 was later discovered in a suburb.This latest robbery is alarming, and scaring off the ostentatiously wealthy who for generations have made Paris their shopping destination would be bad for France\u2019s sagging economy. Yet many people, their egalitarian instincts activated, have shown little sympathy for the prince, who is said once to have left a tip of \u20ac80,000 in Ibiza. And so long as the heists have no casualties, private jets will continue to bring supershoppers to Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "1,000 Islands, 2 Worlds", "Date": "2014-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGuests snorkle at the Holiday Inn on Kandooma Fushi island in the Maldives. The country, composed of more than 1,000 coral islands, is situated off the coast of India.The restaurant was somewhere near the presidential palace. At least that\u2019s what the Internet had said. It was dark in Mal\u00e9, the capital of the Maldives, where we had woken up at our hotel, hungry after traveling for more than 40 hours. We\u2019d slept through our chance to eat there: The kitchen downstairs was already closed. But Google Maps proposed a takeout place a couple of blocks away.The day before, as we rode in, jet-lagged, from the airport, Mal\u00e9 had shown itself as a city with the raffish charms of the Caribbean: brightly painted buildings huddled on its shoreline, small boats graced the harbor and men on motor scooters, either unaware of \u2014 or uninterested in \u2014 traffic laws, zipped down the boulevard that ran along the sea. But that first night, as I went to get our dinner, incongruous music was drifting through the streets. It was a high-pitched keening: plaintive, Middle Eastern and seemingly out of place among the silhouetted palm trees swaying near the beach. I knew what it was, but had not expected to find it here, a strange accompaniment to the pad Thai I\u2019d picked up: From a gold-domed mosque, a muezzin was offering the evening call to prayer.The Maldives, a natural necklace of more than 1,000 coral islands off the western coast of India in the Laccadive Sea, is mostly known as a glamorous vacation destination, the sort of spot where supermodels and their soon-to-be-ex-boyfriends go for beach-and-bungalow retreats. Its reputation is both hedonistic and decidedly high-end. Earlier this year, the Duke and the Duchess of Cambridge spent a holiday in the country just before their royal tour of Australia and New Zealand. They took a seaplane to a five-star resort on the remote atoll of Noonu in the nation\u2019s northwest corner. The two-bedroom villa where they stayed \u2014 thatched roof, sun deck \u2014 stands on stilts above the water with a 40-foot infinity pool and unhindered ocean views.But the Maldives, unlike Bermuda or St. Barts, are more complex than many getaways for European tourists. They are ruled by an Islamic government \u2014 one, in fact, that is becoming more extremist by the year. Maldivian citizens, who are mainly Sunni Muslims, cannot practice religions other than Islam. Pork and alcohol are widely banned, except, of course, at the resort hotels that cater to foreign travelers. As my girlfriend, Cheyne, and I arrived at the airport, we chanced across a news report announcing that the country had recently abandoned its quasi-secular legal code and imposed Shariah law.Perhaps it\u2019s in the nature of an escapist beach vacation to escape: to ignore the local culture and, in essence, face the sea with your back to the land. There\u2019s no doubt that over the course of six days, spent at three resorts, Cheyne and I escaped into extravagant indulgences, whether that meant massages in an underwater spa or a swim with stingrays in a coral reef. But the atmosphere of decadence, while certainly engrossing, was not hermetically sealed. Every now and then, real life \u2014 or real life for Maldivians \u2014 intruded on our reverie. Apparently in paradise, we nonetheless discovered that, with a few simple questions, even elaborate fantasies can sometimes spring a leak.The first hint came on the plane when a flight attendant handed us our customs cards. \u201cSeriously?\u201d Cheyne said, pointing at the list of items banned from import by Maldivian law. Some were unusual, if not surprising: spear guns, say, or dogs. But then there were the others: pork, pornography, alcohol and the catchall entry \u201cMaterials contrary to Islam.\u201d Cheyne took a picture of the card and posted it on Instagram with a caption reading, \u201cGood thing I left my false idols at home!\u201dBefore we booked our trip, I had heard a random segment on the BBC describing how a wealthy Saudi prince was planning to build 10 \u201cworld-class\u201d mosques in the Maldives, even as Saudi scholars had separately pledged $100,000 to improve the country\u2019s religious education. So though I knew that the Maldives were nominally Muslim, I had been lured by TripAdvisor and Expedia.com into thinking they were more or less an Islamic equivalent of the Riviera Maya. I figured that our trip would concern itself mostly with water sports and sitting on the beach.Which is, of course, the experience that most visitors to the Maldives end up having. The local vacation culture is dominated by isolated, opulent resorts. The majority of tourists never set foot in areas that aren\u2019t overseen by the travel industry. They arrive at the airport and are immediately shepherded by uniformed employees of the Hyatt or the Sheraton to nearby jetties where speedboats whisk them off on 40-minute rides to far-flung islands. It is aboard these boats that the fantasy of luxury begins: Smiling stewards ply you with bottles of coconut water and hand you damp towels to relieve the humid heat.As befit the island\u2019s name, we were greeted at Huvafen Fushi\u2019s dock by a beaming team of staff members. They shook our hands and welcomed us by name. There was another round of drinks \u2014 gingery and sweet \u2014 and a briefing on the available entertainments: the restaurants, the snorkeling reef, the glass-walled gym that overlooked the sea. Though it was only noon, the heat was already at perspiration levels, but that was quickly solved by the polo-shirted man who appeared beside us holding out a tray with more damp towels. As we cooled ourselves and moved toward the golf cart that would take us on a tour, freshly cut rose petals were strewn beneath our feet.Hufaven Fushi is a lush green refuge from the world where dirt roads cut through mangrove breaks and weathered boardwalks wander over shallows, connecting a village of native huts on stilts, each designed in faux primitive style. The resort, which prides itself on privacy, has only 44 rooms. Though we were told that most of them were occupied, in the day we spent there, Cheyne and I saw only a handful of fellow fantasists: a garrulous Australian and his date, and a thick-necked Chinese man who was pacing in his flip-flops and ruining the reverie by shouting into a cellphone.After lunch at Raw, Huvafen Fushi\u2019s macrobiotic restaurant, our guide for the day, Afzal Ali, one of the resort\u2019s private butlers (or thakurus), showed us the facility\u2019s most expensive and exclusive room, a royal-couple-worthy villa that rents for $22,000 a night in the high season and sits alone at a boardwalk\u2019s end with little else to look at but the sea. Here was the Maldives at its ostentatious best: surround-sound speakers, sun deck with Jacuzzi, private staircase that descended into the ocean, an indoor pool connected to the patio outside by way of a remote-controlled glass wall.\u201cWhat we offer is escape, a dream of luxury and remoteness,\u201d Marc Gussing, the manager, told us over dinner. \u201cWe\u2019re only four hours from Singapore and Dubai, but we give the impression of being far away.\u201dIn advance of joining Mr. Gussing, I had, on a whim, done a Google news search on the Maldives and up popped a story describing a report that had been issued days earlier by the human rights group Amnesty International. In the report, the group had urged Maldivian officials to investigate a police raid in April on a music festival that had taken place on the uninhabited island of Anbaraa. \u201cAlthough there are no laws banning music in the Maldives and Islamic dress is not mandatory,\u201d the report said, \u201cpolice action appears to have focused on stopping the festival and on forcing women wearing skirts and shirts to cover themselves.\u201dAs we ate our lamb and sipped our Pomerol, I asked Mr. Gussing if it was difficult to operate a luxury resort in a country where Islamic law is exactingly enforced. Huvafen Fushi claims, for instance, to have the largest wine cellar in the Indian Ocean, a climate-controlled chamber boasting bottles of Roman\u00e9e-Conti that sell for nearly $30,000. Were there, I inquired, ever any troubles with the government?\u201cIf I can fill a 6,000-bottle wine cellar on a sandbar, you can\u2019t really say that the government is not accommodating,\u201d Mr. Gussing told me with a smile. \u201cAre things changing in the Maldives? Yes. But do international guests ever see it? Are they exposed to it?\u201cNo,\u201d he answered himself. \u201cThey\u2019re just passing through. \u201dInternational guests have \u2014 at least in numbers \u2014 been passing through the Maldives since 1972, when George Corbin, an Italian travel agent, opened Kurumba, the country\u2019s first resort, on a former coconut plantation on a tiny island not far from the airport. Working with a team of local partners, Mr. Corbin built 30 rooms with coral stone walls and palm thatch roofs. There were brackish water showers and barbecues on the beach. When it was first established, Kurumba was reachable only by dhoni, a type of native open-air vessel with an outboard motor.From this modest start, the tourist business in the Maldives has rapidly expanded to the point that there are now more than 100 resorts, 30 or so of which define themselves as deluxe and offer amenities like lime-and-ginger salt scrubs and private starlight dinners on the beach. Four or five additional resorts are going up each year. The clientele is mainly European \u2014 British and Italian \u2014 though the number of Chinese visitors is on the rise.The Maldivian economy, formerly based on fishing, would probably not exist without the tourist trade, which, according to official statistics, provided the government with almost half of its revenues last year. The travel boom has continued despite the election last November of President Abdulla Yameen, an Islamist whose platform, now enacted, included a plan to institute the death penalty \u2014 even for children \u2014 under Shariah law.As I soon discovered, it was not entirely correct that visitors to the Maldives are not exposed to, or affected by, the country\u2019s Islamic culture. In 2007, for example, 12 foreign tourists \u2014 from England, China and Japan \u2014 were wounded after Muslim extremists set off a bomb in Sultan Park near Mal\u00e9\u2019s main mosque. Three years later, a YouTube video emerged of a British couple unwittingly insulted while renewing their wedding vows at the Vilu Reef Beach & Spa Resort. The resort\u2019s food and beverage manager officiated at the ceremony, but instead of blessing their union, he secretly slandered them as \u201cswine\u201d and \u201cinfidel pigs\u201d in Dhivehi.Then last year, the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point issued a report warning that extremist violence in the Maldives was increasing, especially against the country\u2019s intellectuals. \u201cDespite its reputation as an idyllic paradise popular among Western tourists, political and religious developments in the Maldives should be closely monitored,\u201d the report advised.It\u2019s important to mention that never once during our trip did Cheyne or I feel awkward or unsafe. Far from it: We swam on our own on empty beaches; there were carefree walks alone beneath the palm fronds. The things that I had read about were not unsettling in any immediate way, but rather offered glimpses of what was taking place, apparently unseen, in portions of the country not designed for tourists.Still, by the end of the visit, I felt I needed to explore what the Maldives had to offer beyond the pampered bubble of resorts, and so one afternoon I arranged a trip to the undeveloped island of Guraidhoo. Guraidhoo, with its unpaved streets and leashless dogs, is home to about 2,000 ordinary Maldivians \u2014 most of whom, it seemed, were on the beach in hammocks on the day that I arrived. My guide, Imran Janeen, was pleased to show me Guraidhoo\u2019s hospital and its dilapidated shipbuilding yard where 20 shirtless men were toiling on a huge wooden yacht that had, I was told, been under construction for the last two years. I asked Imran about religion in Guraidhoo \u2014 if Islam was strictly practiced. He told me that there were three mosques on the island, which is only 40 acres. Then again, he said, there were also seven guesthouses, eight or nine restaurants (depending on the season) and \u2014 astonishingly \u2014 50 souvenir shops.After I was led into what seemed like a dozen of these shops, Imran and I stopped into the Peach Tree, a side-street restaurant serving Indian cuisine. It was early afternoon: Crickets were chirping, a salty breeze was blowing through the windows from the street. We had just closed our menus when the music that I\u2019d first heard in Mal\u00e9 suddenly began \u2014 this time, unsurprisingly. \u201cYes,\u201d Imran smiled, almost sheepishly. \u201cThe muezzin.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t long after that a waiter came by to take our order and, with a furtive glance at the bar, offered me a drink. I followed his eyes across the room and there, among the bottles of tea and orange soda, was a row of Kingfisher beers.I didn\u2019t get one in the end, and Imran, who could not partake, seemed pleased.\u201cWe are Muslim here,\u201d he told me, as we popped our bottles of soda. \u201cBut not 100 percent.\u201dA caption with a photo of people snorkeling in the cover article on Aug. 31 about the Maldives, where luxury resorts coexist with a sometimes strict Islamic culture, misspelled in one instance the name of the island where a Holiday Inn is situated. It is Kandooma Fushi island, as mentioned elsewhere, not Kanduma Fushi.ALAN FEUER is a reporter for The New York Times. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Medicare Miracle", "Date": "2014-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySo, what do you think about those Medicare numbers? What, you haven\u2019t heard about them? Well, they haven\u2019t been front-page news. But something remarkable has been happening on the health-spending front, and it should (but probably won\u2019t) transform a lot of our political debate.The story so far: We\u2019ve all seen projections of giant federal deficits over the next few decades, and there\u2019s a whole industry devoted to issuing dire warnings about the budget and demanding cuts in Socialsecuritymedicareandmedicaid. Policy wonks have long known, however, that there\u2019s no such program, and that health care, rather than retirement, was driving those scary projections. Why? Because, historically, health spending has grown much faster than G.D.P., and it was assumed that this trend would continue.This is a really big deal, in at least three ways.First, our supposed fiscal crisis has been postponed, perhaps indefinitely. The federal government is still running deficits, but they\u2019re way down. True, the red ink is still likely to swell again in a few years, if only because more baby boomers will retire and start collecting benefits; but, these days, projections of federal debt as a percentage of G.D.P. show it creeping up rather than soaring. We\u2019ll probably have to raise more revenue eventually, but the long-term fiscal gap now looks much more manageable than the deficit scolds would have you believe.But what accounts for this good news? The third big implication of the Medicare cost miracle is that everything the usual suspects have been saying about fiscal responsibility is wrong.While we\u2019re on the subject of health costs, there are two other stories you should know about.What\u2019s the moral here? For years, pundits and politicians have insisted that guaranteed health care is an impossible dream, even though every other advanced country has it. Covering the uninsured was supposed to be unaffordable; Medicare as we know it was supposed to be unsustainable. But it turns out that incremental steps to improve incentives and reduce costs can achieve a lot, and covering the uninsured isn\u2019t hard at all. When it comes to ensuring that Americans have access to health care, the message of the data is simple: Yes, we can. Advertisement"}

But adjusted earnings were 11 cents a share, 7 cents higher than analysts estimated.The planned factory will produce batteries for Tesla\u2019s all-electric vehicles, as well as modules for the stationary storage market, according to a news release from Tesla. The company said it estimated that the plant and its associated supplier complex, which it is calling the Gigafactory, would employ 6,500 people by 2020. The company has not yet said where it will be located and is negotiating with several states.J. B.

Panasonic will manufacture and supply the lithium-ion cells needed for the batteries and invest in machinery and tools.The goal, Tesla said, is to reduce costs required to make battery packs for vehicles, which will enable the company \u201cto meet its goal of advancing mass market electric vehicles.\u201d Currently, the large batteries required to power electric cars are a main reason such cars are much more expensive than conventional gas-powered vehicles.Tesla said those cost reductions would be \u201cdriven by economies of scale previously unobtainable in battery cell and pack production.\u201dYoshihiko Yamada, Panasonic\u2019s executive vice president, said in a statement on Thursday that once the factory was up and running, the company believed it would be able to \u201caccelerate the expansion of the electric vehicle market.\u201dSo far, the market for electric vehicles has struggled to break through from niche territory. Tesla itself sold only about 1,500 vehicles in June and 9,100 in the first half, according to Autodata. That was up a bit compared with the previous year.The Nissan Leaf saw fairly impressive growth in the first half of the year, with sales up 29 percent compared with 2013 \u2014 though the total number of Leaf sales, 12,736, remained small.Sales of the Chevrolet Volt, General Motors\u2019 marquee plug-in electric vehicle, have dropped since last year.

{"Headline": "Affordable Housing Draws Middle Class to Inland Cities", "Date": "2014-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOKLAHOMA CITY \u2014 Americans have never hesitated to pack up the U-Haul in search of the big time, a better job or just warmer weather. But these days, domestic migrants are increasingly driven by the quest for cheaper housing.The country\u2019s fastest-growing cities are now those where housing is more affordable than average, a decisive reversal from the early years of the millennium, when easy credit allowed cities to grow without regard to housing cost and when the fastest-growing cities had housing that was less affordable than the national average. Among people who have moved long distances, the number of those who cite housing as their primary motivation for doing so has more than doubled since 2007.Rising rents and the difficulty of securing a mortgage on the coasts have proved a boon to inland cities that offer the middle class a firmer footing and an easier life. In the eternal competition among urban centers, the shift has produced some new winners.Oklahoma City, for example, has outpaced most other cities in growth since 2011, becoming the 12th-fastest-growing city last year. It has also won over a coveted demographic, young adults age 25 to 34, going from a net loss of millennials to a net gain. Other affordable cities that have jumped in the growth rankings include several in Texas, including El Paso and San Antonio, as well as Columbus, Ohio, and Little Rock, Ark.Newcomers in Oklahoma City have traded traffic jams and preschool waiting lists for master suites the size of their old apartments. The sons of Lorin Olson, a stem cell biologist who moved here from New York\u2019s Upper East Side, now ride bikes in their suburban neighborhood and go home to a four-bedroom house. Hector Lopez, a caricature artist, lives in a loft apartment here for less than he paid to stay in a garage near Los Angeles. Tony Trammell, one of a group of about a dozen friends to make the move from San Diego, paid $260,000 for his 3,300-square-foot home in a nearby suburb.\u201cThis is the opposite of the gold rush,\u201d Mr. Trammell said.But of those who moved more than 500 miles, the share who said they were chiefly motivated by housing has risen to 18 percent in 2014, from 8 percent in 2007, the earliest year such data is available, according to the Census Bureau. The desire for a new, better or cheaper home and the opportunity to buy instead of rent were among the housing-related reasons people cited.Before the real estate market crashed, housing in four of the five fastest-growing metropolitan areas, including Cape Coral, Fla., and Riverside, Calif., was less affordable than in the average American city, judging by the relationship between the median home price and income for each metropolitan area. But from 2008 to 2012, all five of the cities with the most growth were more affordable than average, including Raleigh-Durham, N.C., and the cities of El Paso, San Antonio, Austin and McAllen in Texas.\u201cA large percentage of Americans had to read \u2018The Grapes of Wrath,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Mayor Mick Cornett of Oklahoma City, referring to the John Steinbeck novel that chronicled the flight of Oklahomans to California in search of a better life during the Depression. Now the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of those migrants are returning for the same reason. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018The Wrath of Grapes,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said.The mayor cited clean air, a lack of traffic gridlock and, of course, affordable housing as factors in the city\u2019s growth. But like other midsize cities, this one has labored to give people additional reasons to move here, notably acquiring a professional basketball team, the Thunder. Along the river, a series of modern glass boathouses has risen like wind-filled sails, transforming the city into a national center for rowing sports. All 73 inner-city schools are being rebuilt or refurbished.Downtown, there is enough streetscaping going on to render a GPS unit useless. And near the city\u2019s historic neighborhoods, chockablock with houses in Arts and Crafts or storybook style, rejuvenated commercial areas like the Plaza District offer residents locally made goods and trendy \u201cbeer cocktails.\u201d\u201cEverything is here; everything is coming here,\u201d said Aasim Saleh, 30, who moved from Seattle to coach kayaking in the Boathouse District, where construction of a new white-water center is planned for this fall. \u201cIf Oklahoma City doesn\u2019t have it, they\u2019ll build it.\u201dMr. Saleh moved because he had a rare opportunity to make about $60,000 a year while avoiding a desk job. The low cost of living was a major sweetener, he said, enabling him to become something he thought would not be possible: a homeowner. \u201cI would say that, 100 percent, I had given up on the idea of homeownership in Seattle,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich is a really big deal.\u201dSome of the newcomers say that as they contemplated living with roommates, sitting in traffic and barely scraping by, the good things about life in a high-cost city lost their appeal. \u201cThe beach isn\u2019t going to pay my rent,\u201d said Jacqueline Sit, 32, who left Portland, Ore., where she worked as a television reporter, to come to Oklahoma City, where she quickly found a job in public relations.Mr. Olson, 42, who was recruited by the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation after finishing his postdoctoral work, said his family had not shed tears over leaving New York. \u201cThere\u2019s a little less to do, yeah,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now we can afford to do it.\u201dGlenn Kelman, the chief executive of Redfin, said that when the company started its real estate service in 2006, he expected the business to thrive in coastal centers. \u201cNow we\u2019re growing fastest in the middle of the country; we can\u2019t hire people fast enough in Houston, in Dallas, in Denver. And all of our customers come from the same place \u2014 the airport,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe the middle class hasn\u2019t disappeared; maybe it\u2019s just gone somewhere else.\u201dFor decades, Americans have flocked to the Sun Belt in search of a better life, first abandoning failing industrial centers like Detroit and Pittsburgh and then increasingly expensive superstar cities like New York and San Francisco, which have been replenished by immigrants.But during the housing bubble, when even people with modest salaries could get loans to buy staggeringly expensive homes, the cost of housing was less of a concern. Now that getting a mortgage has become harder, the wage stagnation that has hobbled the middle class for years has deeper consequences. \u201cPeople have no choice,\u201d Mr. Kelman said. \u201cThey can\u2019t move across the street; they have to move across the country.\u201dDuring the bubble, people coming from the most expensive places viewed even moderately expensive housing in places like Phoenix as a bargain, especially if they expected the value of such housing to rise, says Edward Glaeser, a Harvard economist who studies cities.But, Mr. Glaeser says, there is also a historical trend driven by severe restrictions on building new housing in highly regulated cities like San Francisco, Washington and New York. Whereas high housing prices were once a sign of growth because they indicated strong demand, now they are more a function of limited supply. Midlevel prices (as opposed to rock-bottom values in places like Detroit) have become a better predictor of growth.Of course, some of the fastest-growing cities, like Austin, may become victims of their own success as new people crowd in. Bill Curtis, an affluent petroleum geologist, has lived there since 1976, when it was known for little more than legislative wheeling and dealing and college football. On a recent day, he was unhappily contemplating traffic from his high-rise apartment. \u201cThey\u2019ve screwed this town up so royally, it\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d he said.But Mr. Curtis has a solution. He\u2019s moving to Oklahoma City.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ferguson Images Evoke Civil Rights Era and Changing Visual Perceptions", "Date": "2014-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDanny Lyon, one of the photographers whose work came to define the civil rights upheaval in the South in the 1960s, said he was struck on Thursday when he saw a news image from the racially torn suburb of Ferguson, Mo., showing four police officers arrayed in a phalanx.In part, it was because Mr. Lyon had taken a picture in 1963 in Birmingham, Ala., that looked very much like it: four officers standing in front of a police car with rifles and helmets, in a city where highly publicized clashes between protesters and the police helped turn the tide of public opinion toward the civil rights movement. But the image from Ferguson, for all its formal similarities, could not have been more different. Today\u2019s riot police officers were wearing military-style camouflage and carrying military-style rifles, their heads and faces obscured by black helmets and gas masks as they stood in front of an armored vehicle.\u201cIt didn\u2019t look like America. It looked like Soweto,\u201d Mr. Lyon said, referring to the South African township that was a hotbed of protests against apartheid. \u201cIt looked like soldiers. And soldiers\u2019 job isn\u2019t to protect. Their job is to kill people and to be ready to die.\u201dThe photographs that have emerged during several days of unrest in Ferguson after the fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager by a police officer have drawn mournful comparisons to pictures of the Deep South in the 1960s or of more recent racial unrest, like the 1992 Los Angeles riots. But they have also prompted a flood of commentary about the differences half a century has made in the visual economy. They have raised questions about whether photos have the same power now to sway public opinion and political will; about the increasingly sophisticated ways an image-saturated public reads a picture\u2019s racial and political subtext; and about the rapid transformation of the protests, even more so than the Los Angeles riots or the Occupy movement, into a war of images. The war pits what appears to be a large-scale paramilitary police presence against crowds of African-American protesters walking with their hands raised in surrender \u2014 or people throwing things and looting.An assistant city editor wrote on Twitter to those objecting to the first picture that they would be able to understand the whole story, in a \u201csympathetic treatment,\u201d if they opened the paper. But a reader responded, \u201cYes, in ten-point font I can see the fine print, which is completely overwhelmed by the picture.\u201d Such images look \u201cmore like Watts in 1965 or Newark in 1967, not Birmingham in 1963 or Selma in 1965,\u201d Dr. Garrow said. And historically, he said, such photos were \u201cdeadly when it came to white public opinion.\u201d In Ferguson, the police seem to be just as worried about the dominance of certain imagery. The city\u2019s police chief, Thomas Jackson, said during a news conference Thursday that officials were meeting \u201cto talk about not only the tactics but the appearance\u201d of the police force, whose resemblance to American soldiers in Iraq or Afghanistan has quickly become a social media theme. \u201cIn one case, it\u2019s a kind of mass witness of personhood,\u201d Ms. McWhorter said of the \u201cI Am a Man\u201d signs, \u201cand in the other case, a mass witness of innocence. Those images are very powerful.\u201d\u201cWe can look at these pictures and say that Ferguson is the same as Los Angeles or Birmingham, because it looks the same,\u201d Dr. Berger said. \u201cBut we have to ask not just, \u2018What is the same?\u2019 but also, \u2018What are the ways in which America has changed?\u2019 To just have another conversation that stops at the level of police brutality doesn\u2019t really get us very far.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Reducing Carbon by Curbing Population", "Date": "2014-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneRemember the population explosion?When population was growing at its fastest rate in human history in the decades after World War II, the sense that overpopulation was stunting economic development and stoking political instability took hold from New Delhi to the United Nations\u2019 headquarters in New York, sending policy makers on an urgent quest to stop it.In the 1970s the Indian government forcibly sterilized millions of women. Families in Bangladesh, Indonesia and elsewhere were forced to have fewer children. In 1974, the United Nations organized its first World Population Conference to debate population control. China rolled out its one-child policy in 1980.Then, almost as suddenly as it had begun, the demographic \u201ccrisis\u201d was over. As fertility rates in most of the world dropped to around the replacement rate of 2.1 children per woman \u2014 with the one major exception of sub-Saharan Africa \u2014 population specialists and politicians turned to other issues.By 1994, when the U.N. held its last population conference, in Cairo, demographic targets had pretty much been abandoned, replaced by an agenda centered on empowering women, reducing infant mortality and increasing access to reproductive health.\u201cSome people still regret that; some applaud it,\u201d said Joel E. Cohen, who heads the Laboratory of Populations at Rockefeller University in New York. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we need demographic goals but we need forward thinking.\u201dWell, concerns about population seem to be creeping back. As the threat of climate change has evolved from a fuzzy faraway concept to one of the central existential threats to humanity, scholars like Professor Cohen have noted that reducing the burning of fossil fuels might be easier if there were fewer of us consuming them.\u201cPopulation wouldn\u2019t be the whole story but it could make a big difference,\u201d Mr. Cohen said.This alone would deliver 16 to 29 percent of the emission reductions needed over the next four decades to keep the global temperature from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above that of the late 19th century, the threshold scientists predict could lead to severe disruptions to the climate.Slower population growth could bring other benefits. The World Resources Institute has been looking into how the world will feed itself in 2050 without busting the carbon budget.On current demographic and economic projections, food production would have to increase 70 percent by 2050. \u201cPopulation growth is responsible for about one-half of increased food consumption,\u201d said Tim Searchinger of the World Resources Institute. \u201cThe other half comes from higher incomes and richer diets.\u201dMuch of the expected population growth is set in stone, but sub-Saharan Africa, expected to add 1.2 billion people by 2050 on top of its current 900 million, is an exception.For all the benefits of slower population growth, population policies remain a highly touchy subject.In the 1970s and 1980s, rich nations\u2019 support for population control in poor countries smacked of just another form of colonialism. Coercive population control \u2014 like India\u2019s forced sterilizations, which were abandoned after they led to the collapse of Indira Gandhi\u2019s government in 1977, or China\u2019s one-child policy, which remains in place \u2014 is now widely considered a blatant violation of human rights.Population growth is only one factor \u2014 and not necessarily the most important one \u2014 contributing to global climate change. Over the course of the 20th century, emissions of carbon dioxide grew 180 percent faster than the population in poor countries and 60 percent faster than the population in rich ones. Shifting the world economy into more sustainable energy sources and away from fossil fuels is still the most promising strategy.\u201cThere is a strong case to be made that the world faces sustainability issues whether it has nine billion people, seven billion people or four billion people,\u201d said John Wilmoth, who directs the United Nations Population Division. \u201cNobody can deny that population growth is a major driving factor, but in terms of the policy response, what are you going to do?\u201dYet there are ways to make a difference on the population front that do not depend on coercive governments straying into people\u2019s bedrooms.Access to education is critical. Across human history, fertility rates have fallen when it has made economic sense for families to have fewer children. Education \u2014 especially of girls \u2014 has played a powerful role in expediting the decline.Across much of the developing world, more educated women have fewer children, and their offspring are more likely to survive. The spread of public education was accompanied by plummeting fertility rates in such disparate places as Brazil and Iran.These are hardly new ideas. The U.N. population conference in Cairo 20 years ago suggested pretty much this approach.By contrast, 95 percent of Guatemalan girls are enrolled in elementary school, as are 97 percent of Cambodian girls. In Bangladesh and Bolivia, among the poorest countries outside Africa, only about 40 of every 1,000 children die before they reach 5 years old.During the General Assembly next month, the United Nations plans to hold a meeting to mark the anniversary of the Cairo conference. And it is organizing another to discuss new commitments to mitigate climate change. Perhaps delegates will notice the connection.Email: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "St. Petersburg to Moscow, and Back", "Date": "2014-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 When the Kremlin announced a ban this month on food imports from the United States and the European Union, Russian social networks exploded with jokes about the empty store shelves in the Soviet Union. But the shelves won\u2019t be empty; they\u2019ll simply be stocked with mostly basic and bland items, a reflection of government policies that are pulling the country back to the past and highlighting its inner tensions.Western sanctions and Russian countersanctions have laid bare the interdependent connections between President Vladimir Putin, his oligarch courtiers and his supporters among the broader population. He will use his control over oligarch wealth to alleviate the difficulties sanctions will bring to his followers, while his critics and those Russians who are not part of his base will likely face tough times.If the economic standoff is protracted, the country\u2019s power structure will gradually revert to the rigid social order and top-down redistribution system that characterized both Soviet Russia and the old Russia prior to the reign of Peter the Great. For centuries the Muscovite court ruled by patronage. The grand prince, or later, the czar, would give his boyars regular handouts of food and clothes. His ministers were entitled to food and services from the people, and were allowed a share of the court fees and taxes that they were responsible to collect.During the St. Petersburg period (from the reign of Peter the Great, who founded the northern capital in 1703, to Nicholas II, who abdicated in 1917), Russia gradually rid itself of those archaic practices, developing a modern state, private property, independent courts, and even popular representation.The Bolsheviks, who in 1918 decided to move the capital back to Moscow, also took a step back toward the Muscovite state of the 16th and 17th centuries. Most of Russia\u2019s modern institutions, including markets and private property, were abolished, and Soviet leaders found themselves in a situation where they had to feed and rule, just like the czars. In strict hierarchical fashion, Communist Party bosses, celebrated actors, prominent artists, engineers and scientists would get their food in special distribution centers. Top officials lived in palazzos while the rank and file had to wait for years to get access to cramped spaces in prefabricated apartment blocs.Most of this Soviet-era redistribution system collapsed in the early 1990s. No one needed food rationing or coupons for home appliances anymore \u2014 markets could take care of that. But some resources are always scarce \u2014 especially political power and access to the profits from oil and gas exports. The Kremlin has reconsolidated its hold on these important sectors, as well as some others, including the media, academia and the arts. Every Kremlin courtier now operates under an unseen license, one that allows its holder to live off the assets under his or her control, on condition of loyalty to the regime and paid-on-demand contributions to government projects. No one can really own a large company, especially one that deals in oil and gas: Every \u201cowner\u201d is no more than the titular holder of a license that may expire at any moment.But these practices do not cover the entire economic landscape \u2014 just the most lucrative areas. That\u2019s why independence from the Kremlin has been possible. The main achievement of the post-Soviet period has been the emergence of professional groups and individuals who don\u2019t need to line up at the Kremlin dinner table. They have been learning to build, produce, sell, write and do other things that allow them to support themselves. Owning the results of one\u2019s labor has generally been accepted in today\u2019s Russia. But to Mr. Putin, such independent people are the contemporary version of that Russian cultural icon, the \u201csuperfluous man.\u201d Yet it is these \u201csuperfluous\u201d people who are Russia\u2019s best hope.They are an amorphous, hard-to-define bunch, often in disagreement with one another. They have no one to protect them, hence their intrinsic support for a rule-based state that protects civil and property rights.Western sanctions have managed to scare off investors and bring the economy to a standstill. The ban on food imports is already starting to drive up prices. Tax hikes proposed by the Kremlin to balance the budget will push economic activity into the shadows. All the Kremlin talk about creating opportunities for local agricultural production and food-processing is empty rhetoric; no one is going to start long-term projects amid such deep uncertainty.The Kremlin servitors, the main target of the Western sanctions, are the least vulnerable to external shocks exactly because of their proximity to the sources of Moscow\u2019s wealth. The most vulnerable are those who have never been invited to dine at the Kremlin table.In the face of Western sanctions, hobbled as the ruble loses value against the dollar and the euro, Mr. Putin can only respond by taking aim at that part of society he considers the least valuable: modernized urban dwellers, the \u201csuperfluous\u201d people. There is going to be less freedom, less trade, less independence, and more regulation, more redistribution and more feeding off the institutions of the state.No one knows how long the sanctions will last, but even if the oligarchs eventually persuade Mr. Putin to stop his disruptive policies, the modernized part of the population will be hit very hard. If they are unable to overcome the difficulties imposed from above, the country will sink even further into the mire of economic and political antiquity.But Russia has a long history of sustaining a culture of intellectual freedom under oppressive governments. It\u2019s in the genes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Scots Weigh Independence, Wales Takes Note", "Date": "2014-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAERNARFON, Wales \u2014 Twm Morys was boiling carrots for his children when he momentarily stopped to recite a 15th-century battle chant in Welsh. Beating out the guttural consonants with a stave on his kitchen floor until they rang in every last corner of his farmhouse, Mr. Morys, a well-known poet, said it was time to put \u201cfire in the belly\u201d of his people.He is not the only one. In the ancient mountains towering above this coastal town in northern Wales, where eight in 10 people speak the native Celtic tongue, and many carry names their fellow Britons would not dare pronounce, Welsh nationalists have their eyes firmly set on independence \u2014 Scottish independence.Less than a month before Scotland holds a referendum on whether to leave Britain, Wales is watching with a mix of envy, excitement and trepidation.Tremors from the Scottish debate can already be felt across Britain. Whatever happens on Sept. 18, growing demands for more regional autonomy will reshape the country. In Northern Ireland, nationalists spy an opportunity to revive dreams of a united Ireland. Cornwall recently won minority status for its Celtic inhabitants. Even the long-neglected north of England has turned up the volume, questioning an ever greater concentration of wealth in London and the southeast.But in Wales, perhaps more than anywhere else, nationalists have made the Scottish independence bid their own in the hope that it will stir passions at home \u2014 if not for full independence, at least for more self-government.Others, like Mr. Morys, will gather in the Welsh capital, Cardiff, the week before the referendum for a series of performances to \u201cwhip up some Welsh enthusiasm,\u201d stave in hand.Wales and Scotland have much in common \u2014 not least an unfailing loyalty to any sporting side that plays against England, their once mighty and still dominant neighbor.Ever since Margaret Thatcher, the conservative prime minister, shut their heavy industries, Scottish and Welsh voters have cast their ballot to the left of the English. There is, said Peter Florence, director of Wales\u2019s Hay literary festival, a shared sense of not being represented in Westminster.But Wales is smaller and poorer than Scotland. It has no oil to make up for the subsidies from London currently sustaining its public services. \u201cWe\u2019re a hundred years too late,\u201d Mr. Florence lamented, referring to the Welsh coal riches that once fired Britain\u2019s industrial revolution. If he were Scottish, he would vote for independence, he said. \u201cBut we simply cannot afford it.\u201dGerald Holtham, one of Wales\u2019s most prominent economists, has done the math: Total government spending for Wales is 30 billion pounds a year, or about $50 billion, and tax receipts come to 17 billion pounds. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a gap a quarter the size of the economy,\u201d he said.Nationalists retort that Wales can escape poverty only if it takes charge of its own destiny. \u201cNo nation has ever ruled another well,\u201d said Mr. Price, a former lawmaker who set up a technology company in Wales. \u201cWe are poor because we are not independent, rather than the other way round.\u201dBut even he conceded that the time for Welsh independence has not come. First, he said, \u201cWe have to learn to be a nation again.\u201dUnlike Scotland, whose Parliament voted to join England three centuries ago, Wales was conquered in 1282. The Scots kept their own legal system, schools, universities, church and, with it all, a strong civic identity distinct from England\u2019s. Welsh institutions were swallowed whole; the Welsh dragon, which flutters proudly and ubiquitously on the high street in Caernarfon, is nowhere to be seen in the Union Jack.\u201cWe were England\u2019s first colony,\u201d said Eirian James, owner of Palas Print, a local bookstore with mainly Welsh-language fare. Every time she visits relatives in southern Wales, she has to take a train through England. To this day, most transport links run from west to east, toward England, rather than along Wales\u2019s north-south axis.The Welsh tourism board proudly promotes the fact that there are more castles per square mile in Wales than anywhere else. For locals, those castles are another reminder of early occupation.As Jerry Hunter, a professor at Bangor University, said, \u201cWhere else have you got thousands of people crowding into a pavilion watching the results of a poetry contest?\u201dWhen the Welsh-speaking village Capel Celyn was flooded in 1965 to create a water reservoir for Liverpool, England, despite unanimous opposition from Welsh lawmakers, it spawned songs and graffiti art and gave Plaid Cymru its first significant boost.Stemming the decline in the Welsh language \u2014 just under one in five Welsh people speaks Cymraeg \u2014 is the greatest triumph of Welsh nationalism, but it is also a handicap: It has divided a country of three million between those, mainly in the rural north and west, who speak it, and those in the more urban south and east who don\u2019t, reducing Plaid Cymru in the eyes of many to a mere language-lobbying group.Many still grumble about a Welsh-speaking cabal \u2014 the Taffia, after the Welsh River Taff \u2014 holding the best jobs, the most influence and a greater claim to Welshness. But hostility toward the language has been fading, and the Welsh appetite for more self-government has grown \u2014 with a little help from Scotland.In a 1979 referendum, eight in 10 Welsh voters opposed any kind of autonomy from London. But in 1997, after Scotland voted to have its own Parliament, the tiniest majority of Welsh voters followed suit and approved the creation of a more modest Welsh assembly. By 2011, two in three of those voters wanted to extend the assembly\u2019s lawmaking powers.\u201cThat\u2019s a bigger swing in public opinion over 30 years than in Scotland,\u201d said Richard Wyn Jones of Cardiff University.Some bank on a Scottish yes vote to accelerate that process. Others say a narrow no vote would be a better result for the Welsh: Once mocked in Whitehall circles as Scotland\u2019s \u201csmaller, uglier sister,\u201d Wales may have more leverage with a Scottish ally inside the union.But Mr. Jones says Wales will end up more autonomous irrespective of what happens in Scotland.\u201cIndependence may look unlikely right now,\u201d he said. \u201cBut who in 1979 would have dared imagine a devolved Wales looking on as Scotland prepares an independence referendum?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "An Experiment With Socialism Finally Ends", "Date": "2014-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From IndiaNEW DELHI \u2014 The Planning Commission of India is like those old men who are no longer harmful but are reviled because they once were. In their glory years, their ideas and deeds, couched in exalted convictions, destroyed lives.The commission, in its final days now, was officially a think tank embedded in the government with the honorable mandate to reimagine India\u2019s economic future. But culturally it was a lesson six decades in the telling that there is much to fear in the idealism of the elite. Created in 1950, it was once the heartbeat of India\u2019s planned economy, when a small cabal in Delhi allocated funds, decided what factories should produce and how much, and what sort of industries \u2014 in fact, what sort of anything \u2014 was good for the nation. Its powers have diminished over the years, and its relevance has been questioned.On Friday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in his Independence Day address: \u201cSometimes it costs more to repair an old house, but it gives us no satisfaction. We have a feeling that it would be better to construct a new house altogether. Therefore, within a short period, we will replace the Planning Commission with a new institution.\u201dMr. Modi displayed a degree of respect for the commission, but economic analysts rejoiced, saying that an ancient beast created during India\u2019s experiment with socialism had finally been slain. Amusing then that the seeds of the commission were sown by some of India\u2019s leading capitalists.In 1944, eight men, including the heroes of Indian industry of the time, J.R.D. Tata and G.D. Birla, wrote a 15-year vision for the Indian economy to be circulated among their influential acquaintances. It soon came to be known as \u201cThe Bombay Plan.\u201d The authors wanted per capita income to double in 15 years, and every Indian to enjoy a minimum standard of living \u2014 for instance, to have access to 30 yards of cloth in a year and at least 100 square feet of space to call home.As incredible as it might appear now, they wanted government to exercise tight oversight over industry. \u201cPractically every aspect of economic life will have to be so rigorously controlled by government that individual liberty and freedom of enterprise will suffer a temporary eclipse,\u201d they declared.It is widely believed among academics that this document was among the major forces that influenced newly independent India to create the Planning Commission, which would in time become the most hated institution among the business community.The commission is commonly referred to as a \u201cSoviet-style\u201d behemoth. The comparison annoys the economist Amartya Sen.In \u201cAn Uncertain Glory,\u201d he and the economist Jean Dr\u00e8ze write: \u201cOne thing that Communist countries \u2014 from the U.S.S.R. and pre-reform China to Vietnam or Cuba \u2014 were committed to achieving, despite all the political indoctrination and dogmatism, was to ensure free and universal school education without delay.\u201dIndia\u2019s central planning, at least in its early years, showed a disregard for the primary education of the poor, which would in time assume the proportions of a criminal neglect.\u201cIn fact, the first Five-Year Plan, initiated in 1951 \u2014 even though sympathetic to the need for university education, which it strongly supported \u2014 argued against regular schooling at the elementary level, favoring instead a so-called \u2018basic education\u2019 system, built on the hugely romantic and rather eccentric idea that children should learn through self-financing handicraft,\u201d the authors note. That idea was inspired by Mohandas K. Gandhi, who believed that making children literate before they learned how to make a bag \u201champers their intellectual growth.\u201dAn unsung triumph of India is how many of Gandhi\u2019s ideas it discarded on its way to progress. India survived its philosophers and, of course, the long decades of the commission, until deep economic reforms made it less harmful and, finally, a relic.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hope Dwindles for Hondurans Living in Peril", "Date": "2014-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFriends and relatives in the Chamelec\u00f3n district of San Pedro Sula, Honduras, mourned a loved one killed by thieves at the factory he was guarding. The decay of Chamelec\u00f3n mirrors the deterioration of Honduras as a whole over the past two decades.SAN PEDRO SULA, Honduras \u2014 The pastor came one afternoon to survey his church, or what was left of it: remnants of a \u201cwelcome\u201d sign and a strip of Christmas garland still tacked to the wall.The gang took the chairs. They took the light fixtures. They took the doors. They had given his family 24 hours to get out and so they did, abandoning their home and the small evangelical church he led.When he moved there 20 years ago, Mr. Rivas commanded respect, even among the gang members. The neighborhood, Chamelec\u00f3n, was not yet the most dangerous in one of the most dangerous cities in the hemisphere.He would fish the calm, cooling waters of the R\u00edo Chamelec\u00f3n, long before bullet-pocked bodies turned up along the shore and the sugar cane fields abutting it.His six children would kick soccer balls along Chamelec\u00f3n\u2019s dusty streets and dash to the neighborhood bodega for ice cream, long before stray bullets shot down a neighbor in front of the store across the street.He watched Chamelec\u00f3n decay, mirroring the deterioration of Honduras as a whole over the past two decades. Buffeted by a succession of natural and man-made disasters, it has become one of the poorest countries in the hemisphere and now a flash point for the child migrant crisis as many of its young people flee to the United States, sometimes alone, often in the company of family members or neighbors.A devastating hurricane in 1998 swelled the river and flooded many houses. Economic free fall followed. People could not find work and delinquents, always present in the working-class neighborhood, hardened and grew powerful, driving away even the police.The clothing factories nearby that sustained so many families shifted many jobs to neighboring Nicaragua. The government collapsed in a coup in 2009, and though order was eventually restored, the better days promised still seem a distant dream.The gangs moved from house to house demanding \u201crent\u201d or a \u201cwar tax,\u201d or the property itself. Night after night, families fled in terror to other parts of Honduras, to Mexico, to the United States, many of them part of the wave of child and family migrants overwhelming American detention centers in the Southwest.Left behind are rows of hollowed-out houses, stripped of furniture, windows, even bathroom fixtures.Still, the pastor hung on, because he believed in God and hope. Then gang members pointed a pistol at his 15-year-old son.\u201cLift up your shirt,\u201d they demanded, inspecting his body for rival tattoos.\u201cI could not speak,\u201d the boy recalled of the terror.And, finally, the gang came to the house. They wanted it. And the church.The pastor gave up on hope and the neighborhood.\u201cBut not God,\u201d he said. \u201cHe will find a way.\u201dIt has been nearly two years since he left.A Rise Amid DysfunctionThe Chamelec\u00f3n district is a warren of modest cement-block houses painted in now chipped and fading pastels.Two of Honduras\u2019s most powerful gangs, Mara Salvatrucha and Barrio 18, and their myriad factions battle for turf, with the borderlines of their territory the most lethal. The most spectacular crime occurred a decade ago, when 28 people on a bus passing through the neighborhood were killed by gang members upset at plans to restore the death penalty.But it is the everyday grind of murder and mayhem that gnaws most of all at people here.Oscar Ram\u00f3n, 20, who helps his father farm a patch of land along the river, said at least 20 bodies had been dumped in the river and cane fields in the past year. He lost count.\u201cI think here is not for me,\u201d he said in the broken English he learned at an orphanage school his father sent him to in the capital, to be safe.Many young people agree and have left, but many more have stayed, living locked in their homes and harboring dreams of escape.Although Honduras was spared the civil wars of its neighbors in the 1980s and 1990s, the regional instability set the stage for a surge of migration that rapidly accelerated after Hurricane Mitch devastated the country in 1998. The storm killed thousands of people in Honduras, left one million homeless and destroyed what was left of a declining Banana industry, once the country\u2019s lifeblood, as well as other vital crops.By 2000, the number of Honduran immigrants in the United States, mostly without proper visas, had doubled from a decade earlier, to 283,000, and it now stands around 500,000, according to a Migration Policy Institute report.They have come to prop up the economy back home, with the $3.2 billion sent back last year accounting for 20 percent of the economy, the highest proportion in Latin America.After the Cold War, Honduras strongly embraced capitalism, investing heavily in the manufacturing for export industry \u2014 commonly known as maquiladoras \u2014 and San Pedro Sula\u2019s industrial base boomed, stitching underwear, T-shirts, jeans and other low-cost products for consumption in the United States and other countries.It emerged as a city of stark inequality, with large malls seemingly teleported from Miami and gated communities climbing the hills for the doctors, lawyers and engineers catering to the moneyed class.But the 2009 coup, coupled with the worldwide recession, took a toll, and the economic shock wave was keenly felt in Chamelec\u00f3n, residents said.Family after family told of layoffs and shorter work hours. More and more, it seemed, one needed to know somebody to get and keep a job.In June, a job fair for 5,000 openings drew 23,000 people, forcing the police to respond to keep order.The economic distress and migration laid the ground for the emergence of powerful street gangs, and government dysfunction gave them staying power.They have roots in Los Angeles, among Salvadoran refugees who fled there during the civil war. After the war, gang members were deported and, taking advantage of weak institutions, re-emerged on their home turf with little to keep them in check.Honduras has long had close social ties with El Salvador, and, at least in the early wave of migration, many Hondurans established themselves in Salvadoran communities.Crime analysts say this is why the Honduran gangs bear such a close resemblance to the Salvadoran gangs, but in Honduras, with the political instability, deeper poverty and a history of willfully weak judicial and security forces, the gangs have exploded in power and readily acquire military-grade weaponry.To make matters even more volatile, drug trafficking organizations in recent years, facing increasing obstacles in the Caribbean, began moving more cocaine through Central America and forging alliances with the gangs as foot soldiers. Honduras became a major transshipment point for cocaine flown from South America, and the cartels, along with corrupt police officers, may be supplying the gangs with weapons and cheap cocaine as payment.The number of children crossing the U.S. border alone has doubled since last year. Answers to key questions on the crisis.The police remain so unable to take on the gangs and cartels that sometimes they do not even have gas in their aging vehicles to go on patrol.\u201cIt\u2019s like sending kindergartners up against an N.B.A. basketball team,\u201d said Steven S. Dudley, a director of InsightCrime.com, a website tracking and analyzing Latin American crime trends.Still, Col. Germ\u00e1n Alfaro, who leads a combined military-police force in the San Pedro Sula region, said Honduras had to turn to the military because it was the country\u2019s most trusted authority. Soldiers regularly patrol alongside police officers in a show of force that Chamelec\u00f3n residents said had brought mixed results. Several said a letup in the gang war, not the military, had calmed some streets for now.But Colonel Alfaro said that there had not been a gang-related shootout in more than a month and that slowly, the patrols were gaining the confidence of residents who wished to move back.\u201cThis was not a problem created overnight,\u201d he said, \u201cand it won\u2019t be resolved overnight.\u201d\u2018Everybody Is Nervous\u2019\u201cThere was a fever here; everybody thought they were going to get documents,\u201d said the woman, Marta Triminio Guerrero, 44. \u201cNow, we are all coming back, but to what?\u201dHer son, Roberto, pondered the question. He was nervous during the journey and frustrated when they were caught, but he understood his mother\u2019s motivation.Work is sporadic; she sells trinkets and tamales from the house when she can. Roberto is back in school, one run by a church-affiliated nonprofit called Caminando por la Paz \u2014 Walking for Peace \u2014 that is trying to keep young people like him from falling prey to gangs.To Roberto, his section of Chamelec\u00f3n has not been entirely pacified; gang members lurk, and he does his best to steer clear of them. A wall near his house is full of large bullet holes from high-powered rifles. He rarely goes outside, except to walk to and from school, so, like other children, he spends a lot of time inside watching soccer on television.It is a monotonous life but, for now, a safer one than venturing too far out and getting killed as a suspected \u201chalcon,\u201d or lookout for a rival gang.\u201cI would do it again, yes, because I could study up there, up north, and then work,\u201d he said, referring to his attempt to reach the United States. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty ugly here in the afternoon. You hear the shots and the fighting sometimes. Everybody is nervous until the daytime.\u201dHector Leiva, the coordinator of the school, lamented so many promising young people who were looking to leave the country, or who already have. Everybody is struggling, he said, to the point that his plan to extend the school day by two hours in the afternoon was rejected by parents demanding their children come home to work.\u201cHow do you argue against that?\u201d he asked.Fearing a Return HomeLate one afternoon, Pastor Rivas came to his small, abandoned church to inspect the damage. Almost all the furnishings were gone. The reality is, his family can no longer afford the rent on the house in another part of the city that a church friend helped them with, so they may be forced back. But it is just as well, he said: \u201cOur home is in that neighborhood,\u201d though he worries that he has little means to make repairs.Things in the neighborhood seemed to have settled down. Another neighbor that afternoon, too, was cleaning up her house with the idea to move back soon. But with a 12-year-old daughter, she fretted over taking the chance.\u201cI am going to see how things look in the next couple of weeks,\u201d said the woman, Ana, who was too afraid to give her full name. \u201cIf the soldiers have control, if the gang does not come around for rent, it may be time to come back.\u201dPastor Rivas said he would leave for the United States if there were a legal way to do it. But the long wait and cost for a visa makes that idea impractical, he said. And he does not have the $6,000 or more to pay a smuggler.But he fears a repeat of the worst in the neighborhood.\u201cWe always had to throw ourselves to the floor and pray one of the bullets doesn\u2019t get you,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were always locked in there. It wasn\u2019t a lot of fun.\u201dHe paused, searching for a way to make a stranger understand.\u201cYou go to birthday parties, right?\u201d he said. \u201cThere used to be birthday parties and house parties. Now, there aren\u2019t any because with so many people there, it gets the gang\u2019s attention, and sometimes they would kill people.\u201dThe afternoon dragged on. He watched the end of a soccer game and then walked out to another room, catching sight of his 7-year-old niece drawing in a notebook.She drew a house, a Halloween orange one. Droplets of bright colors encircled it. A long walkway cut through sproutings of a green lawn. A bespectacled, smiling sun gleamed in a corner of the sky.It was not the house she knew.\u201cIt\u2019s the one,\u201d the girl, Astrid, said, \u201cI wished we lived in.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Israel\u2019s South, Families Worry About the Future of Life Near Gaza", "Date": "2014-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKIBBUTZ NAHAL OZ, Israel \u2014 Towering concrete walls surround the kindergarten in this rural Israeli community next to the border with Gaza, blocking out the light. The fortresslike panels went up a few days ago as protection against deadly shrapnel from the Palestinian mortar rounds that have crashed down here in recent weeks with a terrifying intensity.But some parents of young children are questioning whether they want to continue living in Nahal Oz and in Israel\u2019s traumatized south, where the once-revered Zionist ideal of settling the border areas is crumbling.\u201cThis is a test for our community, but no less for our government,\u201d said Daniel Rahamim, the crop irrigation manager of Nahal Oz and a member of the community\u2019s emergency team. \u201cWill our leaders know how to help lift us up? The big test comes once quiet prevails.\u201d A wiry, soft-spoken man in work boots, Mr. Rahamim had shown reporters around the kibbutz earlier in the week, between mortar attacks. He was one of about 50 of the 350 residents \u2014 mostly older people and a few essential workers \u2014 who have remained here for most or all of the war.\u201cWhether we like it or not, the circumstances have imbued our lives with extra significance,\u201d Mr. Rahamim said. Describing Nahal Oz, founded in the early 1950s, soon after the establishment of the state of Israel, as the first line of defense, he said that living here was again about \u201cholding on to this place.\u201dIsrael\u2019s defense minister, Moshe Yaalon, spoke Wednesday in his first public remarks since the cease-fire about the hardships of bringing up children under fire in the area, saying, \u201cThis is a harsh reality to live in, and the difficult questions they now raise are correct and justified.\u201dThe death last Friday of Daniel Tregerman, 4, was a seminal moment for some residents. Daniel was killed here when a mortar sent shrapnel flying into the living room of his family\u2019s small stucco house. His family had ventured back during an earlier cease-fire that collapsed, after assurances from the military\u2019s top brass that it was safe to return. Two more Israeli civilians were killed on Tuesday when mortars crashed into a nearby community, Nirim, half an hour before the new cease-fire took effect.This latest Gaza conflict, the third in less than six years, was the longest and deadliest for both sides. Gaza suffered most of the casualties, with more than 2,100 Palestinians killed in Israeli strikes, while 64 Israeli soldiers and six civilians died.Local leaders criticized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for accepting a truce similar to one that ended eight days of fighting in 2012, which brought only 19 months of quiet. Critics said the countdown had already started toward the next round.Hamas sent longer-range rockets into Israel, almost as far north as Haifa, but in the south, where thousands of rockets paralyzed life and the local economy, residents bore the psychological brunt.Though the physical damage from rockets was minimized by Israel\u2019s Iron Dome antimissile defense system, there is no technological solution yet for the short-range mortars that took a much heavier toll on soldiers and civilians. Though relatively primitive weapons, the mortars now pose an existential threat to communities like Nahal Oz, closest to the border fence.From the kibbutz\u2019s cowshed there is a clear view of Shejaiya, the Gaza neighborhood where some of the fiercest fighting took place in July. Hamas militants emerged from a tunnel and killed five soldiers at a nearby army post. Leaflets dropped over Gaza by Israeli military aircraft warning Palestinian residents to evacuate areas where Hamas was operating landed inside the kibbutz.Adi Freibach, 42, a mother of five, has lived at Nahal Oz since she was a child. She and her family spent this week with 25 other families from Nahal Oz at Kibbutz Urim, safely out of mortar range. For the first time, she said, she was contemplating the possibility of moving away from Nahal Oz, but said her family had decided this was not the time to make decisions.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t only depend on our feeling,\u201d she said, \u201cbut on what happens around us. If others leave and the children\u2019s friends leave, we have nothing to stay for.\u201dMoran Freibach, 44, Ms. Freibach\u2019s husband, was born in Nahal Oz. He said that if the kibbutz were to collapse, it would be \u201cthe beginning of the end of the Zionist dream.\u201d He added, \u201cIf we cannot feel safe there, why should we feel safe anywhere in Israel?\u201dNahal Oz was etched in Israelis\u2019 memory after one of its members, Roy Rotenberg, was killed in a cross-border ambush in 1956. Moshe Dayan, then the army chief of staff, delivered a eulogy at his funeral that became one of his most acclaimed pieces of oratory.\u201cHave we forgotten that this group of young people dwelling at Nahal Oz is bearing the heavy gates of Gaza on its shoulders?\u201d he asked. \u201cLet us make our reckoning with ourselves today. We are a generation of settlement, and without the steel helmet and the gun\u2019s muzzle, we will not be able to plant a tree and build a house.\u201dWhen Yair Lapid, the finance minister, visited Nahal Oz on Monday, a day before the cease-fire, those who remained in the kibbutz gathered with him in the \u201cwar room,\u201d a fortified underground shelter. They asked Mr. Lapid for financial incentives to entice students to rent here; for help to cover special educational and social needs; for assurances that it is worth investing in a fortified roof for the dairy and that people would still want to buy the new houses that were built over the past year as part of a plan to encourage demographic growth. Mostly, they wanted to hear if Nahal Oz had a future.Mr. Lapid listened but had no immediate answers.Ilan Zamir, 29, who works in the dairy and the chicken coops, said that day: \u201cSomeone has to stay here. I don\u2019t want it to be a ghost kibbutz.\u201dHolding the tail of a mortar shell that crashed into a eucalyptus tree not far from his house, he added: \u201cIf rent is cheap, people will come. Between the wars, it is the most beautiful place in the world.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The agency also revised lower its estimate for first-quarter activity to a 0.2 percent contraction, meaning the economy entered a recession.\u201cThis is the last thing that the government would have wanted or needed,\u201d said Neil Shearing, an economist at Capital Economics in London.The data that confirmed the recession, Brazil\u2019s first since the global financial crisis of 2008-9, gives a powerful weapon to Ms. Rousseff\u2019s opponents in the Oct. 5 election. Polls over the last week have shown Ms. Rousseff falling behind the centrist candidate Marina Silva in the event of a second-round runoff, which appears likely.Ms. Silva and the other main opposition candidate, Senator A\u00e9cio Neves, have strongly criticized her for being weak on inflation and ruining the economic momentum that made Brazil a Wall Street darling last decade.\u201cToday is a sad day for Brazil,\u201d Mr. Neves told reporters. \u201cThe truth is that this government failed, and it failed principally in its steering of Brazil\u2019s economy.\u201d Brazil\u2019s economy grew an average 4 percent under Ms. Rousseff\u2019s predecessor, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, from 2003 to 2010. Growth under Ms. Rousseff is set to average less than 2 percent.Despite the government\u2019s recent drive to win back business confidence, investment slid 5.3 percent in the second quarter, the worst performance since early 2009. Manufacturing had its fourth straight quarterly decline, down 1.5 percent.Business activity also slowed as Brazil hosted the World Cup soccer tournament in June and July. Many cities declared public holidays on game days to prevent traffic problems and other logistical issues, and many factories wound down production.Ms. Rousseff and her economic team have blamed the slowdown on continued problems abroad, as in Southern Europe. \u201cEven really organized countries are having problems getting better growth,\u201d Guido Mantega, the finance minister, told reporters. Speaking to reporters on Friday, Ms. Rousseff promised that economic performance during the second half of the year would be \u201cbetter.\u201d Economists and business leaders, however, said Brazil\u2019s recent problems were mostly homegrown and were far deeper than any short-term considerations like the World Cup.They have repeatedly complained of what they describe as Ms. Rousseff\u2019s heavy-handed management of the economy \u2014 like alternately raising and lowering certain taxes. They said her policies had relied too much on stimulating domestic demand at the expense of investment.Other Latin American countries, like Chile or Colombia, have enjoyed much stronger growth in recent years. Economists said Brazil\u2019s next president would need to make big changes.\u201cWe need a new economic program,\u201d said Eduardo Velho, chief economist at INVX Global, an investment fund in S\u00e3o Paulo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will the Economy Save Cameron?", "Date": "2014-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 In Barry Levinson\u2019s wonderful 1997 movie \u201cWag the Dog,\u201d a shadowy political fixer played by Robert De Niro recruits a Hollywood producer (Dustin Hoffman) to stage a televisual \u201cpageant\u201d of war between the United States and Albania to distract attention from a presidential sex scandal. Mr. Hoffman\u2019s character is appalled that, for all his creative ingenuity in choreographing a fictitious conflict, the pundits still attribute the president\u2019s electoral success to a dull campaign slogan: \u201cDon\u2019t change horses in midstream\u201d \u2014 in other words, when the economy is solid, voters should stick with the incumbent.Unexciting as it may be, this deterministic view of electoral behavior remains more or less orthodox. Whether it deserves to be is another question, and one that preoccupies the British prime minister, David Cameron.For most of the past four years, the Conservative Party, which has governed, under his leadership, in coalition with the Liberal Democrats, has trailed Labour in opinion polls. Unpleasant as it has been for Mr. Cameron and his fellow Tories, this has been no real surprise: Their government presided over a program of painful public spending cuts intended to restore economic stability, reassure the markets and reduce the deficit. The recovery has taken much longer than Mr. Cameron and his chancellor, George Osborne, anticipated.Senior Tories privately called for Mr. Osborne to be sacked or moved to another post. But Mr. Cameron resisted this pressure and stuck by his closest ally, a stubbornness that now looks statesmanlike.The question is whether the economic recovery has come soon enough to deliver victory to the Conservatives in next May\u2019s general election \u2014 or at least a good enough result for them to form a second coalition government. Polls still indicate that the Labour Party is four or five points ahead, enough to carry its leader, Ed Miliband, into Downing Street. Mr. Cameron\u2019s hope is that, by polling day, a sufficient number of voters will have felt the return of national prosperity to keep him in the top job. The electorate may not be inspired by the incumbent prime minister, but why take a chance?The assumption lurking beneath this rhetorical question is a risky one. As the former Conservative prime minister Sir John Major put it, there is such a thing as a \u201cvoteless recovery.\u201d Britain\u2019s economy was strong in 1997, but it did not save him from defeat by Tony Blair in a landslide.Equally, high unemployment did not prevent Margaret Thatcher from winning by a handsome margin in 1983. What counted was Labour\u2019s perceived economic incompetence and the public\u2019s conviction that Mrs. Thatcher\u2019s trajectory was the right one. Professor Bale (a colleague at Queen Mary, University of London, where I am a visiting fellow) is right to insist that the relationship between economic and political success is \u201cfar more complicated than many of us imagine.\u201dThis time, the nuances are the social and political consequences of the crash itself. The worst possible response to last week\u2019s figures would be for the Tories to declare a return to \u201cbusiness as usual.\u201d The recklessness of the financial sector and the global failure of the political class to install robust regulation have not been forgotten, or forgiven.Trust in the political process has declined vertiginously. Capitalism remains the only viable system of economic organization, but it has squandered its status as a secular religion. Those who govern us cannot expect an electoral pat on the head for headline growth figures.In 2014, the public wants to know that the new prosperity is a genuinely nationwide phenomenon, a recovery for the many, not the few. This is not a call for rampant collectivism or absolute egalitarianism. But the crash has put a higher premium on decency, solidarity and the capacity of capitalism to spread wealth and protect the vulnerable.Mr. Cameron and Mr. Osborne are well aware of this challenge. Even before Mr. Cameron became the Conservative leader, he conceded that \u201ceconomic liberalism is not enough.\u201d In a speech to the American Enterprise Institute in April, Mr. Osborne acknowledged that \u201cthe very legitimacy of our free-market system depends on the promise that effort is rewarded and prosperity is shared.\u201dThe question is whether the British electorate will hear this, and believe it. The government\u2019s direction is clear, its essential competence established. So why \u201cchange horses in midstream\u201d?To do so would indeed be a risk, but asserting as much is not enough to ensure victory. In the new, post-crash landscape, Britain\u2019s voters need more reassurance than ever about the rider of the horse, and what fills his heart.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Grain Piles Up, Waiting for a Ride, as Trains Move North Dakota Oil", "Date": "2014-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFARGO, N.D. \u2014 The furious pace of energy exploration in North Dakota is creating a crisis for farmers whose grain shipments have been held up by a vast new movement of oil by rail, leading to millions of dollars in agricultural losses and slower production for breakfast cereal giants like General Mills.The backlog is only going to get worse, farmers said, as they prepared this week for what is expected to be a record crop of wheat and soybeans.\u201cIf we can\u2019t get this stuff out soon, a lot of it is simply going to go on the ground and rot,\u201d said Bill Hejl, who grows soybeans, wheat and sugar beets in the town of Casselton, about 20 miles west of here.Although the energy boom in North Dakota has led to a 2.8 percent unemployment rate, the lowest in the nation, the downside has been harder times for farmers who have long been mainstays of the state\u2019s economy. Agriculture was North Dakota\u2019s No. 1 industry for decades, representing a quarter of its economic base, but recent statistics show that oil and gas have become the biggest contributors to the state\u2019s gross domestic product.Railroads have long been the backbone of North Dakota\u2019s transportation system and the most dependable way for farmers to move crops \u2014 to ports in Portland, Ore., Seattle and Vancouver, from which the bulk of the grain is shipped across the Pacific to Asia; and to East Coast ports like Albany, from which it is shipped to Europe.But reports the railroads filed with the federal government show that for the week that ended Aug. 22, the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway \u2014 North Dakota\u2019s largest railroad, owned by the billionaire Warren E. Buffett \u2014 had a backlog of 1,336 rail cars waiting to ship grain and other products. Another railroad, Canadian Pacific, had a backlog of nearly 1,000 cars. For farmers, the delays often mean canceled orders from food giants that cannot wait weeks or months for the grain they need to make cereal, bread and an array of other products. \u201cThey need to get this problem fixed,\u201d Mr. Hejl said. \u201cI\u2019m losing money, and my customers are turning to other sources as a result. I don\u2019t know how much longer we can survive like this.\u201dThis month, federal Agriculture Department officials said they were particularly concerned that Canadian Pacific would not be able to fulfill nearly 30,000 requests from farmers and others for rail cars before October. As a result, North Dakota\u2019s congressional delegation and lawmakers in Minnesota and South Dakota have called on the Surface Transportation Board, which oversees the nation\u2019s railroads, to step up pressure on the companies.\u201cThis rail backlog is a national problem,\u201d Senator Heidi Heitkamp, Democrat of North Dakota, said in an interview. \u201cThe inability of farmers to get these grains to market is not only a problem for agriculture, but for companies that produce cereals, breads and other goods.\u201dA recent study conducted by North Dakota State University at Ms. Heitkamp\u2019s request found that rail congestion could cost farmers in the state more than $160 million because a local oversupply of grain has lowered prices.The study also found that farmers would lose $67 million in revenue from wheat, corn and soybeans from January to mid-April. Around $95 million more in losses are expected if farmers are unable to move their remaining inventory of crops.The study was done before the current harvest, which is forecast at a record 273 million bushels of wheat, up from 235 million bushels in 2013. This year\u2019s soybean harvest is also expected to be a record, and corn will be a near-record.Food companies say they are feeling the effects of the delayed shipments. General Mills, the Minnesota-based maker of Cheerios, told investors in March that it had lost 62 days of production \u2014 as much as 4 percent of its output \u2014 in the quarter that ended in February because of winter logistics problems, including rail-car congestion. In its earnings report this month, Cargill, another Minnesota-based food giant, reported a drop in net earnings that it attributed in part to \u201chigher costs related to rail-car shortages.\u201dFarmers and agriculture groups say rail operators are clearly favoring the more lucrative transport of oil. Rail shipments of crude oil in North Dakota have surged since 2008, and the state now produces about a million barrels a day. About 60 percent of that oil travels by train from the Bakken oil fields in the western part of the state to faraway oil refiners. There are few pipelines to ship it.\u201cOil seems to be pushing us off the trains,\u201d said Bob Sinner, a farmer and the brother of a Democratic congressional candidate, George Sinner, who is running against the state\u2019s lone House member, Representative Kevin Cramer, a Republican. George Sinner has called on the Surface Transportation Board to use its emergency powers to address the rail-car shortage \u2014 the board could allow shippers to move their products with the help of a different carrier, for example. But Dennis Watson, a spokesman for the board, said it rarely invoked its emergency powers and preferred to work with rail carriers to solve problems.B.N.S.F. and Canadian Pacific maintain that their oil shipments have not replaced shipments of crops.\u201cOf course, the big difference in what we are shipping these days is oil,\u201d said Matthew K. Rose, the executive chairman of B.N.S.F. \u201cBut we aren\u2019t favoring one type of product over another.\u201dNonetheless, B.N.S.F. is investing about $400 million in North Dakota, in part to build additional tracks, hire new staff members and add rail cars. \u201cWe understand the frustration of our customers,\u201d Mr. Rose said. \u201cWe\u2019re making this investment in our infrastructure to make sure that we get things back to normal.\u201dDoug Goehring, the state\u2019s agriculture commissioner, is not optimistic so far. \u201cI know that B.N.S.F. especially is trying, but I just don\u2019t see that it\u2019s going to be any better this year,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting record crop yields, and I expect we will see more of the same with shipments lagging.\u201dCanadian Pacific officials said they were working with farmers to clear the backlog. But in a letter to Ms. Heitkamp, E. Hunter Harrison, the railroad\u2019s chief executive, argued that many of the delays stemmed from what he called phantom requests \u2014 farmers\u2019 ordering more rail cars than they need to ship products. As a result, Mr. Harrison said, cars are not available for farmers who have more immediate shipping needs.The letter prompted an angry response from Ms. Heitkamp and state officials like Mr. Goehring. \u201cWith C.P., it\u2019s everybody\u2019s fault but theirs,\u201d Mr. Goehring said.Both railroads said some of the blame for the slowed traffic lay with one of the coldest winters in years and with an increase in shipments of all types of products as a result of an improving economy.Kitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}

Trading desks remain short-staffed until people return from vacation after the Labor Day holiday. Without any major developments, trading volume usually dries up and stock indexes turn sleepy, as if stuck in their beach chairs.The S.&P. 500 is still hovering near nominal highs, leading some analysts to fret that the market looks too expensive. Lawrence Creatura, a fund manager at Federated Investors, argued that the solid second-quarter earnings season, which is nearly wrapped up, should put investors\u2019 worries about high prices to rest.The S.&P. 500, for instance, has gained nearly 6 percent this year. \u201cThat\u2019s an interesting number: 6 percent just happens to be the average earnings growth rate over the very long term,\u201d he said.In Thursday trading, the Class A shares of Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate crossed the $200,000 mark, making the highest-priced United States stock even more expensive. Mr. Buffett has never split Berkshire\u2019s A shares to make them cheaper, although Berkshire created more affordable Class B shares, which closed Thursday at $135.30 Berkshire\u2019s Class A shares rose $3,241, or 2 percent, to end at $202,850.Kohl\u2019s, a department-store chain, turned in quarterly profits that were slightly better than analysts\u2019 expectations.

{"Headline": "A Brick Beauty Bites the Dust", "Date": "2014-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreetscapesThe preservation movement may have been born when Penn Station was demolished in 1963, but it had a long period of gestation. Probably the most regretted structure to be taken down in the years before the station fell was George B. Post\u2019s colossal New York Produce Exchange, on the east side of Broadway, opposite Bowling Green.The giant 1884 brick hall was a monument to a time when wheat, oil and other commodities were central to the New York economy. Founded in 1861, the produce exchange served a nationwide network of produce and commodities dealers, and in 1881 they began building the most impressive exchange structure ever seen in Manhattan. Post, whose firm went on to do the New York Stock Exchange in 1903, won the competition for the design of a trading floor and headquarters. For the 150- by 300-foot site, Post built an arcaded fortress, as noble as anything in Florence, but in fiery red brick. Post made more than 4,000 drawings for the exchange, which he gave a 144-by-220-foot trading floor 60 feet high, with an off-center tower rising to 224 feet. The building has attracted the attention of scholars because it appears that the courtyard walls were built with cage construction, a proto-skyscraper technique, with a metal frame supporting the floors but not the exterior walls. Post covered the building with inventive ornament, ships\u2019 prows at the corners, medallions of corn, cows and pigs elsewhere, although it was lost in its huge scale. However, the professional critic is not easily pleased, and even as it was rising in 1882, The Real Estate Chronicle said the exchange looked like \u201cmilitary barracks,\u201d which was definitely not intended as a compliment. The Real Estate Record and Guide held its inky tongue until 1883, when it ventured that Post\u2019s building was \u201ca great pity,\u201d firming that up in 1884 with criticism of its \u201cpreposterously projecting cornices\u201d on what was in essence \u201ca very thin and stupid looking box.\u201dWhew! If anyone saw any resemblance to Henri Labrouste\u2019s arcaded Biblioth\u00e8que Ste.-Genevi\u00e8ve in Paris, it did not come up. But men of business take little note of the opinions of the chattering classes, and the New York Produce Exchange thrived. In 1886 Harper\u2019s New Monthly Magazine said that trading took place in the environment of \u201ccallithumpian discord,\u201d with \u201cfiendish screeches.\u201d\u201cWhile on the floor,\u201d the magazine reported, \u201ca buyer may receive from Europe a cable order for a cargo of grain, flour, or provisions, may purchase what is ordered, charter a vessel for shipment, engage an elevator to load the grain, or a lighter to move provisions or flour, effect insurance, sell exchange, cable back the fact of his purchases, and write and mail his letters.\u201d The building had lounges, a restaurant, meeting halls, offices for rent and a library that carried foreign and domestic periodicals, including, for instance, The Bangor Rustler of Dakota Territory. National and world prices were established here for petroleum, turpentine and staples like wheat and corn; in the 1880s the exchange processed orders of about 60 million bushels of each, and by 1900 was doing $15 million a day in business. But by the 1950s, exchange membership had fallen to 500, down from 2,500 in the 1880s, and in 1953 the members announced they would part with their venerable headquarters in favor of a new 30-story office building, a tall, angled slab set on a low base, like an early TV on a swivel table, designed by William Lescaze. The architectural historian Talbot F. Hamlin tilted at this windmill in the same year in Architectural Forum, which was becoming known as an independent voice in the field of architecture, ignoring the influence of advertisers. Hamlin called the produce exchange the best of Post\u2019s work, \u201cstriking in color\u201d and also \u201cexpressive of its time,\u201d a sine qua non for modernists. He railed against demolition, asking whether New Yorkers were \u201csuch slaves to economic pressures that they can have no say in what they see, no power to preserve what they love?\u201d For some reason \u2014 certainly not Hamlin\u2019s outrage \u2014 the members hesitated until 1957. Then they moved out and the structure came down. The new No. 2 Broadway was welcomed by businesses in the financial district; the postwar period for downtown real estate had been slow. Graybeards who mourn the rich red brick of the produce exchange must be few in number by now. At the time no one mobilized or picketed or raised any ruckus. But its passing became one of those subliminal \u201caha\u201d moments, a ready reference in the collective consciousness of New Yorkers that something valuable was slipping away, piece by piece.

The lab science and marketing enthusiasm tend to underestimate the bottlenecks to progress that must be overcome with hard work and practical engineering.The field known as \u201cbig data\u201d offers a contemporary case study. The catchphrase stands for the modern abundance of digital data from many sources \u2014 the web, sensors, smartphones and corporate databases \u2014 that can be mined with clever software for discoveries and insights. Its promise is smarter, data-driven decision-making in every field. That is why data scientist is the economy\u2019s hot new job.Yet far too much handcrafted work \u2014 what data scientists call \u201cdata wrangling,\u201d \u201cdata munging\u201d and \u201cdata janitor work\u201d \u2014 is still required. Data scientists, according to interviews and expert estimates, spend from 50 percent to 80 percent of their time mired in this more mundane labor of collecting and preparing unruly digital data, before it can be explored for useful nuggets.\u201cData wrangling is a huge \u2014 and surprisingly so \u2014 part of the job,\u201d said Monica Rogati, vice president for data science at Jawbone, whose sensor-filled wristband and software track activity, sleep and food consumption, and suggest dietary and health tips based on the numbers. \u201cIt\u2019s something that is not appreciated by data civilians. At times, it feels like everything we do.\u201dSeveral start-ups are trying to break through these big data bottlenecks by developing software to automate the gathering, cleaning and organizing of disparate data, which is plentiful but messy. The modern Wild West of data needs to be tamed somewhat so it can be recognized and exploited by a computer program.\u201cIt\u2019s an absolute myth that you can send an algorithm over raw data and have insights pop up,\u201d said Jeffrey Heer, a professor of computer science at the University of Washington and a co-founder of Trifacta, a start-up based in San Francisco.Timothy Weaver, the chief information officer of Del Monte Foods, calls the predicament of data wrangling big data\u2019s \u201ciceberg\u201d issue, meaning attention is focused on the result that is seen rather than all the unseen toil beneath. But it is a problem born of opportunity. Increasingly, there are many more sources of data to tap that can deliver clues about a company\u2019s business, Mr. Weaver said.In the food industry, he explained, the data available today could include production volumes, location data on shipments, weather reports, retailers\u2019 daily sales and social network comments, parsed for signals of shifts in sentiment and demand.The result, Mr. Weaver said, is being able to see each stage of a business in greater detail than in the past, to tailor product plans and trim inventory. \u201cThe more visibility you have, the more intelligent decisions you can make,\u201d he said.But if the value comes from combining different data sets, so does the headache. Data from sensors, documents, the web and conventional databases all come in different formats. Before a software algorithm can go looking for answers, the data must be cleaned up and converted into a unified form that the algorithm can understand.Data formats are one challenge, but so is the ambiguity of human language. Iodine, a new health start-up, gives consumers information on drug side effects and interactions. Its lists, graphics and text descriptions are the result of combining the data from clinical research, government reports and online surveys of people\u2019s experience with specific drugs.But the Food and Drug Administration, National Institutes of Health and pharmaceutical companies often apply slightly different terms to describe the same side effect. For example, \u201cdrowsiness,\u201d \u201csomnolence\u201d and \u201csleepiness\u201d are all used. A human would know they mean the same thing, but a software algorithm has to be programmed to make that interpretation. That kind of painstaking work must be repeated, time and again, on data projects.Data experts try to automate as many steps in the process as possible. \u201cBut practically, because of the diversity of data, you spend a lot of your time being a data janitor, before you can get to the cool, sexy things that got you into the field in the first place,\u201d said Matt Mohebbi, a data scientist and co-founder of Iodine.The big data challenge today fits a familiar pattern in computing. A new technology emerges and initially it is mastered by an elite few. But with time, ingenuity and investment, the tools get better, the economics improve, business practices adapt and the technology eventually gets diffused and democratized into the mainstream.In software, for example, the early programmers were a priesthood who understood the inner workings of the machine. But the door to programming was steadily opened to more people over the years with higher-level languages from Fortran to Java, and even simpler tools like spreadsheets.Spreadsheets made financial math and simple modeling accessible to millions of nonexperts in business. John Akred, chief technology officer at Silicon Valley Data Science, a consulting firm, sees something similar in the modern data world, as the software tools improve.\u201cWe are witnessing the beginning of that revolution now, of making these data problems addressable by a far larger audience,\u201d Mr. Akred said.ClearStory Data, a start-up in Palo Alto, Calif., makes software that recognizes many data sources, pulls them together and presents the results visually as charts, graphics or data-filled maps. Its goal is to reach a wider market of business users beyond data masters.Six to eight data sources typically go into each visual presentation. One for a retailer might include scanned point-of-sale data, weather reports, web traffic, competitors\u2019 pricing data, the number of visits to the merchant\u2019s smartphone app and video tracking of parking lot traffic, said Sharmila Shahani-Mulligan, chief executive of ClearStory.\u201cYou can\u2019t do this manually,\u201d Ms. Shahani-Mulligan said. \u201cYou\u2019re never going to find enough data scientists and analysts.\u201dTrifacta makes a tool for data professionals. Its software employs machine-learning technology to find, present and suggest types of data that might be useful for a data scientist to see and explore, depending on the task at hand.\u201cWe want to lift the burden from the user, reduce the time spent on data preparation and learn from the user,\u201d said Joseph M. Hellerstein, chief strategy officer of Trifacta, who is also a computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley.Paxata, a start-up in Redwood City, Calif., is focused squarely on automating data preparation \u2014 finding, cleaning and blending data so that it is ready to be analyzed. The data refined by Paxata can then be fed into a variety of analysis or visualization software tools, chosen by the data scientist or business analyst, said Prakash Nanduri, chief executive of Paxata.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to liberate people from data-wrangling,\u201d Mr. Nanduri said. \u201cWe want to free up their time and save them from going blind.\u201dData scientists emphasize that there will always be some hands-on work in data preparation, and there should be. Data science, they say, is a step-by-step process of experimentation.\u201cYou prepared your data for a certain purpose, but then you learn something new, and the purpose changes,\u201d said Cathy O\u2019Neil, a data scientist at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, and co-author, with Rachel Schutt, of \u201cDoing Data Science\u201d (O\u2019Reilly Media, 2013).Plenty of progress is still to be made in easing the analysis of data. \u201cWe really need better tools so we can spend less time on data wrangling and get to the sexy stuff,\u201d said Michael Cavaretta, a data scientist at Ford Motor, which has used big data analysis to trim inventory levels and guide changes in car design.Mr. Cavaretta is familiar with the work of ClearStory, Trifacta, Paxata and other start-ups in the field. \u201cI\u2019d encourage these start-ups to keep at it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good problem, and a big one.\u201dAn article on Monday about the development of software to automate the gathering, cleaning and organizing of disparate data misstated the year when \u201cDoing Data Science\u201d was published.

{"Headline": "More Rejoin Labor Force; Jobless Rate Up to 6.2% ", "Date": "2014-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLittle to rave or rant about.And while the numbers didn\u2019t soar to new heights, they completed the strongest pace of job creation over a six-month period since the prerecession year of 2006, while helping to calm concerns on Wall Street that the economy was about to accelerate to a point where the Federal Reserve would be under pressure to start raising interest rates earlier than anticipated.\u201cThis report is consistent with a moderation in economic growth in the second half of the year,\u201d said Dean Maki, chief United States economist at Barclays. \u201cThis is a labor market that is growing solidly, just not quite as fast as in prior months.\u201dThe Labor Department, using a different method of measuring the job market, said Friday that unemployment increased to 6.2 percent from 6.1 percent in June. Many economists viewed the slight rise in the official jobless rate as a modestly encouraging sign, in part because more people reported that they were looking for work, suggesting that many of them were seeing greater job opportunities.On Wall Street, stocks fell only a little after their sharp decline on Thursday, while the bond market improved slightly as interest rates softened.The latest economic data reinforced the view that inflation and wages remain bound by a fairly tight straitjacket, suggesting that the Federal Reserve will see little need to retreat more quickly from its stimulus campaign. The Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, and her allies argued in recent months that the declining unemployment rate overstated the economy\u2019s progress, because more people would start looking for work as the recovery continued. The uptick in the unemployment rate in July lent credence to that view.Inflation also remained sluggish. The Fed\u2019s preferred measure, which the government also updated Friday, rose just 1.6 percent over the 12 months ending in June, remaining below the central bank\u2019s preferred pace of 2 percent a year.The Fed affirmed on Wednesday that it planned to keep interest rates low as long as unemployment remained elevated and inflation remained under control. The sole dissenter, Charles I. Plosser, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, said on Friday that the Fed still should be moving more quickly toward raising rates. In an unusual statement explaining his decision, he noted that inflation had increased over the last year, while unemployment declined, so conditions were moving closer to the Fed\u2019s stated goals.On the jobs numbers, the July figure was well below the revised 298,000 surge reported in June and lower than the 229,000 figure now reported for May.The figures for July confirmed that a gradual healing of the job market remained on track, even as it underscored just how much more needs to be done to reach a level where most people who want to work can find a job relatively easily. It showed, for example, that over the last year employers added 2.57 million jobs, the steepest rate of job creation for any 12-month period in the five-year expansion. But the proportion of the country\u2019s population that reported having a job in July was unchanged at 59 percent, a number that was up only barely from its 58.7 percent level of a year ago, and still near its lowest levels since the late 1970s.\u201cThe economy still has a huge amount of headwind out there from the popping of the credit bubble,\u201d said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist for MFR Inc., in an interview before the labor market numbers were released Friday. \u201cWe\u2019re not through that by any means.\u201dThe Hamilton Project, a Washington group affiliated with the Brookings Institution, calculated that the economy had a \u201cjobs gap\u201d at the end of July of 5.7 million jobs, the number needed to return to prerecession employment levels while absorbing the people who enter the labor force each month.For all the shortcomings, the economy nonetheless appears to be in better shape than at any time since the recession hit in late 2007. So far this year, for example, the economy has added an average of 230,000 jobs a month, compared with 194,000 last year, 174,000 in 2011 and only 88,000 in 2010.\u201cThis is another solid report that shows we are sustaining the momentum of broad-based growth in the economy,\u201d said Thomas E. Perez, the labor secretary, in a telephone interview. He cited the growth in well-paying professional and business services jobs as evidence that the economy is not creating just low-paid jobs. The retail and manufacturing sectors also added jobs.The Labor Department reported that employers added 209,000 jobs in July, but the unemployment rate rose slightly, to 6.2 percent.Adding to the more upbeat view was a report from the Institute for Supply Management showing its manufacturing index rose to 57.1 in July, from 55.3 in June. It was the highest reading in three years, bolstered by improvements in the index of new orders, production, employment and supplier deliveries. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index rose to 81.8 in the last July reading, up from the initial July reading of 81.3. The index was on track with moderate consumer spending growth.But Friday\u2019s data from the Labor Department showed that in July wages barely moved, inching up by just a penny and leaving wages only 2 percent higher than a year ago, a rate that barely outpaced inflation.\u201cPeople\u2019s standards of living are still stuck in the mud,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Economics, who called the government\u2019s report otherwise \u201cclose to perfect\u201d because job growth increased across nearly all industries and all pay scales.The news that wages remained flat contrasted with an Employment Cost Index report Thursday that American labor costs recorded their biggest gain since the third quarter of 2008. The notion that wages might be rising helped prompt the sell-off among investors Thursday, highlighting the divergent views between some on Wall Street and those held by many economists who view rising wages as essential to sustaining an expanding economy.Higher wages have been \u201ca key missing ingredient from the recovery,\u201d Jared Bernstein, an economist at the left-of-center Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, wrote in a blog post.In Rochester, at least one company was looking to hire young people. Neal P. Elli, chief executive of Empire Precision Plastics, said he had openings for about a dozen workers for his company, which makes molds for plastic parts used in electronics and medical devices. Most workers in his industry are older and will be retiring soon, Mr. Elli said. A new employee with four years of training could make $50,000 a year. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a better career than mold-making,\u201d he said.An earlier version of the headline for this article referred incorrectly to the unemployment rate.

{"Headline": "Buildup Makes Russia Battle-Ready for Ukraine", "Date": "2014-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Russia has roughly doubled the number of its battalions near the Ukrainian border, Western officials said Monday, and could respond to the Kiev government\u2019s gains there by launching a cross-border incursion with little or no warning.Over the past several weeks, Russia has built up 17 battalions \u2014 totaling 19,000 to 21,000 troops, according to one Western estimate \u2014 into a battle-ready force of infantry, armor, artillery and air defense within a few miles of the border. In addition, it has vastly expanded its firepower, increasing the number of advanced surface-to-air missile units to 14 from eight, and deploying more than 30 artillery batteries, according to the officials.The Kremlin\u2019s intentions in increasing its military abilities remain unclear. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia could be seeking to pressure Ukraine and the United States to agree to a political settlement that would grant the eastern provinces of Ukraine maximum autonomy. But Mr. Putin, Western officials fear, may also be developing the option to intervene more directly if it appears that the pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine are on the verge of defeat.American intelligence experts say that the advance by Ukrainian government forces on Donetsk and other steps that the Ukrainian government is taking to regain territory in the east from the separatists might prompt Mr. Putin to send his forces across the border under the guise of a \u201cpeacekeeping operation.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a very real option,\u201d a senior Defense Department official said on Monday. \u201cAnd should Putin decide, he could do that with little or no notice. We just don\u2019t know what he\u2019s thinking.\u201dAnother senior American official added, \u201cThe more success Ukrainian forces have, the more pressure there is on Moscow to escalate.\u201dAdding to the concern, the buildup coincides with a newly announced Russian air force and air defense exercise. When it intervened in Crimea this year, Russia used a military exercise to mask its preparations.The Russian moves suggest that the Kremlin and the West are each responding to the standoff over Ukraine by turning to the tools they know best.For President Obama and European leaders, the tool is calibrated economic sanctions, targeted to affect banks close to the Kremlin or narrow subsectors of the Russian economy, like Russia\u2019s long-term ability to develop new Arctic, deep sea and shale oil reserves.But for Mr. Putin, the tool is the Kremlin\u2019s ability to marshal raw military power and, increasingly, its willingness to use it.Less than a week after the Obama administration and European nations announced new sanctions, the Kremlin has expanded its military ability to provide cover fire for the separatists by firing artillery and rockets across the border into Ukraine. And it holds out the possibility of intervening directly.Wesley K. Clark, the retired general and former NATO commander, said that Mr. Putin had put the pieces in place for a major military intervention by massing Russia forces near the border, arming separatist groups, infiltrating operatives, conducting exercises to practice the military\u2019s ability to coordinate fire and supporting the self-proclaimed mayor of Luhansk, who has called for the Russian military to come to the separatists\u2019 aid.But the risks to Mr. Putin of intervening, General Clark noted, include tougher Western economic sanctions, resistance by the Ukrainian forces and Western military support for the Kiev government. \u201cHe has set the military and political conditions for what he believes could be a successful intervention,\u201d General Clark said. \u201cBut he still doesn\u2019t seem to have made the political decision to do this, perhaps because he recognizes that the risks after an intervention are incalculable.\u201dIf Mr. Putin did decide to intervene, one plausible outcome highlighted by General Clark and Phillip A. Karber, a former adviser to Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger, is the possibility of a \u201cpeacekeeping\u201d intervention at the request of the Ukrainian separatists whom Moscow has been arming and supporting politically.In a closed-door briefing for Congress last month, Mr. Karber noted that Russian military vehicles bearing the Russian emblem for peacekeeping forces had been positioned close to Ukraine.Amateur video posted on YouTube and Twitter appears to show some of these vehicles operating in Ukraine.Several American officials confirmed that Russian armored vehicles and trucks with the peacekeeping insignia had been seen on Russian territory near Ukraine. But these officials said that Western intelligence had no independent confirmation that they had crossed into Ukraine.Strikingly, the White House has been taking the idea of a Russian \u201cpeacekeeping\u201d intervention seriously.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a significant rebuild up of Russian forces along the border, potentially positioning Russia for a so-called humanitarian or peacekeeping intervention in Ukraine,\u201d Antony J. Blinken, the deputy national security adviser to Mr. Obama, said last week when the White House announced new sanctions. \u201cSo there\u2019s urgency to arresting this.\u201dA spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry last month insisted that the Kremlin had no plans to send peacekeeping forces to Ukraine, according to a report by the Russian news agency Itar-Tass.The Russian buildup comes as the Ukrainian military has been gaining ground in its struggle with the separatists and amid other signs of Russian military activity. The air exercise announced by Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry will involve more than 100 aircraft, including attack planes, bombers and helicopters. The exercise is scheduled to last through Friday.On June 27, Mr. Putin also issued a decree appealing for reservists to report for up to two months of training, a step that was recently reaffirmed by the Defense Ministry.American and NATO officials have not publicly provided precise troop estimates for the Russian forces near Ukraine. Last week, Pentagon officials put the total at 10,000 to 13,000 troops, but they acknowledged the difficulty of counting Russian troops with precision as units have moved in and out of the border region and employed camouflage to disguise combat equipment. During a visit to Kosovo last week, Gen. Philip M. Breedlove, the top NATO commander, said the number of Russian troops along the border was growing and was \u201cwell over 12,000.\u201d \u201cThe number of battalion task groups,\u201d General Breedlove said, \u201cSpetsnaz units, air defense units, artillery units are all increasing.\u201dOne Western official familiar with the intelligence said Monday that it could be as high as 21,000. The officials all spoke on condition of anonymity because intelligence assessments of Russian military strength are classified.Even as tensions have grown, Mr. Obama has signaled his interest in a political solution. In a call Friday to Mr. Putin, Mr. Obama \u201creinforced his preference for a diplomatic solution to the crisis in Ukraine\u201d and agreed to keep open \u201cthe channels of communication,\u201d the White House said in a statement.Mr. Obama also repeated his \u201cdeep concerns about Russia\u2019s increased support for the separatists in Ukraine,\u201d the White House said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Seeking New Start, Finding Steep Cost", "Date": "2014-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOUISVILLE, Ky. \u2014 When the financial crisis crippled the construction industry seven years ago, Joe DeGrella\u2019s contracting company failed, leaving him looking for what he hoped would be the last job he would ever need.He took each step in line with the advice of the federal government: He met with an unemployment counselor who provided him with a list of job titles the Labor Department determined to be in high demand, he picked from among colleges that offered government-certified job-training courses, and he received a federal retraining grant.But after about two years of studying cardiovascular physiology and the mechanics of electrocardiograms, Mr. DeGrella, now 57, found himself jobless and $20,000 in debt. He moved into his sister\u2019s basement and now works at an AutoZone.Instead, an extensive analysis of the program by The New York Times shows, many graduates wind up significantly worse off than when they started \u2014 mired in unemployment and debt from training for positions that do not exist, and they end up working elsewhere for minimum wage.The Times examination, based on state and federal documents, school and court records, and interviews, shows that some of the retraining institutions advertise graduation and job-placement rates that often do not hold up to scrutiny.The idea of dividing responsibility between federal and state officials was to give local and state authorities more power in helping the unemployed in their areas. But the unemployed who sign up for training are often left to navigate a bureaucratic maze with almost no guidance. To avoid any appearance of favoritism, federal job counselors are not allowed to recommend schools to job seekers, leaving many of the unemployed to unwittingly select institutions that are expensive, have a history of legal trouble or are academically substandard.There is, for example, no mechanism for students to check in with counselors to gauge their progress or determine whether the training program is a good match. States say they investigate complaints and audit programs with poor outcomes, but students say they tend not to register formal complaints about a program\u2019s quality.\u201cI\u2019ve worked hard my whole life,\u201d said Mr. DeGrella, who also once managed a manufacturing company. \u201cI\u2019m just angry that I was trying to improve myself and my situation, and end up $20,000 in debt.\u201dWhile government officials defend the retraining program as useful \u2014 and clearly it does lead some unemployed people to new careers \u2014 neither federal nor state agencies collect data on the number of people who finish job training or earn professional certificates. As a result, officials acknowledge that they are unable to determine how many students the program has helped find appropriate jobs during the past 15 years.\u201cThe jobs they are being trained for really aren\u2019t better paying,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have not used our work force investment system to help people make the choices they need to succeed. For some of the workers, we know what we\u2019re doing for them isn\u2019t working.\u201dThe training program offers courses at community colleges, vocational and business schools, and four-year universities where students can study everything from petroleum pump systems to makeup for the cinema.Though his school claims a 95 percent job-placement rate within six months of graduation, Mr. King, who has sued Concorde, said only five of the 25 students in his class have found full-time jobs. A Concorde official did not dispute those figures.Mr. King, who has a bachelor of arts degree from California State University, Fullerton, said he has so little money that he alternates the months in which he pays his two credit card bills and has delayed indefinitely a visit to the doctor to check a worrisome mole.\u201cI\u2019ve applied for every job under the sun,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m doing everything I\u2019m supposed to do. My wife, who works, expected not to have all the weight on her shoulders.\u201dStudents at Florida Keys default on their loans at a rate of 19.4 percent; at the University of Florida, the rate is 3 percent.Juggling Cost-EffectivenessThe school, which calls itself \u201ca leader in the field of technical and vocational training,\u201d has also failed to find jobs for as many as two-thirds of its students in some programs \u2014 many of whom have taken out thousands of dollars in loans to enroll, according to school records.Additionally, nearly 30 percent of the institute\u2019s students default on their loans, according to Department of Education records, compared with about 5 percent at the University of Texas at Austin.And though the institute\u2019s medical assistant students borrow an average of $10,801, according to federal data, they can expect to earn as little as $10 an hour, according to local job listings \u2014 yielding an annual salary roughly equal to the poverty level for a three-person family.\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of money for a potentially low-paying job,\u201d said Pat Hobbs, executive director of the Cameron County work force board, which manages Workforce Investment Act training programs. \u201cBut these are kids who are at home, and maybe no one is working. So they see light at the end of the tunnel, and figure any job is better than no job.\u201dSouth Texas Vocational Technical Institute\u2019s campuses, located in one of the poorest areas of the nation, are made up nearly entirely of Latinos, two-thirds of whom are women. Cameron County, home of the Brownsville campus, has an annual per capita income of less than $11,000. About 40 percent of the work force lacks a high school diploma.Nonetheless, the commission said the school stands in good stead.\u201cThere are no administrative actions that would affect the school\u2019s licensing status with T.W.C. at this time,\u201d Lisa J. Givens, a spokeswoman for the state commission, wrote in an email.Assessing the TrainingWhen Congress reauthorized the Workforce Investment Act last month, it did not address concerns about the cost of some of the schools, the level of debt students were left with or whether counselors should be allowed to offer more direct professional advice. In a nod to past criticism, however, the updated law does require states to better track former students to determine if training helped them find work with sustainable wages.During interviews, Labor Department officials said the program works well. They said that assessing the quality of training is up to the states, and that the agency does not regulate tuitions and is unaware of concerns related to prices.\u201cIf providers fail to meet the state\u2019s requirements and job-placement policies, states have a process in place to revoke their eligibility,\u201d Eric Seleznow, a deputy assistant secretary in the Labor Department, said in response to written questions.In South Carolina, for example, 75 percent of dislocated workers found jobs without training, compared with 77 percent who found jobs after entering the program, according to state figures.A group of for-profit schools frequently at odds with regulators over the quality of their training and their costs charge some of the highest tuitions but place relatively few students in jobs.Kent Jenkins, a Corinthian spokesman, said its typical student is from a low-income family and has failed in previous attempts to earn a certificate or degree.\u201cWe offer training in health care programs, where if you complete the training, the first job pays in the low- to mid-$20,000s a year,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a fortune. But it gets you out of unemployment, and gets you on a track for a career. It\u2019s a good investment.\u201dA medical assistant course offered by Corinthian that costs $19,000 represents what Mr. Jenkins said was a \u201cconsequential amount, but not the proverbial mountains of debt.\u201dJob-training programs can cost more than $50,000 at Concorde, a competing group of for-profit schools based in Missouri that had its policies criticized by a United States Senate committee report in 2009.Tim Foster, Concorde\u2019s chief executive officer, insisted that the schools\u2019 educational standards were worth the cost, but he acknowledged that Concorde had recently reduced prices to make up for fewer students enrolling.At Daymar College, the for-profit school Mr. DeGrella attended, students pay $18,000 to earn a certificate in dental assisting, or $36,000 for an associate degree.But more than one-third of those who earned the associate degree failed to find a job, despite taking out an average of $18,475 in loans, according to school data. In another Daymar training program \u2014 for billing and coding specialists, which also costs $36,000 \u2014 just 38 percent of graduates find jobs, according to the school\u2019s accreditor, the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools. Daymar refused to comment, saying it had few students enrolled in Workforce Investment Act courses, but it declined a request to provide supporting data.In the Central Valley of California, where unemployment hovers around 16 percent, the program needs more intense focus from the federal government, according to local officials.Jarrod Howard, 45, who has been unemployed for two years, recently finished a welding course in nearby Modesto. He said that welders with his skills could earn $60 an hour, but that he would settle for $20 an hour if he were able to stay within 50 miles of the house he shares with his mother.\u201cI could live on $15 an hour because it is not that expensive to live here, but I\u2019m trying to put away as much money as I can to retire,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I ever retire.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Drinker\u2019s Manifesto", "Date": "2014-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAcross my desk recently came a reissue of the 1964 classic \u201cThe Drinking Man\u2019s Diet,\u201d a cute little volume that maintains that if you drink a bit you\u2019ll lose weight. Counterintuitive, since one of the things we think we know about alcohol is that it provides truly empty calories, which generally speaking cause weight gain (see, for example, soda). Life is complicated, and drinking for health is a lame rationalization, but drinking itself... well, we do it because we like it. Medical discussions about drinking rarely touch on hangovers, an important consequence for serious drinkers, which I\u2019ve had more times than I\u2019d like to think about. (Although I did swear that my most recent hangover would be my last, and given that that was more than six weeks ago, I\u2019d say I\u2019m doing pretty well.) The point is that if we\u2019re reasonably responsible individuals, these are private matters whose consequences are borne by ourselves. We drink because we want to, not because it\u2019s good for us. Whether you believe that alcohol is proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy (a paraphrase of a quote usually attributed to Ben Franklin) or that God has nothing to do with this, it\u2019s clear that alcohol can bring both joy and pain. This is also true of many other things in life, but with alcohol, many of us forgive the self-indulgence. That\u2019s almost official policy, in one way: A bottle of soda has a nutrition label; a bottle of vodka does not. These are calories you\u2019re probably not counting. (If you want to drink \u201clight,\u201d calorie-wise, drink straight booze rather than mixed drinks, wine or beer.) Still, we feel guilty: Two-thirds of us drink, and many of us either underestimate the amount we do or actually lie about it. In Britain, for example, drinking reported to health professionals accounts for only about 60 percent of the alcohol sold. I lie to my doctors about drinking, because by official standards I drink too much and I don\u2019t want to be scolded. The C.D.C. flatly says drinking too much is \u201cdangerous,\u201d which is pretty vague, and can \u201clead to heart disease, breast cancer, sexually transmitted diseases, unintended pregnancy, fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, sudden infant death syndrome, motor-vehicle crashes, and violence.\u201d Many of these dangerous effects are indirect and can be mitigated: If you don\u2019t have sex or get into a car after drinking, you can\u2019t possibly get pregnant or in a car accident. (One thing about drinking alcohol, though: It can cause bad judgment.) The more direct ones, like heart disease and breast cancer, have so many risk factors that drinking may perhaps be discounted, especially in moderation. And there\u2019s evidence that drinking \u201cthe right amount\u201d \u2014 which is less than \u201ctoo much\u201d \u2014 can be good for you. But that amount varies wildly from one individual to the next, and for most people the safest amount of alcohol is probably, rationally, zero. So it\u2019s crazy to say, as people do, \u201cI drink red wine because it\u2019s better for you than white,\u201d because mostly people drink to get buzzed, or drunk, because bad judgment is a release or fun or both. Of course there are people who really drink too much, and we should continue to discourage overconsumption, but once again when it comes to public health we fail to prioritize correctly. The C.D.C. says that excessive alcohol consumption causes 88,000 deaths a year and \u201ccosts the economy about $224 billion.\u201d Obesity-related illnesses cause somewhere around 112,000 deaths, and cost maybe a trillion dollars. You don\u2019t see the C.D.C. saying that people under 21 years of age \u201cdrink too much\u201d if they consume a can of soda. But it should.Thomas L. Friedman is off today. Advertisement"}

Sixty percent also described the Mexican economy as bad, and 67 percent said they were dissatisfied with the way things were going in the country.Earlier this month, Mexico\u2019s Congress approved foreign investment in the state-owned oil company, Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos, known as Pemex. According to the poll, which was conducted in spring, 57 percent of Mexicans had opposed international investment in Pemex, which many people see as a symbol of the nation\u2019s autonomy.More than half of those surveyed also admired how Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto has been dealing with organized crime and drug traffickers. The Mexican public is more upbeat about the government\u2019s efforts against drug traffickers: 45 percent said the government is making progress, up from 37 percent last year. The survey was conducted two months after the February arrest of Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n Loera, known as El Chapo, one of Mexico\u2019s top drug lords.

{"Headline": "An Assault Upon Our Children", "Date": "2014-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 After my older brother fell ill from the stress of being a student in South Korea, my mother decided to move me from our home in Seoul to Vancouver for high school to spare me the intense pressure to succeed. She did not want me to suffer like my brother, who had a chest pain that doctors could not diagnose and an allergy so severe he needed to have shots at home. I was fortunate that my mother recognized the problem and had the means to take me abroad. Most South Korean children\u2019s parents are the main source of the unrelenting pressure put on students. Thirteen years later, in 2008, I taught advanced English grammar to 11-year-olds at an expensive cram school in the wealthy Seoul neighborhood of Gangnam. The students were serious about studying but their eyes appeared dead. When I asked a class if they were happy in this environment, one girl hesitantly raised her hand to tell me that she would only be happy if her mother was gone because all her mother knew was how to nag about her academic performance. The world may look to South Korea as a model for education \u2014 its students rank among the best on international education tests \u2014 but the system\u2019s dark side casts a long shadow. Dominated by Tiger Moms, cram schools and highly authoritarian teachers, South Korean education produces ranks of overachieving students who pay a stiff price in health and happiness. The entire program amounts to child abuse. It should be reformed and restructured without delay. Granted, the South Korean system has its strengths. The idea that success is most important, no matter the cost, is a great motivator. My report card after the first exam in middle school ranked me 21st out of 60 students in my homeroom class. My mother, who was enlightened about the extreme horrors of South Korean education but nevertheless worried about my grades, immediately found me a private tutor for math, which helped me shoot up to a respectable No. 3 in the homeroom hierarchy. But that was the early 1990s. Since then, this culture of competition has only spread. Cram schools like the one I taught in \u2014 known as hagwons in Korean \u2014 are a mainstay of the South Korean education system and a symbol of parental yearning to see their children succeed at all costs. Hagwons are soulless facilities, with room after room divided by thin walls, lit by long fluorescent bulbs, and stuffed with students memorizing English vocabulary, Korean grammar rules and math formulas. Students typically stay after regular school hours until 10 p.m. or later.Herded to various educational outlets and programs by parents, the average South Korean student works up to 13 hours a day, while the average high school student sleeps only 5.5 hours a night to ensure there is sufficient time for studying. Hagwons consume more than half of spending on private education. This \u201cinvestment\u201d in education is what has been used to explain South Koreans\u2019 spectacular scores on the Program for International Student Assessment, increasingly the standard by which students from all over the world are compared to one another. But a system driven by overzealous parents and a leviathan private industry is unsustainable over the long run, especially given the physical and psychological costs that students are forced to bear. Many young South Koreans suffer physical symptoms of academic stress, like my brother did. In a typical case, one friend reported losing clumps of hair as she focused on her studies in high school; her hair regrew only when she entered college.Students are also inclined to see academic performance as their only source of validation and self-worth. Among young South Koreans who confessed to feeling suicidal in 2010, an alarming 53 percent identified inadequate academic performance as the main reason for such thoughts.Not surprisingly, South Korea\u2019s position in the international education hierarchy is flipped when it comes to youth happiness, with only 60 percent of the country\u2019s students confessing to being content in school, compared with an average of 80 percent, in 2012, among the world\u2019s wealthy nations.There is a historical explanation for South Korea\u2019s education fervor. During the Choson Dynasty (1392-1910), having children pass the civil service examination administered by the royal court was seen as a sure conduit to social and material success for the entire family. As the late Professor Edward Wagner at Harvard noted, even then a form of private education persisted, with candidates taking years of lessons to prepare for the exam and wealthier families splurging on special tutors.Korean culture\u2019s special focus on the family unit is also a major factor. Many parents believe that their right to decide their children\u2019s future is sacrosanct. And the view that the family is an economic unit perpetuates such tight control over children. Marriage, for example, still often functions as a financial transaction between two families. To be a South Korean child ultimately is not about freedom, personal choice or happiness; it is about production, performance and obedience.Obedience to authority is enforced both at home and school. I remember the time I disagreed with my homeroom teacher in middle school by writing him a letter about one of his rules. The letter led to my being summoned to the teacher\u2019s office, where I was berated for an hour and a half, not about the substance of my words but the fact that I had expressed my view at all. He had a class to teach but he did not bother to leave our meeting because he was so enraged that someone had questioned his authority. I knew then that trying to be rational or outspoken in school was pointless. Despite decades of outright abuse and the entrenchment of this disturbing system, signs are emerging that some people are beginning to take reform seriously. In the course of coming to terms with the legacy of dictatorial rule, South Koreans have embraced the notion of \u201chealing,\u201d with the understanding that past political repression and continuing social pressure have engendered psychological ills that require redress. That trend has led to discussion of the detrimental effects the education system has on students and what should be done.Another sign that things may move in a positive direction is the election in June of a large number of progressive education superintendents around the country, spurred by the growing desire of the public for reforms. But to effect any meaningful change in education, a culture that treats its children as a commodity to be used in the service of the family or the national economy must be radically altered. The government must halt its unrelenting pursuit of a higher birthrate in the face of a shrinking population and cease viewing children as mere cogs in the country\u2019s economy with no right to personal happiness. South Korea must also encourage its citizens to see marriage not as a dutiful union that must yield tangible economic benefits, but as a life choice that can bring contentment and well-being. Only then can children be perceived as individuals with free will, rather than mere producers of wealth and status subject to onerous education.A private education industry run amok must be better regulated to put children\u2019s welfare first. Although successive presidents have made attempts to rein in the cram schools, including mandating a 10 p.m. closure, many hagwon owners flout the regulations by operating out of residential buildings or blacking out windows so that light cannot be seen from outside. And some parents hire private tutors to get around the rule.The fight against these abuses would be far more effective if legislation were passed criminalizing excessive private education. Otherwise, South Korean parents may never recognize that the current system is a direct assault on the welfare of their own offspring. But above all, the conviction that academic success is paramount in life needs to be set aside completely. South Korea may have become an enviable economic superpower, but it has neglected the happiness of its people. Decrying the state of young people\u2019s existence in Korea, Yi Kwang-su, an early reformist intellectual, wrote in a 1918 essay, \u201cOn Child-Centrism,\u201d \u201cAs long as parents live, children have no freedom and are treated like slaves or livestock not unlike subjects of a feudal lord.\u201d Before South Korea can be seen as a model for the 21st century, it must end this age-old feudal system that passes for education and reflect on what the country\u2019s most vulnerable citizens might themselves want.

{"Headline": "Peter Hall, Who Devised the Enterprise Zone, Dies at 82", "Date": "2014-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPeter Hall, a British planner widely credited with developing the concept of enterprise zones to spur growth by reducing taxes and regulations in blighted urban areas, died on July 30 in London. He was 82.His death, at University College Hospital, was confirmed by University College London, where he was a professor in the school of planning. Professor Hall, a student of cities large and small, was an innovative planner who favored expansion of rail service and the creation of \u201cgarden cities\u201d \u2014 not suburbs but smaller cities, set amid small-scale agriculture, that he believed held particular promise. But he was best known for proposing enterprise zones to help cities so awash in poverty and empty of industry that they needed drastic assistance. In his view, government needed to eliminate taxes and regulations that made businesses difficult to start or drove them elsewhere. He was a socialist politically, but also a pragmatist. By the late 1970s he had begun working with officials close to the conservative prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, to create enterprise zones in several big cities in England. Appealing to small-government conservatives and liberals from stricken cities, the idea quickly crossed the Atlantic. In 1980, United States Representatives Jack Kemp, a Republican from Buffalo, and Robert Garcia, a Democrat from the Bronx, sponsored a bill that would reduce taxes for small businesses that located in struggling neighborhoods and hired people who lived in them. Ronald Reagan embraced the notion in his campaign for president that year.\u201cThose who view poverty and unemployment as permanent afflictions of our cities fail to understand how rapidly the poor can move up the ladder of success in our economy,\u201d Mr. Reagan said during the campaign. \u201cBut to move up the ladder, they must first get on it. And this is the concept behind the enterprise zones.\u201dEnterprise zones have had mixed success \u2014 they have not always created the jobs predicted \u2014 but politicians of various stripes continue to promote them. A recent Obama administration program in Kentucky has the support of Rand Paul, the conservative Republican senator considering a run for president.Peter Geoffrey Hall was born on March 19, 1932, in London. His family moved to Blackpool, a resort town on the western coast, after his father, a clerk in the pension service, was transferred there. He received a master\u2019s degree from the University of Cambridge in 1957 and completed his doctorate there two years later.Nearly half a century ago, with manufacturing declining and suburbs rising, he described the direction he believed urban life would eventually take: clusters of creative professionals dwelling among and reshaping the remnants of an industrial past.\u201cAll these people live only on their ideas,\u201d he wrote in \u201cThe World Cities\u201d in 1966. \u201cThe central business district therefore can be seen as a specialized machine for producing, processing and trading specialized intelligence. And the ideas industry is growing many times faster than industry as a whole.\u201d Professor Hall wrote several dozen books, including the forward-looking \u201cLondon 2000,\u201d published in 1963, and \u201cCities in Civilization: Culture, Technology and Urban Order,\u201d in 1998. His ideas for good planning and how it should be carried out evolved over his long career. Early on, he favored government control and no shortage of demolition to make way for highways, rail and other projects. He later came to believe that a blend of government oversight and private investment was the better course.Professor Hall also taught at the University of Reading, the London School of Economics and the University of California, Berkeley. In 2003 he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for being what she called a \u201cpioneer in the life of the nation.\u201dAlthough Mrs. Thatcher embraced several of Professor Hall\u2019s ideas \u2014 Canary Wharf, which has become one of London\u2019s major financial centers, had been one of his enterprise zones \u2014 he was not immune to her efforts to reduce government. He was a member of the South East Economic Planning Council until 1979, the year she shut it down.Advertisement"}

I play Words With Friends. Be that as it may, the book that\u2019s been most monopolizing my attentions is the massive chronicle by the conservative movement activist Craig Shirley on the campaign that elected our 40th president, \u201cRendezvous With Destiny: Ronald Reagan and the Campaign that Changed America.\u201d Also (though not a book; they\u2019re online) I\u2019ve been reading all the \u201cDoonesbury\u201d strips from the fall of 1976 through January of 1980, seriatim. I once heard that Anthony Trollope, after writing the last page of a novel, would immediately whip out a new sheet to start writing the next. I suppose that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing with these books I\u2019ve been writing on the history of conservatism \u2014 \u201cThe Invisible Bridge,\u201d which tells the story through the summer of 1976, is the third, and now I\u2019m starting in on the fourth and last, which goes through November 1980.What was the last truly great book you read?\u00a0A volume of Chekhov\u2019s short stories. I don\u2019t read many popular histories like the ones I write. The building blocks for my research are scholarly monographs, and the inspiration for my storytelling style are folks like Chekhov. His masterful long short story \u201cA Woman\u2019s Kingdom,\u201d about a forlorn heiress saddled against her will with the job of running the family business, precisely exemplifies what I\u2019m aiming to accomplish in my history writing: to sympathetically reimagine the points of view of people from all genders, ideologies and social identities.Who are the best historians writing today?I look to historians for their power to illuminate not just the invisible lineaments of the present, but also that which is not present. What are the roads that were not taken that most shape our own time? Lately, the historian who\u2019s been doing that best is Nelson Lichtenstein, who parlayed a career writing about midcentury capitalism and industrial unionism into extraordinarily penetrating accounts of why the economic regime we live under today is so deeply unsatisfying. One abandoned idea documented in his most recent book, \u201cA Contest of Ideas: Capital, Politics, and Labor,\u201d haunts me. Powerful people in the Democratic Party, like Senator Robert Wagner of New York, used to insist that the job of liberalism was to penetrate the \u201cblack box\u201d of the corporation and turn the workplace into a more democratic institution. They believed that to leave decision-making in the great firms that dominate our lives merely to owners (as opposed to, say, the system of \u201cco-determination\u201d between labor and management under which the German economy now thrives) was no less than a violation of the Constitution\u2019s 13th Amendment, which outlawed involuntary servitude. Now that such thinking is rare as a unicorn \u2014 and workers all but belong to their bosses during their working day \u2014 no wonder it\u2019s hard to win the allegiance of the white working class to the Democrats.And who today are the best writers on American politics?\u00a0There are two, and they both are bloggers. One, Corey Robin of Brooklyn College, is also a political theorist; his book \u201cThe Reactionary Mind: Conservatism From Edmund Burke to Sarah Palin\u201d provides the most convincing account about what right-wing habits of mind are ultimately all about. His humane and erudite blog \u2014 and its spirited commenters \u2014 deepen that conversation. A favorite theme is the emptiness of right-wing notions of \u201cfreedom\u201d that actually leave us less free. See, for instance, his work on \u201cLavatory and Liberty,\u201d\u00a0which points out that the government doesn\u2019t even enforce the right to bathroom breaks at work. What could be a greater insult to liberty than that?\u00a0My other favorite political writer, Heather Parton, blogs under the name \u201cDigby.\u201d Daily for over 10 years she\u2019s been unleashing a fire hose of brilliance on the fecklessness of the Democrats, the craziness of the Republicans and especially the way that what we now call the \u201cculture wars\u201d has been seared into our national DNA at least since the Civil War. In the acknowledgments to \u201cNixonland,\u201d I called her the other half of my brain.In researching your latest volume of history, which books were most useful to you? Any unexpected gems you came across during the process?\u00a0There\u2019s this lovable old curmudgeon who\u2019s been kicking around Washington Republican circles since the 1960s, Victor Gold \u2014 he was deputy press secretary for Barry Goldwater\u2019s presidential campaign \u2014 who published a marvelous behind-the-scenes account of the 1976 campaigns, \u201cPR as in President,\u201d that revealed the back-room mechanics of politics more revealingly than any book since Joe McGinniss\u2019s \u201cThe Selling of the President\u201d (1969). I don\u2019t think very many people read it \u2014 this I know because he reveals a secret about Ronald Reagan\u2019s performance at the Republican National Convention that year that even the most die-hard Reagan obsessives don\u2019t seem to know about, which let me end my book with a surprise kicker. (I could tell you what it is here, but that would be a spoiler.)On an entirely different note, I somehow stumbled on \u201cBare Feet, Iron Will: Stories From the Other Side of Vietnam\u2019s Battlefields,\u201d an obscure book by James G. Zumwalt, the son of none other than the admiral who commanded naval forces in Vietnam, Elmo (Bud) Zumwalt. It\u2019s a revelatory oral history of what everyday life was like on the North Vietnamese side of the war. He says he wrote it in the interests of helping American veterans heal, by humanizing the enemy, which may not work: It drives home better than any book I\u2019ve read why the war was such a futile, impossible waste. Both the North Vietnamese and the insurgents in the South simply believed themselves to the depths of their souls to be fighting for the very survival of their way of life. Every American bomb dropped on the North, and every village the U.S. \u201cpacified\u201d in the South, only made them more determined: We lost when we \u201cwon.\u201d It helped me shape a major theme of my own book: that America\u2019s blunt confrontation with the ravages Vietnam wrought upon America\u2019s civic soul, after the fall of Saigon in 1975, was a very healthy thing \u2014 and that the forces associated with Ronald Reagan\u2019s rise did our nation no favors by helping citizens turn their back on that reckoning.What kind of reader were you as a child?\u00a0A late reader. I picked up \u201cGo, Dog. Go!\u201d and started reading aloud from it when I was 6 or 7. Been working on catching up since then.If you had to name one book that made you who you are today, what would it be?It might just be \u201cThe Marxist Minstrels: A Handbook on Communist Subversion of Music\u201d (1974), by the fundamentalist minister David Noebel. Back when I was 16, when I should have been doing normal high school things, I availed myself of my brand new driver\u2019s license to spend as much time as possible in Milwaukee\u2019s Renaissance Book Shop, a tumbledown five-story warehouse that the city was finally able to close down in 2011 for safety reasons. It was my teenage paradise. There, I perused Black Panther manifestoes that spelled America with a \u201cKKK\u201d in the middle, and treatises like \u201cThe Marxist Ministrels,\u201d which argued that the Beatles were a Communist plot. (Dr. Noebel is still a fixture on the Tea Party circuit.) Inhaling texts like these \u2014 along with lots and lots of Renaissance Book Shop dust \u2014 first ignited my passion for studying America\u2019s culture wars.If you could require the president to read one book, what would it be?\u00a0The Book of Job, maybe. It\u2019s the best story I know at driving home the fact that the world just isn\u2019t always a reasonable place. Not grasping that, I think, is Barack Obama\u2019s tragic flaw: He still seems to stubbornly believe that if he just explains clearly and calmly enough to his friends across the aisle why his ideas will bring the greatest good to the greatest number, there\u2019ll finally be no more Red America and no more Blue America. But my 18 years studying conservatism has convinced me the right just doesn\u2019t work that way \u2014 they\u2019re fighting for civilization stakes, and he\u2019s a liberal, so, Q.E.D., he\u2019s the enemy. His longing to compromise with them just ends up driving the political center in America further to the right.Disappointing, overrated, just not good: What book did you feel you were supposed to like, and didn\u2019t? Do you remember the last book you put down without finishing?I have a weird habit \u2014 I\u2019m not proud of it \u2014 of putting down novels 50 pages or so before the end. I did it most recently with Sinclair Lewis\u2019s \u201cMain Street\u201d (though I made it all the way through the book he ripped off, Flaubert\u2019s \u201cMadame Bovary\u201d). I even did it with George Eliot\u2019s \u201cMiddlemarch\u201d \u2014 what\u2019s up with that? Perhaps a question for the psychoanalyst\u2019s couch.What\u2019s the one book you wish someone else would write?I used to think some history graduate student looking for a dissertation topic should do a biography of Robert Welch, the founder of the John Birch Society. Back then I thought of it as akin to studying some middling Romantic poet: worthy but slightly marginal. Now I think it\u2019s a project ripe for some top-shelf biographer\u2019s plucking. The Birch Society is thriving within the conservative \u201cmainstream\u201d \u2014 did you know, for instance, that the Muslim Brotherhood has thoroughly infiltrated the Obama White House? You can read all about it in National Review 50 years after its founder, William F. Buckley, purged Birchers and their crazy conspiracies from his pages in the 1960s.\u00a0Whom would you choose to write your life story?Is Anton Chekhov available? Sometimes I think he knows me better than I know myself, even when he\u2019s ostensibly writing about Russian ladies over a hundred years ago.What do you plan to read next?\u201cMad About the Seventies: The Best of the Decade,\u201d by \u201cthe Usual Gang of Idiots.\u201d The second half.

{"Headline": "Coal Leases Were Illegally Granted, an Indian Court Says ", "Date": "2014-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMUMBAI \u2014 India\u2019s top court on Monday ruled that coal fields allocated by the government between 1993 and 2009 were assigned illegally, a decision that could ultimately hinder the industry.The case stems from an incomplete investigation into the allotment of about 200 coal leases by the government to private steel, cement and power companies in India, which began after a report by India\u2019s federal auditor in 2012. The auditor concluded that the process was opaque and cost the government about $30 billion, a figure that has been contested.The accusations of irregularity in allocating coal fields, called \u201ccoalgate\u201d by the Indian media, have been particularly damaging to the former prime minister Manmohan Singh, who headed the coal ministry directly for part of the period under investigation. The former government, led by the Indian National Congress Party, was damaged by wide-ranging accusations of corruption and suffered a resounding defeat in the general election concluded in May.On Monday, a three-judge special bench led by the India\u2019s chief justice concurred with the federal auditor, saying the process had been marred by a lack of accountability and openness.\u201cThere was no fair and transparent procedure, all resulting in unfair distribution of the national wealth,\u201d said India\u2019s chief justice, Rajendra Mal Lodha. \u201cCommon good and public interest have, thus, suffered heavily.\u201dPiyush Goyal, the Indian coal and power minister, said that the decision brought clarity, which would be a \u201cbig plus for the Indian economy,\u201d Press Trust of India reported. \u201cI think in fact they should have been immensely pleased that the economy can now move forward rapidly rather than being cast with the shadow of uncertainty,\u201d he added.But an ultimate decision by the court to cancel the leases could paralyze India\u2019s already troubled coal production and prompt energy prices to rise. The court said that it would decide whether to remove the mining rights of coal blocks already assigned on Sept. 1.After the Monday ruling, shares of Hindalco Industries were down 10 percent in India\u2019s benchmark stock exchange. Analysts predicted that the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling next week would further damage steel, power and coal companies.On Monday, India\u2019s Central Bureau of Investigation said that it would close a related case against Kumar Mangalam Birla, an Indian industrialist, and P.C. Parakh, the former coal secretary, with no finding of wrongdoing.The agency filed the case last year in connection to a coal field allocated in 2005 to Hindalco Industries, a leading producer of primary aluminum in Asia. Mr. Birla, Mr. Parakh and other officials of Hindalco were charged with \u201ccriminal conspiracy\u201d and \u201ccriminal misconduct\u201d for irregularity in allocation.When the matter was filed, Mr. Singh, who was in charge of the coal ministry when the deal took place, said his decision to award the coal lease was \u201centirely appropriate.\u201d Hindalco denied any wrongdoing.Kanchan Prasad, a Central Bureau of Investigation spokeswoman, said a closure report on the case would be filed soon. Such a move, she said, meant that there was \u201cno criminality\u201d on the part of Mr. Birla and Mr. Parakh.Hari Kumar contributed reporting from New Delhi.Advertisement"}

The Cash home and a museum about the town\u2019s beginnings as a farming colony will open this weekend.DYESS, Ark. \u2014 Ruth Hawkins gestured to a white Chevy conversion van grinding to a stop on the gravel road outside the Johnny Cash Boyhood Home. Its plates were from New Mexico. \u201cThis goes on all day long,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople stop and have their pictures made by the fence.\u201dFor decades now, fans like Mr. Shrock have made pilgrimages to this collapsing town of 410 people in the Arkansas Delta, where jobs are scarce and buildings sink into the clay-filled gumbo soil. They come to visit the place that inspired such songs as \u201cPickin\u2019 Time\u201d and \u201cFive Feet High and Rising.\u201d Often, visitors would get an eyeful \u2014 and occasionally steal a handful \u2014 of the deteriorating clapboard house and then leave.Few learned anything about the history of Dyess as an experimental colony built by the Works Progress Administration for farmers during the Great Depression. Or the fact that the Cash family is part of that history. More distressing to those in Dyess, the visitors left with all their money in their pockets.That is because Dyess\u2019s economy, like its buildings, has been sinking for decades. It has no motel. The diner is closed. The theater was one of the buildings that collapsed into the restive soil. The half-empty general store, Bailey\u2019s, sells one memento, hats that read \u201cLifetime Fan of Johnny Cash.\u201dNow, more than a decade after Mr. Cash\u2019s death in 2003, the old house is being restored and its past brought back to life, a tribute to the singer\u2019s lasting influence. What that will mean for the town itself is much less clear.It is all a bit much for Dyess, which Mayor Larry Sims described as a \u201cnice, quiet town,\u201d while gazing out at the forlorn main drag. \u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201cthat\u2019ll change when this thing opens up.\u201dFor years, the town tried and failed to develop tourism. In 2009, Arkansas State got involved with the purchase of both structures.\u201cIf we can get 20,000 people here, we\u2019ll do real well,\u201d Mr. Sims said, noting that the admission fees alone would double the city\u2019s annual budget of $100,000.With Johnny Cash as the bait, visitors will begin the tour at the new museum, where they will get a history lesson of the 1934 colony, including a digital database of Dyess\u2019s first families.Mr. Cash\u2019s family was one of the original 500 to carve a living from the land, 16,000 acres obtained at low cost by the government because they were swampy and wild with trees and vines. The ground swelled when wet, then dried into cracks so wide and deep that mules would break their legs. Farmers cleared their own land, either 20- or 40-acre plots, which they had to begin paying for within a few seasons of their first planting.Johnny Cash was 3 when his family moved from Kingsland, Ark., to Dyess, the biggest of about 100 such colonies across the United States. Dyess peaked at about 3,000 residents in the late 1930s and included a hospital, a barber, beauty shops and a toy factory.When the Cashes saw their new home, they were so overcome that \u201cthe whole family sat down on the floor and cried,\u201d Ms. Hawkins said.Still, the structure was small and basic. There were two bedrooms for the family, which would grow to include seven children. Winter cold rushed up from the floorboards. There was no running water. Electricity came years later.Dyess was eventually incorporated, but the difficulty of farm life and the promise of higher wages elsewhere prompted many families to leave.The main event for tourists is likely to be the Cash home, painstakingly returned to its original look, down to the same type of battery-operated Silvertone radio that young Johnny pushed his ear against. Every item in the home was approved by Tommy and Joanne Cash.\u201cWe\u2019ve got everything just as it was,\u201d Joanne Cash, 76, said in a telephone interview from her home in Nashville. \u201cIt took a lot of hard work. It\u2019s been very emotional for me.\u201dThe most meaningful piece for her, she said, is the only one original to the Cash family, the piano. \u201cWe used to gather around that piano at night and sing gospel for an hour,\u201d Ms. Cash said. \u201cThat was our entertainment.\u201dWhile ticket sales would be a boon for Dyess, the real gain would come from tourists\u2019 spending money at independent businesses \u2014 if there were some. \u201cWe want them to spend money here, or we haven\u2019t really accomplished something for the city,\u201d Mr. Sims said.There has been talk of a restaurant; a bed-and-breakfast in an original colony house; and more tourist attractions, such as a reopened cannery. A gift shop is planned as part of a rebuilt theater, but that will not open until 2016 and will be owned by the university.No one has taken the plunge. And plenty of locals do not share the mayor\u2019s enthusiasm. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to do much for us,\u201d said Kandice Bailey, co-owner of the general store. \u201cThey kept telling us to support it because it\u2019s going to bring in money.\u201d But Ms. Bailey is skeptical that visitors on a tour would take time to walk around town.Mr. Sims ran up against those doubts when he proposed a 1 percent sales tax increase to clean abandoned properties in anticipation of more tourists. The measure failed twice.Nevertheless, the mayor is pushing forward. He found money, volunteers and donations to remake the gymnasium of the school, long closed, into a community center with a stage and used sound system. Mismatched plastic school chairs provide the seating. For an additional $15, tourists can take in a local band and eat local fare, which, by necessity, comes from the houses of locals.Mr. Sims ordered Cash T-shirts, hats, postcards and shot glasses \u2014 piled on dinged-up tables scattered across the floor \u2014 to sell to tourists.Already, a few busloads have rolled in. One with visitors from Norway was particularly quiet. But by the end of the night, the Norwegian fans were line dancing in front of the stage. A busload of visitors from Ireland is scheduled to come in September.Looking out at the community center, Mr. Sims said: \u201cIt\u2019d be nice to have padded chairs and nice tables. But right now, everyone seems happy with what we\u2019ve got.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New Reason to Question the Official Unemployment Rate", "Date": "2014-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Trouble With SurveysBut to call the people who compile the jobs report honest, nonpartisan civil servants is not to say that the jobs report is perfect. The report tries to estimate employment in a big country \u2013 and to do so quickly, to give policy makers, business executives and everyone else a sense of how the economy is performing. It\u2019s a tough task.And it has become tougher, because Americans are less willing to respond to surveys than they used to be.\u201cPeople are skeptical \u2013 Is this a real survey? What they are asking me?\u201d Francis Horvath, of the Labor Department, says.The response rate of the Labor Department\u2019s monthly jobs survey is far higher (about 89 percent) than that of a political poll, but it has also fallen (from 96 percent in the 1980s). Not surprisingly, the people who do not respond have different experiences in the job market than those who do.Over time, the kinds of answers that people give \u2014 or the kinds of people who respond \u2014 change. In later months as part of the survey panel, people who aren\u2019t working are less likely to report being available to work and having looked for a job in the previous four weeks, which is the definition for unemployment. The differences are big, too.The unemployment rate in the first half of 2014 among people in the first month of being interviewed was 7.5 percent. Among people in the final month of being interviewed, it was only 6.1 percent. Because the Labor Department weights later panelists \u2013 for whom there is historical data \u2013 more heavily, the official unemployment rate during this period was 6.5 percent.That number seems too low. The authors note that the higher jobless rate among early-month panelists correlates more strongly with some other economic indicators than the rate among later-month panelists.Of course, survey response rates have also been dropping over that same period. And there may indeed be an Obama effect here. The response rate to the unemployment survey fell noticeably in 2009, shortly after Mr. Obama took office, when the Tea Party was forming. Since then, it has continued falling more steeply than pre-2009. In the Obama era, some Americans simply trust the government less.Tea Party aside, the main factor is technology. It\u2019s a major cause of today\u2019s response-rate problems \u2013 but it\u2019s also the solution.For decades, survey research has revolved around the telephone, and it\u2019s worked very well. But Americans\u2019 relationship with their phones has radically changed. It\u2019s no surprise that survey research will have to as well.Maybe people in coming years will answer questions about their employment status (and political views) by text message on their iPhones \u2013 or through Google glasses. Or maybe they\u2019ll do so on their televisions, when they once would have been watching commercials.In the future, we are unlikely to live in a country in which information is scant. We are certain to live in one in which information is collected in different ways. The transition is under way, and the federal government is among those institutions that will need to adapt.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Abandon Libya", "Date": "2014-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 At a time when Libya urgently needs help from its allies, most countries, including the United States, are evacuating their embassies or drastically downsizing. Weeks of inter-militia fighting have killed hundreds in Tripoli and Benghazi while disrupting food, water and fuel supplies to civilians. While diplomatic security is understandably a top priority, representatives of the international community must not leave the country. Instead, they must maintain contact with Libya\u2019s major political actors \u2014 the Muslim Brotherhood and the National Forces Alliance, and the leaders of the warring militias from Misurata and Zintan \u2014 if they wish to mediate a solution to the conflict.The violence gripping Libya is due to a political struggle between groups that could broadly be characterized as Islamists and anti-Islamists. Since their collaboration in toppling Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in 2011, these factions have been squabbling over the spoils of victory, rendering Libya\u2019s economy and politics dysfunctional. To break the impasse, a renegade former general, Khalifa Hifter, launched a campaign in May vowing to eradicate Islamists from eastern Libya. He militarized the political divide by lumping together all Islamists, ranging from moderate to radical, and declared them his enemies. Most non-Islamists sided with General Hifter, thus signaling to the Islamists that they are all considered radicals who might face the same fate as their fellow Islamists in Egypt \u2014 to either be entirely marginalized from politics or exterminated. Facing this existential threat, Islamists have relied on their ongoing military advantage to ensure their survival. A full-scale battle broke out over control of Tripoli airport in mid-July. From the Islamists\u2019 perspective it had two main objectives: to obstruct the newly elected Parliament from meeting and carrying out its responsibilities, and to control the main roads to Tripoli and divert the movement of people and goods into the Islamist-run Maitiga airport. Both General Hifter and the Islamists believe they can win militarily. With both sides convinced of long-term victory, nothing has forced them to the negotiating table. This makes the role of the international community essential in mediating the conflict or it will drag on.As traditional efforts at tribal mediation have failed, the Libyan government \u2014 which is neutral, largely powerless and exercises no real control over the country \u2014 has formally called for international involvement. The foreign minister, Mohamed Abdulaziz, has asked in particular for \u201ctrainers\u201d to support the feeble Libyan security forces. This could be a first step but it is hardly sufficient. A combination of threats followed by limited international intervention and mediated negotiations is far more likely to succeed. This three-pronged approach should begin with a threat, issued by the United States and European countries, of a limited military intervention to force the warring sides to withdraw from the two major cities and cease firing upon civilians and installations; militias that disobey the order should be targeted with airstrikes. Second, the international community should deploy a peacekeeping force to protect civilians, government institutions and vital installations, such as water reservoirs, electricity grids and oil fields. Third, the United Nations must aggressively mediate negotiations to reach a grand political bargain. This would involve the formation of a national unity government and a mutually agreed-upon roadmap to disarm the militias, restart the economy, and allow the political transition process to continue, including the convening of the newly elected Parliament. These three steps would restore physical security and help create an environment conducive to a comprehensive national dialogue. Once the warring parties start negotiating, a committee that was elected in February could finally begin work on drafting a constitution.Despite the gravity of the situation, there is not much appetite in Western capitals for a military response to the current crisis in Libya. This reluctance is largely based on fears of anti-Western sentiments among Libyans, particularly heightened in light of the September 2012 attack on the United States mission in Benghazi. That perception is misguided. On the contrary, the Libyan people respect the United States for playing a major role in supporting Libyan independence in the 1940s, opposing Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s dictatorship for most of his reign, and assisting rebels during the 2011 revolution. Now, like then, the international community has a stake in Libya\u2019s future. The humanitarian disaster unfolding in the country could easily become a major problem for Europe, which has already seen a large influx of migrants who have crossed through Libya\u2019s vast, unmonitored territory. Moreover, a failed Libya dominated by extremist militias would constitute a security threat to the region and the West by becoming a sanctuary for terrorist organizations from which they could easily launch operations against targets around the world. Libyans have demonstrated little capacity to keep their transition from derailing; representatives of Western governments and international organizations must now demonstrate that closing diplomatic shop does not mean they are checking out.

{"Headline": "Large Dams Just Aren\u2019t Worth the Cost", "Date": "2014-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionTHAYER SCUDDER, the world\u2019s leading authority on the impact of dams on poor people, has changed his mind about dams. A frequent consultant on large dam projects, Mr. Scudder held out hope through most of his 58-year career that the poverty relief delivered by a properly constructed and managed dam would outweigh the social and environmental damage it caused. Now, at age 84, he has concluded that large dams not only aren\u2019t worth their cost, but that many currently under construction \u201cwill have disastrous environmental and socio-economic consequences,\u201d as he wrote in a recent email.Once cohesive and self-sufficient, the Tonga are troubled by intermittent hunger, rampant alcoholism and astronomical unemployment. Desperate for income, some have resorted to illegal drug cultivation and smuggling, elephant poaching, pimping and prostitution. Villagers still lack electricity.Mr. Scudder\u2019s most recent stint as a consultant, on the Nam Theun 2 Dam in Laos, delivered his final disappointment. He and two fellow advisers supported the project because it required the dam\u2019s funders to carry out programs that would leave people displaced by the dam in better shape than before the project started. But the dam was finished in 2010, and the programs\u2019 goals remain unmet. Meanwhile, the dam\u2019s three owners are considering turning over all responsibilities to the Laotian government \u2014 \u201ctoo soon,\u201d Mr. Scudder said in an interview. \u201cThe government wants to build 60 dams over the next 20 or 30 years, and at the moment it doesn\u2019t have the capacity to deal with environmental and social impacts for any single one of them. \u201cNam Theun 2 confirmed my longstanding suspicion that the task of building a large dam is just too complex and too damaging to priceless natural resources,\u201d he said. He now thinks his most significant accomplishment was not improving a dam, but stopping one: He led a 1992 study that helped prevent construction of a dam that would have harmed Botswana\u2019s Okavango Delta, one of the world\u2019s last great wetlands.The study\u2019s authors \u2014 three management scholars and a statistician \u2014 say planners are systematically biased toward excessive optimism, which dam promoters exploit with deception or blatant corruption. The study finds that actual dam expenses on average were nearly double pre-building estimates, and several times greater than overruns of other kinds of infrastructure construction, including roads, railroads, bridges and tunnels. On average, dam construction took 8.6 years, 44 percent longer than predicted \u2014 so much time, the authors say, that large dams are \u201cineffective in resolving urgent energy crises.\u201dDAMS typically consume large chunks of developing countries\u2019 financial resources, as dam planners underestimate the impact of inflation and currency depreciation. Many of the funds that support large dams arrive as loans to the host countries, and must eventually be paid off in hard currency. But most dam revenue comes from electricity sales in local currencies. When local currencies fall against the dollar, as often happens, the burden of those loans grows.One reason this dynamic has been overlooked is that earlier studies evaluated dams\u2019 economic performance by considering whether international lenders like the World Bank recovered their loans \u2014 and in most cases, they did. But the economic impact on host countries was often debilitating. Dam projects are so huge that beginning in the 1980s, dam overruns became major components of debt crises in Turkey, Brazil, Mexico and the former Yugoslavia. \u201cFor many countries, the national economy is so fragile that the debt from just one mega-dam can completely negatively affect the national economy,\u201d Mr. Flyvbjerg, the study\u2019s lead investigator, told me.To underline its point, the study singles out the massive Diamer-Bhasha Dam, now under construction in Pakistan across the Indus River. It is projected to cost $12.7 billion (in 2008 dollars) and finish construction by 2021. But the study suggests that it won\u2019t be completed until 2027, by which time it could cost $35 billion (again, in 2008 dollars) \u2014 a quarter of Pakistan\u2019s gross domestic product that year.Using the study\u2019s criteria, most of the world\u2019s planned mega-dams would be deemed cost-ineffective. That\u2019s unquestionably true of the gargantuan Inga complex of eight dams intended to span the Congo River \u2014 its first two projects have produced huge cost overruns \u2014 and Brazil\u2019s purported $14 billion Belo Monte Dam, which will replace a swath of Amazonian rain forest with the world\u2019s third-largest hydroelectric dam. Instead of building enormous, one-of-a-kind edifices like large dams, the study\u2019s authors recommend \u201cagile energy alternatives\u201d like wind, solar and mini-hydropower facilities. \u201cWe\u2019re stuck in a 1950s mode where everything was done in a very bespoke, manual way,\u201d Mr. Ansar said over the phone. \u201cWe need things that are more easily standardized, things that fit inside a container and can be easily transported.\u201dAll this runs directly contrary to the current international dam-building boom. Chinese, Brazilian and Indian construction companies are building hundreds of dams around the world, and the World Bank announced a year ago that it was reviving a moribund strategy to fund mega-dams. The biggest ones look so seductive, so dazzling, that it has taken us generations to notice: They\u2019re brute-force, Industrial Age artifacts that rarely deliver what they promise.

{"Headline": "One Court, Three Judges and Four States With Gay Marriage Cases", "Date": "2014-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCINCINNATI \u2014 The steady march of judicial approval for same-sex marriage over the past year ran into some skepticism here on Wednesday as a three-judge federal appeals panel heard arguments in six same-sex marriage cases from four states. Judge Jeffrey S. Sutton, one of the Bush appointees and a likely swing vote among the three, repeatedly asked why gay rights advocates wanted to use the courts to hasten an outcome they were gradually winning through elections and changes in attitude. \u201cI\u2019d have thought the best way to get respect and dignity is through the democratic process,\u201d he said, expressing a view that, in practice, would most likely deliver a victory to the states seeking to keep bans on same-sex marriage. As they debated the cases, all three judges and several lawyers referred repeatedly to the transformed legal landscape of the last year, in which more than two dozen lower courts and two appeals courts have ruled that gay couples have a right to marry, and to the expectation that the Supreme Court would soon hear the issue. Judge Sutton did suggest that the arguments offered against marriage equality were weak, saying that marriage bans would be hard to defend if subjected to the intense \u201cheightened scrutiny\u201d that courts apply when fundamental civil rights are at stake. But he also wondered whether legal precedents in the Sixth Circuit and the Supreme Court should prevent the panel from declaring same-sex marriage to be a fundamental right deserving court intervention. In often caustic questions, Judge Martha Craig Daughtrey, the Clinton appointee, left no doubt where she stood. When the lawyer for Michigan said that the courts should not tamper with an institution as deeply rooted as marriage, she replied that bans on interracial marriage were also deeply rooted before the Supreme Court found them unconstitutional. \u201cThat was the law across a huge swath of the Southern states,\u201d she said. The third judge, Deborah L. Cook, another Bush appointee, spoke little during the unusual proceeding in which one state\u2019s case followed another without any breaks. But she seemed to favor the right of states to ban same-sex marriage.If this court were to rule against same-sex marriage, it would create greater pressure on the Supreme Court to rule on the issue to clear up the contradictory decisions among appeals courts.The blitz of hearings here \u201cis a result of the avalanche of federal court decisions on marriage in the last year, all of them ruling the same way,\u201d said Susan Sommer, director of constitutional litigation for Lambda Legal, which helped to represent gay couples from Ohio who asked the state to recognize their marriages from other states and put both parents\u2019 names on birth certificates.Offering poignant images to the argument, three lesbian couples in the case, each with a newborn baby, sat in the courtroom gallery for much of the afternoon, their infants alternately cooing and feeding on bottles. Kentucky and Michigan asked the appeals panel to reverse District Court rulings striking down their bans on same-sex marriage, which were adopted by voters a decade ago. Ohio and Tennessee asked the panel to overrule decisions mandating them to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states. A core issue, lawyers representing the states said again and again, was whether the federal courts had a right to overrule the will of the people. \u201cWho gets to decide what the definition of marriage is?\u201d asked Aaron D. Lindstrom, solicitor general of Michigan.A second crucial issue in Wednesday\u2019s hearings and in courts across the country is whether same-sex marriage is simply an expansion of a well-established fundamental right to marry reflecting shifting social norms, and thus worthy of constitutional protection, or whether gay couples \u201cseek recognition of a new right,\u201d as Kentucky argued. The hearing here was the third time this year that a federal circuit court, the last stage of appeal below the Supreme Court, has considered whether gay couples had a constitutional right to marry. A number of lower courts have overturned state restrictions in the year since the Supreme Court overturned part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, saying it stigmatized gay families. The Tenth Circuit, in Denver, declared same-sex marriage bans in Utah and Oklahoma to be unconstitutional, and the Fourth Circuit, in Richmond, Va., overturned Virginia\u2019s ban. But implementation has been stayed pending appeals to the Supreme Court. This week, Utah and a county clerk in Oklahoma petitioned the Supreme Court for a hearing. More such appeals are expected, and many experts predict that the Supreme Court will accept one or more of these appeals this fall, for a decision in 2015. If the Cincinnati panel or another appeals court rules against same-sex marriage, resulting in a \u201ccircuit split,\u201d quick Supreme Court action would be virtually certain. Lawyers for the four states argued here that, in the words of Mr. Lindstrom of Michigan, \u201cit\u2019s too early to tell\u201d if there were risks to changing the definition of marriage as only between a man and a woman, which he called a bedrock of society. Noting that many states have now had experience with same-sex marriage, Judge Daughtrey replied: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like the sky has fallen.\u201d Offering a new variation in arguments against licensing same-sex marriage, Kentucky officials offered an economic rationale, saying that only heterosexual couples could procreate naturally and that procreation was essential for creating a strong economy, evidenced by reports that the declining birthrate in Europe had harmed economic growth. Asked by Judge Daughtrey to explain why barring gay men and lesbians from marrying served this state interest, Leigh Gross Latherow, a private lawyer hired by Kentucky, said that \u201csame-sex couples cannot procreate\u201d and that only heterosexual couples, \u201cwho can procreate and we believe do procreate,\u201d should receive the state-sponsored benefit of legal marriage. Continuing the season of appeals court hearings on marriage, Indiana and Wisconsin will argue to preserve their struck-down bans on Aug. 26 before the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago; and Idaho and Nevada will appeal their cases on Sept. 8 before the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco.

{"Headline": "Why the Middle Class Isn\u2019t Buying Talk About Economic Good Times", "Date": "2014-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor five years, the United States economy has been expanding at a steady clip, the stock market soaring, the headlines filled with talk of recovery. Yet public opinion polling shows most Americans still think the economy is pretty miserable.What might account for the paradox? New data from a research firm offers a simple, frustrating answer: Middle-class American families\u2019 income is lower now, when adjusted for inflation, than when the recovery began half a decade ago.The economic paradox isn\u2019t much of a paradox at all in this light: The purchasing power of the typical American family is 3.1 percent lower now than it was five years ago. No wonder people are unhappy about the economy! The benefits of rising levels of economic activity have simply not accrued to middle-income wage earners.Other measures of Americans\u2019 income that rely on averages paint a sunnier picture. For example, inflation-adjusted per-person disposable personal income is up 4.2 percent from mid-2009 to mid-2014. But averages like that can be distorted by strong income gains among the wealthiest, so looking at the median income can give a better sense of economic conditions faced by the majority of Americans. And by that measure, the gloomy news actually goes back even beyond the disappointing recovery of the last five years.Sentier\u2019s estimates of median household income, which are broadly consistent with the Census Bureau\u2019s annual estimates, remain lower than they were in January 2000, when the data series began. The middle-income American family is worse off, in other words, than it was 14 years ago.One more negative twist: The researchers broke down the shift in median income by type of family. And the steepest declines, with median income off 10.4 percent in the last five years, is in families with three or more children. It is large families that are seeing incomes fall off most sharply.But there is some good news, too. If you look not at the entire five years of the current expansion, but only the last three, there has been improvement. June 2014 household incomes were up 3.8 percent in inflation-adjusted terms from June 2011.\u201cThe recovery has been very slow,\u201d said Gordon W. Green, an author of the report and a former census official. \u201cIncome didn\u2019t start to turn around until the summer of 2011. The problem is that income dropped so sharply during the first two years that even though we started to rebound in the summer of 2011, by the time we get to the present, we\u2019re still not where we were when the recovery started. But it is encouraging that income has turned around.\u201dThe Census Bureau\u2019s data on median income is more reliable than Sentier\u2019s estimates, but it comes out once a year and with long delays (the 2013 number isn\u2019t due until next month). The researchers behind the new numbers crunch data in the bureau\u2019s Current Population Survey to arrive at an estimate of median income that is available monthly and with a much shorter delay.So for a sense of when incomes are starting to accelerate for ordinary Americans \u2014 and thus when the official recovery feels like a broadly shared recovery \u2014 keep an eye on their data.The Upshot: The Upshot presents news, analysis\nand graphics about politics\nand policy.\nnytimes.com/upshotAdvertisement"}

With his modest nature, Tom Scheerer often finds himself acting the role of bemused bystander in the opulent and self-promoting world of interior design. As a decorator, he has forged a career doing rooms that are relaxed to the point of being hard to categorize as decorated; this is the idea, an observation he would take as a high compliment. There is a Scheerer style, involving limed pecky cypress, Saarinen tables and Thonet bentwood chairs, but it is actually more of a philosophy than a style. \u201cElegance,\u201d he says, \u201cis really about economy.\u201dWhile this is not what every rich person looking to do up a house wants to hear, it\u2019s an important message in today\u2019s world of restaurant kitchens and million-dollar audio/visual installations. It\u2019s about celebrating real life, and remembering that the chicest thing of all, when you can have whatever you want, is to be yourself. A room by Scheerer is a magnificent, tailored and cheerful thing, but most important, a plain thing.Behind every great decorator there is a house that started it all, and Scheerer\u2019s family home on the ocean in East Hampton stands as a beacon of blue-blood gentility to this day. All the changes that have come to West End Road in the form of central air-conditioning and automatic gates have left the Scheerer house unchanged; a visit there is an education in what American chic used to be. (The first thing you see is a Ping-Pong table in the front hall.) Scheerer\u2019s grandfather bought the house, which had been built by the sportswriter Ring Lardner, for about $20,000 in 1945; his mother, Idoline, still fills its nine bedrooms with family every weekend in the summer, and Tom usually cooks for everyone. Asked if this weathered and unpretentious masterpiece of Old East Hampton, to which nothing has been done in decades, was the house that taught him about houses, he confirms that it is. He also confirms that he added the chic and suspiciously hip rattan rug we are standing on.Scheerer has never worked for another designer, let alone a famous one. His mentors have come to him through books like those by Billy Baldwin and David Hicks \u2014 and by looking. Despite growing up in some very stylish, if laid-back, environments, like any cosmopolitan soul he has made a point of seeing what else is out there. Surprisingly, two of his favorite apartments are conspicuous and glittering gems of 1980s New York. \u201cThe Gutfreund apartment is pretty fantastic,\u201d he says, referring to Henri Samuel\u2019s swan song at 834 Fifth Avenue. \u201cBut the best apartment I ever saw was Joan and Lewis Lapham\u2019s, full of Kent furniture and paintings by Francis Bacon.\u201dTo any prospective clients looking for a home that mirrors themselves, Scheerer has some words of advice: \u201cLook at a floor plan of a David Adler house and compare it to a fancy house today \u2014 there\u2019s such a discrepancy.\u201d The lesson is one for decorators and clients alike: don\u2019t build so big; don\u2019t mistake complication for quality; and don\u2019t try so hard.While the book will undoubtedly cement Scheerer\u2019s reputation as one of the true American greats, he\u2019s taking it in stride. \u201cI don\u2019t worry too much about the competition, or what else is going on,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m a soft-sell person. I\u2019ve probably had two projects in my life with budgets of more than $1.5 million.\u201d But every few years, he adds,\u201dsomebody interesting comes along, and if you do a good job, you end up working with the same people forever.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Print Is Down, and Now Out", "Date": "2014-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Media EquationA year ago last week, it seemed as if print newspapers might be on the verge of a comeback, or at least on the brink of, well, survival. Turns out, not so much \u2014 quite the opposite, really. The Washington Post seems fine, but recently, in just over a week, three of the biggest players in American newspapers \u2014 Gannett, Tribune Company and E. W. Scripps, companies built on print franchises that expanded into television \u2014 dumped those properties like yesterday\u2019s news in a series of spinoffs. The recent flurry of divestitures scanned as one of those movies about global warming where icebergs calve huge chunks into churning waters. The persistent financial demands of Wall Street have trumped the informational needs of Main Street. For decades, investors wanted newspaper companies to become bigger and diversify, so they bought more newspapers and developed television divisions. Now print is too much of a drag on earnings, so media companies are dividing back up and print is being kicked to the curb.Setting aside the brave rhetoric \u2014 as one should \u2014 about the opportunity for a \u201crenewed focus on print,\u201d those stand-alone print companies are sailing into very tall waves. Even strong national newspapers like The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times are struggling to meet Wall Street\u2019s demands for growth; the regional newspapers that make up most of the now-independent publishing divisions have a much grimmer outlook. The people at the magazine business Time Inc. were not so lucky, burdened with $1.3 billion in debt when Time Warner threw them from the boat. Swim for your life, executives at the company seemed to be saying, and by the by, here\u2019s an anchor to help you on your way.No debt was built into the arrangement, but the broadcast division hung onto two lucrative digital sites, CareerBuilder.com and Cars.com. In the main, it\u2019s been like one big, long episode of \u201cDivorce Court,\u201d with various petitioners showing up and citing irreconcilable differences with their print partners. It\u2019s not that television is such a spectacular business \u2014 there are plenty of challenges on that front \u2014 but newspapers and magazines are clearly going to be smaller, less ambitious businesses and journalistic enterprises regardless of how carefully they are operated.Even if the writing has been on the wall for some time, let\u2019s play a bit of sad trombone for the loss of reporting horsepower that will accompany the spinoffs. Newspapers will be working without a net as undiversified pure-play print companies. Most are being cut loose after all the low-hanging fruit, like valuable digital properties, have been plucked. Many newspapers have sold their real estate, where much of their remaining value was stored. More ominous, most of the print and magazine assets have already been cut to the bone in terms of staffing. Reducing costs has been the only reliable source of profits as overall revenue has declined. Not much is left to trim. The Tribune Company, which is to be run by Jack Griffin, who had a short, unsuccessful stint overseeing the pre-spin Time Inc., has cut $250 million in costs since 2011, according to the media analyst Ken Doctor. Businesses have to either peddle a growth story \u2014 a tough sell for any print enterprise \u2014 or produce a reliable cash flow that reaps dividends for shareholders. Gannett has eliminated more than a third of its employees since 2005.And with ads declining at a steep rate, newspapers (and magazines) are trying to turn toward readers for digital revenue at the same time that they have denuded their products of much of their value. It\u2019s a little like trashing a house by burning all the furniture to stay warm and then inviting people in to see if they want to buy the joint. If this is the future \u2014 attention news shoppers, Hormel Chili is on sale in Aisle 5 \u2014 what is underway may be a kind of mercy killing. So whose fault is it? No one\u2019s. Nothing is wrong in a fundamental sense: A free-market economy is moving to reallocate capital to its more productive uses, which happens all the time. Ask Kodak. Or Blockbuster. Or the makers of personal computers. Just because the product being manufactured is news in print does not make it sacrosanct or immune to the natural order. It\u2019s a measure of the basic problem that many people haven\u2019t cared or noticed as their hometown newspapers have reduced staffing, days of circulation, delivery and coverage.Will they notice or care when those newspapers go away altogether? I\u2019m not optimistic about that. Email: carr@nytimes.com; Twitter:\u00a0 @carr2nAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Germany Puts Curbing Russia Ahead of Commerce", "Date": "2014-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMemo From GermanyBERLIN \u2014 Over recent months, something significant has happened in Europe: In the crisis over Ukraine, Germany has assumed leadership not just in its familiar fashion of trying to coax Russia away from belligerence and bluster, but also in standing firm and imposing sanctions on Moscow even if they hurt German business.Perhaps even more remarkable is that Germans, long anxious to preserve commercial, energy and cultural ties with their vast eastern neighbor, have gone along. Seventy percent of 1,003 adults polled last week by Infratest dimap for the public broadcaster ARD approved of stricter sanctions; just 15 percent viewed Russia as a reliable partner in a poll with a three-percentage-point margin of sampling error.In marked contrast to France\u2019s leadership, Chancellor Angela Merkel and her government \u2014 a united \u201cgrand coalition\u201d of center-right and center-left \u2014 have kept German businesses apprised of any shift in thinking and made it clear throughout that tougher sanctions would be imposed if Russia fell further out of line.The political upheaval over Ukraine has already affected Germany\u2019s economy, slowing down growth and throwing into question the country\u2019s ability to sustain its long record of robust performance even amid anemic recovery elsewhere in the European Union, economists said. The sanctions that would restrict trade between the countries are likely to cause further damage.But the shocking downing of a Malaysian passenger airliner over eastern Ukraine in July hardened many Germans\u2019 resolve and, with Germany leading, led to even tougher European sanctions on Moscow. Now, as Russia sends a huge convoy it says is delivering aid to beleaguered eastern Ukraine, Berlin is firmly warning Moscow not to exploit the column of trucks for military use or proceed without Ukrainian agreement, and telling Ukraine to show restraint and not worsen the plight of trapped civilians.Appeals to reason have long been a hallmark of German policy. But, even if still couched in caution, there is a clear determination to show Russia that there can be no return to business as usual, even among German businesspeople who have spent years cultivating ties and profits there.The support comes from surprising quarters. Eckhard Cordes, chairman of the Committee on Eastern European Economic Relations, founded in 1952 to promote business with what was then the Soviet bloc, noted that Moscow\u2019s retaliation last week for the latest European sanctions would only sharpen the negative trends in business with Russia, and that his group warned early on of the dangers of sliding into tit-for-tat sanctions. But he stopped well short of objecting to the Western measures or repeating warnings of past months about the danger of losing hundreds of thousands of jobs by shutting down the ties of 7,000 German companies doing business in Russia.Gernot Erler, a lifelong Social Democrat, former deputy foreign minister and now commissioner for Russia and former Soviet states, a government position in the German Parliament, first visited Moscow in 1965 and has spent decades promoting the Ostpolitik of reconciliation with the East. Now, he is bitingly critical of Russia and its leader.\u201cThe policy of Vladimir Putin is destroying reserves of trust with breathtaking speed,\u201d Mr. Erler said in an email. \u201cRussia is not naming its goals and has suddenly become unpredictable. And being unpredictable is the greatest enemy of partnership. Restoring trust will take time.\u201dGovernment officials, speaking privately, use the word tragic to describe what they see as President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s rupture of decades of careful d\u00e9tente. The lament is echoed by businesspeople dealing with a country that seemed eager to look West and to have forgiven the Germans for the Nazi crimes and immense bloodshed of World War II.\u201cThe trust we built up together and mutually in the last 15 to 20 years \u2014 not just in trade, but in school and sports exchanges, I myself did a lot here \u2014 has been shaken,\u201d said Ralf Meyer, 50, a logistics manager who has worked with Russia since 1993 and has run his own company exporting air-conditioning and other climate control systems since 2006. \u201cParents are afraid to send their children to Russia to play matches. Much capital has flowed out of Russia that had already been sent in for specific investments. Projects have been delayed or canceled. Banks, whether giving lines of credit or bridging finance, delay answers.\u201dMap of European energy imports that come from Russia.Mr. Meyer estimates that 1,900 people, mostly in Russia, depend on his company and associated contracting, fitting, repair work and transportation. Yet he does not fault the German government.Ms. Merkel, of the center-right Christian Democrats, and Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, a Social Democrat, have managed the situation well, said Mr. Meyer, whose company is based near Hamburg. \u201cI have faith in our government that it makes the right decisions for business,\u201d he said, despite his disappointment \u201cthat we sometimes orient ourselves too close to what America wants,\u201d even as the United States has \u201cmade some big mistakes in East European policy.\u201d\u201cThese sanctions are not the right way to get into a better situation with Russia. One must sit down and listen to what Russia wants,\u201d he said, adding that he did not think Russia would invade Eastern Ukraine.Many German businesspeople fret that ties might never be fully restored. Small and medium-size businesses \u2014 the backbone of Germany\u2019s export-driven economy \u2014 are calling the Association of German Machine Builders to express their fear that Russian partners will turn to the Asian competition, maybe permanently, said Monika Hollacher, a Russia expert at the association. For association members, trade with Russia dropped 20 percent from January through May compared with the same period in 2013, she said, when association members exported 7.8 billion euros (more than $10 billion) in goods to Russia.If Germany\u2019s economy stalls further as a result of lost business with Russia and general uncertainty in a war-torn world, then it may drag down what the European Central Bank\u2019s president, Mario Draghi, warned last week was a still faltering recovery across Europe.There are signs that differences over dealing with Russia may exacerbate tensions within the European Union, which with Germany at its helm has maintained formal unity among 28 member nations with very different agendas and interests.In part, that is because Russia is seen here as Germany\u2019s near neighbor, and the two are bound by centuries of warring and trading \u2014 as well as by repeated intermarriage of German nobility with Russian czars \u2014 that have forged a relationship closer than the Kremlin has, or had, with any other foreign power.These ties continue. When Germany\u2019s triumphant World Cup soccer team returned to Berlin for a victory parade attended by hundreds of thousands, they were serenaded by a Russian-born German pop star, Helene Fischer. The largest minority in Germany, estimated at 3.5 million, is Russian speaking \u2014 many, like Ms. Fischer, descendants of ethnic Germans who went to Russia centuries ago and have returned, along with Russian-born Jews and others who settled in Germany in the past 20 years.To a degree unknown in the United States or even farther west in Europe, Russia is familiar. This has perhaps stiffened Germany\u2019s resolve now that Russia has suddenly become, as Mr. Erler noted, unpredictable. Germans dislike the unexpected and have spent months rallying a determination not to let Mr. Putin\u2019s actions stand.\u201cI am sobered that in Europe, 25 years after the Cold War, we have still not advanced to the point where we can deal in a different way with unavoidable differences of opinion,\u201d Mr. Steinmeier, the foreign minister, was quoted as saying to the weekly newspaper Die Zeit in a wide-ranging interview in April that reflected the hardening view in Berlin. Seventy years after World War II, he added, \u201cwe confront in just a few short weeks a policy that changes borders by force. That cannot become the norm, either in Europe, or the world.\u201dBesides, he said, \u201cthe hollowing out of the principle of territorial inviolability could, in the end, be most dangerous of all to the multination state of Russia.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Corsica\u2019s Separatist Retreat", "Date": "2014-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAJACCIO, Corsica \u2014 In June, Corsica\u2019s most active separatist group, the National Liberation Front, or FLNC, declared an end to its decades-long armed resistance against the French mainland. For many, its communiqu\u00e9 outlining \u201ca process of demilitarization\u201d and \u201cprogressive exit from clandestine activities\u201d was a surprising reversal.Since the establishment of the FLNC in 1976, there have been over 10,000 terrorist operations on the island. The FLNC and other separatist groups claimed responsibility for about half of these (most of which targeted the homes of non-Corsicans); the FLNC has also been implicated in some 40 assassinations.But despite what the separatists would like to believe, only a tiny minority of locals support independence. Weakened over the years, the FLNC now consists of a handful of activists. Most Corsicans are disgusted with the decades of bloody fighting over disbursements by the French government aimed at buying peace, and \u201cpatriotic\u201d taxes imposed by separatists on local businesses.When snitches are killed, a code of silence, or omert\u00e0, ensures that culprits are rarely brought to justice. In the most egregious case, omert\u00e0 enabled the separatist Yvan Colonna, who in 1998 brutally murdered the prefect Claude Erignac, Paris\u2019s most senior representative in Corsica, to hide on the island for four years before being arrested.Corsicans also resent that, over the years, many separatists abandoned their lofty ideals and turned to organized crime. Many are making fortunes blackmailing local mayors for permits to build condominiums on pristine shores, or getting involved in casinos or foreign drug deals. These mafiosi, who are responsible for hundreds of murders on the island, are today\u2019s real Corsican curse.But Corsican Assembly members on the right and left who backed the demands know they will never become law. The Assembly has no legislative powers. Its resolutions must be approved by the French National Assembly, and can often only become legally binding through constitutional modifications (for which there must be a three-fifths majority in both houses of the legislature).A Corsican senator and vocal adversary of separatism, Nicolas Alfonsi, declared the resolutions \u201ca dead end\u201d as \u201cthe government will not submit a constitutional revision to Parliament.\u201d Some see the Corsican Assembly\u2019s approval of the statutes as a purely cynical attempt by the island\u2019s traditional parties, which are staunchly opposed to independence, to win separatist votes ahead of regional elections in December 2015.France, which conquered Corsica in 1769, never treated it as a colony. Napoleon, born the same year in Ajaccio, the island\u2019s capital, remains a national hero. Many Corsicans are prominent establishment figures. Charles Pasqua was interior minister in two administrations; Bernard Squarcini headed France\u2019s domestic intelligence service under President Nicolas Sarkozy. Jean-Marie Colombani ran the daily newspaper Le Monde from 1994 to 2007; Nonce Paolini chairs TF1, France\u2019s largest private television network.In Ajaccio in June, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve conveyed Paris\u2019s disapproval. A desire to \u201cpreserve a special identity must not set out a path toward breakup,\u201d he said.The same could be said of the majority of Corsica\u2019s 300,000 inhabitants. The island\u2019s relatively weak economy has long been dependent on generous financial support from Paris, including tax breaks and subsidies for transportation to and from the mainland; about 30 percent of Corsicans are civil servants.The FLNC\u2019s carefully worded communiqu\u00e9 does not preclude an eventual resumption of shooting and bombing. This would not be without precedent: In past decades, several solemnly proclaimed truces have dissolved in bloodshed. But in the end the FLNC had no alternative to retreating. It may claim it has won an ideological battle, but the FLNC has lost the war: Corsica wants to stay French.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why a Rule on Loan Losses Could Squeeze Credit", "Date": "2014-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHigh & Low FinanceNo bank loses money on every loan, at least not if it is going to stay in business.But the world\u2019s accounting rule makers have decided that banks should immediately post a loss every time they make a loan on the theory that some percentage of loans will inevitably go bad.Requiring an immediate reporting of losses, long before a borrower has missed even one payment deadline, \u201ccould have serious unintended consequences,\u201d one accounting expert warned two years ago. A bank facing a difficult quarter, and needing to do whatever it could to keep from further depressing earnings, could simply decide to stop making loans, at least until the quarter had passed. That, said Hans Hoogervorst, the chairman of the International Accounting Standards Board, \u201cwould be a very easy way for banks to boost their profits.\u201dBut while profits would look better, the economy could suffer. The rule could reduce the availability of credit just when a troubled economy might be most in need of financing to help promote a recovery.Notwithstanding such concerns, Mr. Hoogervorst and other members of the international board voted last month to require such reporting of losses beginning in 2018. The board\u2019s rules apply to some extent in more than 100 countries but are subject to ratification by various national or regional groups and thus could be delayed or modified in some places.This week I contacted Mr. Hoogervorst to ask if he still feared such consequences. He was traveling in Laos, but he responded by email to say he did.The new rule his board adopted, he said, was \u201ca practical expedient\u201d because a preferable alternative \u2014 one that would have avoided taking such losses immediately while still informing investors about losses that the banks expected over the lives of the loans \u2014 \u201cwas considered operationally too challenging by the banks.\u201dAnd, he added, the rule his board adopted was likely to produce far fewer adverse consequences than one expected to be adopted soon in the United States by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. What\u2019s going on here? How did we come up with rules that will produce results that seem to be absurd but that have been backed by many investors and regulators?The answers stem from the financial crisis, from the reality that similar rules can be applied differently in various countries, and from the fact that the rules are being changed with a specific result in mind: to make banks show more loan loss reserves in their financial statements.Under the current accounting rules, which date from the 1970s, most loans are carried on bank balance sheets as being worth the amount owed. But when it is reasonable to conclude that a loss has been incurred, the loans are to be written down to reflect that loss. In accounting jargon, that is called an \u201cincurred loss\u201d model.There were many complaints during and after the financial crisis that loans should have been written down well before they were, and pressure built to substitute an \u201cexpected loss\u201d model. What that would mean in practice is that when a bank made, say, $100 million in a certain type of loan, like auto loans, it would know from history that it was most likely to lose $2 million as some of those loans defaulted. Of course, it would not know which loans would go bad.Under the rule expected to be adopted in the United States, a bank that made those $100 million in loans on Dec. 31 would take an immediate loss of $2 million to reflect those expected losses. Because the loans would produce no income that year, the result would be that the bank\u2019s pretax profit for that year would be $2 million lower than it would have been had it not made the loans or had it delayed them until Jan. 1.Then, each quarter, the bank would estimate the lifetime losses from those loans. If the expected loss figure is higher than the previous estimate, the bank will have to take a loss. If the expected loss figure has declined, it will be able to report a profit.If the loans were riskier \u2014 say the bank expected $5 million in lifetime losses when it made the loans \u2014 then the initial loss would also be higher.Presumably, of course, the higher expected losses would be offset by a higher interest rate charged by the bank. But while the interest income would add to profits over the life of the loan, the initial loss would reduce profits more when the loan was made.There is an alternative that both boards considered. The bank would estimate the lifetime losses, but it would take no initial loss when the loans were made. Instead, some of the interest received would be put into a reserve for later defaults. Two of the seven members of the American board voted for that alternative, and Mr. Hoogervorst also favored it. But the banks complained that it would be too complex, and some worried that the capital losses might come before there was enough interest income set aside to offset them. So the boards dropped that idea, and unless one or both boards reverses course, loans will show losses on bank books as soon as they are made.The international rule is far less stringent than the one expected in the United States. Under it, the bank would estimate how much it was likely to lose in the first 12 months that the loans were outstanding \u2014 perhaps $500,000 in the $100 million example \u2014 and it would take a loss equal to that amount when the loans were made. After that year, it could evaluate the loans to determine whether they had deteriorated and take additional losses as required.For a time, the American board was willing to accept that. But screams of protest came from bank regulators, among others, who feared that some banks in the United States already had reserves as large or larger than the new rule would require. So the decision was made to adopt the harsher initial write-off. Mr. Hoogervorst told me the American approach \u201cwould have had severe unintended consequences in many parts of the world, where loans tend to have much longer terms than in the United States and, accordingly, much higher Day 1 losses if based on lifetime expected losses.\u201dThat comment and the reaction of American bank regulators underlines a reality of accounting rule-setting that the boards are generally not eager to admit: Rules are sometimes changed to produce the desired results. It is widely believed that loan loss reserves at United States banks are larger, relative to the actual likely loan losses, than are reserves at many European banks. American regulators feared a change that would reduce those reserves, while Europeans feared much higher loss reserves could make their banks look unacceptably weak.In a sense, we\u2019ve been here before. What is different now from the late 1990s is that officials are less concerned about earnings management than they are about bank survival if another financial crisis develops.In 1998, Arthur Levitt, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, warned that companies were using \u201ccookie-cutter reserves\u201d to hold down profits in good times and then using those reserves to avoid bad news when business faltered. A couple of months after his remarks, the S.E.C. forced SunTrust, a Florida bank, to reduce its loan loss provisions by $100 million. The suspicion was that banks used their estimates of incurred losses to manage their earnings, not to reflect reality. Bankers say they responded by making certain that they used consistent methods of making the estimates to avoid accusations of earnings manipulation.Of course, if it was possible to play games with estimates of losses that have already been incurred, it is far more possible to play games if the figure being estimated is the expected loss over the life of the loan. Walter P. Schuetze, who was a member of FASB when the current rule was written and who later served as chief accountant of the S.E.C., has denounced both the new international rule and the expected American one for allowing banks to use arbitrary estimates that cannot be effectively audited.Mr. Schuetze would prefer a rule that required banks to carry the loans on their books at market value \u2014 the amount another bank would pay to buy them \u2014 and require banks to hire independent experts to confirm that the estimates of market value are reasonable. In an interview, he said there was little support for his proposal among current rule makers.As a result, within a few years, banks will be reporting losses as soon as loans are made. An advantage for investors will be that when banks conclude their previous estimates of lifetime losses were too optimistic \u2014 or too pessimistic \u2014 the changes will be obvious to all. A disadvantage may be that banks will be able to manipulate earnings simply by making more or fewer loans. Advertisement"}

I was flattered. Until I opened the page. \u201cSince 2008, Jacobs has written over 400 articles, the vast majority of which portray China in a negative light,\u201d read the entry, which went on to claim that many of those articles contained \u201cjournalistic distortions.\u201d A sympathetic friend edited the page, removing the assertion that I am devoted to smearing China\u2019s good name. The very next day, the anonymous creator changed it back. The editing war, as such tussles are called, went on for months until Wikipedia put a stop to it.These are challenging days for foreigners in China, who in the past year or so have increasingly found themselves caught up in a war of words that paint Westerners as conscripts in the army of \u201chostile foreign forces\u201d seeking to thwart China\u2019s rise. Multinational companies have also been placed in the cross hairs, especially iconic American brands that have been accused of charging too much (Starbucks), serving tainted meat (McDonald\u2019s) or behaving like a monopoly (Microsoft). Although there is no proof that the Chinese government was behind my Wikipedia page, the Communist Party is known to employ vast numbers of freelance propagandists who \u201cguide public opinion\u201d through social media or in the online comment sections of articles. Earlier this month, the advocacy group Free Tibet uncovered about 100 bogus Twitter accounts that used purloined photos of white people to tweet syrupy stories about contented Tibetans \u2014 ignoring the reality of those who are self-immolating to protest Beijing\u2019s hard-line policies. In newspaper columns, retired military officers portray the United States as an unrelenting nemesis of the Chinese people. Such threats are deconstructed and amplified in internal party documents, which warn of the dangerous influences seeping into China from abroad. Although journalists are near the top of the list, liberal Chinese scholars, Hong Kong democracy advocates and bloggers who seek to expose government malfeasance have been maligned as ideological foes, part of the Communist Party\u2019s broad-based battle against those it believes are seeking to upend its six-decade hold on power. Government-fanned xenophobia is nothing new in China. Mao Zedong took the demonization of all things foreign to destructive heights, beginning with the anti-rightist campaigns of the 1950s, which sought to purge society of \u201cbourgeois\u201d Western influences, and culminating in the disastrous Cultural Revolution of 1966-76, during which anyone with a predilection for James Joyce, Mozart or Monet was condemned as an enemy of the people. But since the 1980s, when the pragmatic Deng Xiaoping urged his people to learn from the West in an effort to tackle endemic poverty, Chinese leaders have largely set aside the ideological cudgels. In the decades that followed, Adam Smith-style market economics turned former factory workers into millionaires, and it was China\u2019s erstwhile foe, the United States, that smoothed the way for Beijing\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization. In the meantime, hundreds of thousands of young Chinese, including the progeny of China\u2019s revolutionary elite, flocked to American universities, often on full scholarships. Such paranoia is not entirely unfounded. The United States has long been committed to exporting liberal democracy, and President Obama\u2019s \u201cpivot to Asia\u201d \u2014 shifting military resources from the Middle East to the Asia-Pacific region \u2014 has been rightly perceived by Beijing as an effort to counter its increasingly aggressive territorial claims in the South and East China Seas. But Chen Jian, an expert at Cornell University on American-Chinese relations, says the mounting anti-Western invective is largely a tactic aimed at shifting attention from the potential repercussions of a slowing economy, the glaring gap between rich and poor and the jaw-dropping accounts of official corruption that have become daily fare here. \u201cThere is a profound sense of vulnerability within the party, even a sense of crisis,\u201d said Professor Chen, who experienced the excesses of the Cultural Revolution as an adolescent in China. Yet Professor Chen and other analysts say the \u201chostile foreign forces\u201d narrative is likely to have little impact on the generation of young Chinese weaned on Kobe Bryant and illegal downloads of \u201cSeinfeld.\u201d \u201cJust look at all the students who want to study in the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think these anti-American messages are convincing anyone.\u201dPerhaps, but it doesn\u2019t make life any easier for foreigners living in China, especially journalists, who have endured growing hostility from the authorities. Visas have been denied, the website of The New York Times has been blocked for nearly two years, and even Chinese friends who have studied abroad remain convinced that the Western media is on a mission to harm their country through unflattering coverage. The government\u2019s anti-Western narrative does not always fall on deaf ears. Last spring, a Chinese friend invited me to join his family for the Lunar New Year holiday. I gladly accepted, but then came the bad news. His mother, a doctor, said it would be better if I didn\u2019t come. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d my friend said, \u201cbut she is convinced all foreign journalists are spies.\u201d A correspondent in China for The New York Times.

They are willing to identify and pay for such benefits as reduced pollution, reduced congestion and better safety. A result is stable plans, reliable funding and responsible management.Not all public transportation proposals, including high-speed rail, yield enough public and financial benefits to justify the cost. For those that do, however, the country needs a better approach to identifying all impacts and deciding what the public and private roles should be.The approach must include a stable and adequate source of funding from public authorities involved at all levels; ad hoc approaches will not work to generate large and multiyear investment projects.This is, by the way, just as true for the proposed \u201cprivate sector\u201d high-speed rail projects in Florida and Texas as it is for the Northeast Corridor and California. When projects have manifest public benefits and costs, there is always a public role. The question is whether public authorities actively do their planning and maximize public values or begin with what they are promised initially and play catch-up later in the project.The writer is chairman of the Peer Review Group for the California High-Speed Rail Project.To the Editor:I agree that America needs to initiate more high-speed rail projects, but I also think that all of our major cities need to have model rail transit systems. Transit systems improve the quality of life if workers can get to and from their jobs expediently and thus have more time for family and friends.Oil supplies are limited; it seems incredibly selfish that we would choose not to take measures to extend their availability and instead drive our gas guzzlers at the expense of our grandchildren.If we can reduce demand for oil by adding more high-speed rail and transit systems, fuel prices should drop, and the savings can be used to support these transit projects over the long run.If we do nothing, as in the past, we are going to reach a point where our oil resources become increasingly limited and the high cost of fuel will hurt our economy. Doing nothing is not the answer.To the Editor:Amtrak is a disgrace. Acela trains aside, the Northeast Corridor trains I\u2019ve been on seem way past their prime. Cars are dimly lighted, and an overwhelming effluvium emanates from the bathrooms.In my experience, the trains rarely leave on time and never arrive on time. I need not go into the indignities of entering or departing from Penn Station in New York. And yet the trains are packed; clearly, the public wants to travel by rail.Advertisement"}

Picture an updated \u201cNorma Rae\u201d in which the hero isn\u2019t an oppressed factory worker but a desperate factory owner battling scheming relatives, callous Wall Street bankers and ruthless Chinese competitors \u2014 all to save his workers\u2019 jobs and his family\u2019s bricks-and-mortar legacy, a furniture business in a speck of a town in south central Virginia. Who would play the black sheep turned white knight, John D. Bassett III? George Clooney or Tom Hanks? How about \u00adMeryl Streep or Blythe Danner as the family matriarch, Pocahontas Hundley Bassett, a.k.a. Miss Pokey? And what tough-\u00adtalking star \u2014 Ted Danson, perhaps? \u2014 would take on the role of the devious brother-in-law, Bob Spilman, who, by Macy\u2019s account, snatched control of the family business away from the rightful heir, the aforementioned \u201cJBIII\u201d? And what of the book\u2019s villain, Larry Moh, the Chinese \u00fcbercapitalist seemingly bent on putting American furniture makers out of business? Or the fancy lawyers who wind up making more money than anybody else? \u201cFactory Man\u201d is so thick with rich characters, family secrets and backwoods wisdom that this very abundance becomes its one flaw. The first half of the book is given over to Bassett history in great detail. John D. Bassett Sr. founded the business in 1902, but the family was illustrious long before then. Mr. J.D., as his employees knew him, was a descendant of a Revolutionary War captain to whom King George III had deeded 791 acres of Virginia farmland in 1773. But the imaginative, ambitious Bassett and his equally driven wife \u2014 that would be Miss Pokey \u2014 set up a small store and inn, and eventually made themselves indispensable in the town that soon carried the family name. Then, in a move that would serve both as the key to their success and as ironic portent, the couple cased a Michigan furniture factory and figured that they could outdo the Grand Rapids craftsmen instead of shipping them all their good Virginia walnut, oak, hickory and more. Bassett workers became experts at copying and mass-producing furniture; even if the product wasn\u2019t especially finely made, it was good enough to satisfy a swelling middle class. The Bassetts got rich by following the dictum of Henry Ford: \u201cSell to the classes, eat with the masses. Sell to the masses, eat with the classes.\u201d And everything worked out fine for a good long while. By 1967, Fortune magazine deemed Bassett the world\u2019s largest manufacturer of wood furniture. Throughout that time Bassett remained a family business \u2014 run by various sons and sons-in-law, that is \u2014 and, not surprisingly, managed with the kind of paternalism common to its time and place. Bassett, Va., became a company town in which Bassetts owned or controlled just about everything: the banks, the schools, the church, the local government and, essentially, the people who lived there. According to Macy, in the late 1930s, Mr. J.D. \u201cliked to buy ice cream and peanuts for kids at baseball games, and he could afford to, with six humming factories that sent freight cars laden with Bassett furniture all over the country.\u201d It didn\u2019t matter that the furniture company was the only game in town, because just about anyone who wanted to work could do so \u2014 at a living wage. The Bassetts even employed blacks when other businesses wouldn\u2019t, though, as befit the times, at lower wages and in dirtier jobs. With their profits, the family hired servants, went on expensive vacations and furnished their homes with fine antiques \u2014 no one wanted tacky Bassett merchandise at home \u2014 and sometimes behaved badly: Macy reports that one of the black women who worked in the family mansion wore two girdles to keep the wandering hands of Bassett men at bay. There were also the kind of natural rivalries that occur in most families but particularly families with a lot of money and legacies that matter. JBIII spent most of his youth and early career trying to prove that he wasn\u2019t an heirhead, with other relatives just as invested in proving the opposite. This was particularly true of his sister\u2019s husband, Bob Spilman, who blocked young John Bassett at every turn.The rising tide of the global economy was supposed to float all boats, but as the Bassetts soon discovered, it didn\u2019t. Yes, American consumers initially benefited from the availability of cheaper furniture made offshore, and the workers in poor countries started enjoying better lives. But the Americans who actually made things \u2014 and whose labor made families like the Bassetts rich \u2014 began to suffer. With local factories closing, families began losing their jobs, their homes and their life savings, along with their hopes. \u201cIf somebody wants to predatorily kill your industry and take market share, that\u2019s fine as long as the consumer can get it a little cheaper?\u201d Bassett\u2019s son Wyatt asked Macy at one point. \u201cBut what happens when they destroy your industry and then raise prices 30 percent once all your factories are gone?\u201d What had been a thriving business was soon decimated. From 2000 to 2002, furniture imports from China jumped 121 percent, and by 2003, offshoring had cost American furniture makers and related companies 73,000 jobs.Faced with closing his factories and laying off loyal employees, Bassett chose to take a stand. Instead of capitulating \u2014 selling out for zillions and letting his workers go hang \u2014 he cut costs, upgraded product lines and kept layoffs to a minimum. Bassett, a \u201cRepublican-\u00adleaning independent,\u201d in Macy\u2019s words, even turned to the federal government for help, pushing representatives to enforce trade regulations against the Chinese. The company broke even in 2012, with shareholder equity at $114.5 million, which Bassett considered a victory. The best furniture makers know that too much ornamentation can spoil a lovely line. The same holds true for the best story\u00adtellers, who know that telling too much can be as dangerous as telling too little, and that, finally, craft is all. In this, her first book, Macy\u2019s passion and enthusiasm are palpable on every page, but more judicious editing would have given the tale greater clarity and narrative power, and made the heroes and villains more alive on the page. Still, her chronicle of this quest is important because she makes a complex, now universal story understandable. Macy cares about ordinary Americans in the same way Bassett does, and in the same way so many Wall Street players and corporate shareholders do not.

The country still faces a projected deficit in future decades, thanks mostly to the retirement of the baby boomers and the high cost of medical care, but it is not likely to require the level of fiscal pain that many assumed several years ago.The reduced estimates are also an indication of what\u2019s happening in the overall health care system. Even as more people are getting access to health insurance, the costs of caring for individual patients is growing at a super-slow rate. That means that health care, which has eaten into salary gains for years and driven up debt and bankruptcies, may be starting to stabilize as a share of national spending.The chart above highlights the changes. It compares Medicare spending estimates from the Congressional Budget Office since 2006. Every year, the C.B.O. puts out its best guess for what the country will spend on Medicare over the next 10 years. In 2019, the C.B.O. now estimates the United States will spend about $11,300 in 2014 dollars to care for each person in Medicare. That\u2019s down from around $12,700 since 2010, the year the Affordable Care Act became law. Now multiply that number times the 62.5 million people who will be in the Medicare program.Although the C.B.O.'s forecasters have been off in their projections in the past, there is no reason to assume their estimates are too low now; their prior estimates have both overshot and undershot the real eventual spending numbers. For the last few years, health spending has slowed in such a significant and consistent way that the surprised forecasters can barely keep up.Some of the recent reductions in Medicare spending are because of differences in estimates about the economy and demographics that affect the program.And some are because of cuts in health care spending passed by Congress. The Affordable Care Act, in particular, made significant reductions to Medicare\u2019s spending on hospitals and private Medicare plans, to help subsidize insurance coverage for low- and middle-income Americans. The Budget Control Act, which Congress passed in 2011, also made some across-the-board cuts to Medicare spending.But much of the recent reductions come from changes in behavior among doctors, nurses, hospitals and patients. Medicare beneficiaries are using fewer high-cost health care services than in the past \u2014 taking fewer brand-name drugs, for example, or spending less time in the hospital. The C.B.O.'s economists call these changes \u201ctechnical changes,\u201d and they dominate the downward revisions since 2010.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "France Acknowledges Economic Malaise, Blaming Austerity", "Date": "2014-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs Europe faces the prospect of its third recession in five years, France is quickly emerging as one of the weakest links among the 18 nations that share the euro.After months of insisting that a recovery from Europe\u2019s long debt crisis was at hand, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande on Wednesday delivered a far bleaker message. He indicated that the austerity policies France had been compelled to adopt to meet the eurozone\u2019s budget deficit targets were making growth impossible.Paris officials say that France \u2014 the eurozone\u2019s second-largest economy after Germany \u2014 will no longer try to meet this year\u2019s deficit-reduction targets, to avoid making economic matters worse. Even in abandoning those targets, they indicated that France was unlikely to recover soon from its long period of stagnation or quickly reduce its unemployment rate, which exceeds 10 percent.\u201cThe diagnosis is clear,\u201d Mr. Hollande said in an interview published Wednesday in the French daily Le Monde. \u201cDue to the austerity policies of the last several years, there is a problem of demand throughout Europe, and a growth rate that is not reducing employment.\u201dIt was the most public rejection by France of the austerity medicine that Germany has long prescribed for the eurozone \u2014 which even the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, recently acknowledged might be impeding the currency bloc\u2019s recovery.Mr. Hollande summoned his cabinet to the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace on Wednesday and announced fresh stimulus measures \u2014 the latest in a string unveiled since January. They included proposals for tax cuts on low-income households and plans to reinvigorate France\u2019s moribund housing construction market, where activity recently plunged to a 15-year low.\u201cWe need to go faster and further,\u201d Mr. Hollande said in the Le Monde interview. \u201cI want to accelerate reforms to boost growth as fast as possible.\u201dHe spoke in the face of signs that the broader eurozone economy is stumbling anew, in contrast to the strong recovery in the United States. Global monetary policy officials gathering this week at the United States Federal Reserve\u2019s annual conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo., are expected to examine the divergent paths of the United States and Europe, and the implications for the global economy.Less than a year after its second recession since the 2008 financial crisis, Europe\u2019s currency bloc did not grow in April through June, the European Union\u2019s statistical agency reported last week. France registered zero growth for the second straight quarter, after weak growth or even contraction for most of 2013.France was not the only euro economy to stumble. Italy, where Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has also backed off austerity pledges to spur growth, slid back into a recession in the second quarter. Even in Germany, which had been leading what only a few months ago seemed to be the eurozone\u2019s incipient recovery, the economy contracted 0.2 percent in the second quarter after a solid year of expansion.Economists have been debating whether the robust growth in the years before 2008 will ever return \u2014 or whether a new dynamic, known as \u201csecular stagnation,\u201d has taken hold, hindering robust recoveries in growth and unemployment.\u201cIt is too soon to tell whether secular stagnation is going to materialize,\u201d Nicholas Crafts, a professor of economics and economic history at the University of Warwick, wrote in a recent paper published by Centre for Economic Policy Research in London. \u201cBut it does seem clear that Europeans should be much more afraid than Americans. The depressing effects of slower growth of productive potential will probably be felt more keenly in Europe.\u201dLike many eurozone countries, France was compelled to embrace some austerity to reduce its debt and deficit levels after the financial crisis, when global credit markets were imposing steep borrowing costs on countries that seemed to be living beyond their means.Last year, Mr. Hollande announced a series of tax increases and 50 billion euros, or $66 billion, in spending cuts through 2017, which crimped the economy. And in aiming toward the 3 percent budget deficit target required for eurozone member countries, he also pledged to cut France\u2019s deficit to 3.8 percent this year, from 4.3 percent in 2013.France\u2019s borrowing costs have plunged to record lows since the crisis. But French businesses and industrial activity have struggled to recover to precrisis levels, making it harder for the government to find the tax revenue needed to reduce the deficit. Hoping to offset the slowdown, Mr. Hollande announced in January new tax breaks for business to encourage hiring.But last week, the French economy minister, Michel Sapin, warned that the economy had become so feeble that the government would no longer try to meet the deficit target. He said France would grow only 0.5 percent this year, half the rate originally expected, and would struggle to expand at a 1 percent growth rate next year. Other embattled economies, including Greece and Spain, have suffered as they slashed spending and raised taxes in a downturn to meet the European Union\u2019s fiscal targets.Mr. Hollande\u2019s move on Wednesday was in sharp contrast to his stance just a few months ago, when he insisted that an economic recovery was underway. Buffeted by record-low poll ratings, his Socialist party also suffered stinging defeats in June elections for the European Parliament.Voters disillusioned with his handling of the economy turned instead to the far-right National Front and to the conservative party of former president Nicolas Sarkozy, the Union pour un Mouvement Populaire, which has been beset by several scandals. On Wednesday, Alain Jupp\u00e9, a former prime minister with high popularity ratings, announced he would run to lead the conservative party.That may hand Mr. Hollande a stiff new challenge when he faces a backlash among more liberal members of his Socialist party, who are loath to push any new austerity measures that may upset voters.On Wednesday, Mr. Hollande called on European Union leaders to make growth their priority, saying that the focus on raising taxes and slashing spending amid downturns had proved a disaster for the European recovery.But some saw his move as little more than a public relations ploy.\u201cEven though they\u2019re taking so many painful measures, they have to explain to the French why the economy is not doing well and in fact is doing worse,\u201d said Famke Krumbm\u00fcller, a Europe analyst at the Eurasia Group in London.As a result, Ms. Krumbm\u00fcller said, Mr. Hollande appeared to be trying to shift blame to Europe, rather than trying to tackle more difficult overhauls in areas like France\u2019s notoriously rigid labor market, which employers say constrains hiring and investment.\u201cThe message is, we\u2019ve done our job, now Europe needs to do its job, which is favoring growth,\u201d Ms. Krumbm\u00fcller said. \u201cThe interpretation is that is we\u2019ve done everything we can do in the current political circumstances, and we won\u2019t go further.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Indian Economy Grows 5.7%, Its Fastest Pace in More Than 2 Years", "Date": "2014-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe higher-than-expected growth figure, released by the Central Statistics Office, suggests an improved outlook for an economy that has languished at less than 5 percent growth for nearly two years, and compares with 4.6 percent growth in the previous quarter and 4.4 percent growth in the June period last year. In Asia, only the economies of China and Japan are larger.The acceleration was supported by improvement in the manufacturing sector, which expanded at 3.5 percent, compared with a fall of 1.2 percent in the same quarter last year. The mining sector also showed a positive uptick, growing 2.1 percent, compared with a contraction of 3.9 percent the previous year.A marked renewal in industrial production, which expanded 3.4 percent in June and 5 percent in May, has also aided recovery.Helping to make macroeconomic conditions better, India\u2019s fiscal deficit in the four months ended in July was 61.2 percent of the full-year target, down from 62.8 percent during the comparable period in the previous year, according to government data released on Friday. Also, India\u2019s current-account deficit was brought down to 1.7 percent of gross domestic product in the fiscal year ended in March, a sharp decrease from the 4.6 percent in the previous year.One of the main constraints to economic growth is the considerable backlog of infrastructure projects stalled by a sluggish bureaucracy, economists say. They also cite the hawkish stance of India\u2019s central bank as it has tried in recent months to control inflation.\u201cIn the long run, the central bank\u2019s efforts to bring inflation down will be positive, because it\u2019ll make for a more stable macroeconomic environment,\u201d said Daniel Martin, an economist who covers Asia at Capital Economics in Singapore. \u201cBut in the short term, the effect of high interest rates and tight monetary policy will be felt in dampened domestic demand.\u201dWith the election in May of a new government led by Mr. Modi, sentiment among foreign and domestic investors soared on the expectation of wide-ranging overhauls, given his business-friendly reputation. But its policies did not affect the quarter ended in June.\u201cThe government formation happened almost two months into this quarter \u2014 it is too early to expect any impact of the change in government or the improvement in sentiment,\u201d said Samiran Chakraborty, head of research for India at Standard Chartered Bank.Growth in the coming quarters, however, rests on the action taken by the government to spur domestic demand, improve manufacturing and provide jobs for millions of young people, analysts say.Since taking office, the new government has moved to allow higher foreign investment in the insurance, military and railroad sectors, and Mr. Modi has declared his intent to speed up regulatory approvals for large infrastructure projects. But after three months in power without any radical changes announced, expectations have been tempered with the realization that the process may be gradual.\u201cAfter any such overwhelming election victory, expectations are always unrealistically high, and people forget that governing is a very drawn out, meticulous process that does take time,\u201d said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economic research at HSBC Global Research in Hong Kong. \u201cYou cannot fix what ails India overnight.\u201dEconomists say there is a pressing need for structural overhauls like reducing the rigidity of labor laws, increasing clarity in the tax code and cutting down on the previous government\u2019s subsidy programs.While Mr. Modi won the election with a historical majority, his Bharatiya Janata Party lacks a majority in the upper house of Parliament, making it difficult to shepherd legislation. Many argue that significant economic changes, often politically unpopular, are more likely to be introduced after the completion of state elections next year.\u201cA lot is going to depend on what Modi manages to achieve,\u201d said Mr. Martin, of Capital Economics. \u201cWe haven\u2019t really seen a strong reform agenda from him so far.

{"Headline": "Gift-Bearing Officials Try to Lure Chinese Factories Inland ", "Date": "2014-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 The Renley Watch Manufacturing Company is one of the companies that helped coastal southeastern China displace Switzerland as the center of the world\u2019s watchmaking industry. But now Renley, like many watchmakers, is mulling whether to move far into China\u2019s interior.Just last week, officials from Chongqing, a sprawling metropolis in western China, met with a group of watch industry executives and offered an enticing package for them to move their factories there, said Stanley Lau, Renley\u2019s managing director. The incentives included deeply discounted land, less-intrusive environmental inspections and lower wages.When some of the executives expressed concern about moving costs, the answer came immediately. \u201cThe government in Chongqing said, \u2018Don\u2019t worry. If you agree to move your factory to Chongqing, I\u2019ll pay your moving costs,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Lau said, adding that at least 10 watch factories were already preparing to move.Such meetings are increasingly common as the Chinese economy gradually slows.With foreign investment falling, inland provinces are in a cutthroat competition to attract domestic industries, offering significant financial incentives to businesses and even undercutting one another in crucial areas like environmental regulation. Companies, driven to cut costs, are taking the offers seriously.The turf war echoes the efforts by state governments in the United States, which have long used tax sweeteners to persuade companies to relocate. And the trend in China is infuriating the coastal provinces, which contend that businesses should be deciding where to locate factories based on economic merits like the quality of ports and highways.\u201cIt\u2019s really a problem. I think governments should not give money to companies for relocation,\u201d said Li Chunhong, the top economic policy maker in the southeastern province of Guangdong. \u201cIt violates the transparency of the market.\u201dMr. Li predicted that Guangdong would hold on to higher-wage jobs, particularly in the electronics, design and software industries. Already enough high-tech companies are moving engineers and other staff members into Shenzhen that the city easily has the strongest commercial real estate market in China, with office space in short supply, said Sanjay Verma, the chief executive for Asia at Cushman & Wakefield, a global commercial real estate brokerage firm.Pausing during an interview to pull a large Samsung smartphone out of his suit pocket, Mr. Li described how 90 percent of the phone\u2019s components had been manufactured within a 60-mile-wide circle near Hong Kong that encompasses cities like Shenzhen, Dongguan and Zhuhai.\u201cIf a factory needs components, they can make a call, and in just one hour the components are sent to their factory,\u201d he said. Guangdong Province led China in embracing capitalism in the late 1970s and continues to rival the Shanghai area as one of the country\u2019s two main export hubs. Tens of millions of migrant workers flocked from all over China to fill Guangdong\u2019s factories, many of them built by Hong Kong investors. More recently, Guangdong has been a leader in China in trying to tackle pollution by forcing many factories to install new equipment, move to outlying areas far from population centers or even close entirely.New railroad routes from western China to Europe, as well as sprawling new airports with freight terminals built deep in China\u2019s interior, are also making it possible to ship goods directly from inland factories to foreign markets without relying on the giant ports of Guangdong, Shanghai or other coastal areas.\u201cMore and more manufacturers are considering relocating their production operations from Guangdong to more inland in China, or even to other countries,\u201d said Mr. Lau, who is also the chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong Industries, a broad coalition of trade groups with factories across southeastern China.Mr. Lau\u2019s company, which he founded in Hong Kong in 1983, currently makes watch components and assembles less-expensive watches in Dongguan, in Guangdong Province. Renley also assembles midmarket watches at a factory in Hong Kong and luxury watches in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland. Renley has brands like Buler, Temporis, Sultana and Jean d\u2019Eve, but most of the production is sold under other brands for retailers that do not have watchmaking operations.Sitting in his company\u2019s conference room, lined with display cases that glitter with expensive watches, Mr. Lau ticked off the pros and cons of moving his Dongguan factory 630 miles northwest to Chongqing. With an urban population of 17.3 million, Chongqing is building a \u201cJewelry City\u201d and trying to persuade manufacturers to relocate there.The appeal starts with lower wages. Although pay in the Chinese interior is rising fast, it has not quite caught up. Chongqing has assured watchmakers of an ample supply of workers, and Mr. Lau estimated that they would be paid $375 to $405 a month, excluding government-mandated costs for employers like basic health insurance, pensions and housing subsidies.That compares with $490 a month in Dongguan \u2014 when manufacturers can find employees. \u201cThere is a shortage of workers in every industry,\u201d Mr. Lau said.Chongqing also has abundant land. The city charges one-third less than Dongguan, and the land is near large roads and commercial districts. Dongguan is so built up that the only new sites tend to be several hours\u2019 drive into outlying areas.Environmental regulation is one of the touchiest issues. Mr. Lau said that Chongqing required new factories to install modern pollution-control equipment and adopt certain procedures, but then had fairly few follow-up inspections. Four Chongqing municipal agencies declined to comment on their activities.Guangdong has been gradually reducing air pollution over the last several years partly by closing older factories and requiring new equipment and procedures for other sites. But for many industries with histories of pollution problems, like metal plating \u2014 an important part of watchmaking \u2014 Guangdong is also requiring that factories move to a few designated industrial zones.In a speech on Wednesday, Mr. Li, the economic policy maker for Guangdong, called for renewed emphasis on a \u201cmaritime Silk Road,\u201d the ships that still haul the bulk of China\u2019s commerce. Many freight executives are skeptical that transcontinental railroad routes spanning Asia and Europe would supplant container ships.\u201cWe do not see it as an alternative replacing or denting the status of ocean shipping as the main mode of transport between the two continents,\u201d said Jens Eskelund, the managing director at the China division of A.P. Moller-Maersk, the world\u2019s largest container shipping company.Mr. Lau said that the watch industry still relied almost entirely on air shipments, so rail services were irrelevant. Each bulk buyer of watches in Europe and elsewhere typically arranges its own shipment from the factories, and the result is many small shipments, none of which is big enough for rail, which works best with full container loads.Renley Watch has not made a decision on whether to move. Chongqing has offered this year to cover 2 million renminbi, or $325,000, in moving expenses for each of the first 20 watch factories in Guangdong that agree to relocate.Other countries may not be viable alternatives for manufacturing. Workers in Vietnam and Indonesia are paid less than half as much as their Chinese counterparts. But investment interest in Southeast Asia has temporarily slowed following a spasm of anti-Chinese violence in Vietnam last spring, when rioters destroyed hundreds of factories after a Chinese state-controlled company began drilling for oil off Vietnam\u2019s coast.\u201cThat was one of the problems we never predicted,\u201d Mr. Lau said. \u201cNowhere in the world is safe \u2014 wherever you go, you have to take a risk.\u201dAnother factor may yet motivate manufacturers like Mr. Lau to stay in Guangdong.\u201cIf we move to Chongqing, will my assistants and technicians come with us?\u201d Mr. Lau asked. \u201cWe have to see.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nigeria Struggles to Cope With Ebola Outbreak", "Date": "2014-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEbola, one of the world\u2019s most fatal diseases, has surfaced in Africa\u2019s most populous country.Nigerian health officials have announced 10 confirmed cases and two deaths in the country from the Ebola outbreak that is sweeping West Africa, including a nurse and a man from Liberia whom the nurse had been caring for.The man, Patrick Sawyer, a naturalized American citizen, had flown to Nigeria in late July and died soon after. He had infected at least eight other people, including the nurse, who died on Tuesday, officials said.By Friday, President Goodluck Jonathan had declared a state of emergency, officially adding Nigeria, home to more than 160 million people, to the list of nations struggling to control one of the largest public-health emergencies in recent history. More than 900 people have died.The story of Mr. Sawyer, who according to Nigerian newspaper accounts was aware that he was sick when he left Liberia, demonstrates just how difficult containing the disease will be in the modern age of rapid travel and growing urbanization. Nigeria has Africa\u2019s largest economy and is deeply connected to the outside world, a fact that could magnify the consequences if the outbreak is not contained.\u201cRapid epidemic transmission has been with us a long time, but my guess is that it\u2019s accelerating, with the number of people on the move and intensity of air travel, global trade and the numbers of displaced people we have globally,\u201d said Jeffrey D. Sachs, an economist and the director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University.Climate change, population growth and an increase in displaced populations mean that people are pushing into previously uninhabited places, creating new vulnerabilities and bringing humans into closer contact with animal populations, where many of the diseases have begun, he said.At the same time, globalization means that people are mixing more, trading more and handling more farm animals in industrial settings \u2014 all of which facilitate the emergence and spread of infectious diseases.\u201cThis ought to force a reflection,\u201d Mr. Sachs said, adding that establishing a basic network of community health workers across the developing world was an urgent priority.Health officials emphasized that Nigeria still had only a few confirmed Ebola cases and that its government had mobilized substantial forces to try to stop the spread of the disease.David Daigle, a spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s effort in Nigeria, said the ministers of health and information were on hand Friday for the opening of an emergency operation center in Lagos, a sign that the government was treating the situation seriously.\u201cThe Nigerians understand the magnitude of the problem here,\u201d said Dr. Frank Mahoney, an epidemiologist who has been leading the C.D.C.\u2019s Ebola response in Lagos. Still, he said, international health officials are undertaking a substantial effort in Nigeria, motivated by what might happen if the disease, which had been confined to remote forests and villages in decades past, starts to spread in one of Africa\u2019s most densely populated countries.\u201cWe are very worried about this,\u201d Dr. Mahoney said, pointing out that Nigeria\u2019s health care system could easily become overwhelmed. \u201cLagos is such a huge city with such a mobile population.\u201dLagos, a city of nearly 20 million, the most populous in Nigeria, is also home to a large contingent of religious healers, such as Temitope Balogun Joshua, a popular Christian minister and televangelist known as T. B. Joshua. Health experts are concerned that sick people will flock to Lagos to seek his advice.Dr. Mahoney said health experts were reaching out to such leaders, and Mr. Jonathan called on churches and religious leaders to halt large gatherings that could encourage the spread of the disease.Almost all of the suspected Ebola cases involve people who had direct contact with Mr. Sawyer \u2014 either in the airport, where he was helped into a car, or in the hospital where he was treated, the First Consultant Medical Center.Newspapers in Liberia and Nigeria were brimming with accounts of the strange tale of Mr. Sawyer\u2019s sickness, which began in Liberia, where the disease is exploding.The number of suspected cases has continued to tick up slowly. Nigeria\u2019s state oil company announced on Friday that it had closed its clinic in Lagos after a patient suspected of having Ebola was admitted there. The patient had visited the First Consultant Medical Center, which has since been closed.In a strange twist, a doctors\u2019 strike in Nigeria may have saved lives by reducing the number of medical workers who came into contact with Mr. Sawyer.\u201cIt would have been a disaster,\u201d said Babajide Saheed, a doctor and the secretary of the Lagos State chapter of the Nigerian Medical Association. \u201cAt the time, nobody was prepared for it.\u201dAbout 70 people are believed to have had contact with Mr. Sawyer, Nigerian health officials said. Dr. Mahoney said teams of people were working to call those people and to try to persuade them to stay at home and watch for symptoms, such as a rising temperature. Just as concerning was what would happen if the disease began to spread inside the health care system, Dr. Mahoney said.\u201cThe health care system in Nigeria would have a really difficult time responding to a communitywide outbreak,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article reversed the given name and surname of the secretary of the Lagos State chapter of the Nigerian Medical Association. He is Babajide Saheed, not Saheed Babajide.Ben Ezeamalu contributed reporting from Oshogbo, Nigeria.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Video: A Volvo Crossover for Those Who Don\u2019t Need All-Wheel Drive", "Date": "2014-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe smaller of Volvo\u2019s two crossovers, the XC60 was released to the world in 2008 (and to Americans in 2009). Its curvaceous looks have held up nicely in an industry that usually cycles through products every four to five years.For 2015, the XC60 gets some exterior tweaks, though only Volvophiles will notice the subtle fascia freshening. The big news is the Drive-E powertrain.In T6 tune, the 2-liter 4-cylinder engine is supercharged and turbocharged, pumping out 302 horsepower and 295 pound-feet of torque. The supercharger is mechanically linked to the engine, so it forces more air into the cylinders right off the line, and the turbo kicks in once airflow builds up.This tag team approach provides extra oomph through the entire power band and is enough to sling the vehicle from zero to 60 miles per hour in 6.5 seconds. Coupled with an 8-speed transmission, the E.P.A. rates fuel economy at 22 miles per gallon in the city and 30 on the highway. I averaged 24 m.p.g.The downside to Drive-E is that it is not available with all-wheel drive. That may not concern Aaron in Arizona, but Michael in Minnesota might take a pass. The legacy powertrains remain, and they offer four-wheel power but are not nearly as efficient.Things to like? The driving dynamic, sport seats and giant glass roof are terrific. That cannot be said about the user interface, with its tiny controller knob and small LCD screen.Volvo\u2019s refinement and design are impressive considering it is quite small compared with other automobile companies. Sure, for a spell it was owned by Ford, and in 2010, was taken over by the Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Company of China.The next few years are crucial to the company\u2019s future. Volvo sales have dropped by nearly 50 percent in the United States since 2000. The long overdue next-generation XC90 should help the bottom line. Until then, it is safe to say that the S60 sedan and XC60 will be doing the hard work for the brand.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Eurozone Recovery Stalls, With Weakness in Germany and France", "Date": "2014-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 This was supposed to be the year that the European economy decisively broke free of its shackles. But after a dismal round of economic growth reports on Thursday, the main question appears to be whether the eurozone will avoid tumbling back into recession.\u201cIt\u2019s fairly clear that the eurozone recovery is coming apart at the seams,\u201d said Nicholas Spiro, managing director of Spiro Sovereign Strategy in London, as most of the bloc is either \u201cin recession or flirting with it now.\u201dThe reports drew renewed calls for more aggressive stimulus from the European Central Bank to restore an economy that has been hobbled by millions of people out of work and price pressures so weak that deflation is a genuine threat.The International Monetary Fund last month cut its forecast for 2014 global growth to 3.4 percent from the 3.7 percent it forecast in April.Economists had been forecasting that the eurozone economy would grow as much as 2 percent this year after a 0.4 percent decline last year.After the report on Thursday, many analysts were revisiting their outlooks for a possible downward revision.Lena Komileva, chief economist at G Plus Economics in London, said that the figures showed there was a \u201creal risk\u201d that the eurozone was headed back into recession and that they added to pressure on the European Central Bank to adopt stronger monetary stimulus.\u201cNot only does this render the E.C.B.'s anemic growth forecast of 1 percent for 2014 unrealistic,\u201d she added, \u201cbut it is hard to see just what will keep the recovery growing.\u201dAnother cause for concern on Thursday was the specter of deflation: Eurozone consumer prices rose last month just 0.4 percent from a year ago, Eurostat said, confirming an earlier report.And of the 18 nations in the bloc, prices rose on a monthly basis in only two \u2014 Germany and the Netherlands \u2014 and declined in 15 others; they were flat in Malta.That added to fears that Japan-style deflation was becoming more likely. Investors piled into German sovereign debt, considered the safest asset in Europe, and the yield on the 10-year bond, which moves in the opposite direction to price, fell at one point below 1 percent for the first time.\u201cThe current no-growth, negative-price reality in the eurozone already leaves little hope for restoring jobs, living standards or public debt sustainability,\u201d Ms. Komileva said.Some positive signs did appear on Thursday.Economic growth picked up in several so-called peripheral euro members: Spain grew 0.6 percent on a quarterly basis, up from 0.4 percent at the start of the year; Portugal, the Netherlands, Finland and Sweden all returned to growth after contracting in the first quarter; and Cyprus and Greece moved closer to the break-even mark, suggesting that their steep declines might be nearing an end.And the downturn in Germany, the eurozone\u2019s largest economy, followed by France and Italy, could prove to be temporary. Economists said the latest figures were skewed by unusually fair weather in the first quarter, which bolstered construction growth to a level that was not sustained in the second quarter.But other indicators have pointed to a rough patch ahead for Germany, which remained relatively healthy through the worst of the economic crisis across the rest of Europe. The ZEW index of economic sentiment, released on Tuesday, showed morale among analysts and investors in the country plunging in August to its lowest level in more than 18 months.And German businesses have warned that the European Union\u2019s economic sanctions against Russia could hurt the domestic economy.The eurozone\u2019s most immediate problems are rooted in the need for households and businesses to cut debt and in a dearth of demand that has left more than 18 million people in the unemployment line.After the sovereign debt crisis led Cyprus, Greece, Ireland and Portugal to seek bailouts and raised fears about Spain and Italy\u2019s ability to remain in the euro bloc, governments agreed to a policy of fiscal austerity.While the overhauls won a reprieve from the market, demand declined further as governments cut spending and raised taxes.The data reported Thursday raised the likelihood that Europe was headed for a deflationary trap, as flat or declining G.D.P. would weigh further on the labor market and keep downward pressure on prices, said Carl B. Weinberg, chief economist and managing director of High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y.\u201cThere\u2019s no inflation anywhere in sight,\u201d he said.Inevitably, considering the refusal of Germany and some other nations to weigh using the traditional lever of fiscal policy to stimulate growth, all eyes are now on Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank.At its meeting last week, the central bank left monetary policy intact, with its main interest rate at a record-low 0.15 percent and its deposit rate at negative 0.1 percent.Mr. Draghi has pledged to provide banks with a new round of cheap loans to bolster lending to smaller businesses.But many economists have also called for the bulk buying of debt on the open market \u2014 a policy known as quantitative easing \u2014 as a last-ditch attempt to restore credit and keep prices from the downward deflationary spiral that would further weaken borrowers and banks and sap investment.Mr. Draghi has said the central bank is considering quantitative easing, but many analysts are skeptical that it can be done within the constraints the central bank faces.\u201cQ.E. is a political nonstarter,\u201d Mr. Spiro said, as \u201cwe don\u2019t believe Mr. Draghi will be able to get the support of German politicians.\u201dMr. Draghi, for his part, has sought to keep the spotlight on promises of structural changes made by the recalcitrant governments in France and Italy.Mr. Weinberg said it was misleading even to speak of a recovery in the eurozone, considering that the bloc\u2019s G.D.P. remained more than 2 percent lower than its level in early 2008, before the global financial crisis.\u201cI think we\u2019re still in a depression that began six years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cThe difference between a recession and a depression is that you have a natural bounce-back from a recession, but a depression needs a policy response.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Only a few arrived each week, not enough for a hearse driver to make a decent living.Now, at least five turn up daily, the bodies shoehorned into white plastic-wrapped boxes. So, in 2009, Dipendra Prasad Acharya quit his job driving trucks to work full time in one of Nepal\u2019s few growing industries \u2014 transporting the bodies of emigrant workers.Mr. Acharya knows that his job is assured. At each pickup, he navigates around hordes of rangy young Nepali men and a growing number of women who mob the second-class departure terminal \u2014 some of whom are bound to return shrink-wrapped.\u201cThe number of dead bodies keeps increasing,\u201d he said, waiting for another coffin. \u201cWe ferry the dead to their home villages free of cost. The government pays me for my work.\u201dNepal is a political and economic mess. A 10-year Maoist insurgency ended in 2006, but political leaders have since been unable to agree on a constitution. Despite vast hydropower potential, electricity is in such short supply that lights are extinguished for up to 14 hours each day. Manufacturing has declined for years, and now represents a paltry 6 percent of the country\u2019s economy. Poverty is endemic, air pollution is choking, and health statistics are terrible.With few jobs at home, the country\u2019s youths have responded by leaving. The scale of emigration has astonished development economists, yet it continues to grow, increasing 37 percent in just the past two years.On average, about 1,500 Nepalis officially left for jobs abroad each day in the 2014 fiscal year, up from six in 1996. Even more are thought to have left unofficially for India, though because the border is unchecked no one knows the precise figure. In some seasons, one-quarter of the country\u2019s population may be working beyond the border, economists and manpower officials estimate.No country in the world with at least 10 million people earns a greater share of its wealth from emigrant workers. Nepal has long been a destination for tourists eager to see the world\u2019s highest mountains. But increasingly, even young Nepalis just visit.The flood of foreign money \u2014 officially 25 percent of Nepal\u2019s gross domestic product and unofficially as much as 40 percent \u2014 is rapidly transforming the country\u2019s economy and culture. Sturdy brick homes now dot villages where only mud huts stood. Private schools flourish. With their husbands gone to work abroad, women venture from home more frequently, make more family decisions and have fewer babies.\u201cBefore I went to Qatar, I\u2019d never worked with safety equipment like safety belts and helmets and steel-toed shoes,\u201d Kaplesh Mandal, a 30-year-old laborer, said in comments that were echoed by other men. \u201cAnd there is traffic regulation. If we could get that here in Nepal, that would be really good.\u201dMigrants have transformed Katmandu, the jumping-off point for most official migration. Between 2001 and 2011, the city\u2019s population grew 61 percent, to 1.7 million, while the country\u2019s rose 14 percent, to about 26.5 million. Hundreds line up every day at the Narayanhiti Palace to apply for passports, a long and expensive process.Janakpur, the district capital, is a fetid warren of potholed streets, with some piled so high with rubble that they resemble a war zone. Roads outside the capital are largely dirt tracks over which vehicles rarely travel more than 15 miles per hour and people defecate openly throughout the day.But hope has come to Dhanusha in the form of solid homes, a proliferation of radios and TVs, and good schools. There are also more bars for men who developed a taste for alcohol while abroad.In 2007, Madan Deuba opened the Siddhartha English Boarding School, charging from $4 to $8 per child per month. In the seven years since, he has refurbished a small compound of whitewashed buildings and now has 400 day students. He hopes to continue expanding.\u201cNearly all of the money I get comes from fathers and uncles who are working in Qatar or Saudi Arabia,\u201d he said in an interview.He has 11 teachers, and his students sprang to their feet when he entered classrooms. \u201cAfternoon, sir,\u201d the children sang in unison.Fewer than half of Dhanusha\u2019s adults can read, but the district\u2019s emigrants invest substantially more in education than nonemigrants, a study found. Mr. Deuba said that his goal was to ready students for jobs abroad, although he said he never considered teaching Arabic.A few blocks away, Munesa Khatun lived in a half-built brick home that her husband planned to finish when he returned from Saudi Arabia. But he died in that country. Now, one of their two sons works in Qatar and the other is waiting for a visa to join him, she said.\u201cI\u2019m very frightened for my son because I don\u2019t want him to die over there like his father,\u201d Ms. Khatun said. \u201cBut we need money, and there is no other way to get it.\u201dBhadra Sharma contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lesson From Old India: When an Economy Just Doesn\u2019t Get Better", "Date": "2014-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewCommentators have often compared the recent Great Recession of the United States and Europe to the Great Depression of the 1930s. In both cases, asset prices tumbled, financial systems turned insolvent and demand plummeted. One difference is that in the recent case, we mounted a swifter rescue effort than we did in the 1930s; for instance, Ben S. Bernanke, as chairman of the Federal Reserve in the recent crisis, drew upon his academic research in supporting bailouts and reflating the economy.In 1750, India accounted for one-quarter of the world\u2019s manufacturing output, but by 1900 that was down to 2 percent. The West became more productive as a result of the Industrial Revolution, and India lost much of its leading export sector, textiles. While the data is fragmentary, the best estimates show that India\u2019s living standards declined through the middle of the 19th century and that its economy retrogressed, even as it borrowed some technological improvements from the West. India just didn\u2019t do enough to move toward production on a larger scale or with better machines.Economists are accustomed to emphasizing the benefits of international trade, and these arguments are largely correct. But in India, internal regulations and underdevelopment, combined with British colonial depredations, prevented Indian resources from being redeployed productively. The lesson is that a sufficiently large international trade shock can lead to decades of economic decline in a major economy, especially if that economy isn\u2019t geared to mounting a flexible response.Today, we\u2019re not used to the idea of declining living standards, because growth throughout the 20th century was the global norm for economies that were not at war. International trade grew rapidly after World War II, but at least in the early postwar years most of that trade was among countries with roughly comparable technologies and real wages. And that trade spurred growth rather than damaging laggard economies.Who are some of the possible losers in this radical transformation in the global economy?These economies have a few features in common: They try very hard to preserve old jobs at high real wages, they are not very flexible at adjusting, and they have not engaged in a major economic restructuring. While China is not the main problem of these economies, Chinese export growth and wage competition may have been a kind of final straw that made old ways unsustainable.If either France or Italy, much less both, is in for 15 or 20 years of economic stagnation, it\u2019s hard to see how the eurozone will avoid another major financial crisis. Portugal and Greece, both of which have been de-industrialized over the last few decades, are also possible candidates for continuing, rather than temporary, retrogression.In Asia, the most likely future candidate for this problem is Taiwan, where real wages were largely stagnant from 2000 to 2011. In 2012, Taiwan\u2019s trend was even more disturbing: Its economy grew 1.3 percent, but real wages fell 1.6 percent, both adjusted for inflation. Taiwanese capital has flowed into China, creating a new class of Taiwanese millionaires but hollowing out the country\u2019s manufacturing base as capital was reallocated to the mainland.What about the United States? The chance of an overall economic reversal here is very slim. The American economy is relatively flexible, and various candidates for future growth are strong: technology, health care research, energy and higher education. Despite its slow recovery, the United States probably still has the best fundamentals of any major economy.It was once an unthinkable question, but we\u2019ve arrived at the scary point where it needs to be asked: What if American median income over the next 15 years keeps stagnating \u2014 or maybe even falls?Our Social Security system, whose receipts are based on wage taxation, could then prove to be a bigger fiscal problem than Medicare. Asset prices would most likely prove overvalued, possibly setting off another financial crash or at least damaging many Americans\u2019 retirements. And the rate of household formation would most likely remain slow, depressing the housing market for the foreseeable future.India\u2019s economy started to reindustrialize in the late 19th century, but growth remained subpar until the 1990s \u2014 a truly long recovery lag. This may sound strange to say, but when it comes to some parts of the Western world, the Great Depression may offer the cheerier analogy.TYLER COWEN is a professor of economics at George Mason University.

{"Headline": "Why We Fight Wars", "Date": "2014-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA century has passed since the start of World War I, which many people at the time declared was \u201cthe war to end all wars.\u201d Unfortunately, wars just kept happening. And with the headlines from Ukraine getting scarier by the day, this seems like a good time to ask why. So the thesis of \u201cThe Great Illusion\u201d was right: Modern nations can\u2019t enrich themselves by waging war. Yet wars keep happening. Why?One answer is that leaders may not understand the arithmetic. Angell, by the way, often gets a bum rap from people who think that he was predicting an end to war. Actually, the purpose of his book was to debunk atavistic notions of wealth through conquest, which were still widespread in his time. And delusions of easy winnings still happen. It\u2019s only a guess, but it seems likely that Vladimir Putin thought that he could overthrow Ukraine\u2019s government, or at least seize a large chunk of its territory, on the cheap \u2014 a bit of deniable aid to the rebels, and it would fall into his lap. The larger problem, however, is that governments all too often gain politically from war, even if the war in question makes no sense in terms of national interests.No doubt it\u2019s an oversimplification to say that the confrontation in Ukraine is all about shoring up an authoritarian regime that is stumbling on other fronts. But there\u2019s surely some truth to that story \u2014 and that raises some scary prospects for the future.Most immediately, we have to worry about escalation in Ukraine. All-out war would be hugely against Russia\u2019s interests \u2014 but Mr. Putin may feel that letting the rebellion collapse would be an unacceptable loss of face.And if authoritarian regimes without deep legitimacy are tempted to rattle sabers when they can no longer deliver good performance, think about the incentives China\u2019s rulers will face if and when that nation\u2019s economic miracle comes to an end \u2014 something many economists believe will happen soon. Starting a war is a very bad idea. But it keeps happening anyway. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why We\u2019re Not Driving the Friendly Skies", "Date": "2014-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by11 PhotosA number of us can thank a cartoon character from the future, George Jetson, for instilling our longing. Students of aviation history might look for inspiration to the Autoplane prototype built in 1917 by the flight pioneer Glenn Curtiss. And tens of millions of motorists who have been stuck in traffic jams stretching toward the horizon must also feel a need to know: Where are the flying cars?It\u2019s a dream that has reduced many would-be inventors to despair as they grasped the immensity of the engineering and design challenges rooted in the widely divergent natures of airplanes and cars. Cars must provide occupants with comfort, decent handling and braking and protection in the event of an accident \u2014 while complying with government air-pollution and fuel-economy standards. Keeping weight to a minimum is important, but a few extra pounds here and there can be tolerated.Airplanes are quite a different matter. Weight is everything in a flying machine; it determines the engine power and the wingspan required to get off the ground. Thus, aircraft make extensive use of lightweight materials that their designers fashion into the most efficient structures they can dream up. Trying to reconcile the conflicting requirements of the two types of vehicles invariably results in a boatload of compromises that, some say, make the flying car a nonstarter. Yet the dream lives on. Ray Morgan, a consulting aerospace engineer in Simi Valley, Calif., knows a lot about efficiency and lightweight structures, having led a group that developed a series of prototype aircraft, cars and blimps at AeroVironment Inc. He has also studied flying car design. \u201cIn general, the idea that you are going to use an airplane for a car is just not realistic,\u201d he said in a recent phone interview. \u201cYou are very likely to end up with both a bad airplane and a bad car.\u201dIt helps to put on an imaginary engineer\u2019s hat when pondering the systems that would need to be on board a viable flying car. For starters, there must be an engine. And for weight and complexity reasons it would be ideal for a single engine to provide power for flying and driving. Therefore, some kind of transmission must be devised to send power either to a propeller or to the driving wheels.Wings, and how to stow them for highway travel, are another big piece of the puzzle. \u201cThe heavier your vehicle is, the more wingspan will be needed to make the aerodynamic lift to fly it,\u201d Mr. Morgan said. \u201cEvery time your weight goes up, due to adding systems peculiar to the car function, those wings must get longer. Or else you will need a more powerful engine, and your takeoff and landing speeds get faster.\u201d The longer the wings become, the greater the challenge of getting them out of the way so the flying car will fit the width of a highway lane. Building hinges or pivoting mechanisms into the wings reduces their structural efficiency and adds weight.Even a flying car\u2019s suspension system would require a fair amount of engineering. An automobile suspension is designed to withstand forces of about two gs as it smooths out the bumps in the road. Airplanes sometimes have bad landings, however, and their suspension systems must be built to tolerate four g forces. When Mr. Morgan prepared a study for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency on a rough-country \u201cflying Jeep\u201d concept, he envisioned adapting the long-travel suspension from a sand buggy. Darpa rejected the idea. \u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019ve ever met a real military guy who thinks a flying-car-type vehicle is a good idea,\u201d he said.Another looming challenge for a prospective manufacturer is clearing the hurdles presented by multiple federal regulatory agencies. A new aircraft must receive from the Federal Aviation Administration what\u2019s known as a type certification, which approves the plane\u2019s design as safe and airworthy. Also mandatory is a production certification, which attests that the manufacturer has exacting quality standards in place and can build multiple airplanes identical to the approved prototype. \u201cThe things you do to get automotive approvals add weight. Now, are you still within limits for the aeronautical side of the program?\u201dEnthusiasts have a think or two coming if they assume that one need only buy a flying car and point the nose skyward to soar above the dreary highways. Nobody gets off the ground without training and a pilot\u2019s license, and no government agency will sign off on citizens\u2019 routinely taking off and landing on public roads. That\u2019s what airports are for. A final impediment to swarms of flying cars filling the skies is the existing air traffic control system, which isn\u2019t set up to keep track of low-flying aircraft that don\u2019t have a flight plan and may impulsively change course. \u201cIf this situation became reality, how many of those people would live to see dinner?\u201d Mr. Morgan asked.Despite this mountain of obstacles, there\u2019s no reason to expect the allure of flying cars to wither. What child hasn\u2019t imagined floating around the house a few feet above the floor, looking down on things from a new perspective? It\u2019s a small leap from there to the great outdoors. And the march of progress may yet bring flying cars within reach. NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration are working on a GPS-based technology called an Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast, or A.D.S.-B., receiver that would help multiple light aircraft coordinate flight paths and request changes. The proliferation of gasoline-electric hybrid drive componentry in the auto industry could also help get weight and complexity out of powertrains. Terrafugia is working on that idea. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Public Housing in New York Reaches a Fiscal Crisis", "Date": "2014-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEveryone, it seems, wants a piece of New York City public housing.Advocates for homeless people are demanding more apartments for families living in shelters. School officials want space in public housing for new prekindergarten classes. Mayor Bill de Blasio wants to use open land in the projects for new affordable housing.And just over a quarter of a million households sit on the waiting list for an apartment in one of the New York City Housing Authority\u2019s 334 developments.But the demands on Nycha, as the housing authority is known, clash with a grave financial reality. After years of shrinking government investment in public housing, the agency has a $77 million budget deficit this year and unfunded capital needs totaling $18 billion, its officials say.Shola Olatoye, the housing authority\u2019s chairwoman, said the huge shortfalls had pushed public housing into a \u201cpretty dire\u201d phase, leaving the authority unable to meet many of its day-to-day obligations, like timely repairs, and most of its long-term capital needs.\u201cI wish it were triage,\u201d Ms. Olatoye said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s beyond triage.\u201d Eighty years after it was created during the Depression to replace crowded, unsanitary tenements, public housing in New York is at a crossroads. Who should pay for public housing, and how, are questions being asked as officials, experts and tenants try to figure out how to preserve a bastion of the poor and working class in a city with less and less affordable housing.The job has fallen on a mayor who has staked his tenure on making New York livable for the poor but who is up against a steady government retreat from housing them.More than 400,000 people live in public housing apartments, most of which were built between 1942 and 1969. Federal subsidies for Nycha and other public housing authorities, which are subject to federal funding and oversight but administered locally, have been shrinking in earnest since the 2000s, and while New York has withstood the cuts better than many other big-city authorities, the reckoning appears to be at hand, officials and experts say.Expenses are being cut. Vital repairs are going uncompleted. And essential renovations are being put off indefinitely.\u201cIt\u2019s a perfect storm of an aging building stock at the same time of massive housing cuts from Congress,\u201d said Holly M. Leicht, the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s regional administrator for New York and New Jersey. \u201cPublic housing has to redefine how they do business.\u201dThe de Blasio administration, which has made housing a centerpiece of its agenda, has called for a \u201ctotal reset,\u201d which essentially means finding billions of dollars to keep thousands of aging buildings habitable for decades to come.At Baruch, apartments need windows with better seals, facades need work to protect pedestrians from falling pieces of broken brick, and cracked walkways need repaving. In one 12-story building at Castle Hill, an entire vertical line of apartments shows cracks, residents said.\u201cI\u2019m afraid the whole building might fall,\u201d said Roxanne Reid, 58, a retired school crossing guard and tenant leader at the housing project.At some sites, like Harlem River Houses, whole top floors have been vacated, and sometimes the apartments below them, because of roof leaks. (The project is finally set to start $22 million worth of renovations this year, housing officials said.)The authority houses more than 8 percent of the city\u2019s approximately two million renter households, including some of the neediest. About 80 percent of public housing residents are poor or have very low incomes, making less than $41,950 a year for a household of four, city officials said. More than a quarter of the residents are 65 and older.The agency gives priority in its admission policies to special groups \u2014 like domestic violence victims and, since Mr. de Blasio\u2019s election, people from homeless shelters \u2014 as well as working families who can pay higher rents.That economic diversity as well as the tremendous need for affordable housing in an expensive real estate market has helped public housing in New York survive even as it is demolished in other cities as units nationwide fall into disrepair. But affordable housing advocates say that this highly valued stock is threatened and that nothing short of a major government rescue plan \u2014 some use the term Marshall Plan \u2014 from the state and city will do.Federal financing for capital projects has shrunk cumulatively by over $1 billion in the last decade or so, to $294 million this year from $419 million in 2001, federal figures show. Congressional appropriations for operations have not seen the same steady decline but have fluctuated significantly \u2014 $920 million in 2010, $830 million in 2013 \u2014 making it hard for officials to plan from year to year.\u201cIf we don\u2019t do something about these developments, we\u2019re going to lose them,\u201d said Judith Goldiner, a chief lawyer with the Legal Aid Society, which represents public housing tenants in litigation against the housing authority. \u201cCapital disinvestment leads to deterioration. Some units here, some units there, leads to a lot of units.\u201dSome housing experts have urged a state-city partnership like the one forged to expand access to prekindergarten throughout the city. Others say the solutions should also include leveraging some of the open land in the public housing developments, which could be worth billions of dollars in development rights.\u201cYou need a massive amount\u201d of money, said Emily A. Youssouf, who served on the Housing Authority board as an appointee of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg until earlier this year. \u201cFor a massive amount, you need to do something radical.\u201dBut the idea of leasing public housing land, much less selling it, has been politically unpalatable. Mayor Bloomberg prompted controversy \u2014 and lawsuits \u2014 last year when his administration proposed leasing parking lots and recreational areas to private developers to build market-rate housing.Mr. de Blasio has scuttled that proposal, saying the land should be used for affordable housing instead. But any future land development would bring in only a small fraction of the money needed, federal and city officials said.\u201cThe reality is that we have to think of a very diverse financial strategy, and development is one piece of it,\u201d Ms. Olatoye said.When the de Blasio administration announced an affordable housing strategy this year, officials said that public housing would have to be addressed separately. It was a testament to the system\u2019s vital role but also to the challenges facing the housing authority, including overcoming residents\u2019 fears that they could be displaced. Now the administration hopes to deliver a plan for public housing in December.Cutting overtime costs and transferring authority-run community spaces and social services to other city agencies are likely to be in the strategy. The agency is also planning to give individual housing projects responsibility over their own budgets and property management to make them more accountable.Ms. Olatoye said that she was seeking new ways to leverage public funds to raise private money and planned to make a \u201ccompelling\u201d case to the state to resume providing substantial support to public housing.The authority, by far the largest public housing agency in the country, is a big employer and a big spender, with 11,200 workers and annual spending of more than $3 billion. That, Ms. Olatoye said, cannot be ignored.\u201cThe notion that we contribute to the city and state economy and the state contributes nothing is a real conversation we need to have,\u201d she said.Nycha, while plagued by problems, has not had the levels of corruption and mismanagement seen in the county\u2019s most troubled housing authorities, according to the federal housing agency.But Scott M. Stringer, the city comptroller, whose office is conducting several audits of the housing authority, said the agency could do much better.He said his office had already identified \u201cvery serious\u201d issues involving the authority\u2019s capacity to spend funds efficiently and take advantage of opportunities that would bring in more money.\u201cThere\u2019s been a tradition of incompetence and lack of accountability,\u201d Mr. Stringer said.But even if officials succeed in addressing those problems, the authority has to do more to bring about fiscal solvency. Nycha gets almost one-third of its revenue from rents \u2014 which cannot exceed 30 percent of a tenant\u2019s income \u2014 and two-thirds from federal subsidies. The total is not covering costs, so for years the authority has had to tap reserves and capital funds to cover operating shortfalls.The group says that public housing is worthy of a major investment, comparable to the hundreds of millions of dollars the city and state have invested in baseball stadiums. Mayor de Blasio and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo \u201chave to show a commitment to Nycha and that commitment has to be capital,\u201d said Victor Bach, a senior housing policy analyst with the group.In the meantime, many residents of the authority\u2019s 2,600 buildings live with chronic leaks, mold and maintenance problems, and hundreds of apartments sit empty awaiting work. The buildings in most desperate shape need major renovations, like the replacement of roofs, facades, plumbing and heating systems, but have equipment nearing or beyond the end of its useful life. \u201cBasically,\u201d said Dr. Nicholas D. Bloom, a public housing expert and associate professor at the New York Institute of Technology, \u201cit\u2019s a 1950s automobile that New York City is still driving. It\u2019s like Cuba.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Behind Closed Doors, Obama Crafts Executive Actions", "Date": "2014-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 When President Obama announced in June that he planned to bypass congressional gridlock and overhaul the nation\u2019s immigration system on his own, he did so in a most public way: a speech in the White House Rose Garden.Since then, the process of drafting what will likely be the only significant immigration changes of his presidency \u2014 and his most consequential use of executive power \u2014 has been conducted almost entirely behind closed doors, where lobbyists and interest groups invited to the White House are making their case out of public view.Mr. Obama\u2019s increasingly expansive appetite for the use of unilateral action on issues including immigration, tax policy and gay rights has emboldened activists and businesses to flock to the administration with their policy wish lists. It also has opened the president, already facing charges of executive overreach, to criticism that he is presiding over opaque policy-making, with the potential to reward political backers at the expense of other interests, including some on the losing side who are threatening to sue.\u201cWe look at what they\u2019ve been doing with executive action and are deeply concerned, and have focused a lot of our energies on how we can roll back these things,\u201d said Geoff Burr, the vice president of federal affairs for Associated Builders and Contractors, whose member companies do 60 percent of federal construction jobs.Mr. Burr said an executive order issued by Mr. Obama last month that would block companies with a history of workplace violations from receiving federal contracts had prompted his group to contemplate \u201cthe virtues of a litigation strategy.\u201dWhite House officials say Mr. Obama has been inclusive as he looks to wield his authority, reaching out to an array of lawmakers, experts and business leaders for a wide range of perspectives to inform his plans for executive actions. Since the president first announced his intention to use his \u201cpen and phone\u201d to advance his agenda during his State of the Union address in January, White House officials have held weekly meetings to compile ideas from inside and outside the administration.\u201cThe president has been clear that he will use all of the tools at his disposal, working with Congress where they are willing but also taking action on his own where they aren\u2019t, to expand opportunity for all Americans and help more families share in our economy\u2019s continued progress,\u201d said Jennifer Friedman, a White House spokeswoman. \u201cAs part of this process, the administration has engaged a wide range of stakeholders and has solicited input from groups and individuals representing a diverse set of views.\u201dActivists and business groups that stand to gain from the moves are eagerly providing the White House with their side of the case.On a host of issues, the list of requests is growing. Technology companies would like Mr. Obama to provide more visas for their workers, or at least more flexibility for them and their families as they await green cards for permanent residency. Consumer groups and organized labor want the Treasury Department to act on its own to limit financial incentives for companies that move overseas for tax breaks and stop so-called inversions. Democratic lawmakers are joining in as well, asking the president to act on his own on their pet issues.The go-it-alone approach has left the administration \u2014 which claims to be the most transparent in United States history \u2014 essentially making policy from the White House, replacing congressional hearings and floor debates with closed meetings for invited constituencies. \u200b\u201cThe executive branch is not really set up to be a deliberative body like the Congress is,\u201d said Andrew Rudalevige, a government professor at Bowdoin College who has studied the consequences of executive action. \u201cThe process is certainly stacked toward the policy preferences of the administration, and they\u2019re going to listen to the people they think are right, which usually means the ones who agree with them.\u201cThose who are \u2018in\u2019 will engage the White House and the agencies to get their priorities met, and if you\u2019re \u2018out,\u2019 you turn to the legal process\u201d to challenge the executive action after it is taken, he said.When the president vowed in the Rose Garden in June to \u201cfix as much of our immigration system as I can on my own,\u201d immigration activists were ready with their list of potential executive actions. They range from giving certain categories of undocumented immigrants temporary \u201cparole in place\u201d status to stay in the United States, to essentially legalizing millions more by expanding a 2012 directive issued by Mr. Obama that grants work permits and deportation deferments to young immigrants brought illegally to the United States as children.The requests did not stop there. Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz, Mr. Obama\u2019s top immigration adviser and the domestic policy chief, has led meetings attended by White House political aides and lawyers to hear from interest groups, individual companies and business groups about what executive actions they believe the president should take on immigration.Senator Jeff Sessions, an Alabama Republican and one of the staunchest opponents of the stalled immigration bill Mr. Obama advocated, criticized the process. \u201cIt is chilling to consider now that these groups, frustrated in their aims by our constitutional system of government, are plotting with the Obama administration to collect their spoils through executive fiat,\u201d he said.As recommendations pour in, the most frequent question Mr. Obama\u2019s aides are asking, the people involved said, is whether the moves could withstand a legal challenge, which comes as House Republicans voted to sue Mr. Obama for unilateral action in changing elements of his signature health care law.Professor Shay, a top Treasury official during Obama\u2019s first term who now teaches at Harvard Law School, was asked by the group to craft a legal justification for the administration to act without congressional approval. Professor Shay wrote an article in the trade journal Tax Notes in July, asserting that the president\u2019s team had broad authority to do so.\u201cWe asked his advice as to how to bring this forward to the administration,\u201d said Nell Geiser, the associate director of retail initiatives at Change to Win, who said Professor Shay\u2019s connections at the Treasury were vital. \u201cHe knew all the personalities and their dynamics.\u201dOn other issues, the president has been under pressure to act on his own for years. When Mr. Obama announced in June that he would soon sign executive orders to fulfill his 2008 campaign promise to bar discrimination by federal contractors on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, gay rights activists pressed for the broadest possible protection. In private White House meetings, they lobbied successfully against including a new exemption being sought by religious groups; the order was signed July 21.\u201cHe\u2019s using just a vast array of different means to pursue his various goals,\u201d John T. Woolley, a politics professor at the university who maintains the executive order database and studies presidential use of unilateral action.Mr. Obama \u201chas been quite aggressive and he\u2019s been creative in looking for every possible avenue to take matters into his own hands,\u201d Mr. Woolley said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Foreign Political and Banking Woes Make Investors Wary", "Date": "2014-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStocks declined for a second day on Friday, adding to a large sell-off the day before and giving the market its worst week in two years.Faced with growing geopolitical concerns in Israel and Ukraine and banking problems in Europe, investors found little reason to move money into stocks.For the last two years, investors have generally wanted to step in to buy during any major drop in the stock market, traders said, causing any sell-off to be followed with modest buying. Friday\u2019s decline was \u201cvery telling,\u201d said Jonathan Corpina, a trader on the New York Stock Exchange with Meridian Equity Partners. \u201cThe end of this week could not come at a better time as the weekend might provide some stability.\u201dOn Friday, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index lost 5.52 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,925.15. The index fell 2.7 percent this week, its worst weekly performance since June 2012.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 69.93 points, or 0.4 percent, to 16,493.37. That\u2019s on top of the 317-point drop the index had on Thursday. The Nasdaq fell 17.13 points, or 0.4 percent, to 4,352.64. Concerns over Argentina as well as with European banks were the biggest driver of Friday\u2019s market decline, said Jonathan Golub, chief United States market strategist at RBC Capital Markets. On Friday, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association ruled that Argentina had officially defaulted on its bonds for the second time in 13 years. In Portugal, shares of the struggling bank Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo plunged 40 percent after it reported on Wednesday a 3.5 billion euro net loss for the second quarter. Adding to the uncertainty was the violence between Gaza and Israel, and the conflict in Ukraine. \u201cThe market doesn\u2019t like anything that could potentially disrupt the credit markets,\u201d Mr. Golub said, noting that indicators of market volatility jumped on Friday.Investors did get some good news about the United States economy. The Labor Department said that employers created 209,000 jobs in July, while the unemployment rate rose to 6.2 percent from 6.1 percent. July was the sixth consecutive month that employers created more than 200,000 jobs, a sign that the economy continues to recover. But that means the Federal Reserve may not be there to hold investors\u2019 hands for much longer. The central bank said on Wednesday that it would cut back its bond-buying program again, and investors now appear to believe that the Fed will raise interest rates starting next year.The Fed\u2019s stimulus efforts, combined with the growing economy, have helped push the stock market higher. The last time stocks had a correction, meaning a decline of 10 percent or more in a benchmark index like the S.&P. 500, was nearly three years ago. They typically happen every 18 months.Procter & Gamble was among the day\u2019s winners. The stock rose $2.33, or 3 percent, to $79.65. The consumer products giant said it earned an adjusted profit of 95 cents a share, 4 cents better than analysts had expected. P.&G. helped lift other consumer staples companies, making the industry the best-performing industry in the S.&P. 500.In other trading, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 18/32, to 100 1/32, and its yield fell to 2.49 percent from 2.56 on Thursday. The price of gold rose $12.30 to $1,293.60 an ounce, and the price of oil fell to the lowest level since Feb. 6. Benchmark crude oil dropped 29 cents to $97.88 a barrel, and ended the week with a loss of $4.21 a barrel, or 4 percent. Advertisement"}

Hong\u2019s new book, \u201cThe Birth of Korean Cool: How One Nation Is Conquering the World Through Pop Culture,\u201d loosely follows South Korea\u2019s growth from the mid-60s, when the country\u2019s per capita G.D.P. was less than Ghana\u2019s, to now. Today, South Korea is the 15th-largest economy in the world.

{"Headline": "The Draw of the New City-States", "Date": "2014-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLondon is in the midst of a boom so giddy it has parted company with the rest of Britain. Construction is everywhere, from the new towers of the City of London (a global financial center larger than Wall Street) to the mansions of Kensington (where the world\u2019s superwealthy burrow below ground to accommodate staff quarters and the de rigueur swimming pool) to ever-hipper eastern districts like Hoxton (sought after by the ordinary mortals driven from the center).Money does not precisely gush from every home, business and storefront in central London, as it did before the meltdown of 2008, but it oozes again in sticky abundance. House prices in London have jumped about 19 percent in a year. The London economy is set to grow by over 4 percent this year in a nation that, elsewhere, struggles to shake off stagnation. The capital has become a glittering enclave in a country often resentful of its dominance. It presides with spiffy superiority, like squeaky-clean Singapore looking down on dusty Southeast Asia.There is talk of a bubble. Nobody cares. Foreign money pours in, to the City and its immediate surroundings, where the Shard skyscraper now rises over 1,000 feet, but also into houses and apartments often used only a few weeks a year. In Belgravia, Mayfair and Marylebone the oligarchs of Kazakhstan, the oil-rich of the Gulf and the newly affluent of Asia bivouac with their staffs. They shop, oblivious to the displaced masses with day jobs. The average masters of the universe in London, unlike those in the United States, can enjoy residency without being taxed on global income.Large numbers of luxury properties sit empty most of the time, palatial slivers of big portfolios. If Vladimir V. Putin is serious about defending Russian speakers wherever they are, he may have to annex the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, where Russian is a lingua franca on the King\u2019s Road.None of this will be unfamiliar to New Yorkers. The other great global city \u2014 like London a magnet to strivers of every kind and home to every kind of bad English \u2014 has its own bubble. It sucks in money from across the globe, even without those tax advantages. Real estate prices soar. Ordinary people are pushed out. As in London, far-flung districts rise. Bushwick has arrived; East New York looms. New York is a world apart, even if its relative weight in the national economy is much smaller than that of the British capital.What draws the world to London and New York is opportunity. That\u2019s fine, of course. But they are also magnets to people looking for a safe place for their money. Having made it big in autocratic countries with parlous legal systems (if that), a cowed press and rampant corruption \u2014 say, Russia and China \u2014 oligarchs and crony capitalists wake up one day and find that, gosh, they like nothing as much as democratic systems under the rule of law held accountable by an independent press. Having trashed the West, they trust the West with their money.This then is the way the world works: Autocratic hypercapitalism without Western checks and balances produces new elites whose dream is an American or British lifestyle and education for their children, and whose other goal, knowing how their own capricious systems really function, is to buy into the rule of law by acquiring real estate, driving up prices in prime markets to the point where the middle classes of those countries, with incomes often stagnant or falling, are pushed aside.This process is mirrored at the national level, where the bargain is that American debt is bought by Asian governments, notably the Chinese, and Asians make money through access to credit-fueled American markets and consumers. Asians lend America money to police the world: Their new wealth depends on American-underwritten stability. They know it. Surface conflict often masks inextricable connectedness.London and New York, with roughly the same populations, have become booming city-states that reflect 21st-century openness and fluidity, but also the skewed economics and growing inequalities of a world where finance has outflanked the law and the global rich find ways to game a system that holds the majority in its grip.In London during these boom times, the disparities can feel obscene. Still, London does the public sphere, like bike schemes, road surfaces and the subway, much better than New York. It is a European city, after all. But it sits in a middling nation well past its zenith. New York does power, directness and steak a lot better than London. It races and churns. London carries on.Take your pick. In the end it\u2019s personal. Waiting for a table the other day in a New York restaurant, I was asked for my name. As I spelled it out, the ma\u00eetre d\u2019h\u00f4tel interrupted me: \u201cOf course, of the priestly class,\u201d he said, referring to the name Cohen given to the high priests of ancient Israel.That would not happen in London.Roger Cohen\u2019s column on Saturday, about London\u2019s financial boom, gave an incorrect location for the Shard skyscraper.

It\u2019s in our cars and our carpets, we wrap it around the food we eat and virtually every other product we consume; it has become a key lubricant of globalization \u2014 but it\u2019s choking our future in ways that most of us are barely aware.I have just returned with a team of scientists from six weeks at sea conducting research in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch \u2014 one of five major garbage patches drifting in the oceans north and south of the Equator at the latitude of our great terrestrial deserts. Although it was my 10th voyage to the area, I was utterly shocked to see the enormous increase in the quantity of plastic waste since my last trip in 2009. Plastics of every description, from toothbrushes to tires to unidentifiable fragments too numerous to count floated past our marine research vessel Alguita for hundreds of miles without end. We even came upon a floating island bolstered by dozens of plastic buoys used in oyster aquaculture that had solid areas you could walk on.Plastics are now one of the most common pollutants of ocean waters worldwide. Pushed by winds, tides and currents, plastic particles form with other debris into large swirling glutinous accumulation zones, known to oceanographers as gyres, which comprise as much as 40 percent of the planet\u2019s ocean surface \u2014 roughly 25 percent of the entire earth.No scientist, environmentalist, entrepreneur, national or international government agency has yet been able to establish a comprehensive way of recycling the plastic trash that covers our land and inevitably blows and washes down to the sea.\u00a0In a 2010 study of the Los Angeles and San Gabriel Rivers, my colleagues and I estimated that some 2.3 billion pieces of plastic \u2014 from polystyrene foam to tiny fragments and pellets \u2014 had flowed from Southern California\u2019s urban centers into its coastal waters in just three days of sampling.The deleterious consequences of humanity\u2019s \u201cplastic footprint\u201d are many, some known and some yet to be discovered. We know that plastics biodegrade exceptionally slowly, breaking into tiny fragments in a centuries-long process. We know that plastic debris entangles and slowly kills millions of sea creatures; that hundreds of species mistake plastics for their natural food, ingesting toxicants that cause liver and stomach abnormalities in fish and birds, often choking them to death. We know that one of the main bait fish in the ocean, the lantern fish, eats copious quantities of plastic fragments, threatening their future as a nutritious food source to the tuna, salmon, and other pelagic fish we consume, adding to the increasing amount of synthetic chemicals unknown before 1950 that we now carry in our bodies.We suspect that more animals are killed by vagrant plastic waste than by even climate change \u2014 a hypothesis that needs to be seriously tested. During our most recent voyage, we studied the effects of pollution, taking blood and liver samples from fish as we searched for invasive species and plastic-linked pollutants that cause protein and hormone abnormalities. While we hope our studies will yield important contributions to scientific knowledge, they address but a small part of a broader issue.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the United States supports environmentalist groups that remove debris from beaches. But the\u00a0sieve-like skimmers they use, no matter how technologically sophisticated, will never be able to clean up remote garbage gyres: There\u2019s too much turbulent ocean dispersing and mixing up the mess. The problem is compounded by the aquaculture industry, which uses enormous amounts of plastic in its floats, nets, lines and tubes. The most common floats and tubes I\u2019ve found in the deep ocean and on Hawaiian beaches come from huge sea-urchin and oyster farms like the one that created the oyster-buoy island we discovered. Those buoys were torn from their moorings by the tsunami that walloped Japan on March 11, 2011. But no regulatory remedies exist to deal with tons of plastic equipment lost accidentally and in storms. Government and industry organizations purporting to certify sustainably farmed seafood, despite their dozens of pages of standards, fail to mention gear that is lost and floats away. Governments, which are rightly concerned with depletion of marine food sources, should ensure that plastic from cages, buoys and other equipment used for aquaculture does not escape into the waters.But, in the end, the real challenge is to combat an economic model that thrives on wasteful products and packaging, and leaves the associated problem of clean-up costs. Changing the way we produce and consume plastics is a challenge greater than reining in our production of carbon dioxide.Plastics are a nightmare to recycle. They are very hard to clean. They can melt at low temperatures, so impurities are not vaporized. It makes no difference whether a synthetic polymer like polyethylene is derived from petroleum or plants; it is still a persistent pollutant.\u00a0Biodegradable plastics exist, but manufacturers are quick to point out that marine degradable does not mean \u201cmarine disposable.\u201dScientists in Britain and the Netherlands have proposed to cut plastic pollution by the institution of a \u201ccircular economy.\u201d The basic concept is that products must be designed with end-of-life recovery in mind. They propose a precycling premium to provide incentives to eliminate the possibility that a product will become waste.In the United States, especially in California, the focus has been on so-called structural controls, such as covering gutters and catch basins with screens. This has reduced the amount of debris flowing down rivers to the sea. Activists around the world are lobbying for bans on the most polluting plastics \u2014 the bottles, bags and containers that deliver food and drink. Many have been successful. In California, nearly 100 municipalities have passed ordinances banning throwaway plastic bags and the Senate is considering a statewide ban.Until we shut off the flow of plastic to the sea, the newest global threat to our Anthropocene age will only get worse.

The suicide bomber, driving a Toyota Corolla, detonated the explosives near two heavily armored coalition vehicles, according to Hashmat Stanikzai, the spokesman for the Kabul police chief.The blast killed four civilians: two women, a child and a man. No coalition soldiers were injured, officials with the International Security Assistance Force said, adding that an investigation was underway. The Taliban quickly claimed responsibility for the assault, which they said had killed eight foreigners. The Interior Ministry condemned the attack.Kabul has had relatively few episodes of violence in recent weeks. Though the insurgents have repeatedly fired rockets at the airport and carried out a broad campaign of violence across the country, the suicide bombings that have been a hallmark of the war have been less common in the capital. But the city has been gripped by the election crisis unfolding in Afghanistan, with two candidates vying to replace President Hamid Karzai fighting over an audit of a runoff vote and jockeying for position in a potential unity government.The uncertainty over the election has hampered efforts to forge a new path in the country, just as security appears to be deteriorating in certain areas. With no clear leader, the strategies for combating the insurgency and righting an unsteady economy remain unclear.The Taliban have taken advantage of the uncertainty, striking areas once relatively free of insurgent attacks and consolidating their gains in parts of the country that were once contested.Fazl Rahman Muzhary contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hit the Reset Button in Your Brain", "Date": "2014-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionTHIS month, many Americans will take time off from work to go on vacation, catch up on household projects and simply be with family and friends. And many of us will feel guilty for doing so. We will worry about all of the emails piling up at work, and in many cases continue to compulsively check email during our precious time off.But beware the false break. Make sure you have a real one. The summer vacation is more than a quaint tradition. Along with family time, mealtime and weekends, it is an important way that we can make the most of our beautiful brains.Every day we\u2019re assaulted with facts, pseudofacts, news feeds and jibber-jabber, coming from all directions. According to a 2011 study, on a typical day, we take in the equivalent of about 174 newspapers\u2019 worth of information, five times as much as we did in 1986. As the world\u2019s 21,274 television stations produce some 85,000 hours of original programming every day (by 2003 figures), we watch an average of five hours of television per day. For every hour of YouTube video you watch, there are 5,999 hours of new video just posted! If you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, there\u2019s a reason: The processing capacity of the conscious mind is limited. This is a result of how the brain\u2019s attentional system evolved. Our brains have two dominant modes of attention: the task-positive network and the task-negative network (they\u2019re called networks because they comprise distributed networks of neurons, like electrical circuits within the brain). The task-positive network is active when you\u2019re actively engaged in a task, focused on it, and undistracted; neuroscientists have taken to calling it the central executive. The task-negative network is active when your mind is wandering; this is the daydreaming mode. These two attentional networks operate like a seesaw in the brain: when one is active the other is not. This two-part attentional system is one of the crowning achievements of the human brain, and the focus it enables allowed us to harness fire, build the pyramids, discover penicillin and decode the entire human genome. Those projects required some plain old-fashioned stick-to-itiveness. But the insight that led to them probably came from the daydreaming mode. This brain state, marked by the flow of connections among disparate ideas and thoughts, is responsible for our moments of greatest creativity and insight, when we\u2019re able to solve problems that previously seemed unsolvable. You might be going for a walk or grocery shopping or doing something that doesn\u2019t require sustained attention and suddenly \u2014 boom \u2014 the answer to a problem that had been vexing you suddenly appears. This is the mind-wandering mode, making connections among things that we didn\u2019t previously see as connected. A third component of the attentional system, the attentional filter, helps to orient our attention, to tell us what to pay attention to and what we can safely ignore. This undoubtedly evolved to alert us to predators and other dangerous situations. The constant flow of information from Twitter, Facebook, Vine, Instagram, text messages and the like engages that system, and we find ourselves not sustaining attention on any one thing for very long \u2014 the curse of the information age.My collaborator Vinod Menon, a professor of neuroscience at Stanford, and I showed that the switch between daydreaming and attention is controlled in a part of the brain called the insula, an important structure about an inch or so beneath the surface of the top of your skull. Switching between two external objects involves the temporal-parietal junction. If the relationship between the central executive system and the mind-wandering system is like a seesaw, then the insula \u2014 the attentional switch \u2014 is like an adult holding one side down so that the other stays up in the air. The efficacy of this switch varies from person to person, in some functioning smoothly, in others rather rusty. But switch it does, and if it is called upon to switch too often, we feel tired and a bit dizzy, as though we were seesawing too rapidly. Every status update you read on Facebook, every tweet or text message you get from a friend, is competing for resources in your brain with important things like whether to put your savings in stocks or bonds, where you left your passport or how best to reconcile with a close friend you just had an argument with. If you want to be more productive and creative, and to have more energy, the science dictates that you should partition your day into project periods. Your social networking should be done during a designated time, not as constant interruptions to your day. Email, too, should be done at designated times. An email that you know is sitting there, unread, may sap attentional resources as your brain keeps thinking about it, distracting you from what you\u2019re doing. What might be in it? Who\u2019s it from? Is it good news or bad news? It\u2019s better to leave your email program\u00a0off\u00a0than to hear that constant ping and know that you\u2019re ignoring messages.Increasing creativity will happen naturally as we tame the multitasking and immerse ourselves in a single task for sustained periods of, say, 30 to 50 minutes. Several studies have shown that a walk in nature or listening to music can trigger the mind-wandering mode. This acts as a neural reset button, and provides much needed perspective on what you\u2019re doing. Daydreaming leads to creativity, and creative activities teach us agency, the ability to change the world, to mold it to our liking, to have a positive effect on our environment. Music, for example, turns out to be an effective method for improving attention, building up self-confidence, social skills and a sense of engagement. This radical idea \u2014 that problem solving might take some time and doesn\u2019t always have to be accomplished immediately \u2014 could have profound effects on decision making and even on our economy. Consider this: By some estimates, preventable medical error is the third leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for hundreds of thousands of deaths each year. You want your diagnostician to give the right answer, not always the quickest one. Zoning out is not always bad. You don\u2019t want your airline pilot or air traffic controller to do it while they\u2019re on the job, but you do want them to have opportunities to reset \u2014 this is why air traffic control and other high-attention jobs typically require frequent breaks. Several studies have shown that people who work overtime reach a point of diminishing returns.Taking breaks is biologically restorative. Naps are even better. In several studies, a nap of even 10 minutes improved cognitive function and vigor, and decreased sleepiness and fatigue. If we can train ourselves to take regular vacations \u2014 true vacations without work \u2014 and to set aside time for naps and contemplation, we will be in a more powerful position to start solving some of the world\u2019s big problems. And to be happier and well rested while we\u2019re doing it.The director of the Laboratory for Music, Cognition and Expertise at McGill University and the author of \u201cThe Organized Mind: Thinking Straight in the Age of Information Overload.\u201d Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Miami Grows Up. A Little.", "Date": "2014-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMIAMI \u2014 IF you had asked me what I wanted when I was 12 years old, I probably would have said, \u201cto marry a plastic surgeon.\u201dYou can hardly blame me: I was growing up in Miami. My life plan elegantly combined the city\u2019s worship of bodies and money, and its indifference to how you came by either. When I left for college, I put Miami behind me, and tried to have a life of the mind. I got a graduate degree. I traveled. I even married a fellow writer, whose only real estate was a dingy one-bedroom apartment in Paris, where we lived.But with kids came long summer pilgrimages to Miami to see family. It took a lot of effort to keep spurning the city, especially since the weather was so good. Miami had grown up a bit, and so had I. Hadn\u2019t it developed a soul beneath its vapid, extremely pleasant, slightly menacing exterior? If I understood Miami better, could I grow to like it? Maybe I was the problem? Like practically everyone who grew up in Miami, I knew little about its history. We were more worried about mangoes falling on our cars. It took just a bit of reading to realize that Florida had always attracted people with \u201can inordinate desire to get rich quickly with a minimum of physical effort,\u201d as the economist John Kenneth Galbraith once described them. And if the Miami of my childhood had the temperament of a spoiled teenager, that\u2019s because, effectively, it was one. The city was founded in 1896, but for its first 60 years or so it was a segregated backwater, with fewer than a million people. (Despite the occasional celebrity sighting, \u201cThere was nothing, not even a Neiman Marcus,\u201d someone who lived there in the 1950s told me).The 1959 Cuban revolution was modern Miami\u2019s unofficial birthday. Over the next 20 years, practically the entire Cuban upper class arrived. Many other Cubans followed. One of my neighbors in the 1970s had been imprisoned by Fidel Castro\u2019s government. Another was doing his best to overthrow it. After the 1980 Mariel boatlift, which brought 125,000 more Cubans to Florida, surprised-looking children who spoke no English suddenly appeared in my sixth-grade class. Colombians, Nicaraguans and others arrived later. The upper-class Cubans who became Miami\u2019s new aristocracy had little trouble adapting to the city\u2019s materialistic ethos. After all, they had been forced to leave all their stuff in Cuba. Soon there were two dominant modes of conversation in Miami: discussions about where to get your hair done, and anti-Castro rants. In recent summers, I\u2019ve found that Miami isn\u2019t that city anymore. Young Latinos \u2014 no longer burdened with the myth that they\u2019ll one day return \u201chome\u201d \u2014 adore their American hometown. They major in Spanish literature at Florida universities, gush about Miami\u2019s weather, and get sentimental about stone crabs, Cuban coffee and buying avocados out of the trunks of cars. The area\u2019s remaining \u201cAnglos\u201d \u2014 now just 15 percent of the population \u2014 want their kids to learn Spanish. (Confusingly, Miami\u2019s Latinos call these Anglos \u201cAmericans.\u201d) MIAMI even has a homegrown dialect. Young Latinos \u2014 regardless of whether they even know Spanish \u2014 speak English with a Spanish twang. To non-Miamians, they sound like extremely fluent immigrants. Phillip M. Carter, a linguist at Florida International University, says that when young born-and-bred Miamians visit the rest of America, or even Boca Raton, people often ask them what country they\u2019re from. \u201cMiami English\u201d is also proof that a city can be international but not cosmopolitan. People typically don\u2019t realize they\u2019re speaking a dialect unless they leave Miami, Mr. Carter says. Most locals also don\u2019t seem bothered that Miami is one of America\u2019s most unequal cities, with lots of very poor people living close to rich ones. Miami\u2019s have-nots are easy to ignore, since \u2014 if they\u2019re not cleaning your house or parking your car \u2014 you just drive past them. Still, Miami has gotten more interesting, just by existing a while longer. Its buzzing new arts scene is a start. \u201cI think Miami is now trying to figure out a way to be a center of ideas and brains,\u201d the urban-studies theorist Richard Florida told me. For the moment, though, Miami looks like a giant construction project. After a several-year lull that started in 2008, luxury condominiums are shooting up again, often right next to each other. The local economy still runs on selling bits of land to newcomers.And while there are some thinkers scattered around town, Miami is overrun with lawyers, jewelry designers and personal trainers, all trying to sell services to one another. \u201cInjured on a cruise ship?\u201d reads a sign on South Dixie Highway, one of the city\u2019s main thoroughfares. My recent stay coincided with Miami Spa Month, a bathing-suit fashion week, and a \u201ccamming\u201d convention for stars of do-it-yourself pornography. While dropping off my rental car, I met a Central American woman who made extra cash picking up people at the airport and driving them to their appointments for cut-rate breast enlargements. I wanted to fall for the place. I\u2019m a third-generation Miamian. I\u2019m fond of it. I\u2019m an expatriate, so it\u2019s the only American city I can still legitimately claim. Many of its faults \u2014 especially its inordinate interest in shopping \u2014 are my own too. And it\u2019s obvious why people like it here. After two weeks, I\u2019d swum so many laps that the flaps of fat on my arms, which I\u2019d assumed were an inevitable consequence of middle age, were nearly gone.But still, compared with the Miamians, I felt practically deformed. And I struggled to have conversations that weren\u2019t about real estate or consumption. There was a lot of pleasure in Miami, but not enough surprising interactions and ideas. Miami may one day be the city for normal-looking people with semi-intellectual aspirations and a mild social conscience. But it\u2019s not there yet. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Midterms Give Parties Chance for Sweeping Control of States", "Date": "2014-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne-Party RuleLAS VEGAS \u2014 It was over 100 degrees here the other evening, but inside a buzzing office tucked away on a stretch of gun stores and pornography shops, Democrats were staring into computer screens and talking urgently into cellphones. The stakes were high: The Nevada Senate, which Democrats control by a single seat, could very well shift into Republican hands after November.\u201cHi, this is Justin Jones; I\u2019m your state senator,\u201d said Mr. Jones, a Democrat who won by only 301 votes two years ago. \u201cWe have a really important election campaign coming up this fall. I wanted to see if I could count on your support.\u201dPause.\u201cGreat, Ronald, that\u2019s fantastic.\u201dIt is not only Nevada. Republicans, who had appeared to hit a high-water mark in control of statehouses in recent years, are seeking to pick off another half-dozen chambers this year, taking advantage of President Obama\u2019s persistent unpopularity, anxiety about the economy, and a history of anemic turnout among Democrats in nonpresidential election years. In addition, the party that controls the White House almost always loses seats in statehouses in those years.At a time when Democrats and Republicans in control of statehouses are using their authority to push through ambitious policies that by contrast highlight the paralysis in Washington, the potential for further Republican gains has raised the possibility of deepening the policy divide between red and blue states. Republicans now control 59 of the 98 partisan legislative chambers, and have complete political control \u2014 both legislative houses and the governor\u2019s mansion \u2014 in 23 states, while Democrats control 13. The total number of states ruled by a single political party, 36, is the highest in six decades.Officials from both parties say there are two states that the Republicans might be able to add to the list of places where they enjoy complete control \u2014 Iowa and Arkansas. (There are no similar opportunities for Democrats.) Given that, Republicans this year are also looking to pick off individual chambers as a way of increasing their negotiating ability with Democratic governors and statehouses, or to block Democrats from passing legislation.Republicans are looking to take over senates in Colorado, Iowa, Oregon, Maine and Nevada, and houses in Kentucky, New Hampshire and West Virginia. Republicans could emerge with complete control of the legislatures in New Hampshire and Kentucky, though both of those states have Democratic governors.They hope these victories will help them push through legislation that has been stymied by Democrats until now, such as pressing the kind of restrictions on labor organizing the party passed in Wisconsin, or rolling back gun laws in Colorado. In Iowa, Republicans are looking to eliminate a tax on manufacturing and enact a ban there on telemedicine abortions, where women in rural areas obtain abortion pills after videoconference consultations with faraway doctors.Matt Walter, president of the Republican State Leadership Committee, which is spearheading the statehouse efforts, said, \u201cThe pattern is crystal-clear at this point, and Wisconsin is the best example of it: That ability to drive your agenda when you are completely in control of state government will absolutely continue to play out.\u201dMr. Walter said even picking up a house in a divided state was critical at a time when both parties are so ambitious. \u201cThe ability to restrain the other side from advancing their agenda very often comes down to a couple of seats in one chamber,\u201d he said.In Iowa, Democrats hold a two-seat edge in the Senate. The House is Republican, and Terry Branstad, the popular Republican governor, seems almost certain to win re-election. (Arkansas could also go all Republican if the party wins the governor\u2019s seat; that is complicated by what both parties acknowledge is one of the few bright spots for Democrats \u2014 the possibility of picking up the lower house there.)\u201cWe really believe we have tremendous opportunities in Iowa,\u201d said Bill Dix, the Republican minority leader in the Iowa Senate.Michael Gronstal, the Democratic majority leader of the Senate, said if Republicans take control next year, \u201cI would fully expect them to come in and try to make it harder for unions to organize in this state. They have proposed that kind of stuff in the House. It died in the Senate.\u201dThis looming battle is a reminder of the enduring political import of the 2010 midterm elections, in which Republicans, powered by the Tea Party and anger over Mr. Obama\u2019s health care program, picked up control of 23 state legislatures. These were the legislatures that oversaw redrawing legislative and congressional district lines in most states, typically in favor of the party in power, which has only enhanced their electoral prospects this year.The Democrats held 60 of the 99 bipartisan statehouses going into that election. Today, Republicans, even after losing some chambers in 2012, control about 55 percent of all state legislative seats.\u201cRepublicans are at historic highs,\u201d said Tim Storey of the National Conference of State Legislatures. \u201cYou have to go back to the 1950s to see this kind of Republican control in terms of seats. Their biggest challenge is their past success. These are tougher chambers for them to switch and pick up seats.\u201dIt is not a one-way battle, though: Democrats are pouring resources into taking back senates in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, as well as the houses in Arkansas and Iowa. Democrats are in a position to pick up some governors\u2019 seats in, among others, Pennsylvania and Florida.\u201cI think we have been on a good path to picking up more chambers,\u201d said Michael Sargeant, the executive director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, which works to elect Democrats to statehouses. \u201cWe took eight chambers from the Republicans in 2012.\u201dBut, he acknowledged: \u201cIt\u2019s a challenging political environment for lots of Democrats. I\u2019ve got to think the president\u2019s approval ratings will get better. The economy is getting better.\u201dThe majority of the most contested races are taking place in battleground states where Mr. Obama is viewed unfavorably and where Democratic turnout is expected to be low.\u201cThere are negative Obama coattails at this point,\u201d said Morgan Carroll, the Democratic president of the Senate in Colorado. \u201cFor those of us at the state level, it behooves us to make it known that we are not the federal level and we are not the president.\u201dFrank McNulty, a Republican and former House speaker in Colorado, said he would consider his party victorious even if Democrats continued to control the governor\u2019s seat and the Assembly. \u201cIf we pick up the Senate and nothing else, we return to 2011 and 2012, where nothing bad happens,\u201d he said. Ms. Carroll said that if Republicans take back the Senate and Gov. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat, loses re-election, it could set back some key Democratic initiatives, such as same-sex marriage.Strategists for both parties said they have seen a flood of contributions that indicated the importance of states in enacting policy at a time when Washington has been paralyzed; David and Charles G. Koch, who have become major financiers of conservative candidates, have begun advertising on behalf of three Republican State Senate candidates in Colorado.The intensity of the fight can been seen here in Nevada, even though a Republican takeover of the Senate would likely still leave Democrats in charge of the Assembly. The governor, Brian Sandoval, a Republican, appears to be breezing to re-election. Becky Harris, the Republican challenger to Mr. Jones, the state senator, said she never expected to become such a national figure when she agreed to run.\u201cI was encouraged to run for this seat, so I agreed to do it,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it was like, \u2018This is for control of the Senate.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018O.K., it\u2019s a state race.\u2019 I had no idea when I got into this race that it would be the kind of race where national politicians are looking at what happens in the Nevada State Legislature.\u201dONE-PARTY RULE: Articles in this series explore the\npolitics and policies of states controlled\nentirely by one party.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Calm After a Bank\u2019s Collapse in Portugal Could Signal Eurozone Resiliency", "Date": "2014-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYet financial markets were almost eerily calm on Monday. The Portuguese and European authorities unveiled overnight a rescue plan to divide Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo in two, quarantining the bank\u2019s problem assets and inflicting much of the financial pain on shareholders and some creditors.Portuguese government 10-year bonds, which carried a 15 percent risk premium two years ago, were trading Monday with a yield, or effective market interest rate, of only 3.7 percent. Main stock indexes in Europe were little changed, and the primary index in Portugal rose about 1 percent.The market reaction to the rescue plan could bode well for a larger, coming test of the Continent\u2019s resiliency. In October, the European Central Bank will disclose the results of its exhaustive review of the health of the eurozone\u2019s most important banks. The review could expose other lenders that, like Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo, have grave problems that have been covered up.Europe\u2019s mechanism for dealing with terminally ill banks is a work in progress at best. The bailout suggests that, at least with a relatively small lender like Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo, the system in its incomplete form was able to cope. But questions remain about the ability of regulators to head off government rescues.\u201cIt\u2019s good that they\u2019ve dealt with this expeditiously,\u201d Nicholas Spiro, managing director of Spiro Sovereign Strategy, a consultancy in London, said of the rescue. \u201cBut essentially, once more this is a state-sponsored bailout, which is precisely what eurozone leaders were trying to avoid.\u201dAnalysts were wary on Monday of drawing too much reassurance from the relatively orderly way that Portuguese and European Union regulators managed the rescue. The government of Portugal was able to draw on funds already set aside as part of an international bailout of the country. But countries like Italy, which also has a weak economy and many ailing banks, do not have such readily available funds.\u201cIf the problem is too big and the country is too weak, it might be difficult,\u201d said Bert Van Roosebeke, head of financial markets at the Center for European Policy, a research group in Freiburg, Germany.But working over the weekend in secret, the European Commission and regulators at the central bank put together a rescue plan that they announced around midnight on Sunday. The speed of the rescue showed that the sometimes creaky machinery of European government could move quickly in a crisis.Under the plan, Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo\u2019s healthy businesses, as well as employees, will be transferred to a new bank, which will continue to serve customers as usual. The bank\u2019s bad loans and other problems will remain at the existing legal entity, which will eventually close.In the spirit of new European Union rules intended to protect taxpayers from bank failures, Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo shareholders and so-called subordinated bond holders \u2014 those who agreed to take more risk in return for a higher return \u2014 will have claims only on the so-called bad bank. As a result, they will bear much of the cost and could lose all of their investment.There are likely to be plenty of questions in the weeks to come about why regulators and auditors failed to recognize the gravity of Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo\u2019s problems until it was too late. As recently as May, the bank was able to sell investors \u20ac1 billion in new shares, which have since lost 80 percent of their value.In theory, the central bank, which this year will take over the responsibility of supervising large banks, will have more resources to detect problems and be less susceptible to local political pressure.\u201cThe E.C.B. will be more autonomous than local players have been,\u201d said Nicolas V\u00e9ron, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels.While shareholders stand to absorb much of the losses, taxpayers will still wind up financing a big part of the rescue. Officially, the money for the \u20ac4.9 billion bailout is coming from a resolution fund bankrolled by the financial industry. But because the fund does not have nearly enough cash, the government is lending it \u20ac4.4 billion. If all goes well, the healthy part of Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo will later be sold and the proceeds will be used to reimburse taxpayers.It is not clear whether even a sanitized version of Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo will be worth enough to repay the loan. Because the Portuguese government is using money from a fund established by other European countries, taxpayers in Germany, France, Finland or other eurozone countries could ultimately wind up paying the tab.For the moment, investors do not appear to believe that Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo is symptomatic of a broader banking problem in the eurozone.\u201cMarkets have been unperturbed by the eurozone for quite some time,\u201d Mr. Spiro said. \u201cThey are viewing this as an idiosyncratic, isolated case.\u201d\u201cIf this kind of thing had happened prior to July 2012,\u201d he said, referring to the turning point in the eurozone crisis, \u201cPortugal would have gone down in flames.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Housing Starts Rally to Reach 8-Month High", "Date": "2014-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHousing starts surged to an eight-month high in July, suggesting that the nation\u2019s housing market recovery was back on track after stalling in the second half of last year.While the rebound points to sustained economic strength, other data released on Tuesday showed that inflation was largely under wraps, which could give the Federal Reserve room to maintain its ultra-easy monetary policy stance for a bit longer.\u201cThe Fed will find these data further supportive of the go-it-slow approach to exiting its accommodative policies,\u201d said Dan Greenhaus, chief strategist at BTIG in New York.Groundbreaking for housing jumped 15.7 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.09 million units, the highest level since November, the Commerce Department said. The increase ended two months of declines and beat economists\u2019 forecasts of a rise to 969,000 units.It was the latest sign the market was regaining its footing after being slammed by an increase in interest rates last year. A shortage of properties for sale has also lifted prices, pushing housing out of reach for many first-time customers.Separately, the Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index edged up 0.1 percent last month as declining energy costs partly offset increases in food and rent. The index increased 0.3 percent in June. In the 12 months through July, it increased 2 percent after advancing 2.1 percent in June.While the core C.P.I., which omits volatile food and energy costs, edged up 0.1 percent for a second straight month, economists said there was no evidence that the underlying trend in inflation was shifting lower. In the year through July, the core C.P.I. was up 1.9 percent. The Fed sets a target of 2 percent inflation, but it tracks an index that is running lower than the C.P.I. Many economists do not expect the central bank to raise benchmark rates before the middle of next year, given sluggish wage growth. It has kept rates near zero since December 2008.\u201cLimited inflation and stronger housing are nothing but good news since they imply good growth ahead without the Fed having to move prematurely,\u201d said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa.Stocks rose on the data, with home builders such as Pulte Group and D. R. Horton rallying. The PHLX housing sector index was up 1.7 percent in midafternoon trading, outperforming the broader market.In another bright sign, Home Depot reported second-quarter earnings that exceeded Wall Street\u2019s expectations, and it raised its full-year profit forecast, sending its shares up 5.9 percent.Groundbreaking for single-family homes, the largest part of the market, increased 8.3 percent in July to a seven-month high. Starts for the volatile multifamily segment jumped 33 percent to the highest level since January 2006. This market is being buoyed by a shift toward renting, as many prospective buyers put aside the dream of owning a house. Building permits increased 8.1 percent, the largest gain since April 2013. The recovery in starts and permits \u201cputs us back on a modest trend for residential investment activity,\u201d said Bricklin Dwyer, an economist at BNP Paribas in New York. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Scottish Independence Relates to Larger Tax Fights", "Date": "2014-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The roiling debate over Scottish independence from Britain \u2014 set to be decided by a referendum in Scotland next month \u2014 has thrust the usually sleepy area of national currencies into the spotlight.Anti-independence politicians have argued that moving off the British pound could damage Scotland. Pro-independence groups have replied that Scotland could keep the pound. The dispute has become a centerpiece of the independence debate.And the dispute is also part of a larger question that extends well beyond Britain, to Texas and Colorado, for example, and elsewhere: What are the benefits and drawbacks of larger, politically diverse countries, compared with smaller, more homogeneous ones?The anti-independence side in Britain \u2014 which calls itself \u201cBetter Together\u201d \u2014 has begun emphasizing that being part of a larger country brings big economic benefits to Scotland. Yes, the Scots may have less autonomy \u2014 and currently live under a Tory-led government for which few of them voted. But they also receive a substantial amount of revenue from affluent London taxpayers and have the benefits of using the British pound.In Britain, English voters appear to be demanding a hard line with Scotland whatever the outcome of the referendum on Sept. 18, a new survey shows. Many English voters want Scots to understand that being part of Britain brings substantial benefits. Choosing independence \u2014 or at least more political autonomy, a middle ground that may happen even if independence fails \u2014 will bring both more autonomy but less assistance and perhaps a less friendly atmosphere between the two nations, the English seem to be saying.More surprisingly, perhaps, if the Scots vote against independence \u2014 as polls still predict they will \u2014 English voters are overwhelmingly in favor of giving Scotland more autonomy within Britain. But they also want to cut funding to Scotland and prevent Scottish members of the British Parliament from voting on issues concerning only England, the so-called Future of England survey showed. Some of those positions contradict proposals made to encourage Scottish voters to reject independence.\u201cIt is striking how tough people in England are on Scotland whatever the referendum outcome,\u201d said Charlie Jeffery of the University of Edinburgh, one of the poll\u2019s authors. \u201cThe message appears to be: \u2018Vote yes, by all means, but if you do, you\u2019re on your own.'\u2009\u201d\u201cBut if Scots vote no, there\u2019s something similar at play,\u201d Mr. Jeffery added. \u201cHere the message is: \u2018By all means have more devolution, but you can\u2019t then have the role at Westminster you do now, and don\u2019t expect any funding to flow northwards from England.'\u2009\u201dThe governing Conservative Party, as well as all other main parties in England, have said they will not share the pound with an independent Scotland. Mr. Salmond, who has spearheaded the pro-independence movement, has retorted that if London refuses to share the pound, Scotland will refuse to pay its share of the national debt. He argues that Britain would also pay a steep price if Scotland had a different currency, given how closely the two economies are intertwined.Most political observers say that in case of a yes-vote, the currency would be one of many issues raised in negotiations between the two governments, from dividing up debt obligations and oil revenues to disentangling art in museums.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Oysters Die, Climate Policy Goes on the Stump", "Date": "2014-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOLYMPIA, Wash. \u2014 Billions of baby oysters in the Pacific inlets here are dying and Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington is busy spreading the bad news.\u201cIt used to be the canary in the coal mine,\u201d Mr. Inslee said in a recent interview. \u201cNow it\u2019s the oyster in the half shell. You can\u2019t overstate what this means to Washington.\u201dOr to Mr. Inslee\u2019s ambitions. The Democratic governor, aided by what is expected to be millions of dollars from his billionaire friend Tom Steyer, is using the story of Washington\u2019s oysters \u2014 scientists say a rise in carbon levels has spiked the acidity of the Pacific and is killing off shellfish \u2014 to make the case for passing the most far-reaching climate change policies in the nation.Mr. Steyer\u2019s strategy is to spend heavily this fall to help defeat sitting lawmakers who oppose Mr. Inslee\u2019s agenda and pave the way for the governor to move his policies through next year \u2014 an example, his critics say, of the insidious influence of big money from outsiders that makes local elections less local.\u201cWe\u2019re working to give Jay the Legislature that he needs,\u201d said Gene Karpinski, president of the national League of Conservation Voters. \u201cThe state senators are the obstacles.\u201dMr. Inslee discussed the strategy over lunch at the governor\u2019s mansion in May with Mr. Steyer, a retired California hedge-fund manager who has pledged to spend $100 million on climate issues in elections across the country this year. Mr. Inslee makes no apologies for Mr. Steyer\u2019s efforts on his behalf.Mr. Steyer has not yet named the candidates or the State Senate districts he plans to target in Washington, but his strategists are eyeing about half a dozen key seats that could tip the majority of the State Senate in favor of Mr. Inslee\u2019s agenda. Right now the Senate has 24 Republicans, 2 Democrats who caucus with the Republicans and 23 other Democrats. Mr. Steyer has not said what he will spend in the districts, but his previous pattern indicates it will be hundreds of thousands of dollars for each candidate \u2014 a huge amount for a Washington State race.In 2013, Mr. Steyer\u2019s group spent $275,000 in Washington to help ensure the election of four pro-environment candidates to the local council in Whatcom County, where candidates normally spend less than $25,000 for a single race. As a result, prospects are now dim for council approval of a proposed $600 million port in Whatcom near the border with British Columbia, which, if constructed, would facilitate the shipment of 48 million tons of coal annually to Asia from Montana and Wyoming.The port would be a lifeline for the states\u2019 coal producers, who anticipate the shutdown of American coal-fired power plants because of emissions limits proposed by the Obama administration and hope to send their coal via rail to the proposed Washington port. But Mr. Inslee and Mr. Steyer see them as a climate disaster in the making.Mr. Steyer\u2019s money has not always bought results. In 2013 his group also spent $250,000 in a special election to try to oust Jan Angel, a Republican House member who opposes Mr. Inslee\u2019s climate plans, and was running for a state Senate seat last fall. But Ms. Angel raised money throughout the state and won the election.\u201cThank God that the people of my district were smart enough not to be purchased,\u201d Ms. Angel said. \u201cWhen you have people with deep pockets like Tom Steyer coming in and trying to trash candidates, spending this kind of money, it\u2019s a sad day for our democracy.\u201dOthers are equally outraged. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous that money coming from outside the state is trying to influence our votes,\u201d said Rick Tjoelker, an auto mechanic in Lynden, Wash., who bristled at Mr. Inslee\u2019s climate campaign.\u201cI\u2019m not a fan,\u201d Mr. Tjoelker said. \u201cWhat do you mean by climate change? I don\u2019t recognize that as a serious problem.\u201dMr. Inslee said that views like Mr. Tjoelker\u2019s have convinced him that he has to use the dying oysters \u2014 and the threat to a $270 million Pacific Northwest shellfish industry \u2014 to sound alarms about climate change for people who ordinarily might not listen. Ocean acidification, he said, \u201chas the same cause as climate change, but it has been unsullied with the political controversy of climate change.\u201dMr. Inslee, the author of a book on renewable energy, \u201cApollo\u2019s Fire: Igniting America\u2019s Clean Energy Economy,\u201d has pushed for legislation to fight global warming since he served in the House of Representatives, where he introduced a climate change bill in the House in 2005 that went nowhere. In 2009 he pushed for a measure to create a national cap-and-trade program that would have cut carbon emissions from cars and power plants and forced companies to buy government-issued permits to pollute. That bill passed the House but failed in the Senate.Mr. Inslee argues that in the state of Microsoft and Boeing and where science and technology drive much of the economy, denying the science of climate change is a losing political stance. \u201cThis is a scientifically literate state,\u201d Mr. Inslee said. Washington, he said, is positioned in a low-carbon economy to design and build new kinds of energy technology, like solar panels and software for the electric grid. \u201cIt can be a jobs generator, and my state wants to get in the game,\u201d he said.\u201cWe can attribute the problems in the oyster hatcheries to the increased carbon in the ocean,\u201d said Terrie Klinger, a professor of marine affairs at the University of Washington.Here in Washington\u2019s Pacific inlets, oyster farmers are trying to adapt to the acidic waters by pumping their oyster hatcheries full of alkaline chemicals. But scientists say the acidity levels are only going to keep rising.\u201cWe have a nursery where we\u2019ve set oysters continuously, but now they can\u2019t develop a healthy shell,\u201d said Paul Taylor, whose family has farmed oysters for five generations in Dabob Bay, a pine-fringed inlet. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s just hurting the babies, and in a controlled environment, we can manipulate the chemicals to get those through. But I don\u2019t know at what levels of acidification the adults won\u2019t grow. That unknown is very scary.\u201dMr. Taylor, who said his 500-employee company is the largest shellfish supplier in the Pacific Northwest, said he knows the climate policies Mr. Inslee is pushing could increase his energy costs. \u201cI\u2019m a businessman.\u201d he said. \u201cI know this could raise the cost of fuel for my boats and electricity for my buildings. But if this problem gets worse, and our oysters can\u2019t grow, then we just go away as a business.\u201dAn article on Monday about efforts by Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, a Democrat, to pass the most far-reaching climate change policies in the nation referred incorrectly to one of his ideas. He is considering a proposal to block construction of ports that would ship American coal to China; he has not made a final decision to do so. The article also referred incorrectly to a state senator whom Mr. Inslee and his supporters tried to defeat last year because she opposed his climate plans. The senator, Jan Angel, was a Republican House member at the time she ran for the state Senate; she was not an incumbent senator.A picture caption in an earlier version of this article misspelled the name of a town where an oyster hatchery is located. It is Quilcene, Wash., not Quilceen.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Battle for Senate Control Puts a Spotlight on Alaska", "Date": "2014-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFAIRBANKS, Alaska \u2014 Alaskans are braced for a continued barrage of television ads between now and Election Day in November, bashing or burnishing the reputations of the two men seeking to win Alaska\u2019s potentially pivotal, nationally watched Senate race. But Alaskans like Renee Cook also fully expect to see the candidates in the flesh, walking around and shaking hands like real people. They were here in Fairbanks before Tuesday\u2019s statewide primary election, in which Dan Sullivan, a Republican former state attorney general, and Senator Mark Begich, a Democrat who is considered vulnerable, won the right to meet in a race that could determine which party controls the chamber. \u201cOh yeah, they\u2019ll be back,\u201d said Ms. Cook, 33, who works in child care in Fairbanks. Ms. Cook said she was born and raised in Anchorage, which is also Mr. Begich\u2019s hometown. \u201cI saw him all the time,\u201d she said.For all Alaska\u2019s vast size and geographic complexity \u2014 roadless in many areas, but also highly urbanized, with most of the population living in a corridor between here and Anchorage, 360 miles south \u2014 its politicians still succeed or fail on the basis of a firm handshake and the hard-to-pin-down quality of being genuinely Alaskan.Representative Don Young, for example, a Republican who has represented Alaska\u2019s lone House district since 1973 and is running for re-election, is considered a master of the personal touch and has a goal of shaking every Alaskan\u2019s hand. He is still working on it, though there are more hands now to shake, with 735,000 residents in Alaska, more than double the number when Mr. Young first ran for office.Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Begich will each try to assemble a coalition on that landscape, politicians and residents said. Mr. Sullivan will be working to woo libertarians and voters who hate Washington and think its bureaucrats overly restrict development of mineral resources; Mr. Begich will try to attract rural voters and supporters of abortion rights. The urban areas, especially Anchorage, will decide the contest, people in both parties said, with the ability to make a personal connection with voters being the determining factor. The cities have oil industry workers who might lean toward Mr. Sullivan\u2019s more conservative approach, but liberals and newcomers may lean toward Mr. Begich, and there are lots of independents who could go either way.Whether television advertising even works well in Alaska is also an open question. The primary campaign that finished Tuesday was the most expensive in state history, with outside groups pouring in millions of dollars in support or attack. Though there are few good independent polls, a spokesman for Mr. Begich, Max Croes, said that because the campaign had responded forcefully to attacks, not a lot of opinions seemed to have changed. \u201cThe numbers didn\u2019t budge,\u201d Mr. Croes said.Forces supporting the law, backed by the oil companies themselves, outspent the repeal campaign by about 10 to 1. But as of Wednesday, the outcome was still too close to call, with the repeal measure trailing but thousands of absentee ballots still to be counted. Kaylee Luskleet, 18, a Fairbanks native who called herself a \u201cborderline Republican,\u201d will be casting her first vote in November, and she is exactly the kind of voter both Mr. Begich and Mr. Sullivan will need to grab onto and hold. Ms. Luskleet, who is undecided, works in a downtown coffee shop here in Fairbanks, and she said she fully expected both Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Begich to be in the shop sooner or later, as candidates were during the primaries. Her final choice, she said, will be determined by Alaskan issues: support for gun rights (she has been shooting since age 5 and has occasional bears in her backyard) and efforts to support education, especially in rural areas. But the real measure, she said, will be authenticity, which does not come down to where a person was born, she added. (Mr. Begich\u2019s campaign in particular is emphasizing his deep Alaskan roots and contrasting them with those of Mr. Sullivan, who came here from Ohio.) She wants proof, she said, that a candidate understands and relates to how real Alaska works. \u201cI want somebody who is Alaskan,\u201d she said.The personal touch can work both ways. Rick Wertz, 62, an information technology worker at a bank in Fairbanks, said he voted for Mr. Sullivan on Tuesday at least partly out of distaste for the other two Republicans, especially Joe Miller, a Tea Party-backed candidate who came in second.\u201cI just don\u2019t like him,\u201d Mr. Wertz said of Mr. Miller.Ms. Cook, the child care worker, said she planned to vote for Mr. Begich because she had seen so much of him and his work as mayor of Anchorage and in the Senate, and liked what she had seen.In any case, voters here say they are feeling the pressure, from both the national focus on the race and the attention from candidates, of wielding a giant lever that could switch control of the Senate. Republicans need a net gain of six seats to win a majority.\u201cI recently told my son, who just graduated from college, \u2018You are one of the most powerful people in the country right now,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Gunnar Knapp, the director of the Institute of Social and Economic Research at the University of Alaska. \u201cYou live in a small state that could decide everything.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption misidentified the state where Dan Sullivan, Republican candidate for Senate, came to after leaving Ohio. It was Alaska, not Hawaii.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York City Pension System Is Strained by Costs and Politics", "Date": "2014-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor years, New York City has been dutifully pumping more and more money into its giant pension system for retired city workers.Next year alone, the city will set aside for pensions more than $8 billion, or 11 percent of the budget. That is an increase of more than 12 times from the city\u2019s outlay in 2000, when the payments accounted for less than 2 percent of the budget. But instead of getting smaller, the city\u2019s pension hole just keeps getting bigger, forcing progressively more significant cutbacks in municipal programs and services every year. Like pension systems everywhere, New York City\u2019s has been strained by a growing retiree population that is living longer, global market conditions and other factors. But a close examination of the system\u2019s problems reveals a more glaring issue: Its investment strategy has failed to keep up with its growing costs, hampered by an antiquated and inefficient governing structure that often permits politics to intrude on decisions. The $160 billion system is spread across five separate funds, each with its own board of trustees, all making decisions with further input from consultants and even lawmakers in Albany.The city\u2019s pension assets have fallen further and further behind its obligations \u2014 the amount needed to cover future pension payouts \u2014 a troubling trend that could eventually ripple across the entire city budget, but which has so far received little attention under Mayor Bill de Blasio. Whether he can restore balance to the city\u2019s pension system promises to be one of his biggest challenges, one that will affect not just future generations of workers, but all city residents and taxpayers.Pension analysts compare the worsening situation in New York to watching someone try to fill a sink when the drain is open. \u201cThey\u2019re never going to catch up,\u201d said Sean McShea, president of Ryan Labs, a New York-based asset management firm that works for pension funds and other institutions. The fallout can be seen in measures of the pension system\u2019s financial health. From 1999 to 2012, for example, the plan for general workers fell to just 63 percent funded from 136 percent. Last year, Morningstar, the investment research firm, evaluated for the first time the strength of state and local pension systems across the country and rated New York City\u2019s as poor. Only a few major cities\u2019 pension systems garnered such a low rating, said Rachel Barkley, a municipal credit analyst who wrote the report for Morningstar.Mr. de Blasio, who has appeared less engaged with the city\u2019s pension problems than his predecessor, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, is confronting a legacy of costly and questionable decisions going back at least to the years of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, a review by The New York Times found. Like many public systems, New York has promised irrevocable pension benefits to city workers on the thinking that fund investments would grow enough to cover the cost \u2014 but they have not. Its response so far has been to take advantage of a recovering local economy and inject a lot more city money into the pension system quickly \u2014 an option not available to declining cities like Detroit, which filed for bankruptcy last year, or a tax-averse state like New Jersey, which has been underfunding its pension system for years. At the same time, New York has been aggressively chasing higher investment returns, shifting more money into riskier assets, which come with higher fees. Even as the system\u2019s returns have lagged, pension officials have resisted making changes in the oversight structure that many experts believe could lead to improvements. Complicating matters for Mr. de Blasio, wages and benefits are likely to swell even more in the near future, in line with a new teachers\u2019 union deal that sets a baseline for more than 100 other expired contracts.All of these factors have made the system acutely dependent on investment income. Yet its investment strategy is subject to the whims of the city\u2019s electoral calendar, changing whenever a new comptroller is elected. Regulators are now paying closer attention, very aware of the financial crises that have gripped other cities. Regulators from his office have also been sifting through documents at New York\u2019s pension office, Diane d\u2019Alessandro, executive director of the general workers\u2019 fund, said at a recent meeting of trustees. Letters accompanying the subpoenas said that \u201cthe recent financial difficulties in Detroit serve as a stern wake-up call, demonstrating why strong oversight of New York\u2019s public pension funds is so important.\u201dClashing VoicesMany cities have one pension plan, or two, separating general workers and uniformed personnel. But New York City has five, covering general workers, the police, firefighters, teachers and other school personnel.Each fund has its own trustees. The exact makeup for each fund differs, but the mayor, the comptroller and organized labor each have their representatives, and their interests are frequently diametrically opposed. The boards are fond of personally vetting investment firms \u2014 something experts in model boardrooms say they should not be doing. Politics can often intrude. The teachers\u2019 union, for example, keeps a list of investment firms it sees as unacceptable because of their connections to groups that, say, favor charter schools. Ranji Nagaswami, who served as Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s first chief investment adviser, said that changes in the governing structure \u2014 consolidating, professionalizing and depoliticizing the pension boards \u2014 could result in \u201cvastly improving outcomes.\u201dIn the existing environment, important questions about cost and sustainability can be broached only with great diplomacy. In 2010, Blackstone Advisory Partners, a private equity firm, found out what can happen otherwise. On a conference call with investors, a company official answered a fiscal question by saying retirement benefits for public workers across the country were excessive. When New York City\u2019s trustees got wind of the comment, they called for Blackstone\u2019s chairman to apologize in person. A few months later, he did, and when that proved insufficient, Blackstone issued a statement saying it opposed \u201cscapegoating public employees.\u201d When the dust finally settled, Blackstone survived as one of the system\u2019s biggest investors. New York\u2019s pension system is also the only major governmental system in the country to outsource virtually all of its investment decisions to outside money managers, pension experts said. That inevitably leads to higher investment fees. In 1997, the city\u2019s biggest fund, the New York City Employees\u2019 Retirement System, known as Nycers, spent $17.3 million in investment fees for a $31.7 billion portfolio. By 2010, it was spending $175 million for a $35.4 billion portfolio. Some have argued the pension system would perform better if it hired its own professionals to manage the money in-house. Fees would drop, and the overall strategy would be more coherent, they contend.As it turns out, Robert C. North Jr., the system\u2019s actuary, had been preparing his own stark projections, buried in annual reports. They are based on fair-market values and reflect what an insurer would charge for annuities designed exactly like the pensions. He estimated last year that Nycers was only 40 percent funded, a figure normally associated with funds in severe distress. Expectations and RealityIn the complex world of pension math, one number looms larger than the rest: the expected rate of return on investments over the long term. The higher the assumed rate, the less money the city will be asked to inject in the pension system each year.In New York, this all-important number is chosen by the State Legislature, with input from the pension boards\u2019 many trustees and the system\u2019s actuary. The temptation is to be overly optimistic, because that makes the whole pension plan look more affordable and, therefore, more politically palatable. The more money the city needs to contribute, the more it becomes a problem for the city budget and the greater the likelihood the costs breed resentment against public employee unions.But excessive optimism can lead to financial disaster, because regular shortfalls could ultimately leave the city unable to fulfill its required payouts. For years, the investment return expectation was set at 8 percent. In reality, the system\u2019s returns have often fallen well short of that, earning just 2 percent on average from 1999 to 2009, for instance. (The returns have ticked up as the market has risen.)Yet the pension boards have been reluctant to ask Albany to lower its investment-return assumption, out of concern that it would incite a backlash toward unions and pensions. Already, the growing sums consumed by the pension funds have forced officials to scrimp on certain programs or abandon them, said Marc La Vorgna, a press secretary during Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s administration. One casualty was the Advantage program, which helped homeless people move out of shelters and into apartments. It was eliminated in the Bloomberg administration. Nicole Gelinas, a fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute, cited infrastructure spending as another priority that has been affected. Pension costs are \u201csuffocating our ability to make long-term investments,\u201d she said.The additional cash will certainly help the pension system, but it will still take years and luck in the markets for the city to close the gap from the years it should have been contributing more.It is the pursuit of higher returns that has led the trustees, and lawmakers in Albany, to authorize more aggressive, alternative strategies, mirroring a national trend among public pension systems. The approach carries the possibility of a greater upside but also brings greater risks and costlier fees. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with taking the risk,\u201d Mr. North said. \u201cThe risk, however, should be recognized and understood as it is mostly borne by future generations,\u201d people who were not consulted on these decisions. In New York, private equities \u2014 stocks that do not trade on any exchange or have a published price \u2014 have become a favored asset class. Private equity investments are typically done through partnerships with specialized firms, which last for several years. Until they run their course, the returns cannot be calculated accurately. The fees are high, and it is not yet clear that the partnerships are delivering consistently higher returns.In one example, John Murphy, a former executive director of Nycers, the fund for general workers, said he noticed in 2011 that the Allegra Capital Partners IV fund had just come to an end, making a final accounting possible. After long delays, he received data showing that Allegra had lost 8.24 percent per year, on average. \u201cNycers invested $24 million and got back $11.66 million,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. \u201cThis is clearly an imprudent strategy for a large pension fund.\u201d Mr. Murphy said that Nycers had lost money in just five years out of the last 30 \u2014 all in the 2000s, after the system adopted its private equities program. Out of curiosity, he calculated what the returns might have been if Nycers had continued its strategy of investing solely in publicly traded stocks and high-rated bonds. The answer was: billions of dollars ahead of where it is today. Low PrioritiesThe aims included hiring professional in-house investors and breaking the link between the pension system and the political calendar. Most of the ideas died, however. Some labor leaders felt that they had not been consulted, and Mr. Liu became hobbled by a federal investigation into his campaign finances.Now, of course, there is a new mayor and a new comptroller, both of whom have been staunch labor allies. A new chief investment officer started last month, and Mr. North, the system\u2019s actuary for nearly 25 years, is expected to retire this year. It is unclear whether pensions will be a top priority.Mr. de Blasio, notably, did not mention the word \u201cpension\u201d during his hourlong budget presentation in May. Mr. Bloomberg, by contrast, raised the issue often and made his final formal speech a stemwinder on pension costs.In May, Comptroller Scott M. Stringer announced he would try to commit $1 billion to smaller investment firms led by minorities and women, despite research showing that initiatives geared toward emerging firms make it harder to achieve top investment returns. Mr. North said that Mr. de Blasio\u2019s recent deal with the teachers\u2019 union \u2014 and two subsequent deals with health care workers and nurses \u2014 would necessitate bigger pension contributions from the city. But precisely how much bigger remains unknown because the contracts are complex. After Mr. North leaves, it would be easy for New York to tweak key assumptions and lowball its contributions. That would save the city money, but it could wreak havoc on the future. He has urged the trustees to be mindful of the city\u2019s not-so-distant past.\u201cIt\u2019s less than 40 years since we were near bankruptcy,\u201d he said. Advertisement"}

In this unique sector of the economy, costs of essential government services are shifted to the poor.The recent drive toward privatization of government functions has turned traditional public services into profit-making enterprises as well.In addition to probation, municipal court systems are also turning collections over to a national network of companies like Sentinel that profit from service charges imposed on the men and women who are under court order to pay fees and fines, including traffic tickets (with the fees being sums tacked on by the court to fund administrative services).Human Rights Watch also found that in Georgia in 2012, in \u201ca state of less than 10 million people, 648 courts assigned more than 250,000 cases to private probation companies.\u201d The report notes that \u201cthere is virtually no transparency about the revenues of private probation companies\u201d since \u201cpractically all of the industry\u2019s firms are privately held and not subject to the disclosure requirements that bind publicly traded companies. No state requires probation companies to report their revenues, or by logical extension the amount of money they collect for themselves from probationers.\u201dHuman Rights Watch goes on to provide an account given by a private probation officer in Georgia: \u201cI always try and negotiate with the families. Once they know you are serious they come up with some money. That\u2019s how you have to be. They have to see that this person is not getting out unless they pay something. I\u2019m just looking for some good faith money, really. I got one guy I let out of jail today and I got three or four more sitting there right now.\u201dThis new system of offender-funded law enforcement creates a vicious circle: The poorer the defendants are, the longer it will take them to pay off the fines, fees and charges; the more debt they accumulate, the longer they will remain on probation or in jail; and the more likely they are to be unemployable and to become recidivists.And that\u2019s not all. The more commercialized fee collection and probation services get, the more the costs of these services are inflicted on the poor, and the more resentful of the police specifically and of law enforcement generally the poor become. At the same time, judicial systems are themselves in a vise. Judges, who in many locales must run for re-election, are under intense pressure from taxpayers to cut administrative costs while maintaining the efficacy of the judiciary.In dealing with more serious crimes involving substantial sentences, the rising costs of maintaining and building new prison facilities has prompted many state governments, and even the federal government, to turn to the private prison industry.This industry, which began to grow in the early 1980s, now faces significant problems. As incarceration rates drop, and as some states adopt more lenient sentencing practices, the industry is struggling to find new ways to fill vacant cells.Take the Corrections Corporation of America, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and reported revenues of $1.69 billion in 2013. The firm describes itself as \u201cthe nation\u2019s largest owner of privatized correctional and detention facilities and one of the largest prison operators in the United States behind only the federal government and three states.\u201dIn its 2013 annual report, C.C.A. was clear about the problems facing the company: \u201cunder a per diem rate structure, a decrease in our occupancy rates could cause a decrease in revenue and profitability. For the past three years, occupancy rates have been steadily declining in C.C.A. facilities, from 90 percent in 2011, to 88 percent in 2012 and 85 percent in 2013.\u201dThese numbers reflect the brutal math underlying profit margins in private prisons. The \u201crevenue per compensated man-day\u201d for each inmate rose by 35 cents from $60.22 in 2012 to $60.57 in 2013. But expenses \u201cper compensated man-day\u201d rose by 70 cents from $42.04 to $42.74, for a net decline in operating income for each inmate from $18.18 a day to $17.83.In combination with declining occupancy rates, the result was a dip in total revenue from $1.72 billion in 2012 to $1.69 billion in 2013.Poverty capitalism and government policy are now working on their own and in tandem to shift costs to those least equipped to pay and in particular to the least politically influential segment of the poor: criminal defendants and those delinquent in paying fines.What should be done to interrupt the dangerous feedback loop between low-level crime and extortionate punishment? First, local governments should bring private sector collection charges, court-imposed administrative fees and the dollar amount of traffic fines (which often double and triple when they go unpaid) into line with the economic resources of poor offenders. But larger reforms are needed and those will not come about unless the poor begin to exercise their latent political power. In many ways, everything is working against them. But the public outpouring spurred by the shooting of Michael Brown provides an indication of a possible path to the future. It was, after all, just 50 years ago \u2014 not too distant in historical terms \u2014 that collective action and social solidarity produced tangible results.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Motorbikers in North Korea Are Told to Park to Save Fuel", "Date": "2014-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 It is no secret that North Korea suffers chronic shortages of fuel, to the point that nighttime satellite photographs of the Korean Peninsula show a glittering south and a darkened north, beginning exactly at the 38th parallel that divides them. Now the scarcity, apparently made even worse by a drop in oil imports from China, has claimed a new class of victims: motorbike riders.Over the last week, two websites in Seoul that carry reports from sources in North Korea said the authorities there had cracked down on private motorbike use in order to conserve fuel for military and government officials. The new restrictions come just as motorbikes have been emerging as the next stage in the evolution of vehicular transport in North Korea, much as they had in other parts of Asia decades ago \u2014 another reflection of North Korea\u2019s stunted economy. Motorbike ownership is widely considered a status symbol in North Korea, where most people still travel on foot. Many motorbike owners supplement their income by using them as taxis.The country\u2019s nuclear weapons program and its development of long-range rocket systems have angered many in the West, including in the United States.The restrictions could not be independently verified and have not been reported in North Korea\u2019s own state-run press. But if confirmed, they appear to be another consequence of the North Korean government\u2019s chilled friendship with China, its closest economic benefactor and ally, once routinely described by Chinese officials as a relationship as close as \u201clips and teeth.\u201dChina\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, is known to be exasperated with Kim Jong-un, the 31-year-old North Korean leader who succeeded his father, Kim Jong-il, in 2011, because he has repeatedly defied China\u2019s warnings to curtail North Korea\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.According to South Korea news reports this year quoting official Chinese customs data, China did not export any crude oil to North Korea for at least the first three months of 2014. Diplomats have cautioned against reading too much into those statistics, because China sometimes keeps oil exports to North Korea out of its official trade data. Still, competition for North Korea\u2019s limited supply of fuel for private use is known to have intensified in recent years.Even before the new North Korea restrictions on motorbikes, riders faced hazards peculiar to North Korea\u2019s authoritarian system \u2014 long-distance travel permit requirements, decrepit roads, an unpredictable black-market for gasoline and petty corruption among the police.Lee Mi-yeon, a woman who defected from the North, said recently on Channel A in Seoul that the North Korean police often stopped people on motorbikes just to extort their gasoline.

{"Headline": "The Trucking Industry Needs More Drivers. Maybe It Needs to Pay More.", "Date": "2014-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewSwift Transportation\u2019s 20,000 workers haul goods in almost 14,000 big-rig trucks that travel the interstates and back roads of the United States every day. The company\u2019s performance is closely tied to the nation\u2019s economy, which has been looking increasingly sunny lately. So it was surprising last month when Swift\u2019s stock plummeted nearly 18 percent in a single day. The tumble came for an odd reason. It wasn\u2019t because there was too little business \u2014 but rather, too much. In other words, Swift had plenty of customers wanting to ship goods. But in a time of elevated unemployment, it somehow couldn\u2019t find enough drivers to take those goods from Point A to Point B. How is that possible? The reasons for that conundrum tell us a great deal about what has been ailing American workers and why a full-throated economic recovery has been so slow in coming.Yet the idea that there is a huge shortage of truck drivers flies in the face of a jobless rate of more than 6 percent, not to mention Economics 101. The most basic of economic theories would suggest that when supply isn\u2019t enough to meet demand, it\u2019s because the price \u2014 in this case, truckers\u2019 wages \u2014 is too low. Raise wages, and an ample supply of workers should follow.But corporate America has become so parsimonious about paying workers outside the executive suite that meaningful wage increases may seem an unacceptable affront. In this environment, it may be easier to say \u201cThere is a shortage of skilled workers\u201d than \u201cWe aren\u2019t paying our workers enough,\u201d even if, in economic terms, those come down to the same thing.Millions of able-bodied Americans need work, yet there aren\u2019t enough middle-income jobs for them. That is especially the case for men without advanced educations, who have seen their wages depressed over the last few decades. Trucking would seem to be an excellent option. It\u2019s not an ideal job for everyone. There is no question that trucking is hard work, necessitating long hours and longer stretches away from family. But that\u2019s why it is well compensated, at least in comparison to other jobs not requiring college degrees. The average pay for a long-haul trucker is just shy of $50,000, according to the A.T.A., and an experienced trucker with a good safety record can make significantly more than that. The work typically offers lavish benefits that are increasingly rare for nonunion blue-collar employees.The job can be learned fairly quickly. In some industries, companies complain of shortages of workers for jobs that require years of advanced training, like certain engineering specialties. Trucking is not one of those industries, however. A person can get a commercial driver\u2019s license after a course that can be as brief as six weeks of intensive study. Moreover, there were actually fewer truckers working last year (1.585 million) than five years earlier (1.673 million). Some of the missing workers could presumably be coaxed back into the industry if the money were right. To be sure, the trucker-shortage picture is more complex than this, notes Bob Costello, the A.T.A.\u2019s chief economist. He says these complications make a straightforward story of truckers simply being underpaid not quite fair.For example, new safety requirements mean that individual truckers drive fewer miles than a decade ago: An average long-haul truck can now cover 8,000 miles a month, down from almost 11,000 in 2007, according to the trade association. This helps account for downward wage pressure. And the trucking companies themselves are typically working on thin profit margins and serving customers on long-term contracts, which means that if they simply raised pay sharply to recruit more truckers, they could end up losing money.But every industry has its special challenges, and the trucker shortage \u2014 and falling inflation-adjusted wages over the last decade \u2014 are part of a bigger story.The reasons are the subject of endless debate, and you can pick the one you prefer to emphasize: technological change, globalization or a decline of union power. But wages of workers without advanced skills have been under downward pressure in the United States and across the developed world over the last generation. The deep recession and slow recovery have only made the trend more pronounced.That has led to a mind-set in which executives sometimes think of line workers as merely resources to be tapped at the lowest price. Companies have been able to keep wages low: It\u2019s hard to demand a raise when your colleagues are being laid off or there is a long line of job seekers. Some corporations may have come to view this as a natural state of affairs.By now, wage income is as low a percentage of gross domestic product as it has been since 1947, while corporate profits are at postwar highs. These are two sides of the same coin. Money that once accrued to workers now goes to shareholders. Yet there are some indications that this state of affairs may not last: The shortage of truckers is one piece of evidence that the balance of power is shifting. In recent earnings calls, executives from companies as varied as JetBlue and the Dr Pepper Snapple Group have expressed worry about rising wage pressures. The trucker shortage is already resulting in higher wages in parts of that industry. There have been $2,000 signing bonuses from companies looking to poach truckers and, as Kevin P. Knight of Knight Transportation mentioned in that trucking company\u2019s latest earnings call, per-mile pay increases have been working out to 5 to 10 percent jumps in driver pay.Executives may bemoan higher pay for workers because it could cut profit margins. But after a generation in which the median American household has seen flat to declining inflation-adjusted income, wage increases are a welcome corrective. When workers begin to have more leverage in salary negotiations, it is a sign of an improving economy, not a liability that businesses should be complaining about.The Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life: nytimes.com/upshot.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Frontier in the Efficiency Quest: Cutting Heat Losses", "Date": "2014-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTechnologyDETROIT \u2014 Here\u2019s how you know that automakers are feverishly pursuing ways to improve fuel efficiency by harnessing engine heat: They won\u2019t talk about it.The pressure to improve mileage has been stepping up for years and the straightforward gains \u2014 cutting aerodynamic drag, lowering rolling resistance \u2014 have been long since mined. So researchers are increasingly probing small improvements once thought too troublesome to bother with.The competition is fierce and the secrecy intense.An example: After an exchange of emails requesting answers to questions about thermodynamic research, a Honda spokesman, Brad Nelson, shut off further discussion with a reply that \u201cseveral of these things touch on confidential engineering work at the company, so our team prefers not to offer comments at this time.\u201dIt may be, industry experts hint, that thermodynamic advances will lengthen the life of internal combustion engines.Thermodynamics involves the physics of heat and energy, and automakers are applying this science to a quest for efficiency, developing devices to use heat that would otherwise be wasted to improve fuel economy and reduce emissions.A number of automakers, including BMW, are exploring ways to use heat energy to generate electricity. The principle is simple: voltage can be generated between two thermoelectric semiconductors held at different temperatures. NASA has long relied on this technology, known as the Seebeck effect, to power space probes.BMW has said that it developed a thermoelectric device positioned in the exhaust system that provides 200 watts of power. The latest generation of the device uses more advanced materials to generate 600 watts. The automaker\u2019s goal is 1,000 watts of thermoelectric power.Electricity produced by a thermoelectric generator can be used in place of an alternator, reducing workload on the engine, or it can be used to charge batteries for a hybrid system. BMW says the device works well with a brake energy regeneration system: The thermal system generates electricity well during acceleration while regenerative braking works when slowing down.Thermoelectric devices are just one of many ways auto engineers are trying to use the heat energy rather than waste it.Waste is a key word, because much of the energy produced when fuel is burned is lost to the atmosphere as heat.How much is dispersed through thermal losses? The Energy Department puts the number at 58 to 62 percent for a typical internal combustion engine. This energy is transferred to the atmosphere primarily through the tailpipe and radiator. Much of that heat transmission is intentional. If the engine isn\u2019t cooled, gasoline ignites prematurely, lubricants are rendered ineffective, and moving parts are destroyed. But while the engine must be cooled, some extracted heat can be put to good use.Turbocharging is the age-old way to use heat energy for increased power and efficiency. These exhaust-driven pumps, which push air into the cylinders, were used to increase the power of aircraft engines in the 1920s. The earliest turbochargers were a compromise for automobile engines because of their poor low-speed response. But turbocharging has come a long way and modern systems use twin turbos that operate in sequence to reduce lag. Twin-scroll turbos use two exhaust turbines and two compressor sections to provide boost throughout the r.p.m. range.Exhaust driven turbines can also drive a generator that provides electricity for accessories, batteries and powertrain motors, and turbocompound engines use turbine power directly, coupling it to the vehicle\u2019s drivetrain to help turn the drive wheels.Ford was willing to discuss its work in thermodynamics. In a telephone interview, Zafar Shaikh, manager of powertrain cooling and thermal energy recovery, said that while he was not at liberty to discuss proprietary projects, he could say that Ford\u2019s research efforts are many and include turbocompounding, electricity generation, heat storage devices and Rankine cycle thermodynamics that use engine heat to produce steam that can power an electric generator.A paper by two Ford engineers, Quazi Hussain and David Brigham, presented at the 2011 Directions in Engine-Efficiency and Emissions Research Conference described a closed-loop Rankine cycle device: A pump delivers fluid to an exhaust-heated vaporizer and the resulting steam drives a turbine, which turns an electric generator. The vapor is returned to liquid form in a condenser, and the cycle is repeated.Mr. Shaikh said the challenge is fitting the Rankine device into an automobile. \u201cWe\u2019re close in hardware,\u201d he said, \u201cbut packaging remains a challenge.\u201dBMW is developing a system that is similar in principle. J\u00fcrgen Ringler, BMW\u2019s team leader for thermal energy converters, described a heat exchanger that recovers heat from the engine exhaust.\u201cThis energy is used to heat a fluid which is under high pressure \u2014 this heated fluid then turns into steam, which powers an expansion turbine that generates electrical energy from the recovered heat,\u201d he said in statement.The automaker says that when complete, the system is expected to reduce fuel consumption by up to 10 percent on long trips.Insulating the engine to retain heat energy is another way to improve efficiency, but according to Mr. Shaikh of Ford, it can be problematic.\u201cYou can effectively keep heat in the engine,\u201d he said, but noted that turbocharged direct-injection engines become hot very fast. \u201cYou can have problems if you don\u2019t manage it carefully.\u201dOne obvious way to use heat energy is to store hot coolant for later use. Mr. Shikh said that Ford is working on a thermal battery that uses phase changing material that can absorb a lot of latent heat, which can then be used to warm the engine before start-up.Toyota hybrids use a heat storage device based on a three-liter stainless-steel thermos that stores coolant after the engine is shut off. When the car is restarted, the warm coolant is cycled back to the cylinder head. This allows for a leaner fuel mixture on start-up, improving efficiency and reducing emissions. A warmer start-up also means the passenger cabin can be heated rapidly on cold mornings.Joseph Dulzo, engineering group manager for advanced engine technology at General Motors, responded to questions regarding thermodynamics research in writing. A G.M. spokesman, Tom Read, explained that the automaker was reluctant to allow a phone interview because the company limits what can be said about advanced research. Mr. Dulzo\u2019s answers mentioned the same technologies that Mr. Shaikh had discussed.In summary, Mr. Dulzo wrote, \u201cWe are actively working on integrated systems that optimize exhaust energy recovery while managing packaging and complexity. Turbocompounding, Rankine cycle machines and thermoelectric devices can be used to produce electricity and decrease the electric generator load on the engine resulting in improved fuel consumption. However, the cost and the extra fuel consumed due to the mass of these systems need to be balanced with the gains from the electricity generated.\u201dFiat Chrysler uses engine waste heat to preheat the transmission fluid of Ram trucks with the 8-speed automatic transmission. In a telephone interview, James Adams, chief transmission engineer, said that starting cold, a typical automatic transmission requires 35 to 40 minutes to reach optimum operating temperature, but by preheating fluid with engine coolant, which warms more rapidly, the transmission reaches optimum temperature in about 10 minutes. The technology, according to Mr. Adams, is worth \u201ca couple percent in fuel economy on the overall cycle.\u201dAn article last Sunday about automakers\u2019 efforts to use engine heat more efficiently misstated the surname of a General Motors engineer. He is Joseph Dulzo, not Dutzo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Putin Really Cornered?", "Date": "2014-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 The dismal flood of news out of Ukraine could hardly be more discouraging for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.The downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, apparently at the hands of Russian-backed separatists, and the ghastly scenes at the crash site shocked the world. After months of dithering, Western leaders have imposed sweeping economic sanctions against Russia. The separatists themselves are in retreat, battered and bloodied.Mr. Putin appears to be cornered. So why are Western leaders so antsy?Because a cornered prey is unpredictable. A memorable passage from Mr. Putin\u2019s 2000 quasi autobiography, \u201cFirst Person,\u201d tells you everything you need to know. Growing up in a dilapidated Leningrad apartment building, Mr. Putin used to chase rats with sticks. \u201cOnce I spotted a huge rat and pursued it down the hall until I drove it into a corner,\u201d he recounted. \u201cIt had nowhere to run. Suddenly it lashed around and threw itself at me. I was surprised and frightened. Now the rat was chasing me.\u201dMr. Putin\u2019s risky, impetuous moves have surprised many observers, me included. Annexing Crimea; framing Russia\u2019s foreign policy around protecting the \u201cRussian world\u201d (the Kremlin\u2019s code word for the legions of Russian speakers scattered throughout the former Soviet Union); and subcontracting the insurgency in eastern Ukraine to marginal figures like ultranationalists, Ponzi scheme con artists and run-of-the-mill criminals \u2014 none of this seemed plausible before it happened.Even now, six months into this crisis, Western leaders don\u2019t know how far Mr. Putin will go in Ukraine. President Obama said as much at a recent news conference, fretting that while Mr. Putin should want to resolve the crisis diplomatically, \u201cPeople don\u2019t always act rationally.\u201dUnfortunately, something more insidious than irrationality may be at work. Using sanctions as the principal tool to punish and deter Moscow has created a situation in which Mr. Putin may reasonably believe that the West\u2019s real goal is what he has long suspected \u2014 regime change in Russia, not just in Ukraine \u2014 and that he cannot afford to retreat.But even if Western governments wanted to explore a quiet compromise, it\u2019s not clear whom they could talk to in Moscow. Nearly all of the important figures in the Russian power structure are on the sanctions list \u2014 save Mr. Putin. The Obama-Putin phone calls, which are closely monitored by both countries\u2019 foreign policy bureaucracies, have become a poor venue for real give and take.For want of a better option, Western powers seem to be banking on letting the Ukrainians bloody Moscow\u2019s nose, which might set up a more fruitful diplomatic process somewhere down the road. Combined with the sanctions effort, the West\u2019s policy is based primarily on the hope that Mr. Putin will eventually change course or that elite and public support for him will fracture.Unfortunately, time is not on the West\u2019s \u2014 or Ukraine\u2019s \u2014 side. Moscow is once again building up its troop presence along the border, and there is growing fear that Mr. Putin will intervene militarily. Even the severe sanctions on the state-owned Russian banking sector will take time to bite, given Moscow\u2019s hard currency reserves and limited refinancing needs. The longer the war continues, the more challenging it will be to sustain Ukraine\u2019s ravaged, dysfunctional economy, especially as winter approaches. Against the backdrop of Mr. Putin\u2019s sky-high popularity and a surge in nationalist sentiment, the Kremlin can simply blame foreign enemies for any economic difficulties it encounters.Preventing Russia from establishing a protectorate or frozen conflict in eastern Ukraine is an urgent and worthy goal. But we need to ask whether the course we\u2019re on is too risky. One immediate priority should be re-establishing real channels of communication with Mr. Putin and his inner circle. We still don\u2019t know what they want.While reminding Mr. Putin not to underestimate Western or Ukrainian resolve, Mr. Obama can highlight the cost to Russia of further escalation and put on the table three proposals, which must be closely coordinated with Kiev. The first would be to establish a lasting, verifiable cease-fire under the auspices of the United Nations or the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, combined with a reinforced border-monitoring effort to block additional military assistance to the separatists.Second, Kiev would agree to honor its commitments to transfer power to regional governments, protect the Russian language and arrange for direct election of local officials \u2014 all objectives of the Russian-backed groups.The third proposal would be to begin a conversation about the future of Ukraine between Russia and the West. Even such ideologically different geostrategists as Zbigniew Brzezinski and Henry A. Kissinger are on record as favoring some form of neutrality for Ukraine for the foreseeable future.Mr. Putin may not be receptive to these ideas, of course, but Mr. Obama can remind him that it\u2019s probably only a matter of time before the United States supplies lethal military assistance to the Ukrainians and NATO expands its presence along Russia\u2019s borders.Any durable solution to the Ukraine crisis will require both Kiev and Moscow to find political wiggle room and to forge a much-needed long-term accommodation on political, economic and energy ties that cannot be replaced by the West. At the same time, Mr. Putin\u2019s capabilities and willingness to wreak havoc inside Ukraine \u2014 and even farther afield in places like the Baltics \u2014 are not going to disappear anytime soon. We should keep that in mind before betting on his unconditional surrender.Advertisement"}

Hoffman, chief economist at the PNC Financial Services Group in Pittsburgh. \u201cBusinesses have bounced back after the bad winter disrupted production and demand.\u201dPresident Obama hailed the improving economic news, saying that \u201ccompanies are investing, consumers are spending.\u201dIn brief remarks to reporters on Thursday afternoon, Mr. Obama noted that private businesses had created 10 million new jobs since the recession ended, and he said, \u201cThere are reasons to feel good about the direction that we are headed.\u201dBut he added that there was \u201cmore that we should be doing\u201d to improve the economy further, and he promised to push Congress on those things when lawmakers return to Washington in September.Despite the faster overall growth rate, businesses still seem to be benefiting more from the economy\u2019s upward trajectory than many individual consumers are.The revision on Thursday, for example, lowered the estimate of workers\u2019 wage and salary growth slightly in the first half of 2014, with income rising 5.8 percent in the second quarter. Corporate profits, on the other hand, jumped 8 percent in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said.That split could change if unemployment continues to drop and the labor market tightens enough to give employees more bargaining power to demand higher pay. Although the unemployment rate has fallen to 6.2 percent from 8.2 percent two years ago, broader measures of joblessness remain much higher, meaning that for now, there is little incentive for employers to substantially raise wages to retain and attract workers.Economists expect the unemployment rate to fall below 6 percent by the end of 2014, and Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, will be closely watching the data on employment, wages and inflation to determine when to start raising interest rates next year, said Doug Gordon, senior investment strategist for North America at Russell Investments in Seattle.So far, inflationary pressures remain muted; Mr. Gordon and most other market observers do not expect the Fed to start increasing rates from their level, currently close to zero, until the middle of 2015.The next major reading on the job market will come on Sept. 5, when the Labor Department reports on employment and job creation in August. Wall Street economists are predicting that employers added roughly 220,000 jobs this month, with the unemployment rate dropping 0.1 percentage point to 6.1 percent.One conundrum, Mr. Gordon says, is that even as the economy builds momentum, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond has been falling, the opposite of what usually happens to bond yields when growth picks up.In part, Mr. Gordon attributed this trend to increased demand for Treasury bonds as a safe harbor in the face of rising tensions in Ukraine and weak economic growth across Europe, where borrowing rates in countries like Germany and France are even lower than in the United States. In addition, he said, pension funds and institutional investors who have enjoyed big stock market gains in 2013 and 2014 may be buying Treasury securities to diversify their holdings.In trading on Wall Street, stocks finished the day slightly lower. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 17,079.57, down about 42 points, or 0.25 percent. Yields on 10-year Treasury bonds fell to just above 2.3 percent, the lowest level this year.Another clue as to how substantial the economic rebound will be for the rest of the year will come on Friday, when the Commerce Department reports data on personal income and spending for July. On Tuesday, the Commerce Department reported a strong reading for orders of durable goods in July.Thursday\u2019s report on gross domestic product was the second of three estimates issued by the Commerce Department. The final reading is due on Sept. 26.Within the report, analysts were especially pleased that the upward revision was largely because of factors that signify healthy demand, rather than the piling up of inventories.The estimate of final sales in the second quarter was revised upward, to 2.8 percent from an initial reading of 2.3 percent, while inventory gains were revised downward. In addition, orders for equipment by businesses rose at an annual rate of 10.7 percent in the quarter, well above the earlier 7 percent estimate.In addition, exports in the period were revised slightly upward, while imports were revised modestly downward, which also boosted the overall growth rate.\u201cInvestment spending by businesses tends to follow activity, so this is a sign that good demand in the second quarter will be followed by stronger business investment in the third and fourth quarters,\u201d said Michael Gapen, senior United States economist at Barclays.Michael D. Shear contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The debate on when the Fed should begin increasing rates, which have been near zero since 2008, has intensified in recent months as the Fed winds down its other economic stimulus.Over all, it has been a quiet week for the market.

{"Headline": "Fed Chief Sees Not Enough Data to Raise Rates", "Date": "2014-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJACKSON HOLE, Wyo. \u2014 Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, said on Friday that the economy was improving but that the Fed was awaiting more evidence about the health of labor markets before deciding when to start raising interest rates.Ms. Yellen\u2019s first keynote speech at the annual conference here in the shadow of the Grand Tetons was mostly an extended explanation of the reasons for the Fed\u2019s caution, and an effort to buy time for the Fed to deliberate. She emphasized her view that no single factor, including inflation, could be used to judge the recovery.\u201cWhile these assessments have always been imprecise and subject to revision, the task has become especially challenging in the aftermath of the Great Recession,\u201d she said, both because of the downturn\u2019s \u201cnearly unprecedented\u201d depth and because of simultaneous changes in the economy separate from the ups and downs of the business cycle, including the aging of the work force.Ms. Yellen broke little new ground in her speech. She reiterated the Fed\u2019s basic guidance after its July meeting that holding short-term interest rates near zero remains necessary and useful to increase employment. She said the gap between current conditions and a return to full health was still \u201csignificant.\u201dAcknowledging the uncertainty surrounding this assessment, Ms. Yellen added that the Fed was prepared to adjust its stance as the economic evidence became clearer, either moving more quickly to raise rates or holding steady for even longer. She said the Fed expected to end the expansion of its bond holdings in October.Investors generally expect the Fed to start raising interest rates in the summer of 2015, or slightly later, based on asset prices tied to the level of future rates. John Williams, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and a prominent centrist, told CNBC on Friday that was still a \u201creasonable guess.\u201d Another centrist, Dennis P. Lockhart, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said in an interview on Friday that Ms. Yellen\u2019s speech \u201cdid not break a lot of new ground,\u201d because the Fed\u2019s trajectory depended on the economy. \u201cI\u2019m still someone who thinks midyear is the most likely timing,\u201d Mr. Lockhart said.Some analysts, however, viewed Ms. Yellen\u2019s speech \u2014 along with the minutes of the Fed\u2019s July meeting, released on Wednesday \u2014 as evidence that the Fed had become a little more likely to raise rates earlier, if the economy kept gaining strength.\u201cWe do not believe she has changed her core views,\u201d Michael Gapen, director of United States economic research at Barclays, wrote on Friday in a note to clients after Ms. Yellen\u2019s speech, \u201cbut see the change in tone as a normal evolution based on the fact that the Fed is closer to achieving its dual mandate than at any point in the recovery and has found itself at this stage faster than expected.\u201d Ms. Yellen\u2019s audience on Friday included several internal critics of the stimulus campaign, including her host, Esther George, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, which sponsors the annual conference, and Charles I. Plosser, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, who dissented at the last meeting of the Fed\u2019s policy-making committee. Both argue that the Fed has neared the limits of its ability to improve the health of the economy and that persisting in its efforts could loosen the central bank\u2019s control over price inflation.Ms. Yellen\u2019s optimism that Fed policy can increase employment and wages is also challenged by a growing body of economic literature contending that the decline in the share of the working-age population in jobs stems largely from factors that predate the recession and cannot be addressed by continuing to hold down interest rates.\u201cThese results,\u201d they wrote, \u201csuggest the U.S. economy faced serious impediments to high employment rates well before the Great Recession, and that sustained high employment is unlikely to return without restoring labor market fluidity.\u201dMs. Yellen noted their work in her speech as part of a broad survey of all the things the Fed does not know about the state of the economy. The most important uncertainty, she said, is \u201cjust how far the economy now stands from the attainment of its maximum employment goal.\u201dShe said this unusually murky situation required the Fed to consider a broad range of economic indicators, and to make \u201cdifficult judgments\u201d in the absence of clear knowledge. The remarks amounted to a rejection of legislation proposed by House Republicans to require the Fed to make policy according to a firm set of rules.\u201cMonetary policy ultimately must be conducted in a pragmatic manner that relies not on any particular indicator or model,\u201d Ms. Yellen said.She also sought to play down the importance of inflation as an indicator. Inflation remains below the 2 percent annual pace sought by the Fed, but Ms. Yellen said this should not be seen as clear evidence that slack remains in labor markets. At the same time, she warned that a rising inflation rate, by itself, would not clearly indicate that the Fed had reached the limits of its stimulus campaign.\u201cTightening monetary policy as soon as inflation moves back toward 2 percent might, in this case, prevent labor markets from recovering fully,\u201d she said.A small group of demonstrators made the trek to the remote resort hotel in the middle of Grand Teton National Park to urge Fed officials to continue the stimulus campaign. They formed a receiving line for policy makers in the lobby outside the conference, dressed in green T-shirts emblazoned: \u201cWhat Recovery?\u201d\u201cThe Federal Reserve decides how many of us will remain unemployed and whether our wages will go up or stay low,\u201d said Reuben Eckels, the pastor of a church in Wichita, Kan. \u201cThey need to hear voices from everyday people.\u201dMr. Barkan said Ms. Yellen briefly engaged with the demonstrators as she arrived at the conference on Thursday. \u201cShe said, \u2018We understand the issues you\u2019re talking about and we\u2019re doing everything we can,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said.The demonstrators also spent two hours speaking with Ms. George on Thursday and said she told them the Fed needed to pull back soon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Visiting \u2018Shawshank\u2019 Sites, 20 Years Later", "Date": "2014-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPursuitsRichland County refers to itself, because of its character and geographical location, as the \u201cheart of Ohio.\u201d But for a large number of visitors, it is better known as the home of perhaps the most storied prison in movie history.Despite seven Oscar nominations, including one for best picture, \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption\u201d \u2014 starring Tim Robbins as one (very) unfortunate accountant by the name of Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman as a convict named Red \u2014 barely made back its $25 million budget following its 1994 premiere. But after significant video sales and seemingly endless showings on TNT (151 hours of total televised airtime last year alone), Americans fell in love with the TV equivalent of a houseguest who won\u2019t leave.But the film, based on a 1982 Stephen King short story, doesn\u2019t just resonate because it\u2019s always on. \" \u2018Shawshank\u2019 flatters us while still residing in a real, powerful place,\u201d is how Will Leitch, who reviews movies for the sports site Deadspin, explains the story\u2019s staying power. \u201cWe imagine ourselves as Andy Dufresne and want to believe we would be as strong as he was. Our daily struggles aren\u2019t nearly as overpowering as his, but he still chooses to live, to survive \u2014 that feeling of needing to live that\u2019s universal, and timeless.\u201dAll of this ardor helped boost the recent fortunes of Mansfield, Ashland and Upper Sandusky, Ohio, three towns that share 13 sites that appeared in the movie. (The Tappan Stove Company, Westinghouse and General Motors plants have all closed.)(If one were so inclined, one could consume a Redemption Pizza Pie at Two Cousins\u2019 Pizza, wash it down with a Prison Break Soda at Richland Carrousel Park and then eat a scene from the movie made out of chocolate at Squirrel\u2019s Den, all within a block radius of one another in downtown Mansfield. )In May I went there to explore, enjoy and eat my way through the county that will celebrate the film\u2019s 20th anniversary Aug. 29 to 31.\u201cI saw who the real fans of that movie were,\u201d recalled Bob Gunton, the 68-year-old actor who portrayed the evil Warden Samuel Norton, after he paid a visit to the area last summer, \u201cand the movie\u2019s message really connected with them.\u201dThe connection should be apparent on Labor Day weekend when the region will once again double as a town just outside Portland, Me., where an innocent man found freedom, his inmate pal found that \u201chope is a good thing\u201d and the extremely corrupt head of the prison found ...well, he ended up finding the business end of an office pistol \u2014 but that was a good thing for the prisoners.My first stop was near the entrance to Malabar Farm State Park in Lucas, Ohio, across from one very giving tree (the old oak that marked where Andy buried directions to guide Red toward his post-jailbreak home), while offering the type of scenery and sensibility that Norman Rockwell would just as soon live in as paint.\u201cThe terrain is so completely different south of Mansfield than it is north of the town,\u201d said Mr. Gunton who, as an avid biker, pedaled through much of the landscape when he wasn\u2019t filming. \u201cNorth is pretty flat, and in the south, there\u2019s quite a bit of elevation. I would have a completely different experience depending on which area I\u2019d ride.\u201dThis 917-acre oasis that is Malabar Farm has been part of the Ohio State Parks system since 1972 and is best known for being the longtime home of the author Louis Bromfield, who won the 1927 Best Novel Pulitzer Prize for \u201cEarly Autumn.\u201d But for the purposes of my pilgrimage, it also happens to be across the street from Andy\u2019s solitary oak, within a field that looked, as he told Red, \u201clike something out of a Robert Frost poem.\u201dBecause of a thunderstorm in 2011, the photo op is half the tree it used to be. The overall site (along with a cabin featured in the opening scene where Andy is about to confront his cheating wife with a loaded gun and an empty bottle) is still a nice enough visual, but the real gem is the adjoining park, with Bromfield\u2019s 32-room Western Reserve-style home smack dab in the middle of it all.The tour included everything from a pair of Grandma Moses paintings (a \u201cthank you\u201d present to Bromfield for writing an introduction to her 1947 autobiogrpahy, \u201cGrandma Moses: American Primitive\u201d) to a walk-through of Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall\u2019s honeymoon suite (Mr. Bogart was a longtime friend of the author\u2019s, and the couple had their 1945 wedding at his home).\u201cIt was funny to go outside my door, while they were filming, and see a sheriff\u2019s car there for security during the tree scene,\u201d said Sondra Hupp, a Malabar tour guide when she isn\u2019t working at a local bird sanctuary. Ms. Hupp also lived next to the property where the director Frank Darabont shot the scene. \u201cThat was the first thing that came to my head, thinking there might have been a prison break\u201d from the town\u2019s correctional facility.The Malabar Farm Restaurant, in an 1820 building within the park, has a reputation for its hamburgers (the restaurant uses beef from cattle raised next door). From there it was off to see the centerpiece of the Shawshank experience, the Ohio State Reformatory, which closed in 1990, four years before the site was immortalized on film.\u201cThe O.S.R. had 80,000 visitors last year,\u201d said the president of the tourism bureau, Lee Tasseff. \u201cThe film went from saving it from the wrecking ball to becoming a tourism icon.\u201dKeith Fischer, a volunteer guide, knows every inch of the 250,000-square-foot fortress, which opened in 1896 and is now a state landmark.\u201cWe\u2019ve got a haunted prison tour happening tonight,\u201d Mr. Fischer said as we walked past walls of rusted-out cells. \u201cLots of amateur ghost hunters come here, due to the place\u2019s past.\u201dMuch of the film was shot on these grounds, and many of the props remain, including the sewage pipe Andy spent 19 years breaking into, and eventually crawled out of, to freedom.Other nods to notable plot points within the facility include the other half of the storm-split oak tree propped outside the entrance, and Warden Norton\u2019s office, complete with the safe where he discovered Andy\u2019s nub of a rock hammer in a hollowed-out Bible. Last summer, a group of tourists was lucky enough to bump into the coldhearted disciplinarian himself.\u201cI was taking the tour,\u201d Mr. Gunton said, \u201cand sat behind the desk right when about 60 people come into the very same room. Immediately the place was lit up with cellphone cameras.\u201cSo I held an impromptu news conference,\u201d he said, \u201cexplaining how we shot various scenes, including the warden\u2019s demise, while sitting in that seat, and the logistics that went through that.\u201dThe 118-year-old reformatory, which resembles the Tower of London, is still visited by ex-convicts. \u201cAbout once a week we\u2019ll get a former inmate in here,\u201d Mr. Fischer said as we made our way through the world\u2019s largest free-standing steel cellblock. \u201cThey get some closure. And it gives them some new perspective. They always looked up at the tower. Now they can go up there and look down.\u201dThe next day I drove 46 miles to Upper Sandusky, to pay a visit to the Shawshank Woodshop, the closest thing the area has to a full-on museum devoted to the movie. This was where Red and the rest of his crew heard Andy play Mozart\u2019s \u201cMarriage of Figaro\u201d over the prison sound system and, as Red narrates, \u201cIt was like some beautiful bird flapped into our drab little cage and made those walls dissolve away, and for the briefest of moments, every last man in Shawshank felt free.\u201dThe owners of the wood shop, Bill and April Mullen, were smart enough to get in on the film tourism trade earlier than most. As a result, they\u2019ve acquired more artifacts from the movie than can even be found at the reformatory: everything from the novelty prison trays Hollywood attendees used before the premiere at Mansfield\u2019s gorgeous Renaissance Theater to the 1937 Ford bus that Andy arrived in with the rest of the \u201cfresh fish.\u201d\u201cMorgan Freeman hasn\u2019t said he won\u2019t come in August,\u201d said Mr. Mullen, who became friends with the actor after meeting him in 2012 at the Ground Zero Blues Club, the Clarksdale, Miss., spot that Mr. Freeman co-owns. \u201cWe\u2019re holding out hope.\u201d (A representative for Mr. Freeman said the event is currently not on the actor\u2019s schedule.) Mr. Mullen said Mr. Robbins had also been contacted, but his publicist said he\u2019d be out of the country.\u201cTim was very soft-spoken, and we were all wondering how anyone was going to hear him on screen,\u201d said Bob Wachtman, a retired Upper Sandusky native and an extra in a scene filmed at the nearby Wyandot County Courthouse, as he walked through the wood shop with Mr. Mullen and me. \u201cOnce my shot was done, they never ordered me out of the building, so I just sat there and watched them film the whole day.\u201dAs Mr. Wachtman spoke in almost reverential tones about a small chapter in the town\u2019s history that occurred two decades ago, I thought of the more recent moment when a reformatory guide told me of the fan weddings that the prison hosts and then added, almost as an afterthought, that he too would be getting hitched on the grounds the very next weekend.Not everyone can schedule on-site nuptials (they start at $1,000), but there are always the souvenir T-shirts reading Property of Ohio State Reformatory. Those go for $15.An article last Sunday about tourism in Mansfield, Ashland and Upper Sandusky, Ohio, where much of \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption\u201d was filmed, described incorrectly at one point the location of an old oak tree that was featured in the film. As the article correctly noted elsewhere, it is across the road from Malabar Farm State Park, not in the park. And the article misstated the direction of Upper Sandusky from Mansfield; it is west, not east.IF YOU GOWhere to StayWhere to EatWhat to DoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oversize Expectations for the Airbus A380", "Date": "2014-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTo get a sense of the Airbus A380\u2019s size and ambition, walk up the grand staircase of an Emirates version of the aircraft, past the showers and the first-class suites and then through endless rows in business class to the bar at the back of the upper deck. This sleek semicircle, alluringly underlit and fully stocked with pricey spirits like Grey Goose vodka, is undoubtedly one of the defining features of this aircraft, which can hold more than 500 passengers. The plane dwarfs every commercial jet in the skies.Since it started flying commercially seven years ago, the A380 has caught the imagination of travelers. Its two full-length decks total 6,000 square feet, 50 percent more than the original jumbo jet, the Boeing 747. Its wingspan barely fits inside a football field. Its four engines take this 560-ton airplane to a cruising altitude of 39,000 feet in less than 15 minutes, a surprisingly smooth ascent for such a bulky plane. Passengers love it because it\u2019s quiet and more reminiscent of a cruise ship than an airplane.The A380 was also Airbus\u2019s answer to a problematic trend: More and more passengers meant more flights and increasingly congested tarmacs. Airbus figured that the future of air travel belonged to big planes flying between major hubs. \u201cMore than simply a big airplane,\u201d one industry analyst wrote when the first A380 was delivered to Singapore Airlines in 2007, \u201cthe newest industry flagship will change forever the way the industry operates.\u201dThe prediction hasn\u2019t exactly come true. Airbus has struggled to sell the planes. Orders have been slow, and not a single buyer has been found in the United States, South America, Africa or India. Only one airline in China has ordered it, and its only customer in Japan has canceled. Even existing customers are paring down orders. The A380 has a list price of $400 million, but the pressure has forced Airbus to cut prices as much as 50 percent, according to industry analysts. So far, Airbus has received 318 orders and delivered 138 planes to just 11 airlines \u2014 a disappointing tally given forecasts that the plane would be a flagship aircraft for carriers worldwide.Only one airline \u2014 Emirates \u2014 has made the A380 a central element of its global strategy, ordering 140 as it built a major travel hub in Dubai. But Emirates is unique. No one else has bet on the plane with quite the same confidence. The A380 hasn\u2019t done so well for a number of reasons, some merely cyclical. The plane was introduced amid a deep downturn in the airline business. Airline executives were wary of expanding their fleets aggressively, especially for a costly, four-engine fuel hog.\u201cIt\u2019s a commercial disaster,\u201d Mr. Aboulafia says. \u201cEvery conceivably bad idea that anyone\u2019s ever had about the aviation industry is embodied in this airplane.\u201d Airbus spent roughly $25 billion to develop the aircraft. The plane was delayed for years because of manufacturing problems while Airbus struggled to keep the plane\u2019s weight down and coordinate its complex design among dozens of suppliers across Europe. In 2012, Airbus discovered small cracks in supporting ribs inside the A380\u2019s wings, an embarrassing and costly design error that the manufacturer is now correcting. While the A380 program has been a boon for the European aerospace industry, Airbus is unlikely to recover its research and development costs. The best it can now expect is to break even on production costs, according to analysts, provided that it can keep orders going.Competing ConclusionsA little more than a decade ago, the two dominant airplane makers, Boeing and Airbus, looked at where their businesses were headed and saw similar facts: air traffic doubling every 15 years, estimates that the number of travelers would hit four billion by 2030 \u2014 and came to radically different conclusions about what those numbers meant for their future. Boeing figured that traffic would move away from big hubs and toward secondary airports. So it started to build a smaller, more fuel-efficient long-range aircraft, which became known as the 787 Dreamliner. Airbus, on the other hand, saw the rise of international traffic through major hubs and decided to bet on a big plane to connect those big airports. \u201cThe A380 is not made for every route, but it is ideal for high-traffic routes, high-volume routes that are congested, or where there are flying constraints,\u201d says Antonio Da Costa, the head of A380 marketing for Airbus. Here is one example of how the Airbus theory works in practice: This summer, British Airways plans to replace three Boeing 747s flying each day between London and Los Angeles with two A380s, freeing one slot at Heathrow Airport for another flight.Yet despite the congestion at hubs like Heathrow and the growth of megacities like New York, New Delhi and Beijing, the market for large planes remains small. Airbus predicts that in the next 20 years, airlines will order more than 29,000 new planes from Airbus, Boeing and other plane makers. But the bulk of those, or roughly 20,000, will be smaller, single-aisle planes that fly routes like New York to Chicago, or London to Frankfurt. Airbus estimates that the market for the biggest \u2014 and most expensive \u2014 long-range airplanes will be about 1,700. Boeing, too, is facing lukewarm demand for its latest jumbo jet upgrade, known as the 747-8. The company has received just 51 orders for this big plane, which can seat about 460 passengers and lists at $357 million. By contrast, it has sold more than 1,200 twin-engine 777s, which sell for as much as $320 million. (Airlines typically get discounts on the listed prices.)More worrisome for Airbus is that it has struggled to find new customers for the A380 after a flurry of initial orders. Just three new carriers \u2014 Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways and Asiana Airlines \u2014 are getting A380 planes this year. And last month, Airbus canceled an order for six A380s destined for Skymark Airlines, a low-cost carrier in Japan that has been losing money.Garuda of Indonesia recently dropped plans to buy the A380, deciding that the plane was too big for its markets. And Virgin Atlantic, which has options for six A380s, remains undecided about whether to proceed. The airline was partly acquired by Delta Air Lines in 2012; Richard H. Anderson, Delta\u2019s chief executive, has said the A380 is \u201cby definition an uneconomic airplane unless you\u2019re a state-owned enterprise with subsidies.\u201d Current customers, too, are cutting back their orders, including the major carriers in France and Germany, where the plane is assembled. Air France postponed the last two of 12 planes it had ordered. Lufthansa has scaled back its order to 14 from 17. Bruno Delile, Air France\u2019s senior vice president for fleet management, says that there are a limited number of routes in its network with enough daily traffic to justify the expense of such a big plane. \u201cThe forecasts about traffic growth and market saturation haven\u2019t exactly panned out,\u201d he says.Not only do airlines take a big risk on the size and cost of the A380, but they also have to gain the cooperation of airports to modify gates and widen taxiways to make room for the plane. Apart from the main global hubs, few airports have made these investments. No airport in Brazil, for instance, can handle an A380. The plane was only recently allowed in Mumbai.\u201cAirports haven\u2019t really been rushing to welcome the A380,\u201d Mr. Delile says.Airbus may have mistimed the market in a more fundamental way. While European engineers were developing the plane, their counterparts at Boeing were working on alternative designs. Out of this effort came the 787 Dreamliner, with a carbon-composite fuselage, a host of electronic systems and more efficient engines that could fly longer distances while consuming less jet fuel.That plane, which entered service in late 2011, had its share of high-profile problems; the entire fleet was grounded for three months in 2013 because of battery fires. Boeing says the problem has been resolved, and the company has orders for more than 1,000 of the planes. With versions that seat 210 to 330 passengers, and with a range of about 9,000 miles, the 787 allows airlines to fly pretty much anywhere in the world and connect smaller airports without going through a hub. Recognizing the success of the 787, Airbus started developing its own version of a long-range, fuel-efficient airplane, called the A350-XWB. The first should be delivered to Qatar Airways before year-end. Airlines have ordered 742 of the A350s since the program was announced in 2006.\u201cNo doubt some airlines, given the opportunity to rewrite history, would not order the A380,\u201d Mr. Horton says.A Bar in the SkyThe view from Tim Clark\u2019s office on the top floor of the Emirates headquarters in Dubai offers a stunning panorama of the city\u2019s airport, including a new $4.5 billion terminal. Emirates currently operates 50 A380s, with more on the way, and has built its business model around the plane. Traffic here never stops. Even at midnight, when flights from the east land and connect passengers who are headed west, the airport is alive and bustling.If most airlines appear skeptical of the A380, Emirates is a true believer. It stunned the industry in December when it ordered 50 more of the planes, beyond the 90 it already had on order, throwing Airbus a much needed lifeline. (Emirates also ordered 150 new Boeing 777Xs, a more efficient variation on the best-selling jet, helping to initiate the program for this new airplane, due in 2020.)Mr. Clark, the president of the airline, has turned it into one of the world\u2019s largest carriers by seat capacity. And he is the A380\u2019s most enthusiastic supporter. \u201cPeople get on the A380 and they absolutely love it,\u201d he says. The upper deck on the Emirates version, he adds, is \u201cjust one big party.\u201d (Other carriers configure their A380s differently, with some including economy seating in the upper deck.)The son of a tanker ship captain and an economist, Mr. Clark joined Emirates in the mid-1980s. His basic insight about the A380 is simple: It can be a canvas for a new kind of luxury flight experience. It was Mr. Clark who came up with the idea to install two showers for first-class passengers. Airbus engineers thought the idea was crazy because it would require more fuel to fly the water for the showers. But he dismissed their objections. The showers would immediately distinguish the plane from anything else in the air. He also put a large bar on board, along with a pair of semicircular couches, equipped with seatbelts in case of turbulence. \u201cThis thing is so popular and during the course of a 14-hour flight it becomes even more popular,\u201d he says. \u201cThey all want to have their picture taken behind the bar with their arms around the girls,\u201d he says, referring to passengers posing with the flight attendants. That was certainly the atmosphere on a 13-hour flight between New York and Dubai earlier this year. While about 400 weary coach passengers on the lower deck tried to catch a few hours of fitful sleep, the upper-deck mood was more festive.Rudolph V. Pino Jr., an insurance lawyer from New York, enjoyed a glass of chardonnay and traded pleasantries and business cards with other passengers. The bar was staffed by cheerful flight attendants amid an endless supply of Champagne and canap\u00e9s. \u201cIt\u2019s a special airplane,\u201d he said. \u201cIt brings some glamour back to air travel, just like in the days of TWA and the old Boeing 747s.\u201d Unlike airlines in the United States, Emirates, which is a product of Dubai\u2019s aviation-friendly policies, operates from a single hub. The airport handled 66 million passengers last year, rivaling Heathrow as the busiest international hub. Emirates serves more than 140 destinations, essentially connecting flows of passengers with a single stop in Dubai. But for Emirates, the biggest selling point of the A380 is its ability to pack in more business-class seats and create an environment that appeals to big-spending passengers. \u201cThe upper deck of the A380 is an absolute gold mine for us,\u201d Mr. Clark says. \u201cWe elected to make it all premium. We elected to put in all the gadgets and gizmos. We were laughed at, at first.\u201dThere are more first- and business-class seats on the Emirates A380 than on the 777, and they are usually 75 to 80 percent full, Mr. Clark says. On some routes, like those to Heathrow, where Emirates has five daily flights, that figure can reach 90 percent. Once the whole plane is 85 percent full, its operating costs fall below those of a 777, he says. It\u2019s a simple-enough recipe. But for the plane to be successful for Airbus, Emirates can\u2019t be the only airline to make it work. The problem is that American carriers, including United, aren\u2019t interested. Wall Street analysts aren\u2019t convinced, either. Shares of United would plunge at least 10 percent if it bought A380s, according to one analyst, because of concerns that they would bring too much capacity into the market. In recent years, United States airlines have found the way back to profitability by cutting capacity and retiring airplanes, effectively taking seats out of the market. A bigger plane, in the view of some analysts, would undo everything they\u2019ve done.Some analysts are also worried about the resale value of an A380, once the planes come off their lease and enter the secondary market. With weak sales and limited interest today, aviation experts say the plane\u2019s resale value could potentially depress new A380 prices even further.In his aerie in Dubai, Mr. Clark appears untroubled by these considerations. He has repeatedly said he would buy more planes if Airbus could deliver them fast enough. \u201cMy view is that we\u2019ve all got to tough this out,\u201d he says. \u201cAs I say to my friends at Airbus: Don\u2019t bottle this. The day will come again. The global economy will take care of you.\u201dHe has encouraged Airbus to build an even bigger version of the A380. That, even Airbus would concede, seems unlikely.Advertisement"}

I serve as an adviser to a number of governments on their energy policies and frequently speak at international conferences.What all of this really means is that I\u2019m flying all the time, mostly international, on big commercial airliners and smaller regional planes.It\u2019s pretty ironic since my feelings about flying are rather mixed. Rationally, I\u2019m not afraid of flying. But in practice I get a little concerned at times, especially on local airlines. I swear some of the planes I\u2019ve been on have been held together with duct tape.I\u2019m a Ph.D., and sometimes the flight manifest shows me as Dr. Brenda Shaffer. A number of years ago, I was flying on Lufthansa from Frankfurt to Boston. I was seated back in coach, and a passenger in first class was having health issues. The flight crew saw the \u201cDr.\u201d in front of my name and made the assumption that I was some type of medical doctor, and an attendant asked me if I could help. I would have loved to, but I told her that I was a doctor in political science and unless that person was having an emergency with his relations with Tajikistan, I wouldn\u2019t do much good.I\u2019m a very organized person, but in flying and travel, there are always other people who think they do it better and smarter than you. Sometimes they do. Sometimes they don\u2019t.I was flying from Israel back to the United States years ago with a colleague who thought he was the smartest and most efficient traveler who had ever lived. I was constantly being told what to do and what to bring and got a little grief for bringing along some books and magazines to read.This gentleman told me that he didn\u2019t waste his time with books and magazines. Instead, he took a sleeping pill so he would be refreshed and ready to work when he landed.Well, he did take the sleeping pill. We were in economy class, and he was out like a light. The problem was, the plane developed some mechanical difficulties, and we had to land in Amsterdam. He was so groggy that he could barely stand, let alone make it off the plane. I had to drag him off the plane and then support him as we were making our way through the airport. It was like dragging dead weight.I have told this story to several of his colleagues whom I have seen at various events. If he is still saying he is the most efficient flier ever, I want to set the record straight.Aside from English, I also speak Hebrew, Russian, Turkish and some Azerbaijani and Uzbek. It serves me well in my work and also seems to help at airports.One time, a Turkish gentleman and a Russian woman who were not traveling together both lost their luggage. I was by the carousel at Kennedy and could understand both of them. However, the airline representative could not. So I just stepped in and translated for each of them.The man and woman looked at me as if I were from a different planet since neither had met anyone who spoke both Russian and Turkish. They asked me where I was from. They got really confused when I said San Francisco and Israel.As told to Joan Raymond. Email: \njoan.raymond@nytimes.com Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New Report Argues Inequality Is Causing Slower Growth. Here\u2019s Why It Matters.", "Date": "2014-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIncomes and OutcomesIs income inequality holding back the United States economy? A new report argues that it is, that an unequal distribution in incomes is making it harder for the nation to recover from the recession and achieve the kind of growth that was commonplace in decades past.The report is interesting not because it offers some novel analytical approach or crunches previously unknown data. Rather, it has to do with who produced it, which says a lot about how the discussion over inequality is evolving.\u201cOur review of the data, as well as a wealth of research on this matter, leads us to conclude that the current level of income inequality in the U.S. is dampening G.D.P. growth,\u201d the S.&P. researchers write, \u201cat a time when the world\u2019s biggest economy is struggling to recover from the Great Recession and the government is in need of funds to support an aging population.\u201dTo understand why this matters, you have to know a little bit about the many tribes within the world of economics.Then there are the economists in what can broadly be called the business forecasting community. They wear nicer suits than the academics, and are better at offering a glib, confident analysis of the latest jobs numbers delivered on CNBC or in front of a room full of executives who are their clients. They work for ratings firms like S.&P., forecasting firms like Macroeconomic Advisers and the economics research departments of all the big banks.The key difference, though, is that rather than trying to produce cutting-edge theory, they are trying to do the practical work of explaining to clients \u2014 companies trying to forecast future demand, investors trying to allocate assets \u2014 how the economy is likely to evolve. They\u2019re not really driven by ideology, or by models that are rigorous enough in their theoretical underpinnings to pass academic peer review. Rather, their success or failure hinges on whether they\u2019re successful at giving those clients an accurate picture of where the economy is heading.In that sense, the new S.&P. report is a sign of how worries that income inequality is a factor behind subpar economic growth over the last five years (and really the last 15 years) is going from an idiosyncratic argument made mainly by left-of center economists to something that even the tribe of business forecasters needs to wrestle with.I asked Beth Ann Bovino, the chief U.S. economist at S.&P., why she and her colleagues took on this topic. \u201cWe spend a lot of time trying to think about what\u2019s the economic outlook and what to expect ahead,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat disturbs me about this recovery \u2014 which has been the weakest in 50 years \u2014 is how feeble it has been, and we\u2019ve been asking what are the reasons behind it.\u201d She added: \u201cOne of the reasons that could explain this pace of very slow growth is higher income inequality. And that also might also explain what happened that led up to the great recession.\u201d\u201cFrom my research and some of the analysis I saw from others, when you have extreme levels of inequality, it can hurt the economy,\u201d she said.Because the affluent tend to save more of what they earn rather than spend it, as more and more of the nation\u2019s income goes to people at the top income brackets, there isn\u2019t enough demand for goods and services to maintain strong growth, and attempts to bridge that gap with debt feed a boom-bust cycle of crises, the report argues. High inequality can feed on itself, as the wealthy use their resources to influence the political system toward policies that help maintain that advantage, like low tax rates on high incomes and low estate taxes, and underinvestment in education and infrastructure.The report itself does not break any major new analytical or empirical ground. It spends many pages summarizing the findings of various academic and government economists who have studied inequality and its discontents, and stops short of recommending any radical policy changes favored by the likes of Mr. Piketty (who is among those cited).And the S.&P. researchers are relatively limited in their policy prescriptions, avoiding much discussion of politically explosive debates over marginal tax rates and the scale of the social welfare system. They instead emphasize the usefulness of investing more heavily in education.Ms. Bovino and her colleagues find that if the average amount of education of the nation\u2019s work force were to increase at the same rate it did during the middle of the 20th century, over the next five years annual G.D.P. would be 2.4 percent higher.The S.&P. report is one document from one research group, so one shouldn\u2019t make too much of it. But it is a sign of where things are shifting: Anyone who wants to explain why the United States economy is evolving the way it is needs to at least wrestle with the implications of a more unequal society for the economy as a whole.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Putin Rushes In, Pretending Not to; Obama Stands Back", "Date": "2014-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byQuick HistoryWhen a state sends more than a thousand troops with mobile artillery and heavy equipment into a neighboring state and takes control of territory, that\u2019s an invasion, right?Not according to NATO, which reported the Russian military movements in Ukraine this past week but depicted them only as increased Russian \u201cinterference.\u201d And not according to President Obama, who saw Russia being only \u201ca little more overt\u201d in its support of secessionists in southeastern Ukraine. And certainly not according to President Vladimir V. Putin, whose lieutenants simply denied everything and labeled the evidence a Western \u201ccanard.\u201dSpin, of course, is an elemental political tool, and for the West to call the invasion an invasion would require a response that neither Washington nor other Western capitals nor NATO are prepared for. But an invasion it is, and the fundamental challenge to the liberal world order that it poses will be high on NATO\u2019s agenda when its leaders gather in Wales this week.As for Mr. Putin, the lie is an honored Soviet propaganda tool he has used since the start of the Russian campaign against Ukraine. The Russian leader is aware that acknowledging an invasion would not only sharply elevate the level of tension with the West, but would carry considerable domestic repercussions. Polls show that only 5 percent of Russians would support sending their troops into Ukraine.When Russia acknowledged that Ukraine had captured some Russian soldiers \u2014 Moscow said they accidentally wandered across the border \u2014 mothers and girlfriends of the prisoners immediately and loudly began demanding an explanation.The implausibly deniable invasion of Ukraine, to play on an old C.I.A. term, is not the only unconventional war facing the United States and NATO. There is also the question of what to do about ISIS, the brutal jihadist outfit marauding through Iraq and Syria.In brief comments on Ukraine and the Middle East on Thursday, President Obama said the United States had not yet formulated a strategy for dealing with ISIS inside Syria, but he confirmed he had asked Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel for options. But however reluctant he and the American public were to get militarily involved abroad, it was clear that neither the United States nor NATO could ignore the two threats.As NATO grapples with armed conflicts, international health authorities will be fighting their own unconventional war against the Ebola virus, which spread to a fifth West African country, Senegal, and, according to the World Health Organization, could eventually infect 20,000 people.In this struggle, too, finding a strategy was not always easy. Liberia\u2019s misguided attempt to quarantine the squalid West Point neighborhood of the capital of Monrovia, the African city hit hardest by Ebola, created a reaction arguably as dangerous as the infection, with residents crowding together and battling surrounding soldiers and the police.The Convenient LieThe crisis in Ukraine has been underway now for half a year, and the Russian involvement, from the outright annexation of Crimea in March to the men, arms and convoys repeatedly reported spotted in the fighting in the southeastern industrial belt, has been obvious. But something seemed to change in the past week, when Mr. Putin amiably shook hands with President Petro O. Poroshenko on Tuesday, just two days before NATO reported that more than 1,000 Russian soldiers with artillery and other heavy weaponry were on the march inside Ukraine, and as rebels poised themselves for a new thrust along the Sea of Azov.Until now, Europe, and to a lesser degree the United States, had publicly sustained the myth that Russia was intent only on destabilizing Ukraine to deter it from shifting westward politically, rather than to gain control over its eastern provinces, and that Mr. Putin could be brought to the negotiating table through sanctions and censure. But the Russia-backed rebel drive toward the port of Mariupol could also open a land route from Russia to Crimea, underpinning Russian control of a broad section of Ukrainian territory that Mr. Putin has provocatively called by its old czarist name, \u201cNovorossiya,\u201d or \u201cNew Russia.\u201dThe West has been reluctant to acknowledge that Mr. Putin may be seeking actual control over the Donbass region, in part because breaking with Russia would endanger a major European energy source and lucrative trade deals, including the French sale of two Mistral-class assault ships to Moscow. More broadly, defining Russia as an enemy would mean an end to the post-Cold War world order based on the international rule of law \u2014 an order in which a democratizing Russia was to be a partner in integrating emerging economies, fighting terrorism and reining in rogue states.Mr. Putin has craftily assisted Europe in its illusions by consistently denying any role in the Ukrainian fighting, regularly referring to the Europeans as \u201cour partners,\u201d pinning the blame for the crisis on American \u201cunilateralism,\u201d and posing as a mediator between Kiev and the pro-Russian militias. His actions, however, reflect a primitive and aggressive brand of geopolitics that was not supposed to have survived the Cold War.In his comments on Thursday, Mr. Obama seemed intent first of all on restraining expectations of what the United States might do about either Ukraine or ISIS. Russia\u2019s actions, he said, were \u201cnot really a shift,\u201d and he was vague about tightening sanctions.Yet the pressure for intervening more directly in Ukraine by supplying the government in Kiev with weapons and intelligence is bound to grow, both within the Obama administration and among Eastern European states.The Islamic StateThat challenge extends to Iraq and Syria, where the latest iteration of fanatical Islam, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, has established a virtual state straddling the two countries through military prowess and ruthless cruelty.While Washington has agreed to airstrikes against ISIS inside Iraq to protect threatened minorities and to give the Baghdad government time to marshal its badly battered and fractured forces, President Obama emphasized on Thursday that no decision had been made yet on dealing with ISIS inside Syria.But there was a growing awareness that ISIS could not be curbed so long as it could flee to bases in Syria. Officials were said to be debating whether to use drones or fighter jets, and whether to target ISIS forces or specific leaders.Mr. Obama did not address the actual choices before him. His message was not the action the United States or its allies might take, but rather the inadmissibility of any mission creep.

{"Headline": "Britain Fails to Find Riches It Expected in Swiss Accounts", "Date": "2014-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 When the British tax authorities struck a landmark deal with the Swiss to crack down on tax evasion, they sat back and waited for the cash to flow in. Almost three years later, they are still waiting.So far, only about $1.7 billion of the $8.4 billion windfall they once expected has materialized, and sheepish tax authorities now hope to eventually collect just a third of their original estimate.Instead, the deal struck by Britain, which once seemed a pioneer in combating tax evasion, is emerging as a cautionary tale for a growing number of nations that are feeling the pinch of Europe\u2019s flat economy and are desperate to reap revenues from secret accounts held by the wealthy. The amounts at stake are enormous. In 2012, the British government estimated that Britons had amassed more than 40 billion pounds, or $68.5 billion, in Swiss banks. Some conservative estimates of the amount of money tucked away in tax havens and out of reach of governments worldwide range as high as $21 trillion \u2014 more than the gross domestic product of the United States.British tax authorities are now facing increasing pressure to act more aggressively. But as the British deal has shown, the efforts to reduce tax avoidance by striking deals with individual havens are akin to plugging one hole in a colander.Britain\u2019s deal with Switzerland had plenty of its own. For those who wanted to evade the British tax authorities, the agreement gave ample warning \u2014 16 months \u2014 to shift money to other offshore havens or put it into gold, bearer funds, artwork, insurance or safe deposit boxes.Other money is hidden in ever more elaborate mazes of offshore trusts and foundations often managed by trustees, usually foreign lawyers, allowing the real beneficiaries to remain secret.Mr. Ecclestone denies that he controlled the trust, and says the $44 million was extorted by the banker, to keep him from making false claims.The finances of the trust are so complicated, according to a document filed in the trial, that, under a 2009 divorce agreement, Mr. Ecclestone\u2019s former wife agreed to pay him about $100 million a year. In effect, the authorities say, it is a kind of alimony \u201cinversion.\u201d Mr. Ecclestone keeps a home in Gstaad, Switzerland, which offers a shield because the Swiss authorities do not disclose any account information about legal residents. And his ex-wife is a Croatian who is not a British resident, which has also allowed Mr. Ecclestone to keep the money out of the reach of British tax authorities.The British-Swiss deal was always contentious, with critics arguing that it amounted to an amnesty to tax evaders. The German government abandoned efforts to sign a similar agreement with Switzerland. Under the deal with Switzerland about 18,000 Britons disclosed their names to the British authorities. Those who did not want to be identified paid a one-time levy of up to 34 percent to settle past taxes. Then last year, the Swiss started deducting a regular \u201cwithholding tax\u201d on the interest on behalf of the British authorities.The British tax authorities still insist they did the right thing by striking the agreement, even as they quietly lower expectations of its likely value. Supporters of the government argue that essentially it came down to this deal or nothing.But Mr. Swales, the lawmaker, said that he wanted to see more naming and shaming of individuals. The Swiss, he said, were aware of many cases involving \u201cpeople that they know are engaged in some form of criminal activity like tax evasion.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cutting the Corporate Tax Would Make Other Problems Grow", "Date": "2014-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byToday's EconomistThe basic idea behind abolition is that the current corporate tax code is fraught with wasteful loopholes \u2014 each of which has politically power defenders \u2014 that both lose revenue and distort business decisions. The abolitionists ask: Why not give up on the fiction that we can adequately and efficiently tax companies and instead tax their shareholders at higher income-tax rates?But as imperfect as the corporate tax may be, the end of it would create all kinds of problems and disadvantages. Here is a breakdown of those drawbacks:When corporate profits as a share of national income are the highest on record, with data going back to the late 1920s, it suggests that the current corporate tax system, with all its shortcomings, is hardly killing the competitiveness of American companies.Another reason abolishment is a bad idea: If you think we\u2019ve got tax avoidance problems now \u2014 and if you don\u2019t, you\u2019re not paying attention \u2014 we\u2019d have a much bigger problem with a zero tax rate on incorporated businesses. Most of us don\u2019t manage our taxes. We just pay them. But as your tax bill goes up, you will aggressively look for ways to shelter your income. (More precisely, you hire people to do that for you.)For example, in order to avoid the higher rate on personal income, fund managers tap the \u201ccarried interest\u201d loophole so their earnings are taxed at the lower capital gains rate. To see some really deep tax avoidance, you\u2019ve got to travel abroad to tax havens like the Cayman Islands, where American deposits in their banks amount to about 550 percent of the country\u2019s G.D.P.Those who would get rid of the corporate tax basically argue that the smart move is to go with this flow: As long as so many more businesses are setting themselves up to avoid the corporate tax, don\u2019t fight \u2032em, join \u2032em.The problem is that to do so risks turning the corporate structure itself into a big tax shelter: If income generated and retained by incorporated businesses should become tax-free, then guess what type of income everybody will suddenly start making? Taxes delayed are taxes saved, and with no corporate tax, anyone who could do so would structure their earnings and investments to be \u201ccorporate earnings,\u201d untaxed until they\u2019re distributed.To see the relative efficiency of the current arrangement, think about alternative ways of designing a system to tax undistributed corporate profits. What if I held shares for a day? A week? Suppose dividends were paid out that week? It would be very hard for the I.R.S. to keep track of this, which some of the corporate tax abolitionists acknowledge.You could tax the accrued earnings on corporate stock held over the course of a year, but taxing shareholders on unrealized gains represents a huge change in tax policy that would be aggressively resisted by patient holders of equity. They\u2019d view this trade-off \u2014 a tax on unrealized capital gains in exchange for ending the corporate tax \u2014 as an awfully big stick for a pretty scrawny carrot.Filling the revenue hole could be solved partly by raising taxes on the wealthy, as he notes, but suppose it\u2019s not? Who then will bear the burden of making up the lost revenue?The abolitionists argue that since we already tax lots of business income that\u2019s passed through to the individual\u2019s tax bill, there\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t do more of that. The problem is, we do an even worse job taxing non-incorporated business income than corporate income.Rather than create a new shelter in a world where tax avoidance is already an increasing problem, it would be better to mend the current code. Here too, however, those on my side of the argument are guilty of the same hand-waving as the corporate-tax abolitionists. \u201cBroaden the base\u201d \u2014 i.e., close loopholes \u2014 and lower the corporate rate sounds a lot easier than it is. My loophole is your treasured \u201cjob creation program.\u201dBelieve me, as someone who\u2019s been debating this issue for decades, I recognize how tempting it is to just chuck the whole corporate code. But to do so now would only further encourage tax avoidance and erode an already diminished tax base.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Web Trolls Winning as Incivility Increases", "Date": "2014-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtThe Internet may be losing the war against trolls. At the very least, it isn\u2019t winning. And unless social networks, media sites and governments come up with some innovative way of defeating online troublemakers, the digital world will never be free of the trolls\u2019 collective sway.That\u2019s the dismal judgment of the handful of scholars who study the broad category of online incivility known as trolling, a problem whose scope is not clear, but whose victims keep mounting.\u201cTroll\u201d is the fuzzy term for agitators who pop up, often anonymously, sometimes in mobs, in comment threads and on social networks like Facebook and Twitter, apparently intent on wreaking havoc. The term is vague precisely because trolls lurk in darkness; their aims are unclear, their intentions unknown, their affiliations mysterious.The broader definition of troll reflects, in part, the rise of social media, which has collapsed all distance between celebrity entertainers and media types and their critics. Scholars note that one of the primary motivations of trolling is to titillate other trolls. This sets up one of the central difficulties in confronting trolling: Shedding light on trolling may only encourage it.Jezebel, the popular feminist news site run by Gawker Media, disclosed that it had been overrun for months by anonymous people posting violent, pornographic pictures in its comments section. Some of the content included \u201cgory images of bloody injuries emblazoned with the Jezebel logo,\u201d it said.A celebrity\u2019s quitting Twitter and a blog\u2019s staff having to delete a few terrible images may not sound like one of the most alarming problems the world faces. But trolling does not happen in isolation, and the routine, collective path of emotional damage left in trolls\u2019 wake can be devastating. This is particularly true for women \u2014 especially those who write about feminism or other hot-button topics \u2014 who have become a frequent target of trolls.But combating trolling is a fiendish problem, like the cat-and-mouse fight against hackers. Both Twitter and Facebook have ways for people to report abuse, but the features are frequently described as inadequate.Del Harvey, Twitter\u2019s vice president for trust and safety, said in a statement that the site had suspended the accounts of the people who attacked Ms. Williams. \u201cWe are in the process of evaluating how we can further improve our policies to better handle tragic situations like this one,\u201d she said.But Dr. Phillips, of Humboldt State, pointed out that many efforts to curb trolling ran into a larger problem: \u201cTo what extent do you want to make it harder for people to express themselves on the Internet?\u201d she asked.\u201cThis is not the good-faith exchange of ideas,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just people being nasty, and if anything, it might encourage marginalized groups to not speak up.\u201d She added, \u201cOn the other hand, by silencing that valve, there\u2019s a lot of other stuff that is important culturally that might also be minimized.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of whether or not we\u2019re winning the war on trolling, but whether we\u2019re winning the war on misogyny, or racism, and ableism and all this other stuff,\u201d Dr. Phillips said. \u201cTrolling is just a symptom of those bigger problems.\u201dThe State of the Art column on Friday, about the growing scourge of online incivility known as trolling, referred incorrectly to Twitter\u2019s vice president for trust and safety, who said that the company had suspended the accounts of people who attacked Robin Williams\u2019s daughter, Zelda, after her father\u2019s death. The vice president, Del Harvey, is a woman.Email: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com; Twitter: @fmanjoo Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Yes, Alaska Is Hard to Poll. So Is Everywhere Else.", "Date": "2014-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMidterm CalculusAlaska is notorious for being difficult to poll. It\u2019s a common refrain, common enough that you could be forgiven for not stopping to wonder why.Perhaps the biggest challenge facing Alaskan pollsters, Mr. Larkin said, involves a larger trend within survey research in general: low response rates. Although nonresponse is a problem everywhere, it has an outsize impact in states with small populations, where the pool of people available and willing to take a survey can quickly shrink to nothing. \u201cYou kind of run out of sample, frankly,\u201d he said.Sharon Chamard, director of the Survey Research Center at the University of Alaska Anchorage, added that this, coupled with residential transiency \u2014 people moving in and out of the state \u2014 makes compiling a sample of sufficient size a long and expensive process.But one encounters many of these issues in other states as well. There are many small-population states with significant cell-only or cell-mostly subpopulations, and states with varied and diverse communities.To try to get a sense of how pollsters have fared against these challenges, I decided to look at polls from Senate races since 1992 in which at least three pollsters released a poll within three weeks of Election Day. If a pollster released more than one poll in this window, only its most recent poll was used. This left me with 889 polls spread over 155 Senate races. Polls could then be judged based on how close their predicted vote margins were to the election result.That Alaska Senate race in 2008 was rough, but in terms of average pollster error it doesn\u2019t even crack the top 10. The race that gave pollsters the worst postelection hangover? That\u2019d be the 2000 race in Pennsylvania between Rick Santorum and Ron Klink. Almost every poll in that race showed Mr. Klink trailing by double digits \u2014 a Millersville University poll and one from Decision Forecasting each showed Mr. Santorum up by 21 points just a few weeks before the election. But thanks in part to an unexpected turnout surge in Philadelphia, Mr. Klink ran far closer than the polls suggested. Mr. Santorum still won by 7, but the average poll missed the mark by 11 percentage points.But at least they were on the correct side of the mark. Things were perhaps even worse for pollsters in 1996, when Chuck Hagel and Ben Nelson fought for an open Senate seat in Nebraska. In the days leading to the election, The Omaha World-Herald showed a dead heat, while Mason-Dixon showed Nelson holding a comfortable 13-point lead. Both were public, nonpartisan polls conducted by well-regarded pollsters, and both missed. While Mason-Dixon was correct about the blowout, it was in the wrong direction: Mr. Hagel waltzed to a 14-point victory \u2014 a 27-point error for the firm.The point isn\u2019t that polling in Alaska is easy. It certainly poses tough challenges, ones for which out-of-state pollsters may not always be prepared. But it\u2019s not clear that we should discount numbers coming out of Alaska any more than we should numbers from, say, Georgia or Pennsylvania. That is, at least as far as electoral polling is concerned, Alaska may not deserve quite as much notoriety as it\u2019s gotten.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Changing Face of Temporary Employment", "Date": "2014-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRecovery in Need of a RecoveryTemps aren\u2019t just employees who sort mail and answer the boss\u2019s phone.The work of temping has changed vastly \u2014 today 42 percent of temporary workers labor in light industry or warehouses. And there are more of them. The number of workers employed through temp agencies has climbed to a new high \u2014 2.87 million, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and they represent a record share of the nation\u2019s work force, 2 percent.Labor groups fret that the trend signals the decline of full-time and permanent jobs with good benefits. But what is happening with temp employment is no sharp break with the past.Temp employment has traditionally followed the business cycle, though in an exaggerated way. Temps are disproportionately thrown out of work when there is a slowdown, but when the economy starts to pick up \u2014 with businesses still wary of committing to making permanent hires \u2014 they disproportionately hire temps.More than five years into a recovery marked by halting growth, many businesses are still adding temp jobs rather than permanent ones. \u201cThis is a reflection of business uncertainty, that businesses need to be more responsive, and part of that is keeping their work force flexible,\u201d said Steven Berchem, the chief operating officer of the American Staffing Association.Mr. Berchem is reluctant to accept the government\u2019s numbers. \u201cCertainly staffing employment has grown, and it has returned to prerecession levels,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s a record is still an open question. Our own set of numbers show substantial growth, but not at the level the B.L.S. has.\u201dMr. Berchem plays down the growth and success of his industry partly because the more it grows the more heat it faces. \u201cWe still account for only 2 percent of the work force,\u201d he said. \u201cDuring the depths of the recession, we were much closer to 1 percent. We have never substantially exceeded 2 percent of the work force.\u201d\u201cThere is certainly a lot of evidence that many of these jobs are not good on health and safety and other working conditions,\u201d said Rebecca Smith, deputy director of the National Employment Law Project.According to a study of workers in Washington State published in the American Journal of Industrial Medicine, temps had substantially higher rates of injuries, especially in construction and manufacturing, than other workers. Moreover, they usually missed work longer because of those injuries \u2014 40 days compared with 27 days for regular workers. Two other studies found that the injury rate for workers on the job for just one month \u2014 that is often the situation for temps \u2014 is more than twice that of workers employed for a year.Last week his agency released a guide to employers called \u201cRecommended Practices: Protecting Temporary Workers.\u201d Among other things, the guide urges temp agencies to evaluate the host employer\u2019s work site and to train agency staff to recognize safety and health hazards.Temp workers do complain about lack of training. Yvonne Jones, a 32-year-old mother of two, who temped for six months at an auto parts factory in Lorain, Ohio, said she received just 10 minutes of training and nearly no safety training when she was first assigned to a spot welding machine.\u201cI could have used more training,\u201d she said. \u201cThings messed up on the machine all the time.\u201d She noted that the floor near her work station was often wet, and she feared slipping while carrying heavy motors. She said she was suddenly fired several days after she asked to go home one afternoon because of a migraine headache.Mr. Berchem of the staffing association said worker safety was a priority for staffing firms.But some temps are skeptical there will be a path to permanent work. David Fields, a forklift driver for four months at a warehouse in Gary, Ind., finds temp work less promising than he expected. He turned to temping after the auto parts store where he was the manager closed.\u201cTemp jobs really don\u2019t do much for you,\u201d he said, complaining about the lack of benefits. \u201cI get only 20 to 25 hours a week \u2014 they keep telling me things are going to pick up.\u201d Mr. Fields, 45, had started with 40 hours a week, but now his part-time hours make it hard for him to support his wife, who has returned to school, and their 8-year-old son.\u201cEverywhere I look for jobs today, it\u2019s all temporary,\u201d Mr. Fields said. \u201cThe temporary agencies have picked up all the contracts.\u201dMr. Fields would certainly agree with one conclusion from the National Employment Law Project\u2019s report: \u201cStaffing work is one part of a larger story about the declining middle class in our country.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Productivity Rose 2.5 Percent in the 2nd Quarter", "Date": "2014-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byProductivity at nonfarm businesses rebounded strongly in the second quarter, giving the Federal Reserve room to keep interest rates low for a while.The rebound kept in check labor-related production costs that had surged at the start of the year as an unusually cold winter depressed output.Unit labor costs, the price of labor for any given unit of production, rose at a 0.6 percent rate, braking sharply from an upwardly revised 11.8 percent pace in the first quarter.\u201cThe key message here is that labor costs remain subdued and unlikely to represent a source of rising production costs and or inflationary pressures any time soon,\u201d said Anthony Karydakis, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak in New York.The Fed is keeping a close eye on wage growth as it ponders when to raise benchmark interest rates, which it has kept near zero since December 2008. Investors do not expect a rate increase until around the middle of next year.With productivity stepping up, there is more room for workers to win wage increases without pressuring inflation or profits. Compared with the second quarter of last year, unit labor costs were up just 1.9 percent, below the central bank\u2019s 2 percent inflation target.Even so, pay is accelerating. The report showed compensation per hour increased at a 3.1 percent rate in the second quarter, and was up by the same amount from a year earlier. In comparison, hourly compensation advanced only 1.1 percent last year.Other gauges, such as the government\u2019s measure of personal income and its employment cost index \u2014 one of the favorite measures of Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman \u2014 have also pointed to some firming of wage pressures.\u201cToday\u2019s report doesn\u2019t say that labor costs are a problem yet, but it hints at some improvement in pay,\u201d said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa. \u201cFed members, at least the inflation hawks, will likely look at the report as supporting their view that it is time to change direction.\u201dThe second-quarter rebound reflected a sharp step up in gross domestic product in the second quarter. The government said last week that the economy grew at a 4.0 percent rate after shrinking at a 2.1 percent pace in the first quarter.The second-quarter growth estimate, however, is likely to be trimmed when the figures are revised later this month, with a report on Friday from the Commerce Department showing only a moderate gain in wholesale inventories in May and June.Economists said slow wholesale restocking could lower the second-quarter G.D.P. estimate by as much as three-tenths of a percentage point, although data earlier this week showing a smaller trade gap should help offset that a bit.

{"Headline": "French Economy Minister, Arnaud Montebourg, Was Often Out of Step With President", "Date": "2014-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 When Arnaud Montebourg, France\u2019s combative economy minister, learned in April that Alstom, one of the country\u2019s biggest industrial companies, had been secretly negotiating its takeover by General Electric, he responded by publicly castigating the French company\u2019s boss.With the kind of rhetorical flourish that has made him one of France\u2019s most provocative politicians, Mr. Montebourg stood before Parliament and accused Patrick Kron, Alstom\u2019s chairman and chief executive, of duplicity.\u201cDoes the economy minister have to install a lie detector,\u201d Mr. Montebourg asked, in the offices of \u201cthe C.E.O.s who lack the basic civic-mindedness to keep the government informed?\u201dIt was a signature performance for Mr. Montebourg, grabbing headlines and putting the spotlight squarely on the minister at a time when the economy was struggling to come to life. The episode also reminded critics that with his outsize attacks on investors and business leaders, Mr. Montebourg, a 51-year-old lawyer by training and political leftist by inclination, sometimes appeared to be running an economic policy that was out of step with the Socialist government he was supposed to be representing.The outspoken Mr. Montebourg apparently went too far during the weekend, openly criticizing the economic policies of President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and his center-leaning prime minister, Manuel Valls. When Mr. Valls announces a new cabinet on Tuesday, Mr. Montebourg is not expected to be in it.Mr. Montebourg, though, said in a news conference at the Finance Ministry on Monday that he had told Mr. Hollande that if the president found him wanting, he was prepared to \u201cregain his freedom.\u201d\u201cI will follow the example of Cincinnatus,\u201d Mr. Montebourg said, referring to the famously modest Roman statesman, \u201cwho preferred to quit power to return to his fields and plows.\u201dHaving nothing else to hold him, he added, he would \u201creturn to work among the French.\u201dWhile many economists and French business leaders will no doubt be happy to see Mr. Montebourg depart, he continues to draw substantial support on the French left, particularly among trade unions. Indeed, his decision to cross the government now might represent a gamble that it is better to go down fighting, and be prepared for another shot at high office if the winds change, than to be irrevocably tainted by his experience as a member of the most unpopular government in modern French history.Mr. Montebourg\u2019s office did not respond to a request for an interview.Gilles Moec, head of European economics research at Deutsche Bank in London, said that in the early days of the Hollande administration, which came to power in May 2012, \u201cthere was a bit of a good cop-bad cop routine, with Montebourg getting tough with employers and investors, and Hollande playing the nice guy,\u201d which helped spur economic changes.But more recently, with Mr. Hollande flailing in the polls, eager for foreign investment to revive the stagnant economy and to help trim an unemployment rate of more than 10 percent, Mr. Montebourg has often been seen by mainstream economists and foreign businesses as being unable to meet the challenges of a rapidly globalizing world economy, even as he cast himself as the arch-defender of French workers.Within the last two years, Mr. Montebourg has been an advocate for French workers, battling with ArcelorMittal, the world\u2019s largest steel maker, when it planned in 2012 to cut jobs, and last year with Maurice Taylor Jr., a colorful American tire executive he had tried to recruit to save a factory in northern France.As a fast-rising member of the left wing of the Socialist Party, Mr. Montebourg had a sometimes strained relationship with the more centrist Mr. Hollande. In the battle to name a standard-bearer to face the presidential candidate Nicolas Sarkozy in 2007, Mr. Montebourg backed S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal, Mr. Hollande\u2019s former partner and the mother of his children.Mr. Montebourg made clear his feelings for Mr. Hollande at the time, saying that Ms. Royal \u201chas only one flaw \u2014 her companion.\u201d In the 2012 election, though, his support helped Mr. Hollande to defeat a party rival, Martine Aubry.Despite the apparent animus and extreme differences in style with the famously low-key Mr. Hollande, Mr. Montebourg was invited to join the government as minister for industrial renewal in 2012, and then promoted to economy minister in April of this year.Mr. Hollande seemed to have bet that it would be better to have a potential Socialist troublemaker from his seething left flank beside him, ostensibly bound by his insider status to support the official line, than to let him snipe from the sidelines.But Mr. Montebourg was never fully on board. With Mr. Hollande\u2019s hands seemingly tied by Europe\u2019s fiscal rules and the government increasingly adopting supply-side economic policies, Mr. Montebourg continued to insist that Keynesian-style pump-priming was needed to restart the economy. His suggestion over the weekend that Mr. Hollande\u2019s economic policy was a failure, and that \u201cFrance doesn\u2019t have to align itself with the obsessions of the German right,\u201d may have started a Socialist governance crisis that may take some time to resolve.Mr. Montebourg had begun to go beyond his domestic remit, criticizing eurozone economic governance among other things. \u201cHe was beginning to be a liability, especially at the European level,\u201d said Mr. Moec, the Deutsche Bank economist.Stepping in, Mr. Hollande had former Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault take charge of the negotiations. ArcelorMittal and the government worked out a face-saving deal, one that essentially gave the steel maker what it had wanted \u2014 with Mr. Montebourg conspicuously excluded from the talks.In the G.E.-Alstom deal, Joe Kaeser, the Siemens boss, predicted that the French state\u2019s involvement would sabotage many of the benefits for which G.E. had been hoping.In another case, Mr. Montebourg got into a public tiff with Mr. Taylor over a factory in Amiens, in northern France.\u201cThe French work force gets paid high wages but works only three hours,\u201d Mr. Taylor wrote to Mr. Montebourg. \u201cThey have one hour for their breaks and lunch, talk for three and work for three.\u201dMr. Montebourg responded that Mr. Taylor\u2019s comments were \u201cextreme\u201d and \u201cinsulting,\u201d and showed his \u201cperfect ignorance\u201d about France and its attractiveness as an investment destination.But perhaps that was the point. Instead of seeking to demonstrate that Mr. Taylor\u2019s ideas were outmoded and wrong \u2014 French officials proudly noted that productivity here was among the highest in the world \u2014 Mr. Montebourg seemed more inclined to pick a fight with an overseas executive intent on doing business in France.But the apparent breaking point with Mr. Hollande\u2019s administration was Mr. Montebourg\u2019s call to break free from the European Union\u2019s economic orthodoxy. The economy minister had long argued that that was the primary source of the eurozone\u2019s economic malaise. But his is no longer necessarily a minority, or leftish, view in Europe.The question now is whether Mr. Montebourg\u2019s brand of politics will enable him to emerge as a leader of a new economic strand of socialism in France \u2014 or if it will relegate him to a footnote in 21st-century French industrial history.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the employer of the executive who was publicly castigated by Arnaud Montebourg. It was the French company Alstom, not the American company General Electric.Yann Cres contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Questions About Pipelines and Private Property", "Date": "2014-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Texas TribuneAmid an oil and gas boom that has increased demand for new pipelines, Texas regulators have proposed new rules that have renewed a clash between two major state interests: energy development and private property rights.The Railroad Commission of Texas \u2014 which regulates the state\u2019s 426,000-mile network of natural gas, hazardous liquid and other pipelines \u2014 has offered rules aimed at clarifying when pipelines qualify as \u201ccommon carriers,\u201d a status indicating availability for public use and enabling companies to seize private land using eminent domain. The agency is accepting comments on the proposal until late August.Pipeline operators say stricter regulations would bog down efforts to transport the resources that lubricate Texas\u2019 economy. Landowners say they want fair offers for their land and that they lose bargaining power when companies haphazardly invoke eminent domain claims.\u201cMerely registering as a common carrier does not conclusively convey the extraordinary power of eminent domain or bar landowners from contesting in court whether a planned pipeline meets the statutory common carrier requirements,\u201d the court said in its ruling in favor of David Holland, a Beaumont-area landowner who questioned Denbury Resources\u2019 use of eminent domain to build a carbon dioxide pipeline across his land.The commission opposed the ruling, writing in a brief that it could \u201csignificantly impact the development of needed pipeline infrastructure.\u201dPhil Gamble, a lawyer who represents several major pipeline companies, said the commission\u2019s proposal was \u201ccertainly more burdensome\u201d to the industry. Advocates for landowners say they want to ensure that proposal, which does not add any mechanism to contest a commission decision, will not hinder a landowner\u2019s challenge in court. \u201cIt\u2019s still a little vague,\u201d Regan Beck, an assistant general counsel for the Texas Farm Bureau, said of the proposal. \u201cWe want to make sure that there\u2019s not an assumption in court that it\u2019s a common carrier because the Railroad Commission says it is.\u201d (The Texas Farm Bureau is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune.)The Railroad Commission says the proposal will simply improve its registration process for common carriers and will not grant the agency new authority on eminent domain. \u201cThe ultimate authority to make that determination of who qualifies for common carrier status is with the courts,\u201d Ramona Nye, the commission\u2019s spokeswoman, said.Matthew J. Festa, a professor at the South Texas College of Law, said the proposal \u201cdoesn\u2019t really seem to address the main issue\u201d in the common carrier debate.Requiring pipeline companies to prove their status should not, in theory, create new hurdles for development, he said. \u201cThey should be doing it anyway.\u201d jmalewitz@texastribune.org Advertisement"}

Berkshire Hathaway, the financial and industrial holding company controlled by Warren E. Buffett, helped give the market an early lift on Monday. The company reported late Friday a profit of $6.4 billion last quarter, helped by its insurance division, Geico, which performed well above Wall Street\u2019s expectations. Berkshire\u2019s investment portfolio was also a big driver of profits. The company\u2019s Class B stock rose $3.89, or 3 percent, to $129.72, one of the biggest gains in the S.&P. 500.Michael Kors was the biggest decliner in the S.&P. 500, falling $4.82, or 6 percent, to $77.01. While the handbag and women\u2019s fashion company reported a rise in second quarter earnings, its profit margin shrank for the second consecutive quarter.The news out of Portugal also helped the stock market. Portugal\u2019s central bank said late Sunday that it would shore up Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo, one of the country\u2019s biggest financial institutions. Portugal\u2019s PSI 20 index rose 1 percent on the news.Portugal\u2019s banking problems were one of many catalysts for last week\u2019s market sell-off. While Portugal\u2019s economy is small, strategists say that the eurozone\u2019s economy is fragile enough that Portugal\u2019s woes could spread. Europe just exited its latest recession a year ago, while the United States emerged from its last recession in 2009.The tensions between Europe and Russia, the eurozone\u2019s biggest trading partner, over the continuing conflict in Ukraine only added to the problems facing the Continent.\u201cThese types of things are going to hurt the European economy, and it couldn\u2019t impact the region at a worse time,\u201d Mr. Ablin of BMO said.Last week\u2019s market rout, where the S.&P. 500 fell nearly 3 percent in five days, remained front and center in investors\u2019 minds. It was the worst week for the index since June 2012. With Monday\u2019s gains, it was the Dow\u2019s third positive day in the last 10 sessions.\u201cThere does appear to be a little caution in the markets,\u201d said Craig Erlam, a market analyst at Alpari, an online trading company. \u201cInvestors are a little concerned that the sell-off which started last week is not over and could lead to something much bigger.\u201dUtility stocks were among the biggest decliners. PG&E and Duke Energy fell roughly 1 percent. Among the S.&P. 500 sector indexes, utilities were the only loser, dropping 0.6 percent.In the bond market, interest rates eased slightly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note dipped to 2.48 percent, from 2.49 percent late Friday, while its price increased 3/32, to 100 4/32. Advertisement"}

You see, while Mr. Perry\u2019s hard-line stances and religiosity may be selling points for the Republican Party\u2019s base, his national appeal, if any, will have to rest on claims that he knows how to create prosperity. And it\u2019s true that Texas has had faster job growth than the rest of the country. So have other Sunbelt states with conservative governments. The question, however, is why.To see the problems, let\u2019s tell a tale of three cities. Is it, as people like Mr. Perry assert, because pro-business, pro-wealthy policies like those he favors mean opportunity for everyone? If that were the case, we\u2019d expect all those job opportunities to cause rising wages in the Sunbelt, wages that attract ambitious people away from moribund blue states.In other words, what the facts really suggest is that Americans are being pushed out of the Northeast (and, more recently, California) by high housing costs rather than pulled out by superior economic performance in the Sunbelt. So conservative complaints about excess regulation and intrusive government aren\u2019t entirely wrong, but the secret of Sunbelt growth isn\u2019t being nice to corporations and the 1 percent; it\u2019s not getting in the way of middle- and working-class housing supply.And this, in turn, means that the growth of the Sunbelt isn\u2019t the kind of success story conservatives would have us believe. Yes, Americans are moving to places like Texas, but, in a fundamental sense, they\u2019re moving the wrong way, leaving local economies where their productivity is high for destinations where it\u2019s lower. And the way to make the country richer is to encourage them to move back, by making housing in dense, high-wage metropolitan areas more affordable. So Rick Perry doesn\u2019t know the secrets of job creation, or even of regional growth. It would be great to see the real key \u2014 affordable housing \u2014 become a national issue. But I don\u2019t think Democrats are willing to nominate Mayor Bill de Blasio for president just yet. Advertisement"}

He aims in the wrong direction. In 2005 Israel evacuated 21 settlements in Gaza and withdrew its army. A few months later, Hamas took over control of the government of Gaza with a charter calling for the destruction of the state of Israel and its replacement with a Palestinian Islamic state from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea. Rocket-firing at civilian targets continued and became progressively sophisticated and longer in range. How can any country be expected to negotiate with a group that calls for its destruction?Hamas must cease firing rockets, recognize Israel and remove the language from its charter mandating Israel\u2019s destruction. Then and only then will Israel feel secure enough to begin to lighten the blockade. A real peace can happen with demilitarization of Gaza. Israel has no desire or need to reoccupy a territory that poses no threat to them.\u00a0Mr. Grossman asks the Israeli prime minister and his predecessors: \u201cWhy have you ignored, for 12 years, the Arab League initiative that could have enlisted moderate Arab states with the power to impose, perhaps, a compromise on Hamas?\u201d In answering, we should consider the importance of war to the Israeli economy.

{"Headline": "Imperial Son", "Date": "2014-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cTo paraphrase Winston Churchill,\u201d Ronald Reagan said in his first Inaugural Address, \u201cI did not take the oath I\u2019ve just taken with the intention of presiding over the dissolution of the world\u2019s strongest economy.\u201d If it was curious that an American president should cite an English politician, what made it odder was the line he chose to adapt.In November 1942, Churchill had said that \u201cI have not become the King\u2019s First Minister in order to preside over the liquidation of the British Empire.\u201d Why would the president of a republic born out of rebellion against that empire want to allude to those words, especially since, at the time Churchill spoke them, the American administration and people had been united in their resolve that, whatever else they were fighting for, it was not to preserve the British Empire?Born when imperialism was at its zenith, Churchill lived to see the end of empire, notably his own country\u2019s, and the part he played in this epic story is fascinating. Lawrence James, the author of several books of British history, says that \u201cChurchill and Empire\u201d deals with \u201ca subject that has been overlooked or discreetly sidelined in Churchillian literature,\u201d which is a puzzling claim. Churchill\u2019s imperialism was one of the most salient facts about him, much discussed in his lifetime, and endlessly dissected since by historians, most recently by Richard Toye in his excellent \u201cChurchill\u2019s Empire: The World That Made Him and the World He Made.\u201d Is there something new to say?When our present queen succeeded to the throne in 1952, Churchill recalled that his youth had been passed under another queen, amid \u201cthe tranquil glories of the Victorian era,\u201d but \u201ctranquil\u201d was an unlikely word for his own experience. Before he was elected to Parliament in 1900, aged 25, Churchill had fought in or witnessed no fewer than four savage imperial conflicts. He was a soldier and journalist before he became a politician, and although he maintained that \u201cthe consciousness of dominion over subject races must alone increase the self-respect of every Englishman,\u201d he candidly described the realities of imperial war.In 1898 he took part in one of the last cavalry charges, at Omdurman in Sudan, less battle than massacre. He exultantly killed several men fighting for the jihadist leader called the Mahdi, but he also recorded that \u201call Dervishes who did not immediately surrender were shot or bayoneted.\u201d As a colonial office minister from 1905 to 1908, Churchill visited Kenya and thought that its backward peoples (including the forebears of the present American president) needed to be taught the discipline of hard work. But he was also dismayed by reports in South Africa of the \u201cdisgusting butchery of the natives.\u201d In other words, as we should really have grasped by now, Winston Churchill was all his life a bundle of contradictions, radical or reactionary by turns, brutal and chivalrous.Three years after World War I, in which his career was nearly ended by the Gallipoli debacle, he became colonial secretary, at a critical moment in the story of \u201cwhat is called, somewhat oddly, the Middle East,\u201d as he put it in 1940. In his engaging memoir \u201cMy Early Life,\u201d he said that he had been brought up as a Tory, and thus pro-Turkish, and it had been a cardinal British principle to preserve the Ottoman Empire lest it should collapse and the vacuum be filled by Russia.When it did collapse as a result of the war, the vacuum was filled instead by the British themselves, in a way quite unforeseen and unintended. Churchill cobbled together one completely artificial state called \u201cIraq,\u201d while partitioning the territory to the west into \u201cTrans\u00adjordan\u201d and \u201cPalestine.\u201d Although his own sympathies were with the Zionist settlers, he soon realized what a thankless burden this Palestine was, and toyed with the idea of handing it over to the United States, a teasing \u201cwhat if\u201d of history, supposing improbably that the Americans had wanted to accept any such responsibility.In 1929 Churchill insisted that the British had rescued India \u201cfrom ages of barbarism, tyranny and internecine war,\u201d and he spent the next several years in futile opposition to the India Bill, which granted modest self-government. James is surely wrong to say that Churchill accepted final defeat over the bill \u201cwith good grace\u201d: That was not how most people saw it at the time.And it was India that would be the greatest stain on Churchill\u2019s record at its otherwise splendid climax. As prime minister from 1940 to 1945 he obstinately thwarted any attempt to move toward a settlement with Gandhi and the Congress nationalists. Worse still was the awful Bengal famine of 1943. Like the Irish famine 100 years before, it was not caused by the London government, but in both cases official indifference and inaction gravely aggravated the horror, and destroyed any moral authority the British claimed to rule those suffering peoples.Underlying Churchill\u2019s refusal to alleviate the famine was sheer racial contempt. \u201cStarvation of anyhow underfed Bengalis is less serious than that of sturdy Greeks,\u201d he said, and those who worked with him knew well his tirades about the \u201cfoul race\u201d of Hindus. In the postwar years he railed against the Labour government for granting India its independence, although he then sullenly recognized that the game was up for imperialism. He thought that the French should get out of Indochina and, impulsive as ever, was dismayed by the shameful methods the British authorities were using to suppress the Mau Mau uprising in Kenya.If James\u2019s book reveals not much that is unfamiliar to those seriously interested in Churchill, it is readable and generally reliable, despite a few slips. Churchill\u2019s friend and colleague Lord Moyne, who was assassinated by Zionist extremists in 1944, was not a viscount; and the dinner in London for Chaim Weizmann, the Zionist leader, in June 1937 was at the house of Sir Archibald Sinclair, the Liberal leader, not that of the Labour leader Clement Attlee, as James says.That evening was memorably reported by Blanche (Baffy) Dugdale, niece of A. J. Balfour, a former prime minister and the signer of the declaration, who was herself an active gentile Zionist: \u201cWinston in his most brilliant style, but very drunk.\u201d And here\u2019s something James might have made more of. Benjamin Netanyahu keeps a portrait in his office of his hero Churchill, who was certainly a Zionist and supporter of Israel, but Netanyahu should be careful. He is perhaps unaware that Churchill\u2019s commitment to Zionism was based on his belief that the Jews were a \u201chigher grade race\u201d than the Arabs they were supplanting.We are left with two great para\u00addoxes. The man who, at one extraordinary moment, heroically defied the vilest racial tyranny in history was himself not only an intransigent imperialist but a racist, by the standards of his own age as well as ours. And although Churchill said he would not preside over the liquidation of the British Empire, he did just that, or at least hastened its demise. At the end of a war in which he had nobly led it, his country was exhausted and penniless; in no condition, or mood, to play the part of great power or imperial ruler any more; a financial client of the United States, whose new imperium now took over where the British left off.Others saw this. \u201cAlthough he didn\u2019t like to do so, Mr. Churchill ended the stage of the British Empire,\u201d Zhou Enlai perceptively observed to Henry Kissinger in 1969. He may not have intended to, \u201cbut objectively he ended the British Empire.\u201d Did Churchill in his heart know that?CHURCHILL AND EMPIREA Portrait of an ImperialistBy Lawrence JamesIllustrated. 452 pp. Pegasus Books. $28.95.A review on Aug. 17 about \u201cChurchill and Empire: A Portrait of an Imperialist,\u201d by Lawrence James, referred imprecisely to A.

{"Headline": "ArcelorMittal Returns to Profit as Steel Demand Rises", "Date": "2014-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhile the company\u2019s net income was modest, its crucial businesses showed signs of returning to growth and profitability after years of taking write-offs for closing plants.It was the first profitable quarter for the company, which is based in Luxembourg, since 2012.Still, ArcelorMittal lowered its forecast for 2014 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a closely watched metric in the industry, to about $7 billion from $8 billion. And the company\u2019s stock fell more than 5 percent in morning trading in Amsterdam.The company now forecasts prices for the iron ore it mines to be 13 percent lower, on average, than the $120 per metric ton it estimated at the beginning of the year.While the softening of iron ore prices may hurt the relatively small mining segment at ArcelorMittal, that could be countered by stronger demand for the steel that makes up most of the company\u2019s business.\u201cWe are seeing real progress in a turnaround on the steelmaking side of the business,\u201d Jeff Largey, a steel analyst at Macquarie Securities in London, said in a telephone interview.ArcelorMittal has cut the size of its operations to adapt to changing demand and could be poised for higher profitability if growth in crucial markets like Europe and the United States continues. But profitability remains modest. \u201cIt is being done in baby steps rather than leaps,\u201d Mr. Largey said.Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization grew 4 percent to about $1.8 billion, in line with analysts\u2019 expectations.Lakshmi Mittal, the company\u2019s chief executive, said in a conference call with reporters on Friday that the company had benefited from higher demand in Europe and North America, where it ships two-thirds of its steel. \u201cWe are seeing an improvement in developed markets but a slowdown in developing markets,\u201d he said.Despite slowing growth in some emerging economies, Mr. Mittal said, demand for steel is strong enough in the Middle East and Africa to absorb a surplus in output from its steel plant in Ukraine, where domestic consumption has fallen because of the recent turmoil.ArcelorMittal increased shipments from its Ukrainian operations by about 2 percent in the second quarter compared with the first quarter. It does not make steel in Russia.In recent years, ArcelorMittal has put most of its investment money into mining operations, betting that they would generate more profit than steel. But low iron ore prices have taken a toll, and operating income in mining fell about 19 percent in the quarter, to $233 million.The company\u2019s European operations, its largest unit, reported operating profit of $334 million compared with a $188 million loss in the same period a year earlier. The company closed plants in the region after a substantially reduced market for steel since the beginning of the financial crisis.ArcelorMittal now expects steel demand in Europe to recover, as manufacturing sectors like autos and appliances gain strength. The company said on Friday that it expected demand for steel in Europe to grow 3 to 4 percent this year, after years of declines. It also predicted 5 to 6 percent growth in the United States, where the automobile and energy industries are big customers.The company said that the finishing plant in Calvert, Ala., that it bought from ThyssenKrupp of Germany at the end of last year to serve customers in the southern part of the United States was running at 83 percent of capacity. It has also reopened a blast furnace in Brazil to supply raw steel for the Alabama plant.North American results were hurt by the $90 million payout the company made to settle a price-fixing case in the United States.Demand and economic growth seem to be shifting away from emerging markets to the industrialized regions of Europe and North America. Demand in China is expected to increase 3 to 3.5 percent, the company said, a big drop from the sizzling pace of recent years.ArcelorMittal\u2019s steel shipments worldwide increased by about 3 percent to 21.5 million metric tons, while sales increased by 2.5 percent to $20.7 billion.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Abduction Case Tests Limits of Amish Ties to Modern World", "Date": "2014-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOSWEGATCHIE, N.Y. \u2014 The two sisters were missing, apparently abducted from the roadside vegetable stand in front of their house in this rural town near the Canadian border. The police needed photos of the girls to issue an alert, but the family had none: They were Amish, a community that generally prohibits photographs partly based on the biblical injunction against likenesses. After initially resisting, and with critical time elapsing, the girls\u2019 father, Mose Miller, finally agreed to a compromise: He allowed a sketch artist to make an illustration of the older sister, who is 12, but not the younger one, who is 7. \u201cThey were so uncomfortable,\u201d Sheriff Kevin M. Wells of St. Lawrence County said, recalling the fraught negotiations last week. \u201cWe asked them to make a lot of difficult decisions.\u201d The episode was a turning point in a case that has drawn the insular and ultraconservative Amish population in this region into the glare of international attention. The girls resurfaced a day after their disappearance and two suspects were arrested and charged with kidnapping. The county district attorney said the girls had been sexually abused.But the father\u2019s quandary about the sketch also highlighted the constant challenges the Amish face by adhering to a 19th-century agrarian lifestyle in a 21st-century world.Though they live separately from the non-Amish, the Amish are not independent. In interviews this week throughout northwestern St. Lawrence County, home to hundreds, if not thousands, of Amish, a picture emerges of two communities living side by side and often intersecting \u2014 for the most part comfortably, though sometimes, as in the case of the police investigation, extremely uncomfortably. The Amish have negotiated ways of interacting with the modern world without compromising their religious beliefs; the non-Amish, in turn, have benefited in numerous ways from the presence of their traditionalist neighbors.\u201cWe work together real good, you know,\u201d said John Miller, 42, an uncle of the abducted girls, who has lived in the region nearly all his life.Since the Amish in this region neither drive nor use telephones or electricity, each family has a relationship with non-Amish families who can make telephone calls on their behalf or drive them on urgent errands. Their economies are intertwined, with the Amish selling goods like vegetables, lumber and crafts to non-Amish customers and buying from the non-Amish items such as hardware supplies, groceries and pharmaceuticals.Walmart and other stores have installed hitching posts for horse-drawn buggies.\u201cThey are in the world but not of the world,\u201d said Karen M. Johnson-Weiner, a professor of anthropology at nearby State University of New York at Potsdam, who has studied the Amish for years. \u201cThey rely on the world. They couldn\u2019t make a living without the world.\u201dYet, she added, the Amish regard their life on Earth as essentially a passage to eternal life. \u201cThey are passing through this world without becoming part of it,\u201d she said.Though not as widely known as the more established Amish settlements in Ohio and Pennsylvania, New York State\u2019s Amish communities began taking root in the 1830s. There are now about 16,500 Amish in the state, up from about 10,100 in 2008, making it by far the fastest-growing Amish population among the 10 states with the most Amish, according to the Young Center for Anabaptist and Pietist Studies at Elizabethtown College in Pennsylvania. Settlements now speckle the state, from far western New York near Lake Erie to the northernmost reaches. In 1974, a highly conservative group known as the Swartzentruber Amish migrated from Ohio and began settling in this region, attracted both by the relatively inexpensive farmland and by a desire for separation from more progressive Amish. Preferring large families \u2014 many have more than 10 children \u2014 the Swartzentruber Amish are helping drive the state\u2019s Amish population growth. In the last year alone, Ms. Johnson-Weiner said, 50 new families have joined the settlement centered on this town. Their farms are interspersed among the non-Amish farms. The Amish dwellings are immediately recognizable for the absence of electric lines and satellite dishes and for the presence of dark-colored clothes of simple, uniform design drying on lines and \u2014 an automatic giveaway \u2014 a buggy parked outside. Like other Amish, the Swartzentruber Amish, whose principal language is Pennsylvania German, live by Ordnungs, or codes of conduct. Varying from group to group and church district to church district, Ordnungs prescribe how to live, including rules about the design of homes, clothing and buggies, and protocols for cooking, worship, schooling, dating and interactions with non-Amish, whom the Amish refer to as \u201cthe English.\u201d While some of the more progressive Amish groups may be more accommodating of technological innovations, the Swartzentruber Amish have been far more resistant to change. But they have devised ways of maintaining their strict cultural practices while still being able to prosper in modern society, with many of these solutions reliant on cooperation with non-Amish neighbors. \u201cI like to help them out because you never know when you\u2019re going to need help,\u201d said Harvey Swartzentruber, 35, an Amish farmer and diesel motor mechanic who has lived most of his life in the region. Among the exchanges of favors that help sustain his lifestyle, Mr. Swartzentruber trims the hooves of his non-Amish neighbor\u2019s horses; in return, his neighbor welds for him. When the two Miller girls disappeared last week, their father ran down the road to seek help at the home of Robert and Susan O\u2019Marah, a non-Amish couple. The O\u2019Marahs dialed 911 for him. The two households have developed a close, neighborly relationship over the past two decades; the families moved into their current homes at about the same time. The relationship began years ago when Mr. Miller went to the O\u2019Marahs\u2019 door to report that his wife, Barbara, was in labor with their first child and he asked if they could drive to the Amish midwife\u2019s house and retrieve her. (The Swartzentruber, like most other Amish, eschew insurance and try to avoid hospitals.) The O\u2019Marahs have provided shuttle service for the midwives in the births of more than 20 babies in the Miller family, including 12 of Mose and Barbara Miller\u2019s 13, they said. The Amish \u201care always smiling and waving,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Marah said, adding, \u201cYou couldn\u2019t ask for better neighbors.\u201d In recounting the good deeds that the Amish have bestowed on non-Amish neighbors, residents often recall how the Amish rushed to help other dairy farmers after an ice storm in 1998 knocked out power. Electronic milking systems were down and the Amish, unruffled, jumped in using their hands \u2014 the only way they knew how. Throughout the Miller girls\u2019 disappearance, the Amish here kept abreast of developments through buggy-to-buggy word-of-mouth. But the freshest news often originated with their non-Amish friends. A 53-year-old Amish farmer in the nearby town of DeKalb, the father of 16 children, said he found out about the Miller girls\u2019 disappearance while visiting a non-Amish neighbor, a widower whose family had asked the farmer to keep an eye on him. The news crackled over the neighbor\u2019s scanner. \u201cI try not to listen to radios but sometimes you can\u2019t help it,\u201d the farmer said. \u201cI heard something about the Miller girls. I was hoping I didn\u2019t hear right.\u201d (Like several Amish interviewed for this article, he requested anonymity, saying that speaking out could be viewed as immodest.) While the Amish strive for self-reliance, they will visit non-Amish doctors, buy their drugs at pharmacies and, in emergencies, seek treatment in hospitals, even if it means being hooked up to electric machines. \u201cWe can go to a certain distance to allow us to get what needs to be done,\u201d explained one Amish man, whose young son spent a month in a Syracuse hospital being treated for tetanus.One of Mr. Miller\u2019s daughters was hospitalized in Syracuse for a compound fracture after she was trampled by a horse. Ms. Miller paid the sizable ambulance fee by making the company a quilt, the O\u2019Marahs recalled.\u201cThey aren\u2019t subject to the same restrictions in society,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Marah said. \u201cWe have credit scores to keep up. They could care less about credit. But they care about respectability.\u201d (Mr. Miller politely declined to be interviewed on the record.)The Amish try to work out internal disputes among themselves and seek to avoid the mainstream judicial system. Cars frequently collide with ill-lighted buggies, usually resulting in damage to the buggies and sometimes the horses. But unless the cars are damaged, the episodes are rarely reported.While the apparent abduction deeply rattled the broader population in this region, several Amish said they also felt a deep sense of gratitude for the overwhelming response by the non-Amish population, including neighbors and public officials. But the gratitude, several said, was accompanied by a certain remorse, mainly for having inconvenienced so many people.\u201cI actually feel guilty \u2014 I told my wife \u2014 about the way the police force kicked in,\u201d the Amish farmer in DeKalb said. \u201cIt brought a lot of tears.\u201d As the normal rhythms of life have returned to the region, residents said they had also been left with a deeper feeling of community, an affirmed sense of the interconnectedness that transcends demarcations of religion and custom.\u201cEverybody wants to help, even the English,\u201d said John Miller, the abducted girls\u2019 uncle. \u201cI think that this is going to draw everything together.\u201dAn article on Friday about Amish and non-Amish residents who coexist in the area of upstate New York where two Amish girls were kidnapped last week omitted, in some editions, passages at the beginning of the continuation of the article.

{"Headline": "Imagining Successful Schools", "Date": "2014-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat should teacher accountability look like? All of which might be worth it if this form of accountability truly meant that public school students were getting a better education. But, writes Tucker, \u201cThere is no evidence that it is contributing anything to improved student performance.\u201d Meanwhile, he adds, test-based accountability is \u201cdoing untold damage to the profession of teaching.\u201dNot long after founding the N.C.E.E., Tucker began taking a close look at countries and cities that were re-engineering successfully. What he came away with were two insights. First was a profound appreciation for the fact that most of the countries with the best educational results used the same set of techniques to get there. And, second, that the American reform methods were used nowhere else in the world. \u201cNo other country believes that you can get to a high quality educational system simply by instituting an accountability system,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are entirely on the wrong track.\u201d His cri de coeur has been that Americans should look to what works, instead of clinging to what doesn\u2019t.The main thing that works is treating teaching as a profession, and teachers as professionals. That means that teachers are as well paid as other professionals, that they have a career ladder, that they go to elite schools where they learn their craft, and that they are among the top quartile of college graduates instead of the bottom quartile. When I suggested that American cities couldn\u2019t afford to pay teachers the way we pay engineers or lawyers, Tucker scoffed. With rare exception, he said, the cost per pupil in the places with the best educational systems is less than the American system, even though their teachers are far better paid. \u201cThey are not spending more money; they are spending money differently,\u201d he said.Tucker would not abolish tests, but he would have fewer of them. And they would have a different purpose: In the high-performing countries, the tests exist to hold the students accountable, rather than the teachers. Meanwhile, he writes, \u201cin most of these countries, the primary form of accountability for the school and its staff is high-profile publication of the average scores for the exams for each school, often front-page news.\u201dWhen a school falls short, instead of looking to fire teachers, the high-performing countries \u201cuse the data to decide which schools will receive visits from teams of expert school inspectors. These inspectors are highly regarded educators.\u201d Tucker envisions the same kind of accountability for teachers as exists for, say, lawyers in a firm \u2014 where it is peers holding each other accountable rather than some outside force. People who don\u2019t pull their own weight are asked to leave. The ethos is that people help each other to become better for the good of the firm. Those who successfully rise through the ranks are rewarded with higher pay and status. Would the teachers\u2019 unions go along with such a scheme? The unions would certainly have to shed some of the things they now have, such as control of work rules. But they would gain so much else: \u201cManagement would get their prerogatives back and would be held accountable for results, but the professionals, granted far more autonomy, would be also holding each other accountable for the quality of their work, as professionals everywhere do.\u201dAs our conversation was coming to an end, Tucker told me that he was working with the State of Kentucky to implement some of the reforms he had outlined in his report. If it works there \u2014 and there is no reason it shouldn\u2019t \u2014 perhaps we\u2019ll finally get over our fixation with test-based accountability, and finally re-engineer our educational system the way every other successful country has.

One reason may be the frequent incantation of a motley collection of myths, each one rooted in bad economics:Myth 1: The enormous uncertainty of climate science argues for a wait-and-see strategy.The claim here is that reducing greenhouse gases would be a wasted expense if climate change ends up causing only minor problems. But uncertainty cuts two ways. Things might not be as bad as expected, but they could also be much worse.Myth 2: Slowing the pace of climate change would be prohibitively difficult.Myth 3: A carbon tax would destroy jobs.If a carbon tax were scheduled to be gradually phased in once the economy recovered, its mere announcement would create jobs right away. As with any policy change, there would be winners and losers. But because an impending carbon tax would render many existing energy-using processes obsolete, it would create strong incentives for corporations to put their mountains of idle cash to work. Spending on development of more efficient processes, with attendant hiring, would be expected to begin immediately.Although an effective solution will take global coordination, America\u2019s inaction has been a major barrier to progress.

{"Headline": "Delivery Start-Ups Are Back Like It\u2019s 1999", "Date": "2014-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s the EconomyLast year, I was excited to hear about a new start-up in San Francisco that delivered cheap bottles of wine within an hour. It was called Rewinery, and it was fantastic. I ordered a $5 malbec one day and a $10 chardonnay the next, delivered by bike courier for a modest fee. Already, San Francisco was crawling with bikes, inching up the hills, shuttling sushi and groceries and new clothes, all summoned with the tap of a finger. But Rewinery was the first of the delivery start-ups that made me feel the way I felt back in 2000, when I could order a video and a pint of ice cream to my doorstep from Kozmo.com. Rewinery felt too good to be true.It was. One day, seeking refreshment, I opened the app to find that Rewinery had gone out of business.In the tech crash of the early 2000s, on-demand delivery services like Kozmo and Webvan weren\u2019t just among the most colossal failures. They also became a sort of grim joke, symbolizing the excess that portended the bust. Afterward, conventional wisdom hardened: Web-enabled delivery was not a good business because it simply cost too much to build warehouses, manage an inventory and pay drivers. There was too little opportunity to recoup expenditures in delivery fees; people will pay only so much for toilet paper to be delivered before they decide to fetch it themselves.But something is in the air of late, making hindsight blurry. Despite the early demise of Rewinery and the shrunken ambitions of others, such as eBay Now, similar start-ups with names like Caviar, SpoonRocket and DoorDash have raised half a billion dollars in investment in the last year, according to CB Insights, which tracks venture capital. Even Louis Borders, the founder of Webvan (as well as the Borders bookstore chain, another Internet casualty), is at work on a grocery delivery start-up. Uber is using the $1.4 billion it just raised to expand beyond delivering people to delivering things. Meanwhile, venture capitalists joke that every other entrepreneur they meet pitches an \u201cUber for X,\u201d bringing goods and services on demand: laundry (Washio), ice cream (Ice Cream Life), marijuana (Eaze) and so on. Investors are stuck wondering whether this is 2000 all over again, or whether this new breed of delivery start-ups can succeed where the last crop so famously failed.John A. Deighton, a Harvard Business School professor who wrote a case study on Webvan, likes to compare the delivery business to shining shoes. \u201cYou make as much profit on one shoe as you do on a thousand shoes,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s just no scale.\u201d In years past, it was difficult for Deighton to even teach his students about Webvan, because its fatal flaws were so obvious. They didn\u2019t understand how the euphoria of the dot-com boom could have obscured its shortcomings. But in the last year, he has been asked to teach it three times. \u201cSomething has changed,\u201d he said.The biggest change is that the companies are trying to improve same-day delivery with software \u2014 and, at the same time, are distancing themselves as far as possible from the physical supply chain that killed their ancestors. They have dispensed with warehouses, trucks and full-time drivers and instead have become middlemen, whose sole role is to connect customers with couriers. But the one piece of the puzzle they have failed to eliminate is the hardest part of logistics, and the one Deighton says makes the entire business model unravel: the last few miles of the journey, getting small-ticket orders to far-flung houses.The entrepreneurs and investors behind these companies say software can solve that, too, with algorithms that minimize the amount of time it takes couriers to pick up orders and maximize the number of deliveries they can make.\u201cThe reason it is such a good idea now is the exact same reason it was so horrible before: the network effect,\u201d said Nabeel Hyatt, a venture partner at Spark Capital, which has invested in Postmates, a courier service that delivers from any store or restaurant. Not even half of American households had an Internet connection in 1999; today 98 percent have access to a connection. And it certainly helps that customers and couriers all have smartphones. This means a higher density of users and potential users, who can instantly reach couriers whenever they are in need, eventually leading to scale.In the \u201990s, Webvan built several $35 million, 350,000-square-foot distribution centers. By contrast, Instacart, which offers one-hour grocery delivery in 12 cities, has just 70 employees in a small office in San Francisco, all of them engineers and administrators. They never touch the food \u2014 instead they contract with \u201cpersonal shoppers.\u201d \u201cWe literally don\u2019t have any warehouses, we don\u2019t have any trucks,\u201d said Aditya Shah, Instacart\u2019s general manager.Of course, the couriers still need to be paid. \u201cThe complicated part is not getting customers, it\u2019s getting the product to the customers,\u201d said Paulo Lerner, Rewinery\u2019s founder, who fled San Francisco for Brazil. \u201cIf they charge a lot, it loses the appeal. If they charge less, it has a lot of appeal, but at the same time, they are running on losses.\u201dInstacart charges as little as $3.99 for grocery shopping and delivery. Yet Shah said its shoppers make about $20 an hour, plus tips, which makes profitability seem unlikely, even with the smartest algorithms routing shoppers through grocery stores and city streets. When I told him that, he sounded a lot like Borders back in Webvan\u2019s heyday: \u201cWe\u2019re really well funded, so that is not something we\u2019re as worried about,\u201d Shah said. \u201cGrowth is the most important factor.\u201dThat growth-first philosophy is hardly unpopular in Silicon Valley, where a focus on expansion at the expense of profit has worked well for web businesses. Delivery start-ups are trying to bridge the digital and physical worlds \u2014 and that\u2019s when things get expensive. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard category \u2014 outside the Internet, where everything magically happens,\u201d said Lerner, the Rewinery founder. \u201cThis is real work, hard work. \u201dJosh Lerner (no relation to Paulo), who runs the entrepreneurial management unit at Harvard Business School, is similarly dubious. \u201cSomeone is paying for it, but it\u2019s definitely something that seems to defy the laws of introductory economics,\u201d he said.The question comes down to how much people are willing to pay to be lazy. To economists, laziness isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. To the sympathetic onlooker, these companies could be a step on the path to the world prophesied by John Maynard Keynes (and even \u201cThe Jetsons\u201d), in which technology advances to the point that chores are replaced by leisure time. But even this suggests a gloomy outcome: On-demand delivery could create a two-tier economy \u2014 the people who can afford to hire others to do their errands and the people who do them. That is, unless Amazon succeeds in automating grunt work out of existence. (It already has robots that pick items off shelves and pack them in boxes; it wants to have a fleet of delivery drones.)Or it might be useful to listen to Fred Wilson, the co-founder of Union Square Ventures, who lost a lot of money on Kozmo. \u201cI wish we knew the answers to these questions, but we don\u2019t,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s kept us out of this market.\u201d He still signs up for new delivery start-ups as a customer, though. After all, the worst case is that we\u2019ll go back to doing the same thing I did when Rewinery went under \u2014 running out to the store.Claire Cain Miller is a reporter for The Upshot, The Times\u2019s new website about politics and policy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Missouri Weighs Unusual Addition to Its Constitution: Right to Farm", "Date": "2014-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKINGDOM CITY, Mo. \u2014 Missourians already have the constitutional right to religion, speech and guns. On Tuesday, they could make a novel addition to the State Constitution: the right to farm.The right to farm hardly seems threatened in Missouri, one of the leading agricultural states, with nearly 100,000 farms producing crops including soybeans, corn and wheat.But a coalition of state farming groups and major agriculture corporations have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to take aim at the Humane Society, which led a successful fight in 2010 to regulate inhumane dog-breeding practices in Missouri. Backers of the amendment are wary of laws that have passed in other states, like California, where voters in 2008 approved roomier living conditions for hens, and Oregon, where a rural county\u2019s ban on genetically modified crops was overwhelmingly passed in May.While the amendment would not affect federal laws governing agriculture, its possible effect on local and state laws is unclear.\u201cThere is a lot of uncertainty with respect to how the amendment would actually work in practice,\u201d said Erin Morrow Hawley, an associate law professor at the University of Missouri who specializes in agricultural issues. \u201cYou could see a state law challenged based on this constitutional amendment. But the biggest aim is to prevent new state laws coming in from outside the state. The idea is to create another legal tool to stop that.\u201dThe debate over the proposed amendment has roiled Missouri for more than a year, with supporters saying it would end what they see as meddling by outsiders in its business practices.Opponents have protested that the amendment would be a boon for large industrial farms that would like to avoid potential laws controlling their treatment of animals or the environment, allowing them to pollute the land, extend the use of genetically modified crops and freely experiment with the use of antibiotics in livestock, a trend that has concerned scientists.\u201cIt\u2019s put family against family and neighbor against neighbor,\u201d Jeff Jones, a cattle farmer from Callaway County, in central Missouri, said of the amendment at an emotional public forum on Thursday evening that attracted close to 200 people.The Missouri amendment was sponsored by a Republican legislator and has wide support in the Republican-controlled legislature. The referendum is part of the primary on Tuesday in Missouri, where voters will also decide on a measure that would declare the right to keep and bear arms \u201cunalienable.\u201dSince the beginning of July, advocacy groups have spent more than $1 million on the fight over Amendment 1: Missouri Farmers Care, an umbrella group of supporters, has spent more than $650,000, while Missouri\u2019s Food for America, a group formed last year, has poured more than $400,000 into efforts for the opposition. Much of that money has come from the Humane Society of the United States.Several days before the vote, an aggressive campaign to woo the undecided was well underway. Television commercials seemed to be running nonstop, imploring voters to help family farmers by opposing the amendment. Cherry-red yard signs proclaiming, \u201cKeep Missouri Farming! Yes on 1,\u201d dotted the landscape of rural southwest Missouri, a place where residents like to say there are more cows than people.The Missouri Cattlemen\u2019s Association sent an email to members on Thursday urging them to call friends, post on Facebook and Twitter in support of the amendment, and get to the polls on Tuesday.Many farmers said they were fed up with scrutiny over farming practices from groups like the Humane Society, a widely loathed organization among farmers here, which supported the 2010 measure approving strict regulations on \u201cpuppy mills.\u201d \u201cI personally don\u2019t know anybody that\u2019s against this,\u201d said Richard Le Jeune, who raises 200 cattle on his 573-acre property in the tiny hamlet of Halfway, Mo., 30 miles north of Springfield. \u201cSome of these city people don\u2019t have a clue what goes on in the country and how food is produced. We need this to keep the outsiders from trying to run things.\u201dWhile watching Fox News from his living room on Wednesday, Mr. Le Jeune interrupted himself to nod at the television when a commercial advising viewers to vote against the amendment came on. \u201cThis is the second time in two days I\u2019ve seen this one,\u201d he said.Other farmers said the amendment, which is brief and vaguely worded, would permanently enshrine a special status for ranchers and farmers in the Constitution. Darvin Bentlage, who raises cattle and grows soybeans, corn and wheat in Golden City, Mo., said the people who were pushing the amendment \u201cdon\u2019t know what kind of can of worms is going to open up.\u201d\u201cOne thing\u2019s for sure \u2014 it\u2019s going to put ag culture above everybody else,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be a different class of people. You won\u2019t be able to complain about anything that we do. That should never be the case.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the agricultural establishment trying to build a firewall against growing consumer concerns,\u201d said John E. Ikerd, professor emeritus of agricultural economics at the University of Missouri in Columbia, likening it to early regulation of tobacco. \u201cIf we\u2019d had a \u2018right to smoke\u2019 amendment at that time, we\u2019d still have smoke-filled offices and airplanes.\u201dWhile the Republican-controlled legislature introduced the ballot measure, support for it has not fallen along strict partisan lines. The state attorney general, Chris Koster, a Democrat, supports Amendment 1; the governor, Jay Nixon, also a Democrat, said in an email last week that he did not.Channing Ansley, a spokeswoman for Mr. Nixon, said that while the governor had championed Missouri farmers, \u201che also believes that changing the Constitution of our state should be done sparingly, thoughtfully and only when there is a demonstrated need to do so.\u201dShe continued: \u201cIn the governor\u2019s view, that need has not been demonstrated in this case.\u201dJoe Maxwell, a farmer and former lieutenant governor who works for the Humane Society, said the amendment could set off lawsuits arguing that local laws regulating agriculture were unconstitutional.\u201cThere are now two kinds of agriculture in America \u2014 we have seen over the last 30 years the advancement of the industrialized ag model,\u201d Mr. Maxwell said. \u201cThe group of farmers who are aligned with industrialized ag believe big is better and they should be able to do whatever they want to the land and to the animals. Then there are a group of farmers who believe we are the caretakers of the land. I stand with many family farmers who are in opposition to this.\u201dBut Blake Hurst, the president of the Missouri Farm Bureau, which represents 117,000 farmers, said many laws regulating farming had overstepped, leaving farmers with no choice but to amend the Constitution to protect their industry.\u201cWhen you look across the country, you see a lot of ballot initiatives that are making decisions about how farmers can farm,\u201d Mr. Hurst said. The proposed amendment \u201cdoesn\u2019t change regulations we have now, and it can\u2019t possibly change federal law. We\u2019re trying to stop ballot initiatives that limit farmers\u2019 ability to use technology.\u201dThe effects of the similar amendment in North Dakota, where it passed in 2012 with 67 percent of the vote, have so far been indiscernible, said Rusty Rumley, a senior staff attorney for the National Agricultural Law Center at the University of Arkansas. He added, however, that it was still too soon to expect major repercussions.Should the Missouri amendment pass, the possible ramifications are difficult to predict, he said.\u201cReally and truly, I don\u2019t think anybody knows,\u201d Mr. Rumley said. \u201cThe thing with constitutional amendments is, they\u2019re written to be broad. It could take quite a while to know what it\u2019s all going to mean.\u201dAt the forum in Callaway County on Thursday, Debbie Brunette, 58, of Fulton, Mo., said she supported the farmers\u2019 efforts but feared the measure was too permanent. \u201cWe don\u2019t know the future of agriculture,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy do we have to change the Constitution?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Latvia\u2019s Tensions With Russians at Home Persist in Shadow of Ukraine Conflict ", "Date": "2014-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIGA, Latvia \u2014 History has bequeathed this Baltic port capital much beauty, captured in elegant Art Nouveau buildings or the Gothic church steeples that stud the windswept skyline. But it has also left a nasty ethnic rift that has persisted despite Latvia\u2019s absorption into NATO, the European Union and the euro currency, and which has now deepened with the crisis in Ukraine.In this nation of two million, about one-third of the residents speak only or primarily Russian. Many \u2014 but not all \u2014 are people whose families arrived during the decades of Soviet rule here. Ever since Latvia declared independence in 1991, many of these Russian speakers have been in limbo, as noncitizens squeezed out of political life, largely unable to vote, hold office or even serve in the fire brigade.Those who refuse to acquire proficient skill speaking Latvian do not get citizenship. In the coming October elections, unless the government decides to issue special voting cards, about 283,000 will, once again, not cast ballots.This weekend the Baltic nations marked 25 years since the Baltic Way, a seminal event in the dissolution of the Soviet Union, when two million of their citizens linked hands across nearly 400 miles to declare their goal of independence. Latvians, Lithuanians and Estonians \u201ctook each other by the hand back then to show the world that they wanted to be free, independent states,\u201d noted Laimdota Straujuma, the prime minister of Latvia, at a ceremony here on Saturday. It was \u201ca shout of three abandoned nations for freedom,\u201d said her Estonian counterpart, Taavi Roivas. But while the Baltic majorities remember with relish their successful bid for freedom, others who live in the three lands recall the end of the Soviet Union as a misfortune, or worse.As an ethnic Russian member of Latvia\u2019s Parliament, Boriss Cilevics feels the daily crosscurrents created by the rift which, he stressed, is \u201cnot a problem of blood.\u201d About 25 percent of marriages are mixed Latvian-Russian, he noted. \u201cWe work together, and spend time together.\u201d Russian is widely heard, and Russian citizens make up about a third of the tourists who visit the country. But the dominant political consensus, Mr. Cilevics said, holds that \u201can absolute majority of ethnic Latvians must be ruled by ethnic Latvians only.\u201dMr. Cilevics is a member of Harmony Centre, a political party often supported by Russians that has regularly cleared the 5 percent hurdle needed to get into the 100-seat Parliament but has never been included in Latvia\u2019s coalition governments. The government has one ethnically Russian minister \u2014 Vjaceslavs Dombrovskis, in charge of the economy.Riga\u2019s telegenic blond mayor, Nils Ushakovs, is the Russian leader of Harmony Centre and has won election twice in the city of 700,000, by far Latvia\u2019s largest. In October, he is making a bid for prime minister, though he is considered unlikely to succeed.Latvian politicians who defend the status quo portray it as the natural outcome of the Soviet period, when the ethnic Latvian population here dwindled dangerously close to 50 percent after deportations of Latvians to Siberia before and after Nazi occupation, and an influx arrived from other parts of the Soviet Union.In 1991, citizenship was automatically granted to those who had held citizenship before 1940 \u2014 the start of Soviet occupation \u2014 and their descendants, including many who fled abroad in the chaos during and after World War II. Those non-Latvians who had arrived in Soviet times, and their descendants, had to prove they knew the language and history.\u201cIf the major goal is for everybody to become a citizen, you have to have some kind of attachment to the values,\u201d said Artis Pabriks, a former foreign and defense minister here who now sits in the European Parliament. Today, Mr. Pabriks asked, noting President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s annexation of Crimea and interference in eastern Ukraine, if Russian speakers \u201care sharing values with Putin, how can they be citizens of Latvia?\u201dMr. Pabriks, who wrote his doctorate on minorities in Europe, noted that the number of Latvian residents without citizenship had dropped dramatically, to 12 percent from 36 percent in the early 1990s. By comparison, he said, 9 percent of German residents are not citizens.That is beside the point for ethnic Russians living in Latvia like Lyudmila, 56, a flower seller and mother of six who declined to give her last name. \u201cI was born here, but I\u2019m not a citizen. I studied Russian, and you have to go and get that naturalization. I am not going to beg,\u201d she said. \u201cI do feel at home here, but there is some kind of process of differentiation, and it is offensive.\u201dThe Ukraine crisis has made matters worse, Mr. Cilevics of the Latvian Parliament argued, because most Latvians rely on media in their own language, which give very different views of the conflict. Broadly speaking, the Latvian media is more supportive of Ukraine\u2019s tug away from Russia while Russian-language media echoes, though more mildly, the Kremlin line.Exceptionally, Mr. Cilevics said, \u201cI am one of those people who have two ears,\u201d absorbing Russian media, but also subscribing to reports from European monitors in Ukraine, and finding \u201cthe truth is somewhere in between.\u201d It reminds him of Soviet times, he said, reading the Communist daily Pravda, then listening to Radio Liberty, which is financed by the United States. But most people, he noted, \u201conly have one ear.\u201dThe divide, Mr. Pabriks stressed, \u201cis not an ethnic issue. It is political.\u201d Seeing Ukraine pulling out of Russia\u2019s orbit reminds Russian speakers of how Latvia did the same as the Soviet Union collapsed. They have \u201ca feeling of humiliation that the Soviet Union was dissolved. This is about perception of the world. They think, \u2018Who are you, you small countries? You have no greatness.\u2019 This is how they feel and this is why they don\u2019t want to integrate.\u201dOn the other hand, as Mr. Ushakovs put it, summing up the sentiments of more than a dozen conversations, \u201cno one wants Ukraine here.\u201d That nightmare, he argued, could not repeat in Latvia or the other small Baltic States, which are suddenly feeling vulnerable to Russian aggression, agricultural sanctions on produce from the European Union and Mr. Putin\u2019s threats to protect Russian minorities outside Russia. Latvia and its neighbors, Lithuania and Estonia, which have smaller Russian minorities, have always been stable, with per capita gross domestic product in Latvia four times higher than Ukraine, the mayor said.Mr. Pabriks, the former minister, estimated that approximately 60 percent of Russians in Latvia are sympathetic to Mr. Putin, and his cultivation of Soviet glory. \u201cOn the other hand, even 99 percent of the supporters of Putin in Latvia, I don\u2019t think they are ready to do more than talk.\u201dRussia could make its influence felt in other ways. Latvia depends 100 percent on Russia for deliveries of natural gas. Although the country gets about one-third of its electricity from hydropower, and has shifted toward renewable energy, it is clearly vulnerable to pressure from Russia\u2019s Gazprom, which has a large stake in Latvijas Gas, the natural gas company.Reinis Aboltins, a researcher at the nongovernmental Providus Institute, cited a parliamentary vote last March postponing until 2017 what was supposed to be a mandatory diversification of the gas supply network as one example of Russia\u2019s bringing pressure to bear. Yet dependence is to some extent mutual: Gazprom, which has never cut off delivery to the Baltics, also relies on part of the Latvian network to supply gas back into northwest Russia, including St. Petersburg.For centuries, Russia and Germany have wielded influence here. Riga was an imperial port in czarist times. Russians have been a large minority here for more than 200 years. Today, as visitors drive in from the airport, the first commercial office is that of Siemens, the German engineering giant. The first gas station belongs to Russia\u2019s Lukoil.But now Latvia\u2019s foreign ties are no longer a symbol of dominance by another nation.Most were tourists, \u201cnot just from Germany but from all over Europe,\u201d the chancellor noted later. \u201cThat shows,\u201d she said, \u201cjust how much Latvia has simply become also a part of our common European space.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Rick Perry flew here on Friday to continue laying the groundwork for a possible 2016 presidential bid, exuding confidence as he spoke with businessmen and women in this first-in-the-nation primary state.Mr. Perry, a Republican, was the picture of nonchalance, musing on topics like states\u2019 rights, the rule of law and securing the border, all before he was asked to comment on an indictment last week that charged him with abusing his power. \u201cA few officials want to restrict my constitutional authority to veto a piece of legislation,\u201d he said, reframing the matter. Those officials are in Travis County, which he dismissed as Democratic. \u201cTexas is a pretty red state, but I refer to Travis County as the blueberry in tomato soup, if you know what I mean,\u201d he said to chuckles.Mr. Perry was accused of trying to force the resignation of Rosemary Lehmberg, the Travis County district attorney, after she was arrested on a drunken-driving charge in April 2013, by threatening to veto funding for her office\u2019s Public Integrity Unit. He ultimately followed through on the threat, vetoing $7.5 million in state funds. In Austin, Tex., on Friday, one of Mr. Perry\u2019s lawyers, David L. Botsford, denounced the case as weak and politically motivated. But the special prosecutor, Michael McCrum, defended the indictment and vowed to mount a vigorous response to a dismissal motion. He said he expected a long battle. \u201cI anticipate that Mr. Perry will never plead guilty,\u201d Mr. McCrum said. \u201cSo because of that, I anticipate it will go to trial.\u201d In New Hampshire, Mr. Perry declared, \u201cI\u2019m going to fight this with every fiber of my being.\u201d At the luncheon here \u2014 where about two dozen guests sat with him, overseen by about as many members of the news media \u2014 many said the indictment was a nonissue, a position shared by a number of editorial boards and liberal pundits. \u201cIt\u2019s not worth spending any time thinking about, compared to the extraordinary challenges that this country faces,\u201d Greg Whalen, a commercial real estate broker, said in an interview afterward. \u201cIt\u2019s like a bad mosquito bite \u2014 it ought to just heal itself and go away.\u201dDoug Bates, president of the Greater Portsmouth Chamber of Commerce, said the indictment must be politically motivated. \u201cCan you imagine any employee of yours going out and getting drunk, three times the drinking limit, and you\u2019re going to keep giving her money to run the department?\u201d he asked, referring to reports of Ms. Lehmberg\u2019s blood alcohol level. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201dRenee Plummer, a real estate developer who organized the event, predicted: \u201cI think he\u2019s going to come out smelling like a rose.\u201dGiven such responses, the indictment may be the least of Mr. Perry\u2019s worries in New Hampshire.When Mr. Perry campaigned for the 2012 presidential nomination, he was widely seen as running a terrible campaign. He came in fifth in the Iowa caucuses and skipped campaigning in the New Hampshire primary, where he came in sixth, with less than one percent of the vote. He dropped out in January 2012.\u201cIt is true that New Hampshire gives candidates a second chance \u2014 Reagan, McCain, Romney, George Herbert Walker Bush,\u201d said Dante Scala, a political science professor at the University of New Hampshire. \u201cBut most of them in their first try didn\u2019t fall flat on their face. And it will take Perry time to overcome that.\u201dMr. Perry would probably also face a stronger field of fresher-faced conservatives in 2016, Mr. Scala said. After the luncheon, Mr. Perry, the longest-serving governor of Texas, told reporters that 2012 had been \u201chumbling and frustrating\u201d for him and he had taken its lessons to heart. He noted that he had major back surgery six weeks before he entered the race. But most important, Mr. Perry said, he was not prepared, believing that having won election as governor of Texas was training enough. \u201cYou have to spend a lot of time in these states,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a courtship that goes on, and I didn\u2019t do that.\u201dMr. Perry is clearly in courtship mode now, with a jam-packed schedule. He also has been working on his message, which he tested before the business crowd here. Last year, he said, Texas surpassed California as \u201cthe No. 1 technology-exporting state.\u201d Mr. Perry suggested that with less regulation and lower taxes, he could help make New Hampshire\u2019s economy more competitive.\u201cOn the economic side, no state has grown as much as Texas,\u201d he said, adding that during his tenure 35 percent of all new, private-sector jobs in the country were created in Texas. He said this was not a miracle. \u201cMiracles are things I can\u2019t explain,\u201d Mr. Perry said. \u201cI can explain this.

After celebrating the 70th anniversary of D-Day, the Allied landings in Normandy in 1944, France is about to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Paris two and a half months later by the combined forces of the French Resistance and Gen. Philippe Leclerc\u2019s Free French Army. Yet these celebrations come just as France\u2019s voters have been handing victories to a party created in 1972 by ideological heirs to the Vichy regime, the French puppet government that collaborated with the Nazis and fought the Resistance from 1940 to 1944. Strange days indeed. In May, voters awarded the National Front, a far-right, immigrant-fearing, anti-European Union party, first place with a quarter of all votes cast to represent France in the European Parliament. Two months before, voters had chosen it to run 11 French municipalities. Back in 1974, by comparison, the party\u2019s founder, Jean-Marie Le Pen, mustered only 0.75 percent of the vote for president of France. Of course, French resistance under Vichy never quite fit the morally pure image \u2014 a country united in opposition to German occupation \u2014 that was superimposed on history after the Liberation by a tacit agreement between Gaullists and Communists, the two main French forces who had fought the Nazis. Indeed, in July 1940 the National Assembly voted overwhelmingly to establish the Vichy government in what would become unoccupied southern France.Nevertheless, in the summer of 1944 French opinion rallied in massive numbers to the victors\u2019 banner: There were colossally more Resistance fighters than when Gen. Charles de Gaulle first sent out his call in 1940. They produced the uprising that broke out in Paris on Aug. 19 and brought the German garrison to surrender six days later, as the rapidly advancing Allied armies arrived in Paris in force with Free French infantry and tanks in the lead. For decades in France, that Resistance victory \u2014 the universalist spirit of progress and the Enlightenment triumphing over the herd-like, xenophobic spirit of Vichy \u2014 put everyone who had collaborated with Nazism outside the legitimate political and moral field. And even though the Resistance was far less united than had been imagined during the war, it had been united enough to reach agreement in March 1944 on a farsighted program of national reconstruction as the principal war aim. This program, unanimously adopted by the leaders of the National Council of the Resistance (C.N.R. in French) \u2014 Gaullists, Communists, socialists, Christian democrats and even conservatives \u2014 became the inspiration for a French New Deal of sorts; a dynamic state with a generous social policy that framed the reconstruction of France\u2019s economy in what is known as \u201cthe 30 glorious years\u201d of growth.By the 1980s, the French had absorbed what the French call their \u201csocial victories\u201d \u2014 the two best known are universal health care and a fair pension system \u2014 and retrenchment began slowly eating away at them. Now, however, two more recent incidents have revived this program of the Resistance as an issue.In 2007, Denis Kessler, a prominent French entrepreneur, called for reforming the French economy by \u201ccompletely undoing the C.N.R.\u2019s program\u201d and bringing down the welfare state. In response in 2010, the diplomat St\u00e9phane Hessel, who had fought for the Resistance and survived deportation to Buchenwald, published a short book, \u201cTime for Outrage!\u201d It called for a return to the founding values of the postwar program, starting with social justice and opportunities for the underprivileged, including immigrants. His tract sold more than four million copies, inspired protests by sympathizers across Europe and influenced some elements of Occupy Wall Street.Nevertheless, the program of the Resistance had been repeatedly cut back for 30 years, and this steady disintegration of the \u201cFrench social model\u201d does a great deal to explain the current rise of the National Front and the disturbing resurgence of xenophobia and herd mentality. The putative heirs to the Resistance, who have run the country for 70 years now whether as socialists or conservatives, have proved unable to halt this disintegration. And it is especially difficult for them now. The Socialist Party, which holds power, no longer has any identifiable politics, not even reformist. The radical left is too incoherent and divided to take the slightest electoral advantage of its hostility toward President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. The Communists have almost entirely vanished from the scene. And the Union for a Popular Movement, which unites Gaullists and conservatives, was turned into a megaphone for triumphant free-market capitalism when Nicolas Sarkozy was president. Ever since, its factions have been mired in financial scandal, strong ideological and personal divisions, or fury at Mr. Sarkozy. Mr. Hessel\u2019s call to revive the \u201cspirit of the Resistance\u201d was somewhat artificial, given that French society has changed dramatically in 70 years. But it remains significant as a vision and example \u2014 a remembrance of a time of collective action, openness to others, creative and dynamic leadership, and confidence in the future. All these qualities are cruelly lacking in France today. Their absence opens the way for all the fears that dominate French society, and for all the retreats and retrenchments.In 2011, Marine Le Pen succeeded her father as head of the National Front. Her father was a racist demagogue who spent his life in Vichyist circles. Now she is the only rising figure on France\u2019s political horizon, and she tries to prune away the most repellent aspects of her party\u2019s past. She sticks to a public platform that is less provocative and more centered on actual issues.But in reality, Marine Le Pen remains firmly in line with the party\u2019s history. The National Front\u2019s first program, in 1973, was called \u201cDefending the French\u201d; it stood against immigrants, minorities, Communists and anyone \u201canti-French.\u201d Today, its most rousing slogan invokes \u201cnational preference\u201d; among other things, this entails refusing foreign employees access to the social protections French employees get. This may be milder language than her father\u2019s, but the idea still repels the left and Gaullists alike. Marine Le Pen also champions isolationism toward Europe, and hostility toward immigrants and minorities, especially Muslims. In short, she and her party still embody the precise opposite of the \u201cspirit of the Liberation\u201d that prevailed 70 years ago. This week, even as anti-immigrant sentiment spreads among us daily, we French should remember that many of the first unit of Free French infantrymen to enter Paris and liberate the city on Aug. 24, 1944, were foreigners \u2014 the 9th Company of the 2nd Armored Division, nicknamed in Spanish \u201cLa Nueve\u201d (\u201cThe Ninth\u201d). In Spanish, because among its 160 men, 146 were former members of the Spanish left who had fled General Francisco Franco\u2019s fascist regime to continue, in France, the fight against Nazism and its collaborators.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Does Hosting the Olympics Actually Pay Off?", "Date": "2014-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s the EconomyBrazil may have never wanted for places to play soccer, but that didn\u2019t stop the country from spending billions of dollars on stadiums for last month\u2019s World Cup. The Arena Amazonia, a $300 million edifice designed to look like a woven basket, was built in a rain-forest city where the professional team regularly draws fewer than 2,000 fans per game. And Brazil is only getting started. The country, which is also hosting the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, has embarked on an infrastructure splurge that may top $25 billion. The spending is meant to underscore Brazil\u2019s emergence as an economic power. The country\u2019s leaders insist that it\u2019s also intended to increase the nation\u2019s prosperity.The idea that big sporting events are good for growth is relatively new. A 1956 article in this newspaper noted the curious hopes of Australian officials who were \u201csomewhat optimistic\u201d that visitors to the Melbourne Olympics might settle in the city, or perhaps do a little business there. \u201cOrdinarily,\u201d it said, \u201cbeing host for the Olympic Games is unlikely to gain a nation much beyond prestige.\u201d But as the cost of hosting rose inexorably, so did the supposed benefits. The Olympics and the World Cup are now routinely described as economic engines. Four American cities \u2014 Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington \u2014 recently announced that they were flirting with hosting the 2024 Summer Olympics, and in each case a justification was economic development. In Massachusetts, a state-appointed commission led by a construction executive suggested that a Boston Olympiad could \u201ccatalyze and accelerate the economic-development and infrastructure improvements necessary to ensure that Massachusetts can compete globally now and into the future.\u201dSuch claims are based on the idea that the Games can serve as a tourist attraction, a chance to catch the eye of global business leaders and a way to rally political support for valuable infrastructure projects. The lean and profitable 1984 Los Angeles Olympics are often invoked. So are the 1992 Barcelona Games, which amplified that city\u2019s revival.But there is strikingly little evidence that such events increase tourism or draw new investment. Spending lavishly on a short-lived event is, economically speaking, a dubious long-term strategy. Stadiums, which cost a lot and produce minimal economic benefits, are a particularly lousy line of business. (This is why they are usually built by taxpayers rather than by corporations.) And even though Brazil, like other recent hosts, has sought to make stadium spending more palatable by also building general infrastructure, like highways and airports, the public would derive the same benefit at far less cost if the transportation projects were built and the stadiums were not. The Los Angeles Olympics were successful, after all, because planners avoided building new stadiums. Barcelona, long neglected under the rule of Francisco Franco, was in the midst of a renaissance that would have probably occurred without the Olympics.Many hosts, of course, don\u2019t care all that much about breaking even. The Olympics have always been a debutante\u2019s ball for emerging economies, from Japan in 1964 and Germany in 1972 to China in 2008 and Russia in February. And there is some evidence that it works. Countries that host the Olympics experience a significant increase in trade, according to a 2009 study by Andrew K. Rose, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, and Mark M. Spiegel, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. But their research determined that this was also true of countries that made losing bids for the Olympics \u2014 spending tens of millions rather than billions. The benefit, in other words, came from the signal that a country was open for business, not from the spending itself. \u201cOne city thinks winning the Games is worth more than all the other cities do,\u201d said Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College and the author of the coming \u201cCircus Maximus: The Economics of Hosting the Olympics and the World Cup.\u201d \u201cAnd that city is likely to be making an error.\u201dAnd while Brazil may be eager to signal its economic might, the Games can also tarnish a host country\u2019s reputation. The enduring image of the Munich Olympics is a man in a ski mask; decaying venues from the 2004 Olympics became a metaphor for Greece\u2019s economic crisis. Sochi\u2019s legacy was overshadowed by security concerns and warm weather \u2014 even before Russia ended hopes for a tourism boom by annexing Crimea. In a study of the impact of the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australian researchers interviewed people in four countries \u2014 Hong Kong, Malaysia, South Africa and the United States \u2014 one year before and after the Games. They found little change in perceptions, with one surprising wrinkle: South Africans had soured on Australia \u201cbecause of the way in which the Aboriginal issue was highlighted and portrayed by the South African media,\u201d which drew comparisons with that nation\u2019s history of apartheid.Philip Porter, an economist at the University of South Florida who has studied the impact of sporting events, told me that the evidence was unequivocal. \u201cThe bottom line is, every time we\u2019ve looked \u2014 dozens of scholars, dozens of times \u2014 we find no real change in economic activity,\u201d he said. Still, even for established cities like Boston or San Francisco, there is one clear reason to chase the Olympics or the World Cup: People like hosting major sporting events. Economists tend to pay more attention to money than to happiness, because money is easier to count. But it\u2019s no small matter that surveys routinely find high levels of public support in the host nation before, during and after the Olympics and the World Cup. \u201cIt\u2019s like a wedding,\u201d Matheson told me. \u201cIt won\u2019t make you rich, but it may make you happy.\u201d The trick is deciding how much that\u2019s worth.Binyamin Appelbaum is an economics reporter for The Times.Deep thoughts:\n1. The Olympics won\u2019t make a country rich.\n2. They\u2019re not even good for tourism.\n3. But they will make its people happy.Advertisement"}
