{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s Cloud Business Lifts Its Profit to a Record", "Date": "2016-04-28", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 Amazon delivered a blowout quarter on Thursday, joining Facebook as one of the rare bright spots in a technology sector that has recently produced a string of disappointing earnings reports.Helped by its fast-growing Amazon Web Services business, the company jumped to the most profitable quarter in its nearly 22-year history.Amazon often flip-flops between showing profits and losses, depending on how aggressively it decides to plow money into big new business bets. Investors have granted the company much wider leeway to do so than other technology companies of its size often receive, because of its history of delivering outsize growth.Revenue at the company rose to $29.13 billion from $22.72 billion a year ago.\u201cThe fact that they\u2019re profitable is a big deal,\u201d said Christian Magoon, chief executive of Amplify Investments, a fund manager that counts Amazon as a top holding. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a big deal after some of the disappointing numbers from Apple and others.\u201dThe results were well above the average estimates of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters for earnings of 58 cents a share and revenue of $27.98 billion.\u201cI saw the number, and I thought, \u2018O.K., did I read this wrong?\u2019\u201d Mr. Magoon added. \u201cThe beat was big. On the income side, it was fantastic.\u201dFor the last four quarters, Amazon has run in the black, even if it is still not quite as profitable as some technology companies. Facebook, by contrast, reported that its net income for the first three months of the year tripled to $1.5 billion from a year earlier.The biggest source of the company\u2019s profits is Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing business that started just over a decade ago and is now on track to bring in more than $10 billion a year in revenue. A.W.S., as the business is known, is the most popular cloud service for start-ups and for a growing number of big companies that want to rent computing capacity, rather than run their own hardware and software.Cloud computing is also much more profitable than Amazon\u2019s North American retail business, which runs on thinner margins, and its international retail business, which runs at a loss. The operating income for A.W.S. more than tripled in the quarter to $604 million.The profits from A.W.S. represented 56 percent of Amazon\u2019s total operating income, even though the $2.57 billion in revenue from A.W.S. \u2014 up 64 percent from a year earlier \u2014 amounted to less than 9 percent of total revenue.On a conference call, Brian Olsavsky, Amazon\u2019s chief financial officer, said the company continued to make hefty long-term investments in initiatives, singling out original content for its Prime video service.In a statement announcing the earnings, Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, highlighted the performance of another growing area of investment \u2014 hardware devices \u2014 though with the lack of detail that has often characterized Amazon disclosures. He said customers bought twice as many Fire tablets during the first quarter as they did a year earlier, and he said the company could not keep its Echo intelligent speaker in stock.Last year, Amazon reached $100 billion in annual sales. Investors believe that even at that size, the company can become a lot bigger because online commerce still represents a relatively small portion of total retail sales. Online sales in 2016 are expected to reach about $385 billion in the United States, or 8 percent of total retail sales, according to eMarketer, a technology research firm.Amazon is the rare technology company of its size to still deliver double-digit revenue growth. The company\u2019s retail sales in North America jumped 27 percent to almost $17 billion for the quarter, while its international retail sales rose 24 percent to $9.57 billion.Amazon said revenue in the current quarter is expected to be between $28 billion and $30.5 billion, with operating income between $375 million and $975 million.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What the Apple Watch Does, One Year Later", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported byApp SmartThe Apple Watch\u2019s uses, of course, partly depend on the apps available for it. On that front, the news is good \u2014 the list of apps for the watch is ever-growing. Here are some of the best ones to try.There are a few limitations to Facer. The biggest is that you are stuck with only one watch face design \u2014 the simplest, which shows only an image and the time. That means you will not see features like alerts or weather information that you can see on other watch faces. You also have to pay for some of the images, which can cost $1 and up.The idea is that when you survey your shelves and refrigerator, you use the iPhone app to pull together a shopping list. The app makes this easy, offering prearranged options for items you may regularly buy, like bread, milk, bagels and so on. You can color-code each item to make identifying different categories of products easy, and items the app does not already have can be typed in. You can also set up multiple lists, and share them with others.When shopping, you can view your shopping list on your watch, without having to fish out your phone. This is a fabulous memory aid. Swiping the items on the watch screen to mark them as bought is satisfying. And you can use dictation on the watch to add items to a list, which is great when you suddenly remember something you need to buy.At a glance this can tell you if your heart has been speeding, which is useful after a jog, for example. By using Force Touch \u2014 pressing hard on the watch \u2014 you can add a note to that day\u2019s readings, or add a measurement to your Apple Health app, including weight, body temperature and many more.The accompanying iPhone app is well designed and can display lots of heart health statistics, most of which are easily readable thanks to clever graphics. You can also use it to track your sleeping habits.The app has one button to turn the sleep-detecting mode on, during which it displays your bedtime and how long you have been sleeping. There is also a single button to turn the sleep mode off, after which the app shows some sleep statistics. The accompanying iPhone app displays detailed information about sleep patterns.The one downside of this app is that the watch must be worn during the night, which may be uncomfortable for some.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Outshone by Smaller Screens, PCs Aim to Be Seen as Cool Again", "Date": "2016-04-03", "News": "Supported byPALO ALTO, Calif. \u2014 Dion Weisler, the chief executive of HP Inc., recently held out a bulky laptop that was the pride of 2012. \u201cThis is the laptop we had when I came here,\u201d he said.He opened it to reveal another HP laptop within its hollowed-out insides. Then he opened that machine to produce another smaller and lighter laptop. Like the last in a set of nested Russian dolls, a final and even more slender laptop emerged from inside the third machine.\u201cPretty spectacular, right?\u201d said Mr. Weisler, a toothy and optimistic Australian.It was an impressive visual trick \u2014 and one with a point. On Tuesday, Mr. Weisler will publicly introduce a personal computer similar to the slimmest one he brought out of the nested machines, with a 13.3-inch screen but even thinner. At less than 11 millimeters thick (less than half an inch), he said, it beats the best effort by Apple and shows that HP\u2019s PCs are still hip and innovative. In fact, HP has made a small number of the new slim laptops in gold and diamonds, to be sold for $25,000 each for charity, with the unveiling planned for a New York Times Luxury Conference in Paris.HP\u2019s new laptop, called Spectre, underlines the lengths to which PC makers must now go to attract customer attention. Apart from HP, PC makers like Dell and Lenovo are also pumping money into the design of desktop and laptop computers, coming up with increasingly sleek machines, as well as \u201ctwo in ones,\u201d whose screens detach to become tablets. There are PCs that fit in a pocket, understand voice and gesture, or sense when they need repairs and call on their own for a remote tuneup.The sales decline was just the latest in several years when the PC market faced an onslaught of smartphones and tablets as cooler alternatives. The falloff is expected to level off this year, with PC sales even expected to begin growing slowly in 2017. But that still leaves the question of whether PCs can seem cool again.Even people who depend on the PC industry now lack passion for these onetime miracle products. \u201cIt\u2019s one of many ways onto the Internet now,\u201d Mikako Kitagawa, an analyst at Gartner, said of the PC. \u201cThe big companies are pretty much making similar devices.\u201dThat clearly sticks in the PC industry\u2019s collective craw.\u201cI hear \u2018post-PC era\u2019 and think it\u2019s rubbish,\u201d said Jeff Clarke, president for client solutions at Dell. \u201cWe sell a quarter-billion devices. The installed base is 1.9 billion devices. Maybe it\u2019s taken for granted, but the innovation is second to none.\u201d\u201cIn aggregate, devices like PCs, tablets and smartphones are still growing, but they are also shifting,\u201d said Mr. Weisler, 48, who has spent his career in PCs, working at Acer and Lenovo before joining HP. \u201cYou can create new categories.\u201dTo do that, Mr. Weisler has modestly increased research and development spending and plans to raise that amount. Under Hewlett-Packard\u2019s previous chief executive, Meg Whitman, printing and PCs \u201cdidn\u2019t get investment dollars,\u201d Mr. Weisler said. He also plans to merge HP\u2019s consumer and commercial PC businesses, hoping to bolster the cachet of PCs both at home and at the office.Obstacles remain in the way of Mr. Weisler\u2019s vision. When Hewlett-Packard was one giant company, it was valued at $60 billion. Now HP Inc. and the separate enterprise company, called Hewlett Packard Enterprise, are worth about $53 billion.Even so, he insists on a bright future. On a recent day, he showed off the early results of his push at the company\u2019s Silicon Valley headquarters. One device that looked like a small tablet or a large smartphone could, in fact, be either of those \u2014 or a PC, or a laptop. It worked on its own, or it could fit into a dock attached to a keyboard and a big screen, functioning like a PC. It could also connect wirelessly with a keyboard and folding screen, making it a laptop.Another machine in the room was simply a laptop, but the edges hid a series of quality microphones. It had Internet phone controls built in, and it was designed to open up until it was completely flat. That way it could be used for conference calling, catching voices all around the table.Nearby, HP\u2019s latest printers had lost their moving nozzles in favor of an 8.5-inch bar that spits about a billion dots a second. The company said it could now do laser-quality printing twice as fast and for half the cost, setting it up for the day when 3-D printing becomes commonplace.\u201cWe\u2019re bringing an elegance of design,\u201d Mr. Clarke said, adding that Dell planned to increase spending on research and development.And for all the challenges, Mr. Weisler thinks HP can thrive when PC demand picks up, and it might even get itself some of the shine that surrounds Apple \u2014 which has soared in value on the back of the iPhone \u2014 after the last diamond-encrusted PC leaves his desk.\u201cThere is value in building things that are close to people and understand things like facial expressions,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you focus on building for the high end, your other devices get better, too.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Technology Transforms How Insurers Calculate Risk", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The world is a dangerous, unpredictable place \u2014 not a bad thing, perhaps, if you\u2019re in the business of selling insurance, making loans or figuring out ways to prevent mishaps.But these days, technology is changing some of the calculations around risk, whether for car insurance, life insurance, flood insurance or even vacation-related accident insurance, and slowly but surely disrupting the financial core of the insurance business.Take the old saw that younger drivers are always the riskiest to insure, for example. Is it always true?\u201cA 22-year-old driver who parties a lot and drives 10,000 miles a year, or a 40-year-old teetotaling mom who drives 40,000 miles? I might think the mom is riskier,\u201d said Dan Preston, the chief executive of Metromile. \u201cSpeeding a lot or braking hard, unless you\u2019re going 100 miles an hour, it doesn\u2019t make much difference.\u201dInstead, all those extra miles the mother is safely and soberly driving mean she is more often where the accidents are happening. Or, as Mr. Preston put it, \u201cSeventy percent of the variants around expected losses can be derived from mileage.\u201dFinancial technology is not just changed by faster computers with more powerful software. Technology also changes things like mobile computing, data collection and what people can measure. Put those together creatively and you change any business involved in calculating risk \u2014 in other words, most of the financial world.Customers fill out the usual information, like age and location \u2014 the things traditionally used to guess the likelihood a car will be wrecked or stolen. That data determines a Metromile base rate for insurance, and premiums rise based on miles driven. People who stay below the national average of about 12,000 miles annually can save substantially, compared with traditional insurance.People are, in effect, agreeing to be observed in exchange for the savings, which enables Metromile to add services. It has become a way for Uber drivers to stay insured while they are driving for money, something their traditional policies may not cover.Metromile\u2019s location-based knowledge lets it warn drivers to remove their cars from a street that will be swept soon, helping them avoid a ticket. The tracking device can hook into a car\u2019s computers, warning the driver when the car might need maintenance.While people may be uncertain about government monitoring, they seem to be willing to have companies looking over their shoulders \u2014 at least if it saves them money.It is something insurers want badly, said James Whittle, chief claims counsel for the American Insurance Association. \u201cLots of insurers are drilling down to the precise granularity of risk,\u201d he said.Expect more. Cellphones, sensors and cheap computing make it possible to value all sorts of objects, including cars, houses, cameras and skis, while gaining insight into how they are likely to be used next. That changes the betting for the risk industry.\u201cMetromile is the start of a broader shift,\u201d said Mark McLaughlin, global insurance director for IBM. Insurance companies \u201cwant to shift from paying when something bad happens to helping you prevent something bad happening to you,\u201d he said.He predicts a time when a car insurer might learn drivers\u2019 commuting routes and warn them if there is a chance of a hailstorm ahead, even text them a Starbucks coupon to encourage them to wait out the risk. Last October, IBM bought the digital assets of the Weather Channel, perhaps in anticipation of such a service. IBM declined to discuss future products.Many traditional insurers are already adopting this observational approach and using discounts to sway behavior. Some examples include Progressive Auto Insurance, which has a service similar to Metromile, called Snapshot.The company Vitality has united with several insurers to offer people lower rates in exchange for logging their health data. It gives people things like Fitbits and Apple Watches to automatically track their activities. State Farm Insurance, in conjunction with the home security company ADT, offers discounts for people who get home monitoring systems.Insurance, which is after all a business where people take money with a promise to maybe pay for something someday, is a highly regulated enterprise that historically favored slow-moving companies with lots of capital. In this case, however, Mr. Preston says he has an edge on established competition.\u201cThe challenge for the incumbents is that the low-mileage customers are most of their profits,\u201d he said at Metromile\u2019s headquarters here in a converted parking garage. \u201cThey are subsidizing the high-mileage drivers,\u201d he said. \u201cThose are the people we attract.\u201dMetromile\u2019s co-founder and board chairman is David Friedberg, an early employee at Google, who also founded what became the Climate Corporation. Climate, which used data on things like rainfall and soil quality to insure several types of crops, was bought by Monsanto for more than $900 million in 2013.\u201cThe next generation understands the atomization of everything,\u201d said Scott Walchek, the founder and chief executive of Trov. Atomization means slicing things to their smallest components, in this case not insuring a whole houseful of goods but individual objects. \u201cInsurers have to get ready for customers who expect to have their ownership of everything, how they use things, understood. On-demand everything is the zeitgeist.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "F.B.I. Used Hacking Software Decade Before iPhone Fight", "Date": "2016-04-13", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In early 2003, F.B.I. agents hit a roadblock in a secret investigation, called Operation Trail Mix. For months, agents had been intercepting phone calls and emails belonging to members of an animal welfare group that was believed to be sabotaging operations of a company that was using animals to test drugs. But encryption software had made the emails unreadable.So investigators tried something new. They persuaded a judge to let them remotely, and secretly, install software on the group\u2019s computers to help get around the encryption.That effort, revealed in newly declassified and released records, shows in new detail how F.B.I. hackers worked to defeat encryption more than a decade before the agency\u2019s recent fight with Apple over access to a locked iPhone. The Trail Mix case was, in some ways, a precursor to the Apple dispute. In both cases, the agents could not decode the data themselves, but found a clever workaround.The Trail Mix records also reveal what is believed to be the first example of the F.B.I. remotely installing surveillance software, known as spyware or malware, as part of a criminal wiretap.\u201cThis was the first time that the Department of Justice had ever approved such an intercept of this type,\u201d an F.B.I. agent wrote in a 2005 document summing up the case.The next year, six activists were convicted of conspiracy to violate the Animal Enterprise Protection Act in the case. An appeals court upheld the convictions in 2009, and said that the use of encryption, among other things, was \u201ccircumstantial evidence of their agreement to participate in illegal activity.\u201dRyan Shapiro, a national security researcher and animal welfare advocate, provided the documents in the case to The New York Times after obtaining them in a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit. Several important details remain secret, including whether the tactic worked. The wiretap was disclosed at trial but the software hacking was not, said Lauren Gazzola, one of the defendants, who now works for the Center for Constitutional Rights.The Trail Mix documents provide an unusual, if dated, glimpse at the cat-and-mouse game that the F.B.I. has been playing for years with people who use technology to keep their affairs secret. The records show that, even when encryption was not widely used, there was a growing frustration about it in the F.B.I. To defeat it, agents built and used surveillance software earlier than was known.\u201cThe documents show that the F.B.I. has been in the hacking business for a long time,\u201d said Chris Soghoian, a technology analyst with the American Civil Liberties Union who reviewed the records.The technology company has been locked in a major legal battle against law enforcement officials over privacy and security.In 2008 the F.B.I. began a campaign called \u201cGoing Dark\u201d to build support for laws requiring companies to allow government access to data in unencrypted form. But the Trail Mix records show that agents were frustrated by encryption many years earlier, and saw the fight against terrorism as an opportunity to get new authority.\u201cThe current terrorism prevention context may present the best opportunity to bring up the encryption issue,\u201d an F.B.I. official said in a December 2002 email. A month later, a draft bill, called Patriot Act 2, revealed that the Justice Department was considering outlawing the use of encryption to conceal criminal activity. The bill did not pass.The Trail Mix investigation focused on sabotage and stalking at Huntingdon Life Sciences, a company with a New Jersey laboratory that conducted pharmaceutical testing on animals. The group Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty strongly opposed the company\u2019s testing and advocated protests to end it.F.B.I. agents contended members of the group were also behind criminal attacks that included nuisances like sending nonstop faxes of all-black paper and hacking attacks that caused more than $450,000 in damages and lost business. Federal law labeled such attacks eco-terrorism.The activists communicated using a well-known security program called Pretty Good Privacy, which makes emails unreadable by anyone without a password and a digital key. The agents tried several tactics, including getting a \u201cfull-content\u201d wiretap that intercepted every byte that left the group\u2019s computers. Yet the encryption proved unbreakable.More than a decade later, the F.B.I. still cannot break sophisticated encryption such as the kind used on Apple\u2019s iPhones. Early this year, in its investigation of the San Bernardino, Calif., terrorist attack, the Justice Department tried to require Apple to remove some security features from a locked iPhone so the F.B.I. could guess the password. Eventually, a private consultant developed a way to hack into the phone without Apple\u2019s help, and sold the idea to the F.B.I.Agents in the Trail Mix case also found a workaround. Like the San Bernardino case, the Trail Mix solutions were classified.\u201cPlease be advised that the tool itself is classified SECRET,\u201d an F.B.I. computer specialist from Quantico, Va., wrote in early 2003 while delivering an early version of the tool. \u201cFurther, any indication that the tool is specifically software in nature is also classified.\u201dExactly what the software was built to do is still not clear. But language in the documents suggests that it may have copied the digital keys, kept track of keystrokes to help the F.B.I. identify the passwords, or both.In a Mafia case years earlier, agents sneaked into a Philadelphia office and attached a device to a computer that recorded every keystroke. That classified device helped agents break into an encrypted file. But until Trail Mix, such a tactic had never been tried using software as part of a wiretap, the documents show.Cases like Operation Trail Mix and the San Bernardino shootings are examples of why many government officials say they need a new law to guarantee access to encrypted data. Going case-by-case, hack-by-hack is impractical, they say.\u201cIndividually tailored solutions have to be the exception and not the rule,\u201d Valerie Caproni, the F.B.I.\u2019s top lawyer, told Congress in 2011.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Some Online Bargains May Only Look Like One", "Date": "2016-04-13", "News": "Supported byAmazon has some unbelievable bargains on its virtual shelves.You say you don\u2019t believe that a plastic cat pan could ever have been sold to anyone for a couple of thousand bucks? Or that a six-ounce bag of Zuke\u2019s Lil\u2019 Links pork and apple sausage bits ever cost more than dinner at a five-star restaurant?It\u2019s all part of the bizarre world of Internet \u201cdiscounts,\u201d which let retailers and brands assert that you are getting a stupendous deal because someone somewhere else \u2014 exactly where is never explained \u2014 is being charged much more.So if you are the sort of consumer who cares about such things, how can you guard against such pressure? When does e-commerce deliver on low prices, and when is it merely coasting on its reputation?These are particularly significant issues now, as Internet retail shifts from being mostly about price to being largely about convenience. That will make it much harder for customers to judge independently if they are getting a deal or merely being encouraged to think so.First, realize that the problem is at least as pervasive online as offline \u2014 and even less regulated. California, which has relatively strict laws about deceptive advertising, brought a successful case against Overstock.com for illusory discounts. But authorities elsewhere seem to have little interest.Over the last month, more research has been done on the shadowy world of Internet discounts that underline how random or even whimsical list prices are.Boomerang Commerce, a retail analytics firm, compared the list prices of dozens of pet items on Amazon and the specialist pet site Chewy.com. In only a handful of cases did the retailers even agree on what the list price was. So a 22-pound bag of Blue Buffalo Basics Limited Ingredient Grain-Free Duck and Potato dog food had a list price of $131 on Amazon and $84 on Chewy. Yet the retail price at both sites was the same: $49.49.\u201cA perceived deeper discount creates a higher conversion event \u2014 in other words, more buyers,\u201d said Boomerang\u2019s chief executive, Guru Hariharan, who previously worked at Amazon.Blue Buffalo declined to comment and Chewy did not respond to messages seeking comment. Amazon removed the $131 list price for the dog food and the 99 percent deals I asked about. An Amazon spokesman, Craig Berman, declined to answer any questions.A little over 44 percent of the products \u2014 some sold directly by Amazon, others by third parties \u2014 were billed as discounted, Ripen said. \u201cIt\u2019s less than I expected, actually,\u201d said Dave Rekuc, Ripen\u2019s director of marketing. \u201cConsidering you can basically name your own list price.\u201dSome e-commerce experts said nothing needed to be done about illusory discounts, because the merchants needed them so much.The process \u201ccan seem dishonest to consumers, but let\u2019s consider the retailer\u2019s side,\u201d said Daniel Green of CamelCamelCamel.com, an oddly named but useful site that tracks Amazon prices. \u201cIf they weren\u2019t using the list price as the benchmark, what would they use?\u201dRetailers could choose the most recent price as the comparison, Mr. Green said, but then \u201cthey would just jack the price way up before the sale. I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a good solution here, particularly as consumers apparently respond to large M.S.R.P.-based discounts.\u201d\u201cThe fact that plaintiff may have been manipulated into purchasing the items because she believed she was getting a bargain does not necessarily mean she suffered economic harm,\u201d United States District Judge F. Dennis Saylor IV wrote.For others, however, e-commerce is not living up to its promise of being transparent and pro-consumer.Her site tracks litigation against the retailers. Wayfair, an online furniture retailer, has been sued in a pricing case that is pending. A case against Amazon faltered because its customers waived their rights to sue in favor of arbitration.E-commerce is in flux. The selling point is increasingly getting something now rather than getting it cheap. Online shoppers are encouraged to live in an ecosystem where they buy as much as possible from one company. The pioneer of this, of course, is Amazon, with its annual Prime fee that covers shipping.In an ecosystem, prices are much harder to calculate, or perhaps even impossible. Customers have to trust the retailer, a problematic situation.\u201cPricing can be complex,\u201d said Mr. Hariharan of Boomerang Commerce. \u201cIn some places it\u2019s highly transparent. But there are others where you have to do the math. You have to check the impact of shipping costs, promotions, coupons and loyalty rewards.\u201dSome consumers feel manipulated. Charlie Allenson, a New Yorker who teaches business skills using improv comedy, was recently shopping for an audio interface that would turn his computer into a recording studio.On one e-commerce site, the list price was $170. At another, it was more.

Opts Not to Share iPhone-Unlocking Method", "Date": "2016-04-27", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The F.B.I. closed the door Wednesday to the possibility of giving Apple the technical solution that the government bought to unlock the iPhone used by one of the attackers in the mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif.The decision leaves Apple in the dark about the technical details of how the F.B.I. \u2014 with help from an unknown outside group that was apparently paid at least $1.3 million \u2014 managed to bypass the company\u2019s vaunted encryption.After two months of tense sparring over the San Bernardino iPhone, the government\u2019s decision was a clear rebuke to Apple. Its chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, has declared publicly that the company should not have to develop new software so the F.B.I. can unlock its phones. The F.B.I. on Wednesday appeared eager to return the favor by refusing to divulge how it finally broke in.The decision upset some technology industry executives, who said it appeared to run counter to the Obama administration\u2019s promises to promote security and transparency in the nation\u2019s technology operations.Apple declined to comment on Wednesday.F.B.I. officials maintained that what they bought from the outside company amounted only to a tool for getting into the phone, and not a blueprint exposing the actual security flaws in the device.As a result, F.B.I. officials decided not to send the issue on to a special White House panel that reviews the question of whether software vulnerabilities discovered by American intelligence officials should be shared with the software designer to enhance security.That review panel could have determined that the technical fix bought by the F.B.I. should be shared with Apple.\u201cThe F.B.I. purchased the method from an outside party so that we could unlock the San Bernardino device,\u201d said Amy S. Hess, executive assistant director for science and technology.\u201cWe did not, however, purchase the rights to technical details about how the method functions, or the nature and extent of any vulnerability upon which the method may rely in order to operate. As a result, currently we do not have enough technical information about any vulnerability that would permit any meaningful review\u201d by the White House examiners, she said.Soon after the government said that a third party had successfully gotten data from the phone, after giving the F.B.I. a demonstration of its method in February, many security professionals were hopeful that the method would be made public.\u201cIt\u2019s the position of Obama administration that security flaws should be disclosed to the parties that can fix them,\u201d said Denelle Dixon-Thayer, chief legal and business officer at Mozilla. She added that the fact that the F.B.I. did not take the necessary steps to understand how the outside group opened the phone shows that the review process over all needs to be more transparent.The government\u2019s decision simply to hire the locksmith and ignore how that lock was opened \u201ccreates a gap in the review process\u201d that is \u201cnot transparent and has not been set in legislation,\u201d she said.The F.B.I.\u2019s carefully worded statement reveals that law enforcement authorities have found a loophole in the vulnerability review process created by the administration\u2014 hire the hacker to extract the data, but be careful to not know how he got the job done.\u201cThe F.B.I. is intentionally exploiting a known vulnerability and enabling people to profit off of it,\u201d said Alex Rice, the chief technology officer at HackerOne, a security company in San Francisco that helps coordinate vulnerability disclosure for corporations. \u201cThe collateral damage done by this lack of transparency and the possible ongoing existence of the flaw is serious.\u201dThe government\u2019s claim that it does not have enough details to provide any information to the review process is not unusual. \u201cOver the last 10 years as cellphones became more important to criminal investigations, law enforcement would hire digital forensics teams, would extract data for investigators without necessarily buying the capability to do it themselves,\u201d said Ben Johnson, the co-founder of the security start-up Carbon Black.The F.B.I. decided not to send the issue to the White House to review under a classified and little-known system known as the Vulnerabilities Equities Process.Because the government relies on Internet security, wrote Michael Daniel, special assistant to the president on cybersecurity, \u201cdisclosing vulnerabilities usually makes sense. We need these systems to be secure as much as, if not more so, than anyone else.\u201dBut Mr. Daniel acknowledged that the United States government could sometimes exploit the security flaws itself if it does not disclose them.\u201cDisclosing a vulnerability can mean that we forgo an opportunity to collect crucial intelligence that could thwart a terrorist attack, stop the theft of our nation\u2019s intellectual property, or even discover more dangerous vulnerabilities that are being used by hackers or other adversaries to exploit our networks,\u201d he said.Eric Lichtblau reported from Washington and Katie Benner from San Francisco.

{"Headline": "Why Apple\u2019s Stand Against the F.B.I. Hurts Its Own Customers", "Date": "2016-04-08", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsTwo weeks ago, privacy advocates across the country celebrated as the Federal Bureau of Investigation backed off its request for Apple to help gain access into the iPhone of Syed Farook, one of the terrorists who killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif., in December.On Friday, the F.B.I. again sought Apple\u2019s assistance \u2014 this time to help crack an iPhone belonging to a convicted drug dealer \u2014 by requesting that a federal judge overturn an earlier decision in Brooklyn supporting Apple.Apple had argued in part that it didn\u2019t want iPhone hacking by the government to become routine. That the F.B.I. so soon wants access to another iPhone would seem to prove Apple right and to vindicate the company\u2019s principled resistance, right? Wrong.Apple\u2019s decision not to help in the Farook case was ultimately bad for the company and its customers. Apple has lost leverage in legal cases and the average iPhone user is significantly more vulnerable \u2014 both to government access and to criminal hacking \u2014 than if Apple had assisted the government in the first place.The F.B.I. has already found a company able to access Mr. Farook\u2019s phone without Apple\u2019s assistance, presumably taking advantage of a vulnerability that Apple has either not yet identified or not yet patched. That means that the F.B.I. should be able to access information on similar iPhones. (Even though it may have the technical means to access the Brooklyn phone, the Justice Department argued in its letter to the court that \u201cthe government continues to require Apple\u2019s assistance in accessing the data that it is authorized to search by warrant.\u201d)Apple is now asking the F.B.I. to \u201cresponsibly\u201d disclose the vulnerability so that Apple can rapidly patch it. Apple\u2019s request is predicated on a White House process, created in 2014, that explicitly requires the government to weigh the trade-off between the security benefits of eliminating a vulnerability in a piece of consumer software and the intelligence benefits of continuing access.Relying on this White House process may not help much, though. First, as Ben Wittes of the Brookings Institution has pointed out, the F.B.I. has no legal obligation to disclose the vulnerability. While the White House made clear that its process was \u201cbiased toward responsibly disclosing\u201d vulnerabilities, it also went out of the way to note that it would not \u201ccompletely forgo this tool as a way to conduct intelligence collection.\u201dMoreover, it\u2019s certainly possible, indeed likely, that the company that cracked the iPhone made nondisclosure a condition of giving the government this information; after all, finding vulnerabilities is presumably a moneymaking endeavor for the company (and thus, this vulnerability is conceivably available in the marketplace to the highest bidder), and voluntarily letting Apple fix it doesn\u2019t seem like a great business plan.While the F.B.I. has refused to say whether it will ultimately share the vulnerability with Apple (and Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California and vice chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence committee, has suggested that it should not), Apple\u2019s previous position is almost certain to make the government more likely to withhold the information. Apple has made it clear that it will fight tooth and nail the government\u2019s effort to get lawful access, and will implement as many technical measures as necessary to limit such access.Given that, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if the government decided in favor of leaving this back door open so it could continue to access iPhones.Why does all this matter? Simple: The longer it takes Apple to patch this vulnerability (either because the government discloses it to Apple or because Apple figures it out on its own), the longer iPhone user data is at risk \u2014 both from the government and from criminals.So privacy advocates should carefully weigh the costs and benefits of Apple\u2019s decision for both the company and its customers. If Apple had complied with the California court\u2019s order, it could have used a method to obtain access that was known only to the company. The vulnerability would be safe, or at least, safer (hackers could eventually re-create this method).For those of us concerned with government overreach and privacy, there would be three clear benefits to Apple\u2019s cooperation. First, by forcing the government to come to it in the first instance, Apple retains the ability to litigate court orders \u2014 assuming its position is not to refuse to cooperate no matter the particular facts \u2014 and thereby challenge the government in specific cases of possible overreach.Second, Apple can choose to protect the method for lawful access as closely as it wants, including by storing it in the same way that it stores its source code or its software signing keys. And, perhaps most important, Apple would leave it to the courts do their job to figure out whether the F.B.I. has probable cause for a search.Ultimately, the question is this: For lawful access to material important to terrorism investigations, would we rather trust Apple itself under the close supervision of the courts, or the F.B.I. and some private company that makes money selling cellphone hacks? The latter, which is where we clearly are, seems bad for the privacy and security of iPhone users around the globe.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "On Encryption Battle, Apple Has Advocates in Ex-National Security Officials", "Date": "2016-04-22", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In their years together as top national security officials, Michael V. Hayden and Michael Chertoff were fierce advocates of using the government\u2019s spying powers to pry into sensitive intelligence data.Mr. Hayden directed a secret domestic eavesdropping program at the National Security Agency that captured billions of phone records after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Mr. Chertoff pushed for additional wiretapping and surveillance powers from Congress both as a top prosecutor and as Homeland Security secretary.But today, their jobs have changed, and so, apparently, have their views on privacy. Both former officials now work with technology companies like Apple at a corporate consulting firm that Mr. Chertoff founded, and both are now backing Apple \u2014 and not the F.B.I., with which they once worked \u2014 in its fight to keep its iPhones encrypted and private.They are among more than a half-dozen prominent former national security officials who, to varying degrees, have supported Apple and the idea of impenetrable \u201cend-to-end encryption\u201d during a furious national debate over the balance between privacy and security in the digital age.In white papers, op-ed articles, conferences, newspaper and television interviews and elsewhere, the former officials have made their support for Apple clear. While their former jobs in the government are always featured prominently in their public appearances, their current business affiliations often go unmentioned.The barrage of support has given Apple a public relations boost in a fight it once seemed destined to lose, but it has surprised and angered some law enforcement officials.These officials question whether the business relationships that some of the former officials now have with Apple and other Silicon Valley companies \u2014 jobs that usually pay far above their former government salaries \u2014 are behind their enthusiastic advocacy of privacy and encryption.Among those who have voiced support for Apple\u2019s position are Mike McConnell, a former director of national intelligence; David H. Petraeus, a former director of the Central Intelligence Agency; R. James Woolsey, another former C.I.A. director; and Richard A. Clarke, a former top White House counterterrorism official. Like Mr. Chertoff and Mr. Hayden, they all now work with firms that have ties to the technology sector, records show.It is unclear how much money Apple and other technology firms involved in the F.B.I. litigation have paid to the firms where the former officials now work; most of the firms declined to discuss their private business dealings, calling them irrelevant.Mr. McConnell, who served as national intelligence director under President Obama and George W. Bush, argues that keeping the United States\u2019 computer systems safe from rival nations and rogue hackers should outweigh the F.B.I.\u2019s interests in unlocking smartphones in criminal cases.The technology company has been locked in a major legal battle against law enforcement officials over privacy and security.\u201cI believe ubiquitous encryption is something that the nation is going to have to embrace,\u201d Mr. McConnell, who is now a senior executive adviser at the consulting giant Booz Allen Hamilton, said in a telephone interview. \u201cApple has been leading the fight to go down that path, Google is right behind and Microsoft will be there before too long.\u201dBooz Allen\u2019s executive vice president, Thad W. Allen, a former Coast Guard commandant, has also voiced support for Apple\u2019s position on encryption, because, he said, American technology firms need to stay competitive in the international market.Booz Allen has made a recent push to form \u201cstrategic alliances\u201d with Apple and other technology companies, executives said.Mr. McConnell and other former national security officials said that their work in the private sector had no impact on their public support for Apple. Not everyone agrees.Some current law enforcement officials say they have been angered by the former officials\u2019 sharp and sometimes personal criticism of the F.B.I. (Mr. Hayden, for instance, said in an interview, \u201cI think Jim Comey\u2019s wrong,\u201d referring to the bureau\u2019s director.)The Justice Department and the F.B.I. declined to comment. But Stewart Baker, a former Homeland Security official who is one of the few former officials publicly backing the F.B.I. in the encryption debate, said it was frustrating to see old colleagues now echoing what he sees as erroneous assertions from Apple about the threat to its customers\u2019 privacy.Still, he conceded that the efforts had been effective. What started as a dispute over a locked iPhone used by a terrorist in San Bernardino, Calif., has instead become a broader one over privacy and computer security, Mr. Baker said, and \u201cthey\u2019re getting a lot of people to side with Apple.\u201dSo strong is their support that Apple has included comments from several of the former officials in its legal pleadings. One filing included a comment from Mr. Chertoff at a conference last month that if Apple were forced to create a \u201cback door\u201d to get around its encryption, it would be like creating \u201ca bacteriological weapon.\u201dAnother vote of support that Apple has included in its legal filings came from Mr. Hayden, who is one of the top executives at Mr. Chertoff\u2019s consulting firm, the Chertoff Group. \u201cAmerica is more secure \u2014 America is more safe \u2014 with unbreakable end-to-end encryption,\u201d Mr. Hayden, who led both the National Security Agency and the C.I.A., told a television interviewer a week after the Apple fight broke out.Mr. Chertoff\u2019s firm also produced a 28-page report this year on the value of encryption, and its dealings with technology companies on security issues are extensive. Apple was also a corporate sponsor of a cybersecurity conference it hosted in October.Mr. Hayden has acknowledged that he might have come down differently in the Apple dispute when he was the head of the N.S.A. If faced with an unbreakable device, he might have gone straight to the budget office and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to need another $500 million because I\u2019m going to kick my way in,\u201d he told the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.Still, Mr. Hayden said in a telephone interview that his strong stance on encryption dated back years and was not influenced by his post-government work at the Chertoff Group.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have any relevance to what I think about this,\u201d he said. \u201cI answered this on its merits.\u201dMr. Chertoff was traveling and unavailable for comment, the Chertoff Group said. The firm declined to discuss its financial dealings with Apple.But Mr. Chertoff acknowledged in a panel discussion last month that during his time inside the government, there were situations in which \u201cI knew I had to move heaven and earth\u201d to find out where a threat was coming from. His current focus on encryption, he said, is complementary to that previous stance on security and not contradictory.The encryption debate erupted in February after the F.B.I. said it needed Apple\u2019s technical help to get into the iPhone used by Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the San Bernardino attackers.Initially, the F.B.I. appeared poised to win the battle for public opinion. The attack, which killed 14 people, was the worst terrorist strike on American soil since the Sept. 11 attacks. Mr. Farook was dead; the phone\u2019s owner \u2014 the county of San Bernardino, where he worked \u2014 had consented to the search; and the Justice Department had a court order to do it.With the F.B.I. still pushing to open other locked phones, Apple\u2019s backers are preparing for a long fight.Mr. Hayden, the former N.S.A. director, warned listeners last month at the American Enterprise Institute that the flare-up in the San Bernardino case was \u201cnot a one-and-done.\u201dEncryption is at the root of Internet communications, Mr. Hayden said, and \u201cthere is nothing we can do to stop that.\u201d His advice to his onetime government colleagues on the other side of the fight was simple: \u201cGet over it,\u201d he said.Kitty Bennett, Matt Apuzzo and Michael S.

{"Headline": "Taking Shelter in Old-School Dividend Stocks", "Date": "2016-04-09", "News": "Supported byOver the last several years, growth stocks, like Amazon and Netflix, have brought much momentum to the market. But in the first quarter, those kinds of stocks lost some of their sizzle, as old-school dividend payers came back into favor.That is where three of the quarter\u2019s top-performing mutual funds found some of their better stock picks.Cheapness is not enough, though. A company must also have a durable, defensible business and a burly balance sheet. That is not to say they avoid wading into situations that some investors might consider scary. Part of their strategy is to hunt in sectors where \u201cfear and anxiety\u201d have depressed prices, Mr. Sertl said.Thus, a couple of years ago, they bought gold-mining stocks \u2014 a first for their 10-year-old fund. \u201cGold and gold stocks went into a horrific bear market, and that\u2019s when we got involved,\u201d he said. \u201cGoldcorp peaked at $55 in 2011 and bottomed out in January at under $10.\u201d The stock ended up being one of the fund\u2019s better-performing holdings in the first quarter.A period of disfavor for media companies likewise drew the fund\u2019s managers into CBS and Time Warner shares, which also have done well lately. Some consumers have been dropping cable TV in favor of online video streaming, and media companies have responded by offering \u201cskinnier bundles\u201d of services and channels, Mr. Sertl said. That could mean less revenue, which has prompted some investors to scurry away. But Mr. Sertl said he and his colleagues believed that companies with popular programming, like CBS\u2019s sports broadcasts and the Time Warner division HBO, would continue to thrive.\u201cSome people say, \u2018Content is king,\u2019 and we believe that,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you have good content, you\u2019ll be able to monetize it.\u201dThe Artisan fund, whose investor shares have an expense ratio of 1 percent, returned 6.38 percent in the first quarter, compared with 1.35 percent for the S.&P. 500.The managers assemble the portfolio annually and replace a stock in the interim only if its yield falls below the median yield of the S.&P. 500 or if a company is taken over, Mr. Pettee said. Otherwise, they leave the holdings alone.\u201cA big part of our success is the fact that we reconstitute the fund only once a year,\u201d he said. \u201cThat cuts down on our opportunities to make mistakes.\u201dThe strategy has led to the fund owning an abundance of companies in traditional sectors like industrials and energy, and fewer in higher-flying ones like health care and information technology. But as tech companies mature, more of them are finding their way into the fund \u2014 and even more will most likely end up there in the future, Mr. Pettee said.\u201cThink about Apple,\u201d he said. \u201cIt declared a dividend in 2012, so it\u2019s now in my world. It didn\u2019t score well in our model \u2014 the valuation was too rich \u2014 so it\u2019s not in the portfolio. But I\u2019m looking forward to the day when I own Apple as a Dog of the Dow.\u201cMicrosoft was the Apple of the \u201980s, and in 2013, we bought it as a Dog of the Dow.\u201dThe SunAmerica fund, whose A shares have an expense ratio of 1.07 percent, returned 6.29 percent in the first quarter.Croci (pronounced \u201ccroaky\u201d) stands for \u201ccash return on capital invested,\u201d she said. That is a measure that Deutsche Asset Management, a division of Deutsche Bank, developed to compare stocks across industries and countries. It was conceived as an improvement over traditional measures like the price-to-earnings ratio, Ms. Kumble said.\u201cEarnings are based on accounting numbers,\u201d she said. But accounting rules can vary across industries and countries, making earnings and thus P/E ratios tough to compare. \u201cWith Croci, we make adjustments to transform accounting reports into economic values,\u201d she said.The fund\u2019s managers apply a series of screens to winnow their potential holdings from among large-cap domestic stocks.\u201cWe start with the S.&P. 500 and exclude financials and any stock that pays no dividend,\u201d Ms. Kumble said. The managers then seek stocks with low financial leverage and low price volatility as well as above-average dividend yields and low prices based on their proprietary calculations. All of the stocks they buy are given an equal weight in the portfolio, and they are rebalanced and, as needed, replaced quarterly.The methodology produces a portfolio that can yield picks that might seem surprising when viewed via traditional metrics.Consider Exxon Mobil and Coca-Cola, Ms. Kumble said. Back in 2013, Coke had a price-to-earnings ratio of 19, while Exxon\u2019s was 12. \u201cSo on the surface, Exxon was cheap,\u201d she said. \u201cBut our Croci economic P/E was higher for Exxon Mobil than Coke. So our methodology said Coke was actually the cheaper stock.\u201d The Croci approach made a number of adjustments, including, for example, counting Coke\u2019s advertising and brand as assets, which differs from the traditional approach, Ms. Kumble said.Coke was also among the fund\u2019s most recent reported holdings, though Exxon Mobil was not. Apple, too, was a holding.The Deutsche fund, with a net expense ratio of 1.08 percent, returned 6.45 percent in the first quarter.Advertisement"}

An app that lets random people call and wake you up. A bathroom scale that posts your weight on Twitter.And then there is Doug Evans\u2019s brainchild. With no experience running tech companies and a bungled juice-bar chain under his belt, he has extracted a remarkable $120 million in investments from Silicon Valley titans, including Google Ventures and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, and big companies like Campbell Soup.His pitch: a $700 machine that makes an eight-ounce glass of juice.Mr. Evans is a raw-food evangelist, although \u201coccasionally I eat steamed vegetables, to not be dogmatic,\u201d he said. He wears shoes made of hemp. But even as Silicon Valley retreats from its recent boom, this unlikely entrepreneur has persuaded top investors to throw their money at one of the most enigmatic start-ups in years.His company, Juicero, opens for business this week. But what is it?Is it a juice-ordering app? Is it just another kitchen-counter contraption? Or is it a 111,000-square-foot food-processing factory, staffed by dozens of hourly workers, washing and slicing up fruits and vegetables in Los Angeles?It is all of these things. \u201cIt\u2019s the most complicated business that I\u2019ve ever funded,\u201d said David Krane, a partner at GV, formerly Google Ventures. \u201cIt\u2019s software. It\u2019s consumer electronics. It\u2019s produce and packaging.\u201dMany of the tycoons who inhabit Silicon Valley are obsessed with health and longevity while harboring the conviction that technology can improve anything, even one of nature\u2019s most elementary foodstuffs \u2014 in this case, juice. And they believe that niche trends, if properly disrupted, can become billion-dollar markets. Juicero is the latest expression of these techno-utopian impulses.It is also the latest example of an unproven start-up raising enormous sums of money. Born in an earlier era in the Valley, the headier times of 18 months or so ago, Mr. Evans\u2019s idea captivated some of the industry\u2019s most ambitious investors. In today\u2019s more conservative financing environment, such a pitch might not get funded.No matter. In coming days, Juicero starts taking orders.The machine itself is a white plastic slab roughly the size of a food processor. To get some juice, you insert a pouch that resembles an IV bag and press a button. A couple of minutes later, a thin stream of vividly colored liquid squirts into a glass.For health nuts willing to pay a premium, Juicero promises the platonic ideal of juice. Plus, the machine never needs to be cleaned.But getting from farm to glass involves a daunting mix of hardware, code and food processing. The arrangement relies on a smartphone app, always-on Wi-Fi, QR codes, high-tech packaging and an army of workers slicing fruits and vegetables in very particular ways.Ultimately, however, what makes Juicero so special is not quantifiable by conventional science, said Mr. Evans, the founder and chief executive.\u201cNot all juice is equal,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do you measure life force? How do you measure chi?\u201dNearly as unlikely as Juicero itself is the man behind it. Mr. Evans trained as an Army paratrooper before joining a graphic design firm. His love affair with juice began in 1999, when he met Denise Mari, a vegan, at a nightclub. Soon he was dating Ms. Mari and converted to veganism, too.Hoping to create an eatery compatible with their strict dietary regimen, Mr. Evans and Ms. Mari bought some industrial-strength juicers and developed Organic Avenue, which sold $10 bottles of cold-pressed, unpasteurized juice and other vegan snacks.\u201cIt was a vision of a restaurant someone could go to where no animals were harmed, and no humans were harmed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was so magical to be able to have that. I was drinking several glasses of juice a day as my primary form of hydration.\u201dAfter the first store opened in 2006, the business grew quickly. But margins were persistently thin. New York real estate is expensive, and the inventory was perishable.\u201cWe were on the brink of insolvency,\u201d Mr. Evans said.In 2012, Mr. Evans and Ms. Mari, who are separated but remain friends, sold a majority interest in Organic Avenue to a private equity firm. Shortly after that, both were ousted. (The company was eventually sold to another private equity firm, which shuttered all the stores.)Upon being fired, Mr. Evans said, he had a problem. \u201cFor me, I was just wondering: How am I going to get my juice?\u201d he said.He bought every juicer he could find, but he was never satisfied. \u201cIt didn\u2019t have the magic that I was accustomed to.\u201dSo he resolved to create a miniaturized version of the industrial presses he had used at Organic Avenue. Working with freelance welders and machinists, he built prototypes in his Brooklyn kitchen. By 2013, he had a working model, albeit one that occasionally blew apart, sending pieces of metal and food scraps flying across the room.He approached Ms. Mari and some of the original backers of Organic Avenue, who invested enough money for him to keep going. \u201cThen I got an introduction to a partner at Kleiner Perkins through a vegan fashion designer who knew someone at the Humane Society who knew them,\u201d Mr. Evans said.The partner at Kleiner Perkins, Amol Deshpande, was a believer, and the firm agreed to invest an additional half-million dollars and incubate Juicero in Silicon Valley. Mr. Evans left Brooklyn, moved into temporary housing in a shopping center on Sand Hill Road and raised $16.5 million in Series A financing.With the extra money, Mr. Evans began hiring software engineers, mechanical engineers, food scientists and app developers. It wasn\u2019t long before Mr. Evans realized he needed still more money. The innards of the machine were complex but manageable. It was the software, the production facility, the electrical testing and a thousand other things that necessitated a bigger staff.\u201cI was just na\u00efve,\u201d Mr. Evans said. \u201cI was like Forrest Gump. I had no idea what it took to make a piece of hardware that could ship to consumers safely.\u201dSo in 2015, Juicero raised a $70 million Series B round. But even that was not enough. Mr. Evans is now raising more money, currently $28 million and counting.And cold-pressed juice, the variety that Mr. Evans is hoping to capitalize on, has had a minor renaissance in recent years. Suja, a San Diego company, is selling bottles across the country, including in Costco, for as little as $3.50 each. In 2011, Starbucks acquired Evolution Fresh, and now sells cold-pressed juice in its thousands of coffee shops.\u201cJust five years ago, cold-pressed juice was a niche trend, popular only with health fanatics,\u201d Andrew Alvarez, an analyst with IBISWorld, a market research firm, wrote in a recent report. Now though, it \u201chas hit the mainstream and given rise to hundreds of new juice bars, typically selling juice at higher price points.\u201dStill, there are signs that juice mania may have peaked. Last year, retail juice sales in the United States declined by 2 percent from 2014, according to Euromonitor International, another market research firm. Sales of home juicers were down 6 percent in the United States last year.There are also health concerns. One reason sales have been falling, analysts believe, is that people are increasingly worried about sugar, even the naturally occurring kinds.Finally, there are the environmental questions about the single-serve model pioneered by coffee companies such as Keurig and Nespresso, which creates a throwaway container with each serving. Every glass of Juicero juice needs its own pack, which is shipped from Los Angeles to the customer, although Mr. Evans said he was developing a compostable pack.To succeed, Juicero will have to buck these trends, and also clear a more pedestrian hurdle \u2014 persuading people to pay a premium for another kitchen doodad. \u201cSeven hundred dollars for a small cooking appliance is extremely high,\u201d said Virginia Lee, beverage analyst for Euromonitor. \u201cThere are a lot of appliances competing for counter space, never mind the wallet.\u201dExpensive as it is, what Mr. Evans has packed into that counter space is rather remarkable. Inside the machine is a series of gears and metal plates that exert 8,000 pounds of pressure on packs of chopped fruits and vegetables.To make a glass of juice, you insert a pack ($4 to $10 each) into the machine, close the door and press a button. There are five flavors, including Sweet Roots (carrot, beet, orange, lemon and apple) and Spicy Greens (pineapple, romaine, celery, cucumber, spinach, parsley and jalape\u00f1o).Each pack has a QR code on it. A camera in the machine scans the code on each pack and, using Wi-Fi, checks in with an online database. If the pack is no longer fresh, or has been deemed contaminated, the machine won\u2019t press it. If the pack is O.K., the gears start turning and out squirts the juice.So far, so complicated. But the real logistical feat is behind the scenes. To create those packs in the Los Angeles plant, workers receive truckloads of produce from nearby organic farms, triple-wash it, then chop it into specific shapes (carrots are finely diced, while beets are chunkier).A specialized machine then fills each pack. The packs are then sent by FedEx to users, who order them using Juicero\u2019s smartphone app.Mr. Evans and his investors speak of Juicero being a \u201cplatform\u201d for a new paradigm of food delivery. And they speak of commercial sales. Already, chain restaurants including Le Pain Quotidien have agreed to use Juicero. The hope is that bigger companies will put machines in their office kitchens, too.At this point, however, the investors betting millions don\u2019t have any sales data to reassure them. Instead, they have little more than Mr. Evans\u2019s enthusiasm for juice. He drinks it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. He is so committed to a largely liquid diet that he rarely consumes water.\u201cOrganic cold-pressed juice is rainwater filtered through the soil and the roots and the stems and the plants,\u201d he said. \u201cYou extract the water molecules, the chlorophyll, the anthocyanin and the flavonoids and the micronutrients. You\u2019re getting this living nutrition. It\u2019s like drinking the nectar of the earth.\u201dBut do other people have such refined palates when it comes to juice? Will those who don\u2019t subsist entirely on raw produce be able to tell a difference between organic and nonorganic fruit, as Mr. Evans claims to do? Even if they can, what will they be willing to pay for the privilege of consuming it in their own kitchens? After all, this is a machine that won\u2019t make a glass of carrot juice if your Wi-Fi is down.An article last Sunday about Juicero, a Silicon Valley company that has developed a $700 cold-press juicer as well as packaged ingredients for it, described the Tovala, another high-tech kitchen appliance, incorrectly. It is a programmable oven that can bake, broil, steam or heat by convection in any sequence. It is not a combination microwave/toaster.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Opens Another iPhone, This Time With the Keycode", "Date": "2016-04-22", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Justice Department said Friday night that it had gained access on its own to a locked iPhone used by a Brooklyn drug dealer, the second time in less than a month that it had unlocked such a device after initially insisting it could do so only with Apple\u2019s help.In a short letter to a federal judge in the Eastern District of New York, prosecutors said that an unidentified person had given the phone\u2019s passcode to investigators. The Brooklyn phone had become the latest battleground in the fight between Apple and the Justice Department over issues of privacy and security.Last month, in a higher-profile case that set off a national debate, prosecutors dropped their demand that Apple develop software to unlock an iPhone used by one of the attackers in the San Bernardino, Calif., rampage in December. The F.B.I. unlocked that phone after paying an outside party to demonstrate how to do so.In the Brooklyn case, the drug dealer\u2019s phone was running an older operating system that lacks the encryption features of the San Bernardino phone, so unlocking that device would involve much less technical sophistication even without the passcode.Apple had voluntarily helped prosecutors unlock phones in some 70 earlier cases involving phones with the older operating systems, but it changed its stance last fall and began challenging the Justice Department\u2019s legal authority to use a 1789 statute called the All Writs Act to force its technical assistance in such cases.Prosecutors had said for months that they needed Apple to provide what amounted to a technical passkey to the Brooklyn phone because the owner, a confessed methamphetamine dealer named Jun Feng, claimed to have forgotten the passcode.That changed on Thursday evening, when someone gave the government the passcode, prosecutors said in the letter to the court. Officials would not say whether it was Mr. Feng or someone close to him who provided the passcode.\u201cBecause we now have access to the data we sought, we notified the court of this recent development and have withdrawn our request for assistance,\u201d said Emily Pierce, a Justice Department spokeswoman. \u201cThis is an ongoing investigation and therefore we are not revealing the identity of the individual.\u201dApple, which declined to comment on Friday, has raised similar objections to unlocking iPhones in a Boston case and in at least several dozen others elsewhere, most of which are under court seal.Alex Abdo, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, which has supported Apple in the recent encryption fights, said that the latest development in Brooklyn was \u201cvery welcome news.\u201d\u201cThis is a debate that should be had in Congress before asking the courts to weigh in,\u201d he said. \u201cThat will be better for everyone\u2019s digital security.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But he added that \u201cwe have not shared the solution with Apple to date.\u201dFor weeks, law enforcement officials have played down expectations about what might be found in the phone, which was used last year by Syed Rizwan Farook before he and his wife carried out the California attack, in which 14 people were killed.Mr. Farook and his wife destroyed several other mobile devices, and it was seen as unlikely that he would keep sensitive information related to the December attack on an intact phone issued to him by the San Bernardino County government.Investigators have hoped that the phone might help them answer two lingering questions: where the couple went in the minutes after the shooting, and whether any unidentified people in the United States or overseas may have been involved in the plot.\u201cIf there\u2019s more information in the phone \u2014 more contacts, more communications, more of anything \u2014 that\u2019s a success for the F.B.I.,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Yahoo\u2019s Suitors Uncover Few Financial Details", "Date": "2016-04-14", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 As Yahoo prepares to accept first-round bids for its core Internet business on Monday, potential buyers have found themselves facing one big problem: How do you value a company with a declining business when the company appears reluctant to share vital financial details?But several big companies are expected to place bids for Yahoo anyway, according to people briefed on the matter. Verizon Communications, which has publicly expressed interest in buying Yahoo\u2019s core Internet business and merging it with its AOL division, plans to press forward with a bid, some of these people said.The Daily Mail, a British tabloid newspaper and website, said publicly that it had considered joining with potential investors, including one or more private equity firm, for a bid. And the private equity firm TPG plans to make a bid in the first round on its own, according to a person briefed on the matter.Yet other huge companies plan to sit out the bidding. Google, which competes with Yahoo on search and display advertising and has a search partnership with the company, considered making an offer, but is unlikely to proceed because it fears any deal would draw stiff antitrust scrutiny, according to people briefed on the company\u2019s thinking.Other notable businesses, including AT&T, CBS and the investment firms Silver Lake, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and General Atlantic, are unlikely to bid, according to others briefed on their plans. And SoftBank, the Japanese telecommunications giant that controls Yahoo Japan, does not plan to bid despite press reports to the contrary.A 90-slide presentation shown to potential Yahoo bidders is dense with figures, but even people familiar with the company\u2019s operations have struggled to make sense of them. At the same time, Yahoo devoted just a couple of slides to important strategies, like its costly Hail Mary project to create an entirely new mobile search experience to leapfrog competitors like Google, Apple and Amazon.Representatives of Verizon, Google, AT&T and CBS declined to comment. A Yahoo spokeswoman also declined to comment on the sales process.Marissa Mayer, Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, is expected to face questions about the bidding on Tuesday, when the company reports its latest quarterly earnings. The report should offer a window into how Yahoo is weathering the upheaval caused by the layoff of 15 percent of its work force announced in February. The total value of Yahoo shares is now about $35 billion.The company may also disclose sales of patents and real estate, which it began shopping a couple of months ago in the hope of raising $1 billion to $3 billion.One reason for Yahoo\u2019s reluctance to share information may be that the business is worse than the company has publicly disclosed. That has added to confusion regarding the intentions of a board of directors that, just a few months ago, publicly said it had no intention of selling.Ms. Mayer has often said she wants to make Yahoo services a \u201cdaily habit\u201d for Internet users. But after nearly four years of effort, only about 10 percent of the one billion monthly visitors to Yahoo sites return every day, suggesting little attachment to the brand, according to people who have seen confidential internal data. At Facebook, by comparison, 65 percent of users visit daily.Yahoo is in a difficult position. Ms. Mayer\u2019s four-year turnaround effort has failed to deliver significant improvements at a company that has been in decline for a decade. Ms. Mayer argues that she is turning the tide with new investments in areas like video and native advertising.Activist investors, led by the Starboard Value hedge fund, have run out of patience and are pressing the board to sell the core business, separating it from the company\u2019s far more valuable investment stakes in Alibaba, China\u2019s leading e-commerce company, and Yahoo Japan, a separate, publicly traded company.Yahoo\u2019s board, which spent more than a year working on other plans to separate the investment stakes, reluctantly agreed to explore a sale of all or parts of the company and hired three investment banking firms to run the process. Starboard has formally threatened a proxy fight to replace the entire board at the next shareholder meeting if the directors do not follow through on a sale.Ms. Mayer has publicly laid out a path for an independent Yahoo and made the case to potential bidders that they should retain her as chief to carry out the plan.Abandoning previous forays into video and digital magazines, Ms. Mayer, who formerly headed search at Google, is now focused on returning Yahoo to its glory days as a search engine. Although comScore says that Yahoo is currently the No. 3 player in desktop searches, behind Google and Microsoft, Ms. Mayer argues that Yahoo can leap ahead through a \u201ccomplete reimagination of mobile search.\u201dMs. Mayer has assigned about 1,000 people to search products, or about 10 percent of the company\u2019s staff, according to people briefed on the business. The mobile effort, code-named Project Index, has officially been underway for two years and aims to create a search tool similar to Google Now on Android phones, Apple\u2019s Siri, Microsoft\u2019s Cortana and Amazon\u2019s Alexa.But the team has little to show for its work, and many at Yahoo wonder whether it is a hopeless quest. Industry experts as well as Yahoo insiders say that without the location and personal data that Apple and Google have, Yahoo will have a difficult time predicting what people want with enough accuracy to get them to switch from other services.As Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, Ms. Mayer acquired more than 20 companies, but ultimately struggled to turn around the web pioneer.\u201cThere is a massive opportunity for mobile search,\u201d said Keith Rabois, a partner at Khosla Ventures, who invests in search start-ups. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think Yahoo has the core assets or skills you would need to succeed or thrive right now.\u201dA Yahoo spokesman said that the company was exploring many search ideas, including the use of software bots that would fetch information on behalf of users.Ms. Mayer\u2019s vague plans for reversing Yahoo\u2019s decline, along with the lack of disclosure about the company\u2019s finances, have made prospective bidders nervous.Though several private equity firms have been looking at the company, people involved in the bidding process said that they were unlikely to prevail against a determined corporate buyer.Verizon is viewed by analysts as the leading bidder for Yahoo, but its likely offer comes despite trepidation among its executives, according to the people briefed on the bidding.Verizon is still struggling to digest its $4.4 billion acquisition last year of AOL, and some executives worry that buying Yahoo would simply be doubling down on integration troubles.Verizon could certainly combine the content properties and ad products and networks run by Yahoo and AOL.The company, with more than 112 million cellphone customers on top of its landline Internet subscribers, would have the ability to preinstall Yahoo services and distribute them widely.However, the contracts governing Apple iPhones and phones running Google\u2019s Android operating system generally restrict what phone carriers can do to promote alternatives for major services like search and email. So Yahoo would still need to build products good enough to persuade people to switch.Wall Street is hoping for a quick sale, to anybody, at any reasonable price.\u201cWe continue to believe that one of the greatest risks in the stock is the core being a \u2018melting ice cube,\u2019 as a prolonged sale process draws on, creating questions for employees, advertisers and partners,\u201d wrote Robert Peck, an analyst with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, on Wednesday.Because of an editing error, an article on Friday about Yahoo\u2019s reluctance to share financial details with prospective buyers misstated the amount the company hoped to raise by selling patents and real estate. The amount is $1 billion to $3 billion, not $1 billion to $35 billion.Conor Dougherty contributed reporting from San Francisco, and Emily Steel from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Services Shut Down in China in Startling About-Face", "Date": "2016-04-21", "News": "Supported byFor years, there has been a limit to the success of American technology companies in China. Capture too much market share or wield too much influence, and Beijing will push back.Apple has largely been an exception to that trend. Yet the Silicon Valley company is now facing a regulatory push against its services in China that could signal its good relations in the country may be turning.Last week, Apple\u2019s iBooks Store and iTunes Movies were shut down in China, just six months after they were started there. Initially, Apple apparently had the government\u2019s approval to introduce the services. But then a regulator, the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television, asserted its authority and demanded the closings, according to two people who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\u201cWe hope to make books and movies available again to our customers in China as soon as possible,\u201d an Apple spokeswoman said in a statement.China\u2019s pushback against Apple shows that the company may finally be vulnerable to the heightened scrutiny that other American tech companies have faced in recent years. That scrutiny was spurred by revelations from the former United States National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden in 2013 of the use of American companies to conduct cyberespionage for Washington.China has sweeping goals in its move against Apple, said Daniel H. Rosen, founding partner of Rhodium Group, a New-York based advisory firm specializing in the Chinese economy.\u201cThey are interested in protecting the content that the Chinese people see, policing its national security and favoring indigenous giants such as Huawei, Alibaba and Tencent,\u201d Mr. Rosen said. In this new era, he added, China \u201cis strongly disinclined to accept the dominance of foreign players on the Internet, not least those from the United States.\u201dAfter the shutdown of Apple\u2019s services, President Xi Jinping of China, who has led a crackdown on Western ideology, conducted a meeting on Tuesday in Beijing on China\u2019s restrictive Internet policies. China\u2019s top tech leaders, including Jack Ma, chairman of the e-commerce company Alibaba, and Ren Zhengfei, head of Huawei, were present at the meeting.\u201cChina must improve management of cyberspace and work to ensure high-quality content with positive voices creating a healthy, positive culture that is a force for good,\u201d a report by the state-run news service Xinhua quoted Mr. Xi as saying.Since the Snowden leaks, China\u2019s state media identified eight American companies that it has labeled guardian warriors and that it has said were too deeply established in the country\u2019s core industries such as energy, communications, education and military.Though Apple is one of the eight, it has had a much easier time.There have been some signs of trouble ahead. Mr. Xi has presided over a deep freeze on the Internet, increasing censorship and taking aim at online tools used to circumvent China\u2019s system of online filters, known as the Great Firewall. He has also added new policy tools to keep tabs on electronic communications. Mr. Xi heads a committee of top leaders set up to streamline tech and Internet policy and turn the country into a \u201ccyberpower.\u201dIn addition, the Chinese government proposed an antiterrorism law two years ago that would require foreign companies to turn over encryption keys \u2014 the codes that enable otherwise-scrambled information to be viewed \u2014 for security reasons. Though the language was ultimately dropped, analysts said the government wants to have access to all communications within China.The two Apple services that Chinese regulators shut down, iTunes Movies and the iBooks Store, compete directly with Chinese Internet companies\u2019 products. Beijing has recently added initiatives to support a sputtering economy with new emphasis on industries that require higher skills and command better profit margins, like the Internet.That push may eventually trickle down to other Apple services. Apple Pay, for example, competes with mobile payments systems from some of China\u2019s largest Internet companies: Alibaba and Tencent.In the longer term, China\u2019s tough line on foreign tech companies like Apple could have heavy consequences for the Chinese economy, Mr. Rosen said.\u201cAs surely as the tremendous welfare gains for China and its people from deepening links to global tech production, disassembling those connections is likely to entail a heavy economic loss,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why We Are Still Reaching for Wallets, Not Phones, at the Checkout", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported bySammy Yuen, a graphic designer who lives on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, was standing in line at Whole Foods Market one morning waiting to pay. He used the Starbucks app on his phone to order coffee in advance and then bought his Whole Foods items with Apple Pay by holding the phone in front of the register.Using his phone in these ways has become a routine for Mr. Yuen. \u201cWherever I can use it, I do use it,\u201d he said.But Mr. Yuen is very much the exception.Banks, technology companies and retailers are spending large sums to build systems and apps so that people can pay for items with their phones in stores, where most retail spending still takes place. The hope is that phones will make payments more efficient and give banks and retailers new data on their customers\u2019 shopping habits. Phone and software makers, including Apple, Google and Samsung, are getting involved in mobile payments to make their products more useful and attractive to their owners.Behind all this is the belief that consumers will discover the benefits of paying with their phones \u2014 and then use them more often as a payment method.Yet this is happening slowly.A tiny percentage of in-store sales are made with phones. In the United States, an estimated $8.7 billion in purchases were made with phones in 2015, according to a survey by eMarketer, a research firm. That is a mere 0.2 percent of the estimated $4.35 trillion of in-store sales last year. Excluding purchases made with a wildly popular app by Starbucks, the amount of mobile payments would most likely be well below that $8.7 billion, payment industry experts say.Other customers coming out of Whole Foods that morning gave several reasons for not paying with their phones. Most were concerned about the security of the transactions \u2014 or of losing their phones and having other people get access to their financial data.They also doubted phones were much faster than credit or debit cards. Even Mr. Yuen said, \u201cI still think that swiping is faster.\u201dApple said the usage of Apple Pay accelerated significantly in the second half of 2015, compared with the first half of that year. The company did not define how it was measuring usage.Large numbers of consumers don\u2019t appear to be making frequent use of the other payment apps, either. Part of the problem may be that many apps are simultaneously vying for consumers\u2019 attention, keeping one from becoming dominant, at least for now.Confronted by the low enthusiasm for mobile payments, companies are looking for ways to generate some excitement.Samsung has taken a technological step that substantially increases the number of places where its service, Samsung Pay, can be used. Many phone payment methods require the technology near-field communication. But it does not exist on older payment terminals that read a card\u2019s magnetic strip. Samsung Pay, however, can be used on both types of terminals. Rival mobile payment services from Apple and Android do not work on the older technology.As a result, Samsung Pay can be used in more places, according to Thomas Ko, Samsung Pay\u2019s global co-general manager. \u201cTruly, you don\u2019t have to carry your wallet anymore,\u201d he said.But that advantage may not last, as the number of near-field communication terminals grows.Companies might also try to increase adoption by underscoring the ways in which paying by phone can be more secure than using a card. Thumbprint authentication and passcodes can make it almost impossible for a thief to use a stolen phone to pay for something.By contrast, a stolen credit card, or information from the card, can be easily misused until the theft is suspected or reported.But because card users generally do not have to pay fraudulent charges, the more secure nature of phones may not ultimately be the big draw that leads consumers to use them more for payments.Another way to increase use might be to make paying with a phone far quicker than using a card. Services like Apple Pay are designed to be fast. But at some stores, the customer still has to sign when using such services. And even when that isn\u2019t the case, taking out a phone and making a payment is probably not that much faster than using a card.Many payments specialists say they believe that for mobile payments systems to take off, they have to reduce costs for retailers. Seeing the savings, retailers may then offer their customers benefits for using their phones to pay, like rewards programs. Such a program has been one reason for the runaway popularity of the Starbucks payment app. And once consumers see real benefits from paying with their phones, they may finally turn to their phones a lot more at the checkout.That is why many payments experts are waiting to see what happens with JPMorgan Chase\u2019s digital wallet, called Chase Pay, which the bank aims to offer this year. JPMorgan has payments relationships with a wide range of merchants, which, the bank hopes, will give Chase Pay critical mass with both retailers and customers.Still, shoppers\u2019 infrequent use of mobile payments does not bode well. Credit and debit cards have drawbacks, but are easy to carry and generally quick to use. What\u2019s more, they don\u2019t have batteries that run out during a shopping trip. \u201cWhat happens if my phone dies?\u201d said Tyriek Good, a resident of Harlem, as he came out of Whole Foods last month. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get used to this.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the technology used by older payment terminals. Older terminals used magnetic strip readers, not magnetic secure transmission, which is recent technology that allows Samsung Pay to work with older payment terminals.Advertisement"}

A used PlayStation, for example, would be checked for every component, from the disc-loading tray to the laser that reads the games.

To see whether such stigma is warranted, I compared the pre-owned products programs of three retailers: Amazon, GameStop and Gazelle. My takeaway is that you can buy pre-owned products from reputable brands with as much confidence as you might buy a used car from a certified dealer.Glenn Ramsdell, director of Amazon\u2019s Warehouse Deals, said every item was checked by hand for its physical and functional condition. A wireless speaker, for example, would be tested for its connectivity features and checked for included accessories; repairs are made if necessary.Then the items get a grade. \u201cLike new\u201d means it was probably untouched and in perfect condition; \u201cvery good\u201d describes an item that was well cared for and lightly used; a \u201cgood\u201d item might show signs of wear and tear but works perfectly; and \u201cacceptable\u201d would be something that has cosmetic issues like scratches and dents but otherwise works.Dave Maquera, the president of Gazelle, said that similar to the inspection programs used by certified pre-owned car dealers, Gazelle\u2019s process creates a new level of confidence in buying used phones and computers. Though he declined to provide specific numbers, he noted that sales of used devices to consumers had jumped a double-digit percentage compared to last year.At GameStop, the product testing gets intense. Mr. Kulp, the supply chain executive, said the company takes up to 100 game consoles a month, refurbishes them and puts them through stress tests, running them for thousands of hours to see if its repairs are long-lasting. These test units are never sold to consumers.\u201cIt\u2019s just like the way a car company would do a crash test,\u201d he said.As for used video games, the company buffs out any light scratches from the discs, but if the game is so deeply scratched that it becomes unplayable, it heads to the shredder.The trade-offs for buying used games at GameStop are fairly obvious. For one, after a new game releases, you will have to wait awhile to buy it used: In other words, you will be a late adopter. For another, the product will probably lack its original packaging and there might be light cosmetic wear. But for the average consumer, all that matters is that your gaming experience will be exactly the same as if you had bought the product new.What if something goes wrong? Amazon and GameStop give customers 30 days to return used products, the same amount of time they allow for returns of new products. Gazelle offers a free 30-day warranty for each device and the option to buy an extended warranty.Consumers should always consider checking out the used section of retailers for most electronics, including smartphones, laptops and desktop computers, said Dr. Mars of the Sustainability Consortium. In my personal experience buying used video games, computers and even home gadgets like vacuum cleaners from GameStop, Gazelle and Amazon, I have never regretted buying used items.But Dr. Mars said to beware of buying used televisions and computer monitors, since a lot more can go wrong with larger screens than with computer equipment. The jury is also still out on buying used wearable devices like Fitbit trackers because they make up a fairly new category, she added.\u201cTurn over that old device so that somebody can get a second life out of it,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for it to go into a drawer.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S. Presses Bid to Force Apple to Unlock iPhone in New York", "Date": "2016-04-08", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 With the legal battle over one iPhone now behind them, lawyers for the Justice Department and Apple resumed their sparring in another case on Friday, as prosecutors told a federal judge in Brooklyn that they still needed the company\u2019s help to unlock a drug dealer\u2019s iPhone.While prosecutors described the demand in the Brooklyn case as routine, Apple said it reflected an attempt by the government to establish a precedent that could help unlock dozens or even hundreds of other phones.Indeed, a judge in yet another case revolving around a locked iPhone \u2014 one in Boston involving a violent gang conspiracy \u2014 has directed Apple to help the Federal Bureau of Investigation extract data from the phone, according to documents unsealed on Friday.The cases in Brooklyn and Boston represent the latest battlegrounds in the unusually prominent dispute between the government and Apple over the F.B.I.\u2019s difficulties in breaking into encrypted phones.The Justice Department said it was proceeding with its appeal of a February ruling that rejected its demand for Apple\u2019s assistance in the Brooklyn case, even after the F.B.I. managed in recent weeks to unlock, without the company\u2019s help, an iPhone used by one of the attackers in the December terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif.\u201cThe government\u2019s application is not moot and the government continues to require Apple\u2019s assistance in accessing the data that it is authorized to search by warrant,\u201d prosecutors said.Emily Pierce, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, said the technological solution found in the San Bernardino case would not work to get into the phone of the Brooklyn drug dealer, which has a different operating system.\u201cIn this case, we still need Apple\u2019s help in accessing the data, which they have done with little effort in at least 70 other cases when presented with court orders for comparable phones running iOS 7 or earlier operating systems,\u201d she said.Apple\u2019s lawyers are skeptical of the F.B.I.\u2019s claims that it cannot simply use the San Bernardino method to get into the Brooklyn phone.In a stinging rebuke five weeks ago, however, Magistrate Judge James Orenstein said in a 50-page ruling that the Justice Department had overstepped its authority in trying to use a 1789 statute called the All Writs Act to compel Apple\u2019s cooperation.The technology company has been locked in a major legal battle against law enforcement officials over privacy and security.Apple had previously agreed without objection to help unlock dozens of phones in federal investigations, but it changed its position late last year, saying that the F.B.I.\u2019s demands could cause \u201creputational harm\u201d as it promotes the security of its devices.An Apple lawyer said the company was disappointed but not surprised by the government\u2019s decision to press ahead in Brooklyn.The lawyer, who spoke to reporters on the condition of anonymity because of company policy, argued that prosecutors were pushing the case not because of the value of the information in the phone, but rather to set a precedent that could be used to get into other locked iPhones.A ruling in the government\u2019s favor in the Federal District Court in Brooklyn would not be binding in other cases, but if it were appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and upheld there, it would become precedent for other federal courts in the region.Justice Department lawyers point to Apple\u2019s past cooperation in arguing that it should be compelled to unlock Mr. Feng\u2019s phone. But Joseph DeMarco, a former prosecutor who is not involved in the case, said that alone would not be enough to overturn Judge Orenstein\u2019s order.\u201cApple can still argue that it doesn\u2019t have to comply with this order,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that it has done so before is relevant but not, as a technical matter, legally binding.\u201dThe method used by the F.B.I. to get into the San Bernardino phone has been a topic of furious speculation at Apple and among encryption experts.The Apple lawyer said on Friday that the company had decided not to sue the F.B.I. to find out how it got into the phone, in part because Apple\u2019s regular product updates would probably give the method a short shelf life.The company works constantly to find and fix vulnerabilities, and its lawyers said they were confident that it would render useless the tool used by the F.B.I. in the San Bernardino case, even if it never knew for sure the method involved.The company\u2019s lawyers plan to argue that the San Bernardino phone used a new operating system and was much harder to break into than the phone in the Brooklyn case would be. With a higher bar set, the company will question why the government cannot turn to the same marketplace of technicians that helped it crack the San Bernardino phone.Apple executives, including Timothy D. Cook, the chief, argue that Congress, not the courts, should set broad policies on investigators\u2019 access to encrypted data.But many officials in Washington doubt that a divided Congress will be able to reach agreement on such a complicated issue, and the draft bill drew quick protests even before its release, with the American Civil Liberties Union calling it \u201ca clear threat to everyone\u2019s privacy and security.\u201dEric Lichtblau reported from Washington and Katie Benner from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cloud Services Show Their Value in Earnings Reports", "Date": "2016-04-29", "News": "Supported byBitsThe star of the show was Amazon Web Services, or AWS, that cloud business. Amazon breaks out that sector from the rest of its business, and it makes for impressive reading: Operating income as a percentage of sales for Amazon\u2019s retail business was 3 percent; for AWS it was 24 percent.AWS is still a relatively small part of the company\u2019s total business, but that outsize profitability is reshaping Amazon. Over all, the company\u2019s operating income is 3.6 percent of revenue, but that is up from 1.1 percent a year ago. A big reason is that AWS has doubled its profitability.Cloud computing makes a lot of money in part by automating things: A large data center, supplying potentially thousands of customers, may be run by just a half-dozen people. The people engineering these systems have become very clever about running them efficiently too, devising special semiconductors and software.Google and Facebook are also cloud-based companies, though for now they get most of their money from advertising.As we near the end of the tech earnings season, it is useful to look at net income earned per employee at the company. Microsoft had profits of about $32,200 per person in the quarter, a healthy performance considering how many employees it still has in older businesses. It came in just ahead of Goldman Sachs, on a profit per employee basis.There are two lessons from that: If you do sell retail products, it helps to sell highly profitable fetish objects, like iPhones \u2014 which, not incidentally, have a lot of value because of the cloud-based apps running on them.And if you are selling bargain retail, it\u2019s a very good idea to be in the cloud computing business, too.Advertisement"}

Previously, only one-to-one text messages were fully encrypted.\u201cFortunately, end-to-end encryption protects us from these vulnerabilities,\u201d the company said.The government has faced similar issues with companies like Telegram, Signal and Wickr Me, messaging services that also offer encrypted communications.The debate over access to digital data erupted in February when a federal court in California ordered Apple to help crack open an iPhone used by a gunman in the San Bernardino, Calif., rampage last year. Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, resisted the order, saying that the company needed to protect individuals\u2019 privacy. Law enforcement officials, including the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, have criticized encryption as a hindrance to investigations, including in terrorism cases.End-to-end encryption for WhatsApp is of particular concern to the F.B.I., considering the service\u2019s huge subscriber base and large international footprint. With increasing amounts of communications now sent across messaging services, encrypted texts, video, photos and the like may end up being more problematic for law enforcement than locked devices. The encryption on WhatsApp will be turned on by default, so users will not be required to enable it themselves.In the United States, the Justice Department has been discussing how to proceed in a continuing criminal investigation in which a federal judge approved a wiretap, but investigators were stymied by WhatsApp\u2019s encryption.Advertisement"}

Director Suggests Bill for iPhone Hacking Topped $1.3 Million", "Date": "2016-04-21", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The director of the F.B.I. suggested Thursday that his agency paid at least $1.3 million to an undisclosed group to help hack into the encrypted iPhone used by an attacker in the mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif.At a conference on global security in London, a moderator asked James B. Comey Jr., the F.B.I. chief, how much bureau officials had to pay the undisclosed outside group to demonstrate how to bypass the phone\u2019s encryption.\u201cA lot,\u201d Mr. Comey said, as audience members at the Aspen Institute event laughed.He continued: \u201cLet\u2019s see, more than I will make in the remainder of this job, which is seven years and four months, for sure.\u201dThe F.B.I. had been unwilling to say anything at all until Thursday about how much it paid for what has become one of the world\u2019s most publicized hacking jobs, so Mr. Comey\u2019s cryptic comments about his own wages and the bounty quickly sent listeners scurrying in search of their calculators.The F.B.I. director makes about $185,100 a year \u2014 so Mr. Comey stands to earn at least $1.35 million at that base rate of pay for the remainder of his 10-year term.The F.B.I. declined to confirm or deny Thursday whether the bureau had in fact paid at least $1.3 million for the hacking, and it declined to elaborate on Mr. Comey\u2019s suggestive remarks.But that price tag, if confirmed, appears in line with what other companies have offered for identifying iOS vulnerabilities.Zerodium, a security firm in Washington that collects and then sells such bugs, said last fall that it would pay $1 million for weaknesses in Apple\u2019s iOS 9 operating system. Hackers eventually claimed that bounty. The iPhone used by the San Bernardino gunman ran iOS 9.\u201cA number of factors go into pricing these bounties,\u201d said Alex Rice, the co-founder of the security start-up HackerOne CTO, who also started Facebook\u2019s bug bounty program. Mr. Rice said that the highest premiums were paid when the buyer didn\u2019t intend to disclose the flaw to a party that could fix it.\u201cThe cost of keeping a flaw secret is high,\u201d Mr. Rice said. He added that buyers like Zerodium\u2019s customers and the government might not work to fix problems.When companies run bug bounty programs, they may pay about $100,000 to hackers that show them system vulnerabilities that must be fixed. \u201cWhen you sell at a high price, you have to be O.K. with the possibility that the person you sold the flaw to could do something bad with it,\u201d Mr. Rice said.While Mr. Comey\u2019s remarks appeared to address the lingering mystery of how much the F.B.I. paid to get into the San Bernardino phone, he said nothing that would indicate the actual identity of the outside group behind the hacking. Some media reports have named an Israeli software company that might have helped the F.B.I., but numerous law enforcement officials have said that company was not involved.After an intense courtroom fight in Southern California, the F.B.I. disclosed three weeks ago that it had managed to get access to the data inside an iPhone 5c used by Syed Farook, one of the attackers in the San Bernardino rampage, which killed 14 people, by paying the outside group.The Justice Department had gone to court to try to force Apple to develop a new operating system to allow access into the encrypted phone, setting off an intense national debate about privacy versus national security. But it withdrew its case after the outside party came to the F.B.I. and demonstrated a way around the phone\u2019s internal defenses, which would have destroyed the data inside after 10 failed password attempts and would have meant longer and longer intervals in between guesses.With those mechanisms disabled, the F.B.I. was able to use what is called a brute force attack \u2014 using computers to guess vast numbers of password combinations at once \u2014 in order to get inside the phone.But the Justice Department is still trying to force Apple in court to help unlock encrypted phones in Brooklyn, Boston and elsewhere.Because of an editing error, the homepage and mobile headlines on an earlier version of this article incorrectly reported the estimated cost of the iPhone hacking. It was $1.3 million, not $1.3 billion. An earlier version also misstated the focus of a conference in London, where James B. Comey Jr., the F.B.I. chief, was asked how much bureau officials had to pay the undisclosed outside group to demonstrate how to bypass the phone\u2019s encryption. It was a global security conference, not a technology conference.Eric Lichtblau reported from Washington and Katie Benner from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

While this means putting more of ourselves inside the machine, Google argues that its method is more efficient.The product, called Goals, works like this: Inside the online calendar, people choose from a menu of goals like \u201cexercise,\u201d \u201cme time\u201d or \u201cskill building.\u201d The software then asks for some specifics, like how often a person wants to run, for what duration and typically when in the day.It then scours the white spaces in a calendar for possible times and maps out a schedule, filling those times with the desired aspiration. Afterward, the goal can be marked completed or not, which helps the algorithm work out a better schedule over time.Along with Goals, Google is introducing a calendar feature that enables two people in the same company to find mutually convenient meeting times, by enabling a software \u201cagent\u201d to scour both datebooks and pick an optimal time.Not coincidentally, Google\u2019s calendar features are something of a riposte to competitors like Apple, Microsoft and Facebook, which have been getting into the life management business.Presumably, friends\u2019 encouragement programs people to stay with a goal. Artificial intelligence, or A.I., software that behaves socially aims to do the same.Sherry Turkle, who studies the social effects of technology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the Google calendar software appeared to be a promising alternative to the more seemingly \u201chuman\u201d software agents, which she worries can diminish authentic human interactions.\u201cToo often we\u2019re cheap dates that fall for programs that pretend to know us, or ask about our emotional states,\u201d Ms. Turkle said. \u201cThis is harnessing the calendar to make an aspiration real.

Last year Google bought Timeful, a scheduling company where he worked.Google, which is increasingly trying to move from Internet search and advertising company to a more general provider of A.I.-type software, says its technology already sorts email into high- and low-priority items and weeds out the junk. Unfortunately, this appears to have freed up time to send more work email.\u201cEmail shows up and says, \u2018Answer me!\u2019\u201d Mr. Ariely said. \u201cUnfortunately, time for thinking does not do that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

At 32, Mr. Udashkin, who practiced law and worked for the shoe company Aldo negotiating real estate deals and working on wholesale development, has a practiced way with business-school jargon and a marketing guru\u2019s reverence for the limitless potential of branding.

It includes a battery that zips out of the bag for any necessary troubleshooting or repairs, and help is as near as the app, where you can chat with customer service representatives.In its march toward tech-enabled luggage, Raden is not the first, and it is not alone. Fellow direct-to-consumer start-ups like Away and Bluesmart are working similar angles.

There are also the dog owners who can rest easy knowing that hired dog walkers are doing their job, and that the dogs are doing their business.And then, there is the comfort of tracking your pizza delivery.When Lora Mastrangeli orders one from Pizza Hut every other week, she does not just wait for it. She stalks it.The moment her order leaves the nearest Pizza Hut, about 30 minutes from her home in Plano, Tex., the restaurant sends Ms. Mastrangeli an alert on her smartphone with a link to a map showing an image of a pizza delivery car driving toward her house. Since she knows her driver\u2019s location, she knows precisely when to scoop her two small dogs up and sequester them in a back room to keep them from yapping at the driver.\u201cMy husband and I absolutely love it,\u201d said Ms. Mastrangeli, who works in sales for Nordstrom. \u201cWe\u2019re walking out the door when he pulls up.\u201dPeople were amazed six years ago when the ride-hailing service Uber let them track the location of their drivers on a real-time map as they waited for a ride, rather than accepting the vague assurances of taxi dispatchers. Other tech start-ups followed with maps to pinpoint the location of all sorts of things, from shoes to food and the dog walkers.And new services from Comcast and Time Warner Cable allow customers to see the exact location of the cable repairman on the way to the house.So does tracking your pizza on a map just make you feel better?\u201cIt\u2019s pure psychological effect,\u201d said Nicholas Goubert, head of project management at Here, a digital maps company that provides location data to Amazon and other businesses. \u201cYour pizza is not going to come any sooner. But it\u2019s moving.\u201dSoon UPS, the world\u2019s largest package delivery company, may also begin showing customers exactly where their stuff is. UPS is exploring giving location maps of its familiar brown trucks to customers and could begin a trial of the service within a few months, according to a person briefed on the plan who asked for anonymity because it is still private.Executives at big, established companies concede that their moves are inspired by on-demand businesses like Uber, which have changed what customers expect from all kinds of services.\u201cIt brings that visibility and transparency that they\u2019re starting to come to expect with the Ubers and Lyfts,\u201d said Baron Concors, global chief digital officer for Pizza Hut, which began sharing the location of delivery drivers with customers in some markets about six months ago. \u201cThere\u2019s a new bar for experience when it comes to delivery and transportation that everyone is going to have to meet.\u201dIn many cases, companies that provide customers with live tracking information have a practical motivation. The service is intended to eliminate situations when someone misses a knock on the door by stepping into the shower or backyard. A missed delivery or service call is a logistical headache companies want to avoid.\u201cIf they have to come back, they lose money,\u201d said Bryan Trussel, chief executive of Glympse, a location-tracking start-up in Seattle that is working with companies like Pizza Hut, Comcast and Time Warner.Joshua Viner, chief executive of Wag, said the map allows pet owners to verify that their dog is getting the amount of exercise the owner is paying for.\u201cThere\u2019s no way to cheat the system,\u201d said Julien LoPresti, who works in sales and operations for a technology company in New York and has used Wag to find walkers for Reptar, his Labrador mix. \u201cIt gives you extra confidence.\u201dIn the next month, Wag will go even further by allowing walkers to commemorate where pets relieve themselves by tapping the screens on their smartphones.

Now Comcast has cut the appointment windows to two hours.\u201cThe overall premise is we should always be respecting customers\u2019 time,\u201d said Charlie Herrin, executive vice president of customer experience at Comcast.About 30 minutes before the two-hour window, Comcast sends the customer a notification through the Comcast mobile app giving a narrower, half-hour window when the technician expects to arrive. About 15 minutes before the technician pulls up at the home, Comcast sends a link to a map that shows the vehicle en route.Dr. Frei, the Harvard Business School professor, said customers would be happier if Comcast were more precise with its appointment estimates from the start.\u201cWhat I\u2019d like them to do is say, \u2018We will be there at 3 p.m.,\u2019 and then what I\u2019d like to have happen is they\u2019re there at 3 p.m.,\u201d she said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t need any transparency.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The lawmakers gathered law enforcement authorities and Silicon Valley company executives to discuss the issue, which has divided technology companies and officials in recent months and spurred a debate over privacy and security.Yet that has done little to quell the controversy. The encryption debate has continued with new hearings, proposed legislation and other cases that involve locked iPhones and law enforcement demands that the devices be opened to aid investigations.In Tuesday\u2019s hearing, Ms. Hess did not provide details on how the F.B.I. ultimately gained access to the San Bernardino iPhone but said the agency had come to rely on private sector partners to keep up with changes in technology. She said that there was no one-stop solution and that the agency generally should not use third parties to hack into systems but lacks the expertise to break past encryption.\u201cThese types of solutions that we may employ require a lot of highly skilled, specialized resources that we may not have immediately available to us,\u201d Ms. Hess said.The focus on third parties at the hearing illustrates a growing discomfort by some in Congress and in the tech industry with the use of \u201cgray hat\u201d hackers, who are hackers who may push the boundaries of the law and anger companies but whose intentions are not malicious.\u201cI don\u2019t think relying on a third party is a good model,\u201d said Representative Diana DeGette, a Democrat from Colorado. She questioned if the use of third-party hackers was ethical and whether it could open up greater security risks because sensitive and valuable data could be accessible to outside groups.Ms. Hess did not answer directly when asked about whether there were ethical issues in using third-party hackers but said the bureau needed to review its operation \u201cto make sure that we identify the risks and benefits.\u201d The F.B.I. has been unwilling to say whom it paid to demonstrate a way around the iPhone\u2019s internal defenses, or how much, and it has not shown Apple the technique.Apple\u2019s general counsel, Bruce Sewell, said at the hearing that encryption did not prevent the authorities from solving crimes.\u201cAs you heard from our colleagues in law enforcement, they have the perception that encryption walls off information to them,\u201d Mr. Sewell said. \u201cBut technologists and national security experts don\u2019t see the world that way. We see a data-rich world that seems to be full of information. Information that law enforcement can use to solve \u2014 and prevent \u2014 crimes.\u201dLaw enforcement officials testifying before the committee on Tuesday expressed frustration over their inability to run a number of cases to ground \u2014 particularly sex abuse and child pornography cases \u2014 because of encrypted phones. They said the recent publicity over the issue could end up helping criminals.\u201cMake no mistake \u2014 criminals are listening to this testimony and learning from it,\u201d said Charles Cohen, commander of the Indiana Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force.The F.B.I. said there has been an increase in the number of devices it has acquired through investigations but was unable to gain access to because of encryption. Ms. Hess said that since October, 13 percent of the devices obtained by the F.B.I. were impenetrable by the agency. When asked at Tuesday\u2019s hearing if the relationship between the tech industry and law enforcement had become adversarial, Ms. Hess responded, \u201cI hope not.\u201dTech companies, which have largely banded together in support of Apple\u2019s pro-encryption position, are lobbying against the draft bill.Timed to the Tuesday hearing, trade groups representing top technology companies including Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft sent a letter to Senators Burr and Feinstein, opposing their bill.\u201cWe believe it is critical to the safety of the nation\u2019s, and the world\u2019s, information technology infrastructure for us all to avoid actions that will create government-mandated security vulnerabilities in our encryption systems,\u201d the groups, which include the Reform Government Surveillance and Computer and Communications Industry Association, said. \u201cAny mandatory decryption requirement, such as that included in the discussion draft of the bill that you authored, will to lead to unintended consequences.\u201dMichael Petricone, senior vice president for government affairs at the Consumer Technology Association, added, \u201cThis is urgent because the one thing you don\u2019t want is Congress coming in a knee-jerk fashion and doing something with all sorts of negative consequences, which is what we may be seeing happen now.\u201dPresident Obama has done little to assuage concerns by the tech industry.

The three, who work in either government or the private sector, spoke on the condition of anonymity.The charges, known formally as a statement of objections, may be announced in Brussels as soon as Wednesday, though the announcement could still be postponed until later this month, according to one of the people.The expected charges against Google are the latest in a raft of regulatory problems that American tech giants have faced as the European Union has cracked down on these companies\u2019 perceived dominance over how people in the 28-member bloc get access to digital services.Google denies that it has breached the region\u2019s tough competition laws, and it will have several months to respond to the charges from the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union.\u201cAnyone can use Android with or without Google applications,\u201d Mark Jansen, a Google spokesman, said in a statement when asked about the company\u2019s mobile software. \u201cHardware manufacturers and carriers can decide how to use Android, and consumers have the last word about which apps they want to use on their devices.\u201dA spokesman for the European Commission declined to comment.Despite the company\u2019s denials, the expected charges linked to Android, which powers 77 percent of European smartphones, would represent a major setback for the Silicon Valley company as it grapples with a growing number of global competition investigations into Google\u2019s vast operations.Canadian authorities, though, said on Tuesday that they had closed their investigation into claims that Google had misused its dominant position in online search. They added they would continue monitoring the company\u2019s activities.Apple continues to generate the largest share of revenue from global smartphone sales. The company also bundles its own services, including digital maps, into its mobile software, but has yet to face similar questions over whether it has broken Europe\u2019s antitrust rules.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.If European officials demand that the company provide rivals greater access to the Android universe \u2014 a possibility if Google is found to have broken the region\u2019s laws \u2014 the search giant may find it more difficult to promote its own mobile services to users worldwide as well as to smartphone makers.As part of the charges to be announced as soon as Wednesday, Margrethe Vestager, Europe\u2019s antitrust chief, is expected to focus on Google\u2019s deals with cellphone manufacturers that include bundles of Google services included in Android.Speaking in Amsterdam on Monday, Ms. Vestager said that these deals may have hindered competition by forcing cellphone manufacturers to rely on Google\u2019s mobile services that come preinstalled on certain versions of the Android software.\u201cOur concern is that, by requiring phone makers and operators to preload a set of Google apps, rather than letting them decide for themselves which apps to load, Google might have cut off one of the main ways that new apps can reach customers,\u201d Ms. Vestager said ahead of the charges being announced.The case related to Google\u2019s Android operating system has been long expected.These companies say that they have been financially hurt by Google practices that they call unfair, an accusation the company rejects.\u201cConsumers deserve more choice and innovation in mobile devices and applications,\u201d said Thomas Vinje, a lawyer for FairSearch. \u201cA statement of objections in the Android case would be an important step forward for competition and consumers.\u201dGoogle says that its partnerships with cellphone makers that rely on its operating system are voluntary, and that these relationships offer benefits to consumers as well as manufacturers.In February, Mr. Pichai traveled to Brussels to meet with Ms. Vestager and other European politicians, including G\u00fcnther Oettinger, a German politician in charge of the digital economy in the bloc. Eric E. Schmidt, Alphabet\u2019s executive chairman, has also been a regular visitor to Europe, meeting often with regional officials, in part to discuss the company\u2019s continuing antitrust problems.Now, Google faces mounting pressure over accusations it abused its position in everything from online search to its Android operating system.

More of you will be doing that than tweeting, searching on Google, checking stock prices on Yahoo or reading articles like this. And that constant lure, a fix you can easily satisfy both on a phone and a desktop computer, explains why Facebook is pulling ahead of every other large technology company right now.Your addiction is making Facebook astonishingly profitable. Put a little more kindly, your emotional and intellectual interactions on the social network are creating a great place for companies to advertise.What this means in dollars and cents for Facebook can be seen in numbers contained in its first-quarter financial results, released on Wednesday. For the United States and Canada, Facebook pulled in $11.86 in advertising revenue per user in the first quarter. That\u2019s what advertisers are willing to pay to catch your attention as you argue with your friends and relatives over Donald Trump or coo over baby pictures or both.Facebook\u2019s revenue was up over 50 percent from a year earlier, while its net income soared nearly 200 percent. Its stock leapt on Thursday as the wider market fell. Facebook\u2019s blowout financial performance stood out because Apple, Twitter and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, all reported disappointing first-quarter numbers.Facebook is doing well because it occupies a huge sweet spot in the connected world, perhaps an even bigger one than Google owns.But people apparently hang around on Facebook far longer. According to SimilarWeb, users spent just over 17 minutes on the social network on average in March, well ahead of the nine minutes for Google (these figures don\u2019t accurately reflect how active people are on the sites, but you can still see the difference.)Google has long enjoyed a big advantage in the battle for online advertising revenue because users are more likely to click on an ad for something they are searching for. But even though Facebook users are not usually on the network to buy something, the sticky way in which they engage once there makes it an attractive place to advertise.Another advantage for Facebook is that its costs are lower than Google\u2019s, which helps it make more money out of every dollar of revenue. In the 12 months through March, Facebook\u2019s operating profit was equivalent to 37 percent of its revenue; at Google it was 26 percent. Facebook is in the enviable position of spending less to bring in revenue that is growing more quickly than Google\u2019s.Pundits made a big deal this week about how Facebook excelled as Apple stumbled. But there was a warning for Facebook in Apple\u2019s results. Apple has relied heavily on one product \u2014 the iPhone \u2014 for much of its revenue, so when sales of the device slowed, there was little Apple could do to keep growing. Facebook is even more reliant on a single element: advertising revenue. If people spend markedly less time on Facebook \u2014 because an enticing new network comes along, for example \u2014 the company\u2019s revenue growth could slow.Advertisement"}

Essentially, the further away Uber gets from acting like actual employers with drivers \u2014 that is, the less control it exerts over the work force \u2014 the more room it has to call its drivers \u201cpartners\u201d and not employees.This settlement sounds a bit like that situation: Uber drivers get some perks of employment, including people to complain to, and some measure of job security (even if it\u2019s probably pretty weak). But they don\u2019t get to be full employees \u2014 meaning the company does not have to pay them benefits, and the drivers are free to work as much or as little as they\u2019d like.Am I wrong to see this as a pretty good middle-of-the-road fix to a thorny problem that had been vexing lots of on-demand companies?The counterargument for some of this is that Uber can still shut drivers out of the app for short periods of time if they make too many trip cancellations. That\u2019s a level of control that one could argue should be reserved for an employer-employee relationship.Anyway, the moral of the story is this seems to have been largely defused, though not entirely over and done with. Watch other states and the subsequent litigation closely.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Shuts Out Competitors on Android? Hardly", "Date": "2016-04-27", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtOne of the persistent tragedies of Android, Google\u2019s globe-conquering mobile operating system, is that it continues to be better in theory than in reality.The charges make sense in the abstract. Google makes the world\u2019s most popular mobile operating system, and some of its licenses do compel phone makers to include several Google apps, even if they just want to include the Google Play app store. On paper, that may constitute unfair \u201cbundling,\u201d one of the sins that did in Microsoft at its apex in the late 1990s.Yet the European charges miss the messy reality of life on Android, which is clear to anyone who studies the mobile software business: Android phones come teeming with non-Google apps, often to the point of frustration for users. The search company appears powerless to keep many of them off people\u2019s devices, even when doing so might help its business.Harry First, a law professor at New York University who studies antitrust issues, says the key difficulty for regulators in this case is that the tech world has changed radically since the Microsoft antitrust case. Back then, Microsoft managed to outflank rivals like Netscape by bundling its Internet Explorer browser with its Windows operating system, and by using licenses and payments to prevent computer makers from installing competing browsers.\u201cIn the Microsoft era people were unfamiliar with downloading, and nothing was as effective as getting the browser installed by the O.E.M.s,\u201d he said, using the abbreviation for original equipment makers, or computer manufacturers.\u201cBut now, I\u2019d be surprised if people aren\u2019t fully at ease with downloading things from app stores, and people are familiar with having more than one app on their phone that does the same thing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe E.U. has to tell an exclusion story, but it\u2019s hard for me to see the exclusion story here.\u201dBut Hangouts is clearly no messaging juggernaut. In much of the world, that title belongs to two apps owned by Facebook \u2014 Messenger, which has 800 million active users a month, and WhatsApp, which has more than a billion. (Google has never disclosed the Hangouts user base; analysts I spoke to estimated that its share of the messaging market was in the single digits.)Then there\u2019s the popularity of the main Facebook app. As its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has acknowledged, the company was late to realize the importance of mobile phones; for years, its smartphone app was a slow, kludgy mess, and until just a few years ago it had no mobile revenue to speak of. Google, meanwhile, bundled its own social network, Google Plus, with Android phones.So if you were looking at the market a few years ago through the eyes of an E.U. antitrust regulator, you might have anticipated some trouble for Facebook on Android phones, and you might even have ventured that Google Plus would become a hit. After all, here was a small, late-moving upstart pitted against a bundle-friendly giant that owned the operating system.Of course, that\u2019s not how things turned out. Google Plus is now all but dead. And Facebook did not just survive the shift to mobile phones, it became the unstoppable force in the industry.How did Facebook get so popular on phones? On the whole, it happened the old-fashioned way: People loved Facebook, they had no trouble finding it in mobile app stores, and they began to download and use it. In other words, unlike in the desktop era ruled by Microsoft, Google\u2019s platform dominance on mobile phones does not appear to have posed any hindrance to a competitor\u2019s rise.The E.U.\u2019s objections go beyond the supposed restrictions that Google places on Android\u2019s app ecosystem. Another key charge involves Google\u2019s dominance in web search. Regulators say Google ensures that it remains Android\u2019s dominant search engine both by requiring phone makers to install the Chrome browser on their phones and, in some instances, by paying manufacturers to position the Google Search app on the phone\u2019s home screen.Mr. First, the law professor, said the search issue isn\u2019t as clear-cut as the question of whether Google has restricted rival apps. But he noted that the general flexibility of Android \u2014 the fact that, in general, Google makes it pretty easy for device makers and users to tinker with the software \u2014 cuts in Google\u2019s favor.Mr. First said the interaction was noteworthy: Android easily let him download a rival to Google\u2019s offering, and it even asked him if he wanted to set the rival as a default.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see how the commission could do better than that,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Barnes & Noble\u2019s Longtime Leader, Leonard Riggio, Is Stepping Down", "Date": "2016-04-27", "News": "Supported byWhen Leonard Riggio bought Barnes & Noble in 1971, it consisted of a single struggling store in Manhattan. Over time, with swagger and an unwavering belief in the value of physical bookstores, he turned it into the country\u2019s largest bookselling chain.On Wednesday, the company announced that Mr. Riggio, the founder and executive chairman of Barnes & Noble Inc., would retire in September.He initially planned to retire at 40, but got swept up in the excitement of building the company, Mr. Riggio, now 75, said in an interview on Tuesday.\u201cI had never planned to be a business person for life,\u201d he said. \u201cI had always wanted to do something different after I\u2019d been in business for a while and made some money.\u201dDuring his tenure, Mr. Riggio steered the company through heady days of explosive growth in the 1980s and 1990s, when Barnes & Noble expanded nationally and opened its first superstores.Brash and sporting a sleek mustache, Mr. Riggio brought outsize ambition to the bookselling trade as he built his retail empire. His biggest innovation \u2014 turning his bookstores into a destination where people could meet up and linger \u2014 helped transform bookselling from a genteel, fusty calling into big business.In recent years, he has also been the company\u2019s most stable and visible leader during a prolonged period of turmoil. The company has closed 80 of its outlets around the country in the last six years, leaving a base of 640 retail stores. Barnes & Noble shares, which traded above $45 in 2006, closed at $12.42 on Tuesday.Its heavy investments in the Nook e-reader and its doomed effort to take on tech giants like Amazon and Apple in the digital book market proved financially disastrous. Last summer, the company brought in a new leader, Ron Boire, who became Barnes & Noble\u2019s third chief executive in just six years.Despite those setbacks, Mr. Riggio says he feels confident that the company he built will recover its footing, as it continues to cut losses from the Nook and experiments with a new store prototype. \u201cThe company\u2019s in a very good position,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to be the best bookseller we can be.\u201dMr. Riggio, who will keep a seat on the board, said he has no plans to sell his stock. He remains the company\u2019s largest individual shareholder, with 17.5 percent.Born in Little Italy, Mr. Riggio grew up in Bensonhurst, the son of a professional boxer turned cabdriver. His career as a bookseller began in the early 1960s, when he took a job at New York University\u2019s college bookstore to help pay for his tuition. He dropped out of college to open a rival bookstore, SBX, for Student Book Exchange, and started managing several other campus bookstores. A few years later, he bought Barnes & Noble, a bookstore on Fifth Avenue, with a $1.2 million loan.In the mid-1970s, Mr. Riggio began acquiring smaller chains. In 1986, he bought the B. Dalton bookstore chain and took over its roughly 800 stores across the country.Mr. Riggio took Barnes & Noble public and became the chief executive in 1993. He held the post until 2002.With its ubiquitous outlets \u2014 giant stores with comfy seats, a cafe and bathrooms with changing tables \u2014 Barnes & Noble became a place to loiter as much as buy books. Some in the literary world scoffed at Barnes & Noble\u2019s deep discounts and its cookie-cutter, superstore formula, but Mr. Riggio saw the store\u2019s nationwide expansion and low prices as a \u201cdemocratization\u201d of the marketplace.\u201cOur bookstores were designed to be welcoming as opposed to intimidating,\u201d Mr. Riggio said. \u201cThese weren\u2019t elitist places. You could go in, get a cup of coffee, sit down and read a book for as long as you like, use the restroom. These were innovations that we had that no one thought was possible.\u201dThe strategy worked so well that for a time, Barnes & Noble was vilified as a greedy monopolist that was crushing independent booksellers. Thousands of independent stores closed during the mid- to late 1990s, as Barnes & Noble expanded. It opened multifloor superstores with more than 100,000 titles.Mr. Riggio still bristles slightly at the criticism. \u201cThey would say, \u2018You\u2019re homogenizing bookselling,\u2019 which was ridiculous because we were carrying 5,000 to 10,000 more titles than would be in a typical bookstore,\u201d Mr. Riggio said.But lately, as independent bookstores have enjoyed a resurgence, Barnes & Noble has itself become something of an underdog.The company waged a fierce battle for dominance in the e-book marketplace, and was badly beaten by Amazon.\u201cWe\u2019re great booksellers; we know how to do that,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Riggio said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t constituted to be a technology company.\u201dMr. Riggio said that once he retires, he might write a book, though not a conventional business memoir. He wants to travel to South America and visit museums and galleries (he is a passionate art collector).\u201cI don\u2019t want to run any more businesses,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a great idea for a sock store, but I\u2019m not going to do it.

{"Headline": "How to Switch to iPhone From Android: Patience and Persistence", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported byGadgetwiseThe iPhone has obviously come a long way since then. It can now be used on any carrier. Its voice and data quality are stellar. Some of its built-in apps, such as Apple Pay, are best in class. There are 1.5 million apps created by outside developers.I have finally caved in: My phone is now an iPhone.Faced with slowing sales growth, Apple is counting on millions of people like me to give up their Android phones, which can be bought new for as little as $30 in some countries, to purchase iPhones, which cost $400 or more.\u201cWe were blown away by the level of Android switchers that we had last quarter,\u201d Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, told Wall Street in January. \u201cWe see that as a huge opportunity.\u201dAs someone who has since 2010 used high-end phones based on Google\u2019s Android operating system, I have experienced a rocky transition, like moving to a faraway city. The landmarks are unfamiliar, the customs are different, and I miss my old haunts even as I explore new ones.Switching phone operating systems should in theory be simple. First you transfer your data from the old phone to the new one. Then you reinstall your favorite apps. Finally you customize the settings for features like ring tones and notifications and learn the quirks of your new device.But as I learned, many things can go wrong, and my experience is not unusual.\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to go through the things that are most valuable to you and make sure it\u2019s all there,\u201d said Jonathan S. Geller, editor in chief of BGR, a tech news site that reviews phones and writes frequently about switching. \u201cFor a normal consumer, it\u2019s reasonably frustrating.\u201dHere\u2019s what happened when I switched:A lot of contacts and photos never made it through. It was as if a moving company had lost half my stuff during a cross-country haul.Apple later told me that I could have called a toll-free number for help, gone to an Apple store or erased everything and started over. The company lent me another iPhone 6S to try the Move to iOS app again \u2014 and this time it did transfer my data. But it failed to do the other half of the job: download the Apple versions of my Android apps to the new iPhone.The most fundamental difference between iPhones and Androids is the level of conformity dictated by each company. This is where personal preferences play a big role in customer satisfaction.Apple exercises great control over the look, feel and features of iPhones to deliver its idealized version of what it thinks people want. Android is free-form and adaptable \u2014 so much so that the look and feel can vary widely from one phone maker to the next, especially in Asia.One consequence of Apple\u2019s approach is that the iPhone is more stable. Every Android phone I have ever used has suffered mysterious hardware and software problems like random reboots and crashing apps. These happen much more rarely in iOS.But Apple\u2019s control has its downsides. The company makes its apps the permanent default options for common services like maps, web browsing and email.In my case, I have a Windows laptop; my employer, The New York Times, uses Google\u2019s enterprise apps; and I depend on Google\u2019s search technology to find airline tickets, email addresses and old photos stored in my various digital pockets. My life is deeply enmeshed in the Google ecosystem.To make my iPhone more familiar and my data easier to find, I put my favorite Google apps on my home screen and mostly use them instead of Apple\u2019s apps. Google has knitted its iPhone apps together so that Gmail uses Google\u2019s browser, Chrome, when you click on a link in an email, and Google\u2019s calendar uses Google Maps when you click on an address.Given the headaches of switching, most people avoid it.Michael R. Levin, partner and co-founder of Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, which surveys smartphone users in the United States, said only about one out of five people activating a new iPhone or Android was switching from the other platform. \u201cIn the past two years, the loyalty and switching rates have gotten very, very set,\u201d he said.Over all, I am getting more comfortable with my iPhone. I like Apple\u2019s fingerprint reader and have finally figured out how to align my fingertips precisely enough to unlock the phone (at least most of the time).Will the iPhone ever feel like home? Check back in two years, when I am due for my next upgrade.An article on the Personal Tech pages on Thursday about switching to an iPhone from an Android device misstated the content of a Google web page.

{"Headline": "Samsung Profits Are Up, Thanks to Its Galaxy 7 Smartphone", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 Samsung performed better than expected at the beginning of what it has said will be a tough year, thanks to a product that recently has been its Achilles\u2019 heel: smartphones.The South Korean electronics maker said on Thursday that its operating profit for the first three months of this year rose about 10 percent over the same period a year ago. The increase was slightly less than the fourth quarter\u2019s, but better than many analysts had expected. Much of that performance came from sales of its curvy new Galaxy S7 smartphones, analysts said.The results indicate that even as the company has faced moderating growth, it has the potential to surprise with new products that catch consumers\u2019 eyes.Samsung probably cannot return to the heady days of 2013, when strong smartphone sales powered its transformation into a global device company and helped it make nearly $10 billion a quarter. But the strong smartphone sales are a welcome return to form for a part of the company that has been squeezed at one end by cheap Chinese smartphone makers and at the other by Apple.Mr. Thompson said the major factors that hurt Samsung \u2014 including Apple\u2019s release of a handset in China\u2019s largest telecom service provider, China Mobile, and its decision to offer a big-screen iPhone \u2014 are in the South Korean company\u2019s rearview mirror.\u201cThere is a population that wants a high-end Android phone,\u201d he said, referring to the operating system from Google that many of Samsung\u2019s phones use, \u201cand the reality is Samsung is good at making hardware. They make a good phone.\u201dSamsung said that operating profit would be 6.6 trillion won, or about $5.7 billion, in the fourth quarter compared with 6.0 trillion a year earlier. The numbers released Thursday are preliminary; Samsung will post its final earnings later this month.Another factor helping Samsung has been a change in the way the company manages its new product rollouts, said Peter Yu, a BNP Paribas analyst. Last year, the company missed strong demand for its Edge series of phones, in part because it imitated Apple\u2019s hype-filled product release, and early sales of limited supplies that sell out, Mr. Yu said.This year, Samsung limited the number of countries where it was releasing the phones, and made sure it had already shipped phones across many of its channels, he said.\u201cThere was a better sell through this year compared to last year,\u201d Mr. Yu said.\u201cThere was a production issue too,\u201d he added. \u201cNow that they have climbed the learning curve, the production is there. So they have the production, the costs are lower and without those constraints they found that the Edge is selling better than they thought.\u201dWhile smartphone sales have helped solidify earnings, the company is still likely to face weak demand for its components this year on soft global demand for electronics. The conglomerate, whose products include smartphone screens, memory and microchips, has been broadly exposed to economic weakness.This year, Samsung also has to work to replace some of the microchip business it had with Apple, which it lost when Apple shifted orders to its Taiwan semiconductor rival TSMC.Even so, analysts expect Samsung, which has leading technology in sectors like screens and memory chips, to perform better whenever conditions improve.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Case Against Google Might Help Rivals More Than Consumers", "Date": "2016-04-28", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseIn a persistent (and thus far fruitless) effort to hobble giant American technology companies, the European Union has again taken aim at Alphabet\u2019s Google search engine.At first blush, it might seem the Europeans are onto something. If device manufacturers want to preinstall the Google Play app, they must agree to install Google search and its Chrome browser as well \u2014 and make Google the default search engine.With some manufacturers, Google pays to have its search function preinstalled as the default option \u2014 an estimated $1 billion a year to Apple, according to a court filing last year.If these claims seem a little like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, that\u2019s because anyone over the age of 20 has seen this before: Microsoft embedded its Internet Explorer browser in its Windows desktop operating system, a so-called tying arrangement. In the late 1990s, the Justice Department and European Union regulators accused Microsoft of illegally trying to extend its dominant position in operating systems to Internet browsers and search. (Microsoft ultimately settled the cases.)But the rapid rise of mobile and tablet devices has pretty much rendered all that irrelevant. The latest version of Internet Explorer still has the largest market share for desktop Internet browsers, but it has only a negligible share for fast-growing mobile and tablet devices, where Google Chrome is far ahead.Technological change has also undermined the superficial similarities between the old Microsoft case and the new Android one. Back then, consumers who wanted a rival browser like Netscape to run on their Windows operating system rather than the (free) Explorer had to go to a store, pay for a disk with a rival program and then install it.Today, a free rival browser is a tap away. When I checked into Google Play this week, there were more browser choices than I knew what to do with, including some I\u2019d never heard of (Maxthon?). But I\u2019m satisfied with Google\u2019s offering and have no interest in further cluttering my phone\u2019s display screen.It\u2019s so easy to substitute or add apps that it\u2019s not even clear Google\u2019s agreements with manufacturers would be deemed tying arrangements. \u201cI don\u2019t think they meet the requirement,\u201d said Herbert Hovenkamp, an antitrust expert at the University of Iowa College of Law. \u201cThere\u2019s almost no limit to your ability to add additional apps or to delete the Google app and substitute a different one.\u201dOf course, there\u2019s obviously an advantage to being the default app, or else Google wouldn\u2019t be paying Apple such a large sum. \u201cOn the other hand, anyone can change if they\u2019re unhappy,\u201d Professor Hovenkamp said.Nor do manufacturers have to preinstall any Google apps on devices using Android, which is an open source system, available free. Amazon\u2019s Fire was an Android mobile device with a built-in Amazon shopping app, but it didn\u2019t come with Google Play or Search preinstalled. Fire was deemed a flop, in part because it lacked popular Google apps like Gmail and Maps.Even if Google is found to be using a tying arrangement, that\u2019s not necessarily illegal or bad for consumers. Scott Hemphill, an antitrust professor at New York University School of Law, said tying arrangements are common across a wide array of products and industries. \u201cNo one complains because they don\u2019t have a choice of transmission manufacturers in their cars,\u201d Professor Hemphill said.These same issues were raised last year in a class-action suit in a Federal District Court in California.The two named plaintiffs both bought Android phones, one in Louisville, Ky., the other in Des Moines, Iowa, and complained that they hadn\u2019t realized they came with Google search already installed. Judge Beth Labson Freeman of Federal District Court struggled to find any evidence that either had suffered any harm.So who exactly is being hurt by Google\u2019s behavior? It\u2019s not, apparently, consumers, in whose name this battle is being fought. Google\u2019s search engine is even more popular in Europe, where it has a more than 90 percent market share, according to the European Union, than it is in the United States.The driving force pushing the European action was a consortium of Google\u2019s corporate rivals \u2014 foremost among them, ironically, Microsoft, which once complained loudly about European overreaching. It has backed a lobbying group called FairSearch, which hailed the European action against Google as \u201ca crucial step to end abusive business practices.\u201d(Microsoft and Google said this week that they were burying the hatchet and would withdraw regulatory complaints about each other around the globe. Microsoft has said it will no longer back FairSearch.)If Microsoft really wants to compete with Google\u2019s search engine in Europe, it has the wherewithal to outbid Google and pay manufacturers to make Bing their default search engine.The Russian Internet company Yandex has been the most vocal in urging European action against Apple, which is even more ironic considering that Russia is not a member of the European Union and has been sanctioned over its annexation of Crimea. Yandex has dominated Internet search in Russia but has recently been losing ground there to Google. It filed \u2014 and, no surprise, won \u2014 similar claims in Russia. (Google is appealing that outcome.)Even if competitors like Yandex would stand to benefit, \u201cthe purpose of antitrust law, at least in the U.S., is to protect consumers, not competitors,\u201d Professor Hemphill said.Professor Hovenkamp echoed that thought. \u201cEurope is moving pretty far into left field with this case,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems like over-regulation for the benefit of competitors that won\u2019t end up doing consumers any good.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He was 75.His family said the cause was cancer.Mr. Campbell had exerted a strong influence on Apple and Google, two of the world\u2019s most valuable companies, since the 1980s. Operating in a network of billionaire technology innovators, he was known for making informal but lasting personal connections that helped shape the industry.The term \u201ccoach\u201d was a reference to his days coaching the Columbia University football team from 1974 to 1979 \u2014 he had also played for Columbia \u2014 but it applied as well to his business career.As recently as the end of March, John Doerr, one of the valley\u2019s leading venture capitalists, publicly cited \u201cCoach Bill Campbell\u2019s\u201d advice when Mr. Doerr announced that he would give up his executive role at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and become its first chairman.Mr. Campbell was an Eastman Kodak executive in Europe when he was recruited to Silicon Valley in 1983 by Apple\u2019s chief executive at the time, John Sculley. Mr. Sculley named him vice president of marketing. Mr. Campbell later played a significant role in Apple\u2019s spectacular turnaround when Steve Jobs, who had been fired by Mr. Sculley, returned to the company in 1997. Apple went on to revamp its Mac computer line and introduce the iPod, iPhone and iPad.Mr. Campbell was an Apple director from 1997 until 2014.It was Mr. Doerr who brought Mr. Campbell to Google to serve as an informal adviser to the two founders, Mr. Page and Sergey Brin. Mr. Campbell was instrumental in the hiring of Eric Schmidt to be Google\u2019s chief executive in August 2001.Strikingly, Mr. Campbell\u2019s advisory role was often unpaid, at his insistence; he said he wanted to pay back what he felt was a debt to the nation\u2019s technology region.At Google, for example, he helped shape its leadership for a generation or more but, except for a single stock grant, never had a formal financial relationship with the company, according to Mr. Schmidt, who is now Google\u2019s chairman.\u201cGoogle would not be the company it is today without the influence of Bill Campbell,\u201d Mr. Schmidt said, \u201cand my guess is Apple wouldn\u2019t be, either.\u201dMr. Campbell also worked early on with Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, as well as Ben Horowitz and Marc Andreessen before they founded one of the country\u2019s top venture capital firms, Andreessen Horowitz.Mr. Campbell was deeply involved in Silicon Valley\u2019s start-up culture as well. In 1987 he led a group of Apple executives in setting up a software subsidiary, Claris, with the ultimate goal of spinning the company off as a start-up. When Apple decided not to let Claris become a separate public company, many of the executives, including Mr. Campbell, left.He later became chief executive of Go Corporation, a pioneering tablet computer company that fought a long and ultimately unsuccessful battle with Microsoft. From 1994 until 1998 he was chief executive of Intuit, a personal finance software company.William Vincent Campbell Jr. was born on Aug. 31, 1940, and grew up in Homestead, Pa., near Pittsburgh. He excelled in football in high school.Mr. Campbell ended his coaching career in 1979 with an overall record of 12-41-1. He then went to work for J. Walter Thompson, the advertising agency, before joining Kodak.In 2009, the National Football Foundation and College Hall of Fame announced that its annual award given to the top scholar-athlete would be renamed for Mr. Campbell.He was chairman of Columbia University\u2019s board of trustees from 2005 to 2014 and donated $10 million to help fund the Campbell Sports Center on the university\u2019s campus. As a philanthropist he also donated millions in support of education in the Pennsylvania steel country where he grew up.His survivors include his wife, Eileen Bocci Campbell; a daughter, Margaret; a son, Jim; and his stepchildren, Kevin, Matthew and Kate Bocci.Mr. Campbell was known for his informality. Randy Komisar, a partner at Kleiner Perkins who had been a young lawyer at Apple, recalled Mr. Campbell running down a hall one day and dragging him into a dark conference room to tell him he was starting the software company that would become Claris. Without saying anything about title or compensation, Mr. Campbell looked at him across the table and simply asked, \u201cAre you in, or are you out?\u201dAn obituary last Tuesday about Bill Campbell, an adviser to executives in the technology industry, misstated his history with the tablet computer company Go Corporation. While he was a former chief executive of the company, he did not help found it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple iPhone, Once a Status Symbol in China, Loses Its Luster", "Date": "2016-04-27", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 Since 2010, Yu Kai has followed the ritual every year: When a new Apple iPhone comes out, he gets rid of his old one and heads to a store in Beijing to buy the latest model.This year, however, he held back.Instead of buying the iPhone 6s, he has been waiting to see what the next iPhone looks like, and he said he might even switch to a model by a different maker.In China, where Apple has been a signifier of wealth and fashion, and where many Chinese update their smartphones each year, Mr. Yu is not an outlier.Mr. Cook noted that sales had dropped from a high level: In the first quarter of 2015, sales were 80 percent higher than in the same period in 2014. But the decline announced on Tuesday is a setback for one of the most beloved brands in China.China\u2019s young, middle-class consumers are increasingly willing, analysts say, to try phones from the many competitors \u2014 including Huawei, Meizu and Xiaomi \u2014 that seek to compete with Apple on technical specifications and aesthetics but that offer their models at a few hundred dollars cheaper.But one challenge for Apple\u2019s sales this year is that its most recent models do not represent a big leap from the previous generation.\u201cEveryone bought a 6 series,\u201d Steven C. Pelayo, a technology analyst at HSBC in Hong Kong, said by email, referring to models introduced in late 2014. They \u201cwere less inclined to upgrade to a 6s, which only had very minor changes,\u201d he added.Qu Dewei, who has been selling smartphones for four years in a technology mall in eastern Beijing, said it had been tough to sell iPhones since September, when the iPhone 6s came out.\u201cIt\u2019s been bad since then, it\u2019s been really bad,\u201d Mr. Qu said as he leaned on the counter at his stall. On Wednesday afternoon, the mall where he works was largely empty.\u201cNone of the brands do really great,\u201d he said. \u201cBut while I might sell one or two Huawei phones in 10 days, I may not even sell one iPhone 6s.\u201dFor years, smugglers have done a brisk business taking iPhones to mainland China from Hong Kong, where they cost less. But even the illegal sellers are feeling the pressure. In interviews, four smugglers who did well a year ago said they had now quit the trade.The iPhone\u2019s weaker sales also reflect the broader slowdown in growth in China\u2019s enormous smartphone market. Jason Low, an analyst in Shanghai with the research group Canalys, said he expected the Chinese smartphone market to grow only 4.7 percent in 2016. As recently as 2013, it was growing 50 percent annually.\u201cIf you look at the entire market, Apple cannot fight off so many competitors, like Samsung and local brands like Huawei and Oppo,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re all trying to raise the average selling price, and that will bleed into Apple\u2019s sales flow.\u201dIn many ways, the company is in a similar position today. Samsung\u2019s Edge phones stand out with screens that have rounded edges on one side, and many in China say the camera on Huawei\u2019s flagship model is better than Apple\u2019s camera. That puts more pressure on Apple to pack new features into the next iPhone, which is expected to come out this autumn.For Mo Chen, a 26-year-old public relations professional who owns an iPhone 5, the next Apple smartphone will have to do much more than her current model for her to be tempted.She was blunt in her criticism: \u201cThe iPhone 6 and 6s are really ugly.\u201dMany of Ms. Mo\u2019s co-workers and former classmates use Android phones, she said, and she is considering switching to a device by the South Korean company or to a Chinese phone made by ZTE or One Plus.\u201cI like Apple a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cI use an Apple computer. But in recent years, especially after I tried my friends\u2019 Android phones, I realized that the brand has lost a bit of its charm.\u201dCao Li contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Bets on Bots for Its Messenger App", "Date": "2016-04-12", "News": "Supported byThe experience is akin to chatting with a friend, \u201cthe one whose taste you always trust while you\u2019re shopping,\u201d said Alan Tisch, chief executive of Spring.There\u2019s just one thing: The entity on the other end talking to you and helping you choose the shoes is not human. It is a chatbot, a relatively simple piece of software that uses artificial intelligence to carry on a conversation.On Tuesday, Facebook underlined the rise of bots at its annual F8 developer conference in San Francisco. Facebook said it was opening up Messenger, its own messaging app, so that any outside company \u2014 from Applebee\u2019s to Zara \u2014 could create a bot capable of interacting with people through the chat program.With the move, Facebook is aiming to usher in a new era of customer service by bringing together the 900 million regular monthly users of Messenger with the more than 15 million businesses that have an official brand page on Facebook. Facebook is kicking off the project with partners like Spring, 1-800-Flowers, a weather and travel app called Poncho and news partners like CNN. Facebook is also testing advertising on chatbots as a potential source of revenue.\u201cWe\u2019re conversational creatures,\u201d David A. Marcus, vice president of messaging at Facebook, said of chat. \u201cThat\u2019s the way our brain functions. That\u2019s the way we\u2019re wired. As a result, it\u2019s probably the most natural interface there is.\u201dMark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, also sketched out his grand vision at the conference for the company\u2019s future over the next five, 10 and 15 years. Under his plan, people would accompany Facebook as it builds out a comprehensive global system of communications, virtual reality and shopping.\u201cWe all have a desire to be understood and relate to each other,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u201cWe\u2019re always trying to get closer to capturing the purest form.\u201dUnderlying many of these bot efforts is their presence primarily on messaging services, which are increasingly becoming a primary form of communication and computing. More than 1.6 billion people are projected to become regular users of mobile messaging apps by the end of this year, equivalent to 22 percent of the global population, according to eMarketer, an industry research firm. That figure is expected to reach two billion people by 2018.The bot revival is also taking place at a time when people are growing tired of individual apps. While big brands have long promoted easier access to shopping and customer service through their own proprietary smartphone apps, some consumers are fatigued by having to download a different app for each company. More than a quarter of the time spent on mobile apps by Americans is now focused on just a handful of social networking and communication apps, according to Forrester, an industry research firm.As a result, brands in search of the best way to talk to consumers are now pairing off with some the world\u2019s dominant messaging platforms \u2014 and their chatbots.\u201cImagine if you had, say, 10 bot interactions a day, and if your entire daily commercial life was powered by a chat platform,\u201d said Ted Livingston, chief executive of Kik. \u201cHow that platform works \u2014 and who controls it \u2014 is going to be very important.\u201d Kik is heavily promoting its \u201cbot store\u201d to lure businesses to its platform.There are no guarantees the bot medium will take off. Facebook, Kik and Microsoft are up against other artificially intelligent assistants like Apple\u2019s Siri and Amazon\u2019s Echo, the hardware devices that are voice-controlled \u2014 no typing required. And making each transaction into a personal conversation may not be what people need when they just want to book a flight or order food.\u201cA lot of apps are already incredibly functional,\u201d said Robin Chan, chief executive of Operator. \u201cTake Uber, for example: You just push a button and it works. You don\u2019t need a drawn-out conversation for every single app.\u201dRegardless, the bot wave is coming, said John Lilly, a venture capitalist at Greylock Partners who has long been interested in bots and artificial intelligence. It may not come right now, with consumers needing to type in \u201ccommand line\u201d-style text to the chatbots, but he said the trend may gather momentum as bots increasingly blend technology and \u201chuman product design,\u201d whatever form that may take.Mr. Tisch of Spring, the mobile shopping start-up that just started offering a bot on Facebook Messenger, said working with the social media company to unveil the chatbot was a no-brainer. Facebook\u2019s huge scale, at more than 1.6 billion global users, makes it a good candidate for kickstarting a new form of commerce online, he said.And chatbots themselves are simply an extension of the kind of personal conversations that are already happening in retail, he said. Many high-end retailers offer personal shopping services, often through text messaging.Conversing with a chatbot to shop feels \u201cmagical,\u201d Mr. Tisch said, though \u201cin reality, much of commerce is happening through the conversations we\u2019re already having all the time.\u201dQuentin Hardy contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For a Generalist, \u2018Too Big to Fail\u2019 May Be Too Tricky to Judge", "Date": "2016-04-11", "News": "Supported byDealBookAbout two years ago, I was speaking with an executive at MetLife who floated the idea that the company should sue the government to overturn its designation as a firm that was too big to fail. The company believed that it was being unfairly labeled, and that the regulations that came with the designation were hindering its business.My initial reaction, I distinctly remember, was to say: \u201cThat\u2019s a terribly risky idea. The government always wins.\u201dBoy was I wrong.A judge determined that the government\u2019s process for designating MetLife a systemically important institution was not just \u201cfatally flawed,\u201d but seemingly purposely so. \u201cEvery possible effect of MetLife\u2019s imminent insolvency was summarily deemed grave enough to damage the economy,\u201d Judge Rosemary M. Collyer wrote in her opinion.Not surprisingly, Jacob J. Lew, the Treasury secretary, took great umbrage. \u201cIn overturning the conclusions of experienced financial regulators, the court imposed new requirements that Congress never enacted, and contradicted key policy lessons from the financial crisis,\u201d he said.I have no idea if MetLife is too big to fail. I\u2019ve read hundreds of pages of legal briefs from both sides, and talked to company and government officials and outside experts, and I\u2019m still not sure. I\u2019ve tried to make sense of it, but it is a highly complicated puzzle and to make such a determination with any degree of certainty requires mathematically projecting how money will flow between hundreds of institutions around the globe.Which raises this question: How can any judge with anything short of a doctorate in statistics and economic modeling be tasked with effectively overseeing the decisions of a group like the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which includes the leaders of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the list goes on.Judge Collyer smartly chose not to comment on whether MetLife was actually too big to fail, and she left open the possibility that the company could someday merit that designation. In her opinion, she said more narrowly that the process of determining that status in the case of MetLife was problematic.The judge has a long history as a thoughtful lawyer and jurist. She\u2019s also a member of the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and once worked as the general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board. In other words, she\u2019s a legal rock star.But her job in the case was, in effect, to approve or reject the approach the oversight council took in its analysis.Judges, of course, are often asked to weigh in on complicated matters that are beyond their area of expertise. The judge in the case of the F.B.I.\u2019s effort to unlock an Apple phone was not an engineer or a computer scientist. And our legal system regularly asks jurors with no background in a particular subject to decide difficult cases.But in certain instances, like the case involving MetLife and the oversight council, should there be a special court, perhaps with an area of expertise?Many of the lawyers I spoke with scoffed at the idea of a specialized tribunal to deal with issues related to the oversight council, saying that it is a judge\u2019s job to determine whether government agencies provide appropriate regulation.Still, Joshua D. Wright, a former commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission, co-wrote a 2011 study that determined in antitrust cases, a judge\u2019s expertise had a significant impact on the validity of the ruling. \u201cDecisions of judges trained in basic economics are significantly less likely to be appealed than are decisions by their untrained counterparts,\u201d the study says. \u201cOur analysis supports the hypothesis that some antitrust cases are too complicated for generalist judges.\u201dNow, with the ruling by Judge Collyer in the MetLife case, many analysts are expecting that other companies, including potentially General Electric and Prudential, will sue to have their designation lifted too. That puts the decision not to a committee of ostensibly qualified experts, but to a panel of judges with limited experience.Judge Collyer\u2019s decision may well be entirely valid, but at least in certain places she appears off base. For example, she said the government \u201cnever projected what the losses would be, which financial institutions would have to actively manage their balance sheets or how the market would destabilize as a result.\u201dWell, the government appears to have done much of that in its report, but you\u2019d need a pretty sophisticated understanding of finance to understand exactly how their numbers were calculated.Judge Collyer either decided to ignore those numbers or decided they were chosen arbitrarily.The conundrum in the case of the oversight council is that determining which companies pose a systemic risk can\u2019t be done with a straight formula. The nature of financial crises means that, as a regulator, you\u2019re playing against a 100-year storm that you can\u2019t fully foresee.That\u2019s not to say the government didn\u2019t mess up in its process of designating MetLife. It now seems as if the government, in some instances, didn\u2019t even follow its own guidelines. It may get another shot, though, with the chance to go back and remake its case that MetLife should be designated too big to fail.For now, we are left with a ruling that has damaged the government\u2019s ability to regulate an institution that at least some pretty smart people who study these things thought required an extra level of scrutiny. They may or may not have been right, but ultimately it should be left to experts to decide.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "IPhone Sales Drop, and Apple\u2019s 13-Year Surge Ebbs", "Date": "2016-04-26", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 From the iPod to the iPhone to the iPad, Apple created more than a decade\u2019s worth of new gadgets to fuel its historic growth.But the technology company\u2019s dazzling 13-year run of quarterly revenue growth ended on Tuesday \u2014 a casualty of Apple\u2019s already immense size, weakness in key global markets like China and the lack of another hot product to pry open the wallets of customers.Nearly half of the smartphones sold in the United States are iPhones, and Apple may be reaching the saturation point among potential customers in other developed countries. Rival smartphone makers using Google\u2019s Android operating system continue to challenge the company with powerful, less expensive devices.Over all, Apple sold 16 percent fewer iPhones in the quarter compared with the same quarter last year.\u201cThere\u2019s no question that Apple\u2019s best days are behind it,\u201d said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at the Bernstein brokerage firm. \u201cThe company grew at astronomical rates, and it\u2019s now so big that its ability to grow at those rates doesn\u2019t exist anymore.\u201dApple\u2019s disappointing quarter is the latest in a string of bad reports from the biggest technology companies. While the reasons vary \u2014 including the long slump in personal computer sales and slipping prices for online ads \u2014 a common theme has been that as these companies have grown into giants, it has become harder and harder to keep up the momentum.Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, described the decline as a \u201cpause,\u201d not a fundamental change in the company\u2019s business.\u201cThis, too, shall pass,\u201d he said in a call with Wall Street analysts to discuss the results. \u201cThe future of Apple is very bright.\u201dApple\u2019s forecast for the current quarter did not make Wall Street more confident. The company projected revenue of $41 billion to $43 billion. That is much worse than Wall Street had been predicting.Amit Daryanani, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said that Apple may be entering a period of slowing replacement sales, similar to what happened in the personal computer market a decade ago.Mr. Daryanani also noted that many companies had been hurt by the strong dollar, which makes American products more expensive overseas. \u201cIt\u2019s a common theme across technology companies,\u201d he said.Mr. Cook portrayed the slowdown as part of the normal two-year product cycle of Apple\u2019s iPhone. The company\u2019s larger iPhone 6 line, introduced in 2014, led to a surge in sales last year as customers upgraded, sending Apple\u2019s stock to a record high.\u201cIf you look at our installed base of iPhones today versus two years ago, it\u2019s increased 80 percent,\u201d he said.Apple\u2019s newest phone, the four-inch iPhone SE, went on sale March 31 \u2014 too late to affect the second quarter\u2019s results \u2014 and Mr. Cook said that there was more demand for it than Apple could currently fill.Apple has high hopes for some of its consumer-oriented services, such as Apple Music and iCloud, as well as for its nascent Watch accessory, but those have yet to turn into giant businesses. Apple said first-year sales of the Watch exceeded first-year sales of the original iPhone, but declined to provide specific figures.The iPad tablet, once a powerful revenue generator for the company, has had disappointing sales in recent years, despite new, larger professional versions. But Mr. Cook said iPad sales would improve in the current quarter.Apple still generates tens of billions of dollars of cash every year. And the company said Tuesday that it would pass along more of that money to its shareholders. Apple said it would raise its quarterly dividend 10 percent to 57 cents a share and increase the amount of stock it buys back to $175 billion.Apple\u2019s services segment was one bright spot in the quarter, with revenue up 20 percent. The company ended the quarter with $233 billion in cash and marketable securities.\u201cWhen we look at the dynamics of the iPhone business, we feel very good,\u201d Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, said in a telephone interview. Although unit sales were down 16 percent, \u201cwe continue to draw millions of people that are buying their first smartphone to iPhone.\u201dDenny Fish, a portfolio manager at the Janus Global Technology Fund, said Tuesday that the fund sold some of its position in Apple in the first quarter, citing the company\u2019s growth challenges and worries about its position in China.Apple, which is based in Cupertino, Calif., is expected to introduce other iPhones this year, which could give sales a jolt.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With a Stand-Alone App, Starz Looks Beyond the Cable Bundle", "Date": "2016-04-04", "News": "Supported byAnd then there was Starz.The hot and crowded market of subscription streaming services will get yet another entrant on Tuesday when Starz, the premium TV network, plans to introduce a stand-alone app available on Apple and Google devices.Aimed at the 20 million homes that pay for broadband but not the full cable TV bundle, the new service, which costs $9 a month, will offer Starz original series like \u201cOutlander\u201d and \u201cPower,\u201d as well as thousands of TV episodes and movies, including Disney\u2019s blockbuster \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens\u201d later this year.The development puts a renewed spotlight on Starz, which has surpassed its rival Showtime to become the second-largest premium TV network in the country behind HBO. Now it is seeking to expand its footprint even more by making the network available outside the traditional pay TV model, as HBO has with HBO Now, and other media companies have with similar services.At the same time, Starz has been the subject of on-again-off-again merger and acquisition chatter since 2013, when it spun off from the billionaire John C. Malone\u2019s Liberty Media. Mr. Malone, known for his deal making, has spoken publicly about what he sees as the need for consolidation of what he calls \u201cfree radicals\u201d in the media industry.Creating a stand-alone streaming service has been a long time in the making for Chris Albrecht, who took over as chief executive of Starz in January 2010.Previously, Mr. Albrecht was the chief executive of HBO, where he helped assemble a slate of signature series like \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d \u201cThe Wire\u201d and \u201cSex and the City.\u201d During that time, he said, he started exploring the idea of creating a \u201clighter\u201d service that HBO could sell directly to consumers, outside traditional cable or satellite packages.\u201cI like to think it was because I was really smart,\u201d he said, but he instead credited people he hired \u201cwho knew about the space and thought about the way people are going to consume content.\u201dThey said, \u201cThis is something that we should be doing and we should be first,\u201d he recalled.\u201cOther companies that are out there might not now exist if we had done that then,\u201d he added, hinting at the rise of Netflix and of Amazon\u2019s streaming service.Starz had only just started experimenting with original programming, with projects like \u201cParty Down\u201d and \u201cSpartacus.\u201d The flagship network at the time counted about 17 million subscribers and had struck a programming deal with Netflix that Mr. Albrecht described as an \u201calbatross around our neck.\u201d That deal \u201cdid a great job in helping launch Netflix,\u201d he said.The company has changed significantly since then. In 2013, Starz was spun off from Liberty into an independent, publicly traded company. It has also raised its profile with critically acclaimed programs like \u201cOutlander,\u201d based on the best-selling novel about a World War II-era British Army nurse, and \u201cPower,\u201d produced by the rapper Curtis Jackson, better known as 50 Cent, about a New York nightclub owner and drug kingpin.Starz now has about 23.6 million subscribers, according to SNL Kagan, slightly ahead of Showtime\u2019s 23.4 million. HBO, the leading premium channel, has 32.5 million subscribers. Those figures do not include subscribers to their streaming services.Amy Yong, a media analyst with Macquarie, said subscriber numbers were growing for Starz largely because cable and satellite companies get big incentives to sell its subscriptions.Starz is estimated to capture about $4 a subscriber, with the rest of the subscription fee going to cable and satellite companies.\u201cThey are happy to be partners with cable companies,\u201d Ms. Yong said, at a time when many media companies find themselves in heated disputes with cable operators over rights fees.Total revenues for the company increased 2 percent in 2015 to $1.7 billion, with net income down 12 percent to $237 million, primarily because of increased programming and marketing costs. Analysts expect the expiration of a programming deal with Disney to deliver cost savings in the future.Despite the strides Starz has made, it still suffers a perception problem compared with HBO and Showtime, whose shows \u2014 like \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and \u201cHomeland\u201d \u2014 can become part of the cultural conversation. \u201cEveryone knows and recognizes HBO, and consumers can rattle off the last couple of shows on that network,\u201d Ms. Yong said. \u201cStarz still hasn\u2019t found that voice with the consumer. They don\u2019t have any recognizable hits, but they are getting there.\u201d\u201cIt is like they tied one of their legs to ours, tied an anchor around the other leg and threw the anchor off the boat,\u201d Mr. Albrecht said.\u201cIt was certainly distressing to see that and not a lot of fun since then,\u201d he added. \u201cWe can show the ways that we can continue to evolve through the lines of business that we have, as well as creating new ones. We\u2019re going to show a company that is worth investing in.\u201dOne major focus is the new app, which offers downloads of most content and allows four people to stream simultaneously. People who already subscribe to Starz through a traditional pay TV provider also will be able to use the app, which initially will be available on Apple and Google devices, with other future partners expected.In a statement, an Apple spokeswoman said, \u201cAs we\u2019ve said, the future of TV is apps, and STARZ is another incredible example of iOS and Apple TV customers being able to watch the shows they love on their favorite devices.\u201dStarz original series attract viewers who are more racially diverse and have lower average incomes than audiences of other premium TV networks, according to Nielsen data provided by the network. Mr. Albrecht said that the new app was meant for viewers who are likely to be interested in the network\u2019s original programming but are priced out of higher-cost premium TV networks.Typically, cable and satellite providers sell premium networks like HBO, Showtime and Starz on top of subscriptions to standard cable bundles.\u201cThere is an opportunity to differentiate ourselves to a group of consumers that would likely be customers of Starz if they could access it,\u201d Mr. Albrecht said. \u201cPremiums are stuck on top as a cherry last to be added, first to come off.\u201dIndeed, Starz will have much differentiating to do. The debut of the network\u2019s app comes nearly a year after HBO introduced its $15-a-month HBO Now streaming service to much fanfare. Soon after, Showtime unveiled a similar service for $11 a month. All the while, digital competitors like Netflix, Amazon and Hulu have greatly expanded their offerings.Advertisement"}

What is more, the new policy was effective immediately, giving Amazon and others no time to comply.A trade group representing the Internet companies is considering sending a letter asking the Indian government for clarification or to delay enforcement of the rules until September.Analysts and Internet executives in India say they do not expect an immediate government crackdown on Amazon and others, and it is not yet clear what the consequences would be for breaking the new rules.But the regulations were at least helpful to Amazon and its rivals because India finally clarified its murky policies regarding foreign-owned e-commerce companies.Uncertainty is part of the tumult of doing business in India, which has had a flood of foreign investment in its Internet commerce sector and a corresponding wave of opposition from politically powerful domestic retailers. Online spending in India is expected to jump to nearly $75 billion by 2020 from a mere $12.1 billion last year, as more of the country\u2019s 1.25 billion people get on the Internet, according to Forrester.The stunning growth projections have led executives at Amazon, the e-commerce giant, to predict that India could be its second-largest market after the United States within a decade. In 2014, the company\u2019s chief executive, Jeffrey P. Bezos, stood atop a bus in Bangalore wearing a jodhpuri-style Indian coat and holding a giant check for $2 billion, representing the amount Amazon pledged to plow into its business in the country.\u201cWith a growing middle class and propensity to shop online, the revenue potential there is enormous,\u201d said Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Company.As in the United States, in India brick-and-mortar retailers have expressed alarm at the growth of e-commerce, and they have sued the Indian government to compel it to place more restrictions on the industry.For Amazon there is a special urgency to get India right after fumbling attempts to crack the e-commerce business in China, another huge emerging market dominated by domestic players.From the day it started in India in 2013, Amazon had to make big changes to comply with its restrictive rules governing retailing.India essentially bars companies with substantial foreign ownership from operating retail outlets that sell from their own inventories of goods. Although American multinationals like Amazon, Walmart and Apple have sought to overturn or soften those restrictions, the government has made few changes.To work around the restrictions, Amazon and competitors billed themselves as e-commerce marketplaces, eBay-like websites that matched buyers with independent sellers. Amazon owns no inventory of its own in India, though it handles the warehousing and delivery of goods for many of its independent sellers, a model it also employs in the United States.The new regulations appear to make Amazon\u2019s dependence on one large seller on its site, Cloudtail, illegal, according to industry officials and analysts. While Amazon says it has more than 80,000 sellers on its India site, Cloudtail is estimated to account for 40 percent to 50 percent of the site\u2019s sales, according to Mr. Meena of Forrester.The parent company of Cloudtail is a partnership between Catamaran Ventures, the investment firm of the Indian business magnate, N.R. Narayana Murthy, and Amazon, which owns 49 percent. India\u2019s leading e-commerce company, Flipkart, also works closely with an affiliated large seller and faces a similar problem.The agency that issued the new rules, the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion, declined to comment on whether any violations had occurred. Ishtiyaque Ahmed, a director of foreign collaboration at the agency, said he was not familiar with the details of the two companies\u2019 business arrangements \u201cso I cannot discuss a hypothetical situation.\u201dFlipkart declined to comment.One obvious course of action for Amazon is to form more joint ventures with Indian companies to reduce its reliance on any single seller like Cloudtail. Arjun Narayan, managing director of Catamaran Ventures, Amazon\u2019s partner in Cloudtail, said in an email that he did not expect any \u201cabrupt business changes\u201d for Cloudtail.Snapdeal, one of the largest e-commerce companies, which has no large sellers, welcomed the regulations.Nick Wingfield reported from Seattle and Vindu Goel from San Francisco.
