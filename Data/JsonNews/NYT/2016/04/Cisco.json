{"Headline": "General Mills and 7-Eleven Join the Venture Capital Crowd", "Date": "2016-04-18", "News": "Supported byAt first glance, the maker of Cheerios and Cocoa Puffs might not fit the image of a cutting-edge venture capital investor.But with the food business moving to healthier offerings and online distribution, General Mills has created a venture capital unit that recently led a $3 million investment in Rhythm Superfoods, a specialty start-up that makes kale chips and broccoli crisps.General Mills, based in Minneapolis, is part of an increasing number of old-economy companies, including the convenience chain 7-Eleven and the Campbell Soup Company, that have joined a crowd of technology companies to create venture capital funds. Through them, they scout for new products or services and promising potential business partners.Their moves have accompanied a surge and recent crest in the valuations of many venture capital-backed start-ups. Critics say the corporate-run funds have contributed to inflated valuations for start-ups, and some funds have begun selling stakes even as they face reduced valuations on some holdings.Reports recently surfaced that Intel\u2019s fund, the largest of its kind, might sell up to $1 billion of its holdings as it narrows its strategy under its chief executive, Brian M. Krzanich.With valuations of many young, private companies faltering as interest in initial public offerings of stock has waned, corporate venture investing faces a test.\u201cI think some of the corporate V.C. will get a little less enamored as the venture market goes from euphoria into a little more normal period,\u201d said J. Sanford Miller, a general partner at Institutional Venture Partners in Menlo Park, Calif.Since 2011, the number of companies making venture capital investments has risen 79 percent, to 801 globally, according to Global Corporate Venturing, a data provider. The ranks include Verizon Ventures, Volvo Group Venture Capital, Chevron Venture Capital, Pfizer Venture Investments and Blue Cross Blue Shield Venture Partners.Even as total venture capital investment more than doubled from 2011 to 2015, to $58.8 billion, the amount invested by corporate venture funds quadrupled to $7.6 billion in the same period, according to the National Venture Capital Association. Corporate funds make up 12.9 percent share of the total, the highest since 2000.As a sign of how start-up valuations have waxed and waned, the size of the median late-stage fund-raising roughly tripled from 2012 to 2015, but it has fallen by 23 percent so far this year, according to Global Corporate Venturing.For many company funds, financial gain is less important than finding the next big idea.Arvind Sodhani, who led Intel\u2019s venture unit for 10 years, until mid-2015, said corporate venture investing has grown partly because of interest by chief executives. \u201cC.E.O.s who are worried they\u2019re going to get disrupted want to have an outpost in Silicon Valley to discern where the disruption is coming from,\u201d he said.Such corporate funds have \u201cclearly been driving up valuations,\u201d he added.For General Mills, which has also invested in the plant-based food maker Beyond Meat and two other start-ups, the venture capital fund is a way to keep pace with the growing number of small food brands that have found consumer success, especially online.\u201cThe traditional consumer packaged goods model of big advertising budgets, trade leverage and scale \u2014 a lot of those factors have been neutralized by these small brands,\u201d said John Haugen, who heads the General Mills venture fund after managing brands such as Nature Valley, Yoplait and Hamburger Helper. Emerging brands, he added, \u201chave alternative pathways to market online.\u201dTechnology companies pioneered corporate venture funds 30 years ago, followed by media, finance and health care companies. The two giants of the field are Intel, with stakes estimated by outsiders of more than $5 billion in more than 400 companies, and Google, now Alphabet, which has a $2.4 billion venture fund called GV with more than 300 investments.Comcast Ventures invests in companies it can later introduce to its cable and broadcast television customers. In 2009 and 2011, it took stakes in iControl Networks, a broadband home security and energy management service, and it later offered it to its customers through Xfinity Home.Comcast\u2019s portfolio also includes stakes in DocuSign, Birchbox and TiVo, as well as FanDuel, the fantasy sports betting site. Comcast introduced FanDuel to its NBC broadcast TV unit and its large customer base of sports fans.Other corporate venture funds acknowledge that their growing ranks have pushed up private company valuations. \u201cIn the last few years, there has been more and more corporate V.C. money coming in, and I do think that\u2019s had an impact on valuations,\u201d said Rob Salvagno, head of corporate development at Cisco Investments, which has $2 billion of stakes in 100 companies and 40 venture funds.Some funds have had bubble-style returns \u2014 as well as bubble-style losses. Qualcomm, a maker of chips for mobile phones, participated in a $25 million early-stage funding round for Waze, a crowd-sourced traffic application, in 2010. When Waze was acquired by Google for about $1 billion in 2013, Qualcomm\u2019s return was 10 times its investment.But some of Qualcomm\u2019s investments have struggled, too. It invested $5 million in the fitness device maker Fitbit in 2013 and had a paper profit of about 20 times its cost after Fitbit\u2019s initial public offering in mid-2015. However, Fitbit shares have since come back to earth, falling 67 percent from their post-I.P.O. peak in August.Qualcomm is prepared to invest through downturns because such stakes offer a ringside seat for \u201cthe next generation of disruptive innovation around our mobile core,\u201d said Brian Modoff, who oversees strategy, mergers and acquisitions and ventures for the company.Microsoft is renewing a venture investing push, hiring Nagraj Kashyap, the former head of Qualcomm Ventures, in January. The software giant was a big investor in tech and telecommunications companies in 1999 and 2000, but after losing about $5 billion from such investments in the three years that ended in mid-2003, it curtailed the effort in favor of more acquisitions.Venture investments have mushroomed recently at Salesforce, a maker of customer relations software, which began investing in 2009. Since 2011, Salesforce has increased its investments to $505 million, from $27 million. Five of its 150 companies have had I.P.O.s, and another seven or eight are waiting in the wings.Salesforce was one of five named participants in a $350 million investment in the cloud-storage start-up Dropbox in January 2014 that valued the company at $10 billion. Recently, however, one mutual fund investor that was part of the same investor group cut its valuation of Dropbox to less than $5 billion.John Somorjai, executive vice president of corporate development and Salesforce Ventures at Salesforce, said that he did not agree that corporate venture funds have helped inflate valuations. Prices for most investments are set by the traditional venture capital firms that lead the deals, not by the corporate participants, he said.As for Dropbox, Mr. Somorjai called it \u201ca very small investment.\u201d Salesforce does try to reflect such fluctuations in valuing its holdings, but \u201cno single investment is going to move the needle,\u201d he added.Sue Siegel, the chief executive General Electric\u2019s GE Ventures, said the company got into venture investing in 2013 to identify up-and-coming entrepreneurs in the health care and energy industries. She added that G.E. planned to stick with venture investing in the current valuation downturn. \u201cWhen you have these down cycles, it\u2019s a wonderful time for us to look.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple Services Shut Down in China in Startling About-Face", "Date": "2016-04-21", "News": "Supported byFor years, there has been a limit to the success of American technology companies in China. Capture too much market share or wield too much influence, and Beijing will push back.Apple has largely been an exception to that trend. Yet the Silicon Valley company is now facing a regulatory push against its services in China that could signal its good relations in the country may be turning.Last week, Apple\u2019s iBooks Store and iTunes Movies were shut down in China, just six months after they were started there. Initially, Apple apparently had the government\u2019s approval to introduce the services. But then a regulator, the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television, asserted its authority and demanded the closings, according to two people who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\u201cWe hope to make books and movies available again to our customers in China as soon as possible,\u201d an Apple spokeswoman said in a statement.China\u2019s pushback against Apple shows that the company may finally be vulnerable to the heightened scrutiny that other American tech companies have faced in recent years. That scrutiny was spurred by revelations from the former United States National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden in 2013 of the use of American companies to conduct cyberespionage for Washington.China has sweeping goals in its move against Apple, said Daniel H. Rosen, founding partner of Rhodium Group, a New-York based advisory firm specializing in the Chinese economy.\u201cThey are interested in protecting the content that the Chinese people see, policing its national security and favoring indigenous giants such as Huawei, Alibaba and Tencent,\u201d Mr. Rosen said. In this new era, he added, China \u201cis strongly disinclined to accept the dominance of foreign players on the Internet, not least those from the United States.\u201dAfter the shutdown of Apple\u2019s services, President Xi Jinping of China, who has led a crackdown on Western ideology, conducted a meeting on Tuesday in Beijing on China\u2019s restrictive Internet policies. China\u2019s top tech leaders, including Jack Ma, chairman of the e-commerce company Alibaba, and Ren Zhengfei, head of Huawei, were present at the meeting.\u201cChina must improve management of cyberspace and work to ensure high-quality content with positive voices creating a healthy, positive culture that is a force for good,\u201d a report by the state-run news service Xinhua quoted Mr. Xi as saying.Since the Snowden leaks, China\u2019s state media identified eight American companies that it has labeled guardian warriors and that it has said were too deeply established in the country\u2019s core industries such as energy, communications, education and military.Though Apple is one of the eight, it has had a much easier time.There have been some signs of trouble ahead. Mr. Xi has presided over a deep freeze on the Internet, increasing censorship and taking aim at online tools used to circumvent China\u2019s system of online filters, known as the Great Firewall. He has also added new policy tools to keep tabs on electronic communications. Mr. Xi heads a committee of top leaders set up to streamline tech and Internet policy and turn the country into a \u201ccyberpower.\u201dIn addition, the Chinese government proposed an antiterrorism law two years ago that would require foreign companies to turn over encryption keys \u2014 the codes that enable otherwise-scrambled information to be viewed \u2014 for security reasons. Though the language was ultimately dropped, analysts said the government wants to have access to all communications within China.The two Apple services that Chinese regulators shut down, iTunes Movies and the iBooks Store, compete directly with Chinese Internet companies\u2019 products. Beijing has recently added initiatives to support a sputtering economy with new emphasis on industries that require higher skills and command better profit margins, like the Internet.That push may eventually trickle down to other Apple services. Apple Pay, for example, competes with mobile payments systems from some of China\u2019s largest Internet companies: Alibaba and Tencent.In the longer term, China\u2019s tough line on foreign tech companies like Apple could have heavy consequences for the Chinese economy, Mr. Rosen said.\u201cAs surely as the tremendous welfare gains for China and its people from deepening links to global tech production, disassembling those connections is likely to entail a heavy economic loss,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Aims to Drive Down Tech Prices to Expand Its Reach", "Date": "2016-04-24", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, is clear about his vision for his company: He wants to triple the size of his social network, which now has 1.6 billion members.But to reach that new audience, he has to find a way to change telecommunications networks to make connecting to the Internet more affordable, since many of those would-be Facebook users live in developing countries.That could be bad news for the companies that make equipment for those networks, whether they are Silicon Valley giants like Cisco Systems or little widget makers that produce the parts to tie different pieces of the network together.\u201cThere is definitely going to be some pressure, some consolidation\u201d for many tech equipment suppliers, said Akshay Sharma, research director at the technology advisory firm Gartner. \u201cIf you\u2019re in hardware, you\u2019re going to reduce head count from thousands to maybe 10 people, a hundred at most.\u201dNo doubt, Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s grand \u2014 some would say grandiose \u2014 vision could take years to realize. But if he manages to make the way people connect to the Internet more affordable, it would be just the latest instance of how the company has quietly upended the traditional economics of the technology industry.Facebook has changed the way people interact with their friends on the Internet. But less understood outside tech circles is how the social network has come to be perhaps the most aggressive example of a growing number of companies that are unwilling to pay top dollar for products made by traditional technology suppliers.Mr. Zuckerberg has embraced so-called open-source concepts, which have helped him play catch-up with the giant computer networks of companies like Amazon and Google.Open source typically refers to freely shared code or even development plans that companies and people collectively create at a fraction of the price of traditional tech products. Bits of open-source technology can be found in all sorts of things, including Google\u2019s Android operating system and web browsers.Companies like Facebook often contribute to open-source projects since they don\u2019t make money selling products \u2014 instead, they have to buy products that help them offer their service. Keeping tech costs down helps the bottom line.When Facebook reveals the financial results for its most recent quarter on Wednesday, investors will no doubt scrutinize how much the company is spending, particularly since Mr. Zuckerberg has promised to invest more money in searching for new users. One big key to keeping those costs down has been open-source technology.It should not be surprising, then, that Mr. Zuckerberg is relying on open source to reduce the price of building and running the world\u2019s telecommunications networks, a business estimated to be worth about $150 billion a year.\u201cOur rule is 10 times faster or 10 times cheaper or both,\u201d said Jay Parikh, Facebook\u2019s vice president for engineering. \u201cWe want to get a full Facebook experience to every end user, whether that is video, or eventually virtual reality.\u201d\u201cThere is a new force in the system,\u201d said Dave Ward, Cisco\u2019s chief architect. \u201cWe\u2019d rather be on the train than in front of it.\u201dIn the future, Mr. Zuckerberg imagines that \u201ca physical thing, like a TV, will just be a $1 app\u201d inside virtual reality on Facebook, he recently told a conference of software developers building apps for Facebook. But that may be 10 years off, by Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s own admission. People who do not work at Facebook might say it is a fantasy.Facebook even appears willing to turn the price-crushing model on itself. To get virtual reality to every place in the world, Facebook\u2019s Oculus VR headsets, currently $600, may have to cost $5, said Mike Schroepfer, the company\u2019s chief technology officer.Is that another fantasy? For Facebook, getting those costs down could mean controlling the next big communications platform, since Mr. Zuckerberg believes virtual reality may eventually supplant smartphones as a primary connection to the online world.\u201cThe world is making enough phones. It\u2019s better for the world if there are fewer devices,\u201d Mr. Schroepfer said. \u201cIt\u2019s not totally obvious how all this shakes out \u2014 whether we\u2019ll have lots of consumer products, or it all disappears into a couple of VR headsets.\u201dHow much profit this new audience will yield Facebook is an open question. But Facebook would rather control a crucial technology than have to build on top of another company\u2019s products, as it has had to do with PCs and smartphones.\u201cIt\u2019s more opportunity to show ads,\u201d said Danny Sullivan, founder of the technology website Search Engine Land, who is a close watcher of the industry. \u201cIt\u2019s more opportunity to gather data on what we do or who we are connected with. It\u2019s more opportunity to build a new platform where Facebook serves as the broker of connectivity.\u201dAt the same Facebook developers\u2019 conference there were talks on the latest open-source efforts, including an urban wireless network that checks its performance 125,000 times a second, and a long-range wireless system that Facebook says can send a gigabit of data a second, about 10 times the rate of today\u2019s good-performing networks and enough for virtual reality.Both technologies, Mr. Parikh said, will be tested this year, with an eye to releasing them as open-source projects. \u201cWe\u2019ll be into all this stuff,\u201d he said. Facebook does not want to own or sell the gear, he added, but plans to work with \u201chundreds\u201d of local phone companies worldwide on cheaper high-speed connections.But others dismiss some of Facebook\u2019s efforts as hype. \u201cWe are connecting 700 million to 1.5 billion people a year via smartphones and tablets,\u201d said Ulf Ewaldsson, chief technical officer at Ericsson, one of the world\u2019s largest makers of telecommunications hardware.\u201cThey say they can do a 90 percent cost reduction, but that is from phone bills for high-cost customers,\u201d he said. \u201cPoor people need to be covered, and the industry is working on that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Twitter\u2019s Chief in China Raises Eyebrows Over Military Past and R\u00e9sum\u00e9", "Date": "2016-04-18", "News": "Supported bySinosphereOn the day Twitter named Kathy Chen as its new chief for China, she turned to the service to introduce herself to its vast and voluble user base.\u201cThank you very much for your support,\u201d said Ms. Chen, Twitter\u2019s new managing director for greater China and a veteran of the Chinese operations of Microsoft and Cisco, in a short video posted on Twitter late last week by the company\u2019s official greater China account.But for some of Twitter\u2019s Chinese-speaking users, that support will not be arriving anytime soon. The reason is her r\u00e9sum\u00e9: Nearly 30 years before she worked for foreign companies in China, Ms. Chen served a stint in the Chinese military. After that, she was involved in a joint venture that was partly owned by the country\u2019s powerful domestic security ministry.Like many foreign-owned Internet services, Twitter has long been blocked in China. But Ms. Chen\u2019s appointment \u2014 and the stir it has caused \u2014 shows the complicated relationship between Twitter, the technology industry and China. The country has some of the world\u2019s strictest limits on online expression, and it requires Internet companies to place servers in the mainland. It has shown little compunction about blocking or banning companies that will not play along.Twitter has become an online home to a number of Chinese political activists abroad, who use it to communicate with one another and to share their views of current events in China with the world. Some of them reacted with condemnation over the weekend to Ms. Chen\u2019s appointment.In a statement, Dickson Seow, a Twitter spokesman, said that after college in the late 1980s, Ms. Chen was assigned by the Chinese government to become a junior engineer in the People\u2019s Liberation Army. She left in 1994, when the opening of the Chinese economy provided a chance, the statement said.She then was hired by Computer Associates, an American company, to lead its joint venture in China. The Chinese Ministry of Public Security owned a 20 percent stake in that venture through a local company, the statement said, and Ms. Chen focused on selling antivirus products and never worked for the ministry itself. According to her LinkedIn biography, she worked for Microsoft from 2005 to 2009 and for Cisco from 2009 to 2013, before returning to Microsoft.Advertisement"}
