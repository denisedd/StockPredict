William Kristol, editor of the conservative Weekly Standard magazine, said Mr. Mattis had decided \u00e2\u0080\u009cafter much consideration\u00e2\u0080\u009d not to proceed.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe thoughtfulness and patriotism \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and for that matter, the modesty \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Jim showed as he reflected on this decision make me more convinced than ever that he would have made a truly admirable president, and also a good candidate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Kristol wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut it\u2019s not to be.

Mr. Kristol said in his message that he received an email from Mr. Mattis on Thursday, saying that he would not be a candidate in 2016.Any independent candidate would face formidable hurdles \u00e2\u0080\u0093 both logistical and financial \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in entering the presidential race at this late stage.

{"Headline": "Bankers in the Age of Bernie: Do They Need Camouflage?", "Date": "2016-04-21", "News": "Supported byUnbuttonedHe came, he lost, but his rhetoric continues.Mr. Sanders has built a platform on their villainy. Over the weekend, at a block party in Brooklyn, Mrs. Clinton called out \u201cthe greed and recklessness of Wall Street,\u201d and declared, \u201cI take a back seat to no one in taking them on.\u201d Senator Ted Cruz, the Republican candidate who used a hefty loan from his wife\u2019s former employer, Goldman Sachs, to finance his 2012 Senate race, has labeled the institution a hotbed of \u201ccrony capitalism.\u201d And so on.You would think it would be enough to have them \u2014 whomever this mythic \u201cthem\u201d may be \u2014 don sackcloth and ashes and sneak around in the shadows so no one could identify them by the uniform of their profession. Which, if you accept the premise that we use our wardrobe to signal our allegiance to a group (personal, political or professional), raises the question: What does it mean to look like a banker in the age of Bernie?After all, the last time the financial world was so loudly derided \u2014 during the recession of 2008 and 2009 \u2014 there was a knock-on effect in the men\u2019s wear world, and certain obvious totems of Wall Street style (the broad, structured shoulders; the patterned ties; the Ferragamo shoes) fell out of favor. According to a banker at Goldman Sachs, the idea was to play down any signifiers of employment, lest they invite negative repercussions.This was around the same time the luxury shopping site Net-a-Porter started offering deliveries in brown paper bags so those still able to indulge their consumer urges could not be identified. There was a sense that it was unseemly (and sometimes, in the Occupy Wall Street days, maybe dangerous) to represent the 1 percent.Yet this time around, no such camouflage has seemed necessary.That may be, however, less a gesture of defiance, or the result of the fact that Mr. Sanders and Mr. Cruz had pretty poor primary showings in New York (they are still preaching their bad-banker gospel, after all, and their competitors are being notably circumspect about their ties to the financial sector), than a reflection of a certain reality: The stereotype of the \u201cbanker\u201d that is currently being kicked around no longer exists \u2014 or doesn\u2019t exist in any overarching sense. It may make an easy target, but it\u2019s a straw man.The image was created in 1987 by the perfect storm of Tom Wolfe\u2019s novel \u201cBonfire of the Vanities\u201d and Oliver Stone\u2019s film \u201cWall Street,\u201d and proved astonishingly durable. And though it has been perpetrated to a certain extent in popular culture, it bears less and less resemblance to actual fact.Indeed, in conversations with several financial professionals, the consistent reaction was \u201cno one dresses that way anymore.\u201d Rather, the adjectives most used to describe their clothing were \u201crumpled\u201d and \u201cunderstated.\u201dThe stereotype style has been eroded by the global financial crisis, sure, but also casual Fridays; the rise of the entrepreneurial class, especially in technology; and the growth of a shadow banking sector \u2014 the venture capitalists and hedge funds and private equity firms that have their own, less identifiable uniform, much of which can be characterized by what it is not: the banker clothing of yore.\u201cHe is aggressively not a suit guy,\u201d said Eric Daman, the show\u2019s costume designer, who is now prepping for the second season. The hoodies may be cashmere, the jeans Rag & Bone, the sneakers limited edition, but to the untutored eye, the character may look like nothing so much as a rogue Facebook employee (and he would not look out of place at a Sanders rally).Which is not an accident. As the tech world has risen in the \u201cglobal pecking order,\u201d in the words of John Studzinski, a partner at the asset management firm Blackstone, its determinedly dress-down uniform has infiltrated the world of those who would finance it. The theory being, at least for some, if you can\u2019t beat \u2019em, dress like \u2019em.For others, \u201cit\u2019s less \u2018show me the money\u2019 than subtle,\u201d Mr. Studzinski said. \u201cPeople are going out of their way to be more understated; materialism is less valued than ownership. At a recent Friday lunch, I was looking around and it was all Brunello Cucinelli and Loro Piana. I don\u2019t even know if those brands make suits.\u201d\u201cBut that in-your-face power suit image?\u201d Mr. Studzinski said. \u201cThat image is long gone.\u201d This election year, however, its ghost lingers on.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "LVMH Again Lifts the Luxury Curtain", "Date": "2016-04-01", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 For six generations, in the foothills of the Italian Alps, the Loro Piana family has been spinning wool from cashmere goats, Merino sheep and Andean vicu\u00f1a into some of the most expensive yarn in the world.Now, for the first time, the company\u2019s Roccapietra mill will open its doors to the public. It will happen on May 20-22, part of Les Journ\u00e9es Particuli\u00e8res, a three-day event in which the French luxury giant LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton lifts the curtain on some of the studios and workshops of its 70 brands.In 2011 and 2013, more than 100,000 visitors watched shoemakers add the final flourishes to custom Berluti shoes, horologists piece together TAG Heuer watches and petites mains embroider beads onto the bodices of Dior gowns. (The event is held irregularly.)The idea is a play on the Journ\u00e9es du Patrimoine, or Heritage Days, held in France, when official buildings like the Palais de Congr\u00e8s and the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace are opened to the public.Antoine Arnault, chief executive of Berluti, chairman of Loro Piana and the son of the LVMH founder, Bernard Arnault, said he initiated the event to show that LVMH is more than just a stock listing.\u201cThe group is not built by finance,\u201d he said. \u201cThe group is made of tens of thousands of people who are proud of what they do, who love what they do, who work in fantastic conditions.\u201dMr. Arnault said he knows visitors are excited to visit the ateliers, but the event really is for the artisans: \u201cThey\u2019re there all year long making these beautiful products a little bit in the shadows, and you feel their pride.\u201dThis year, 51 locations across Europe are opening, several of them for the first time. In addition to Loro Piana\u2019s mill, they include Fendi\u2019s headquarters and fur workshop at the Palazzo Della Civilt\u00e0 Italiana in Rome, where a visit is as much about the architecture as the artisans. Commissioned by Benito Mussolini in the 1930s, the Square Colosseum, as it is commonly called, is a towering block of travertine marble perforated on all sides by a grid of Roman archways.This year Les Journ\u00e9es Particulaires will put special emphasis on the transmission of savoir-faire, and there will be a variety of master classes, like a barbering workshop with Acqua di Parma, and a session on the art of custom-made dress shirts with the British brand Thomas Pink.In another first, teams from Instagram and Facebook will document this year\u2019s visits in real time to expand the access.Registration begins April 21 on the LVMH website. Potential visitors are being encouraged to create accounts in advance to speed the process once reservations open, because space is limited and tends to fill quickly.As for the event itself, Mr. Arnault has a personal goal: \u201cWe hope to beat the record of Beyonc\u00e9. She sold out her last concert in 3 minutes. We think we can do better.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Bittersweet Passover: Cancer, Remission and Change", "Date": "2016-04-21", "News": "Susan Gubar writes about life with ovarian cancer.Despite good news about my cancer treatment, it has been a hard winter, so I am looking forward to Passover. By retelling the story of the Jewish people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s escape from slavery in Egypt, the Haggadah \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the text recited at the annual Seder \u00e2\u0080\u0094 celebrates deliverance and springtime renewal. How would its rituals and prayers resonate for me this year, when cancer concerns were unexpectedly supplanted by other tribulations?  Alesha, the research nurse of my clinical trial, informed me in February that she and my oncologist were requesting an amendment of the Phase 1 study rules on my behalf. Since August 2012, I have driven up to Indianapolis every month for tests that have charted my vital signs and the CA-125 blood marker of ovarian cancer. The signs remained good, the marker stayed low, and each month Alesha passed over another bag of the experimental pills. Soon the leash tying me to the hospital will loosen. Maybe I will get two or even three months of pills all at once.My jubilation was tempered by the difficult circumstances with which I currently contend. Over the past year, my husband, Don, has suffered a series of debilitating accidents, surgeries and infections. Just when I was priding myself on caring for Don as devotedly as he had cared for me, I slipped and fractured my pelvis. Once energetic seniors, Don and I now hobble around on canes, a geriatric duo. Grounded, we realize that we must move out of a country house we love but cannot maintain. As I turn over the pages of the Haggadah in preparation for the last of some 22 Passovers we have commemorated here, I find myself startled by its images of the inextricable collocation of joy and sorrow. On the Seder plate, parsley, celery and scallions represent nature\u00e2\u0080\u0099s regeneration; however, they are dipped into salt water, signifying the tears of oppression. We read that the lettuce on the plate starts out sweet, but it becomes bitter if left in the ground too long, just as people do in bondage.The Hillel sandwich best exemplifies the discord of elation and distress.  It consists of matzo eaten with charoset (often a mixture of apples, honey, cinnamon and wine) and maror (horseradish). The horseradish, if strong enough, can elicit yowls from guests simultaneously savoring the honeyed fruit which, oddly, represents the mortar used in making bricks for the pharaohs.Dissonance resounds throughout the Seder story. The sustaining matzo we are enjoined to offer all who are hungry and needy is the bread of affliction, baked hastily by migrants fleeing for their lives. Although the story says that the Angel of Death passed over the houses of Jews, the first-born babies of the Egyptians died. Liberation from slavery occurred centuries ago, yet the Haggadah states that in every generation, all participants should regard themselves as if they have personally come out of slavery. We are each and every one of us strangers in a strange land, but the Jews arrived at their promised destination.The state of cancer survivorship has everything to do with this weird sort of discordance, or so it seems to me. Life-saving protocols produce injurious side effects, impairments or mutilations. The relief of remission is shadowed by fear of recurrence.  While I profit from a targeted drug, two members of my support group report the failure of their chemotherapies. Those in the group who exult at being cancer-free mourn the three participants whose lives have been cut short by the disease.  According to the essayist David Rakoff, living with cancer may also blur \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe borders between the micro and the macro,\u00e2\u0080\u009d leading people to conflate private with public woes: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe world seems lethally friable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  As the political becomes personal, the incivility and violence of presidential contests in this country scare me. Then there are the bombings overseas. That politicians recurrently refer to terrorist cells as cancers rightly suggests that cancer terrorizes its hosts, but the victims of terrorism have no recourse to treatments. This year, the narrative of the Seder will remind me that we all remain in captivity while millions of refugees suffer in exile and populations across the globe struggle with anti-Semitism, racism and sexual slavery. To symbolize the need for a renewal of faith in forces that can right these grievous wrongs, after the meal we will open the door for the stranger and sing a hymn to the prophet Elijah, who heralds harmony and redemption.    Considering cancer research, I rejoice that the clinical trial in which I participate means a little bit of redemption for women who test positive for the BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. Drugs called PARP inhibitors, like the one I take, will extend the progression-free survival \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the length of time during and after treatment of a disease that does not worsen \u2014 of women whose ovarian cancer was caused by these genetic mutations. But I grieve over the majority of ovarian cancer patients besieged by a miserable prognosis. For me, living longer means getting old \u2014 which, my mother always told me, is not for sissies. As I welcome Elijah this April, I will be hoping that Don and I garner the strength to open another door next year \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not in our spacious country home, rich in the memories of Seders past, but in the promised land of a one-story, in-town apartment we can manage to negotiate. It is a bittersweet prospect for which Passover will prepare us.Related:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "A Time of Bullies", "Date": "2016-04-01", "News": "Supported byEvery Jew of the second half of the 20th century was a child of the Holocaust. So was all humanity. Survival could only be a source of guilt, whether spoken or unspoken. We bore the imprint of departed souls.The silence that descended was the silence of the lost. It seems to me that I was raised in silence and that I was far from alone in that. Language could not accommodate such a volume of ashes. Death\u2019s German mastery lingered. The new European prosperity was an epilogue to the unspeakable, its disguise.Beneath the gleaming postwar surfaces there lurked the indelible stain of barbarism. A human stain, the bruise of complicity in all its shades.After a while I wanted to understand the things unsaid in the rush to build on the ruins. The covered-over came after me. As a child of the repetitively displaced, I was perhaps a natural target for smothered memory. I wanted to understand where I came from. I wanted to understand my mother\u2019s madness. Never should it be forgotten how onerous it is to forget.There were clues along the way.I stand with my then-wife Frida Baranek at Auschwitz gazing at the entangled piles of spectacles left behind by the gassed. Glasses removed for a \u201cshower\u201d form a labyrinthine mound of wire. Frida\u2019s grandmother and most of her maternal family from Poland were killed in the camps. Raised in Brazil, she has never seen this residue of mass murder. Yet her gravity-defying sculptures from the tropics resemble nothing so much as this living tangle of metal.Some feeling had passed from her murdered grandmother \u2014 of the weightlessness of life, of sightlessness, of imbalance and collapse. What it was, at the end, to crumple naked into a cold wall and scream.My own family skirted the Holocaust. I am not strictly a child of the Holocaust \u2014 perhaps a stepchild. They fled the Russian pogroms of Lithuania for the sun and gold of South Africa. My parents left the ravages of apartheid for the tolerance of England. I bounced back and forth in infancy between London and Johannesburg, before being educated at bastions of British privilege, Westminster School and Balliol College, Oxford.Yet \u2014 that old Jewish thing \u2014 I never quite belonged. I left England and sotto voce Jewishness to become an American and full-throated Jew in New York. I settled in Brooklyn just in time to see the Twin Towers come down, watch the papers flutter like confetti over the East River, and inhale the acrid-sweet smell of burnt flesh below Canal Street.Ashes again, vanishing in the air, motes of darkness.Hatred, fomented in the name of utopian illusion, returns. It is unbearable for some to accept Kant\u2019s \u201ccrooked timber of humanity\u201d out of which no straight thing was ever fashioned. The essence of liberalism is acceptance of our human limits and our human differences. It is acceptance of multiple and perhaps incompatible truths. In Europe and America, liberalism is threatened today. Anger rises. Bullies have workable material.When societies leave many people feeling excluded, they grow volatile. Belonging is a fundamental human need.In the United States we tend to think of immigration as new opportunity and new hope. That is the bright star of movement and displacement.The black sun is loss and forgetting, losing an identity to craft another. It is the enormous effort of rebuilding a life far from the familiar \u2014 the cherries of Lithuania, the firm yellow peaches of Cape Town, the certain moments and certain pleasures that once inhabited Aleppo or Homs.The Holocaust was an uprooting, an eviction and an effacement executed on a scale never imagined. For Jews, belonging ceased. My parents, bearing the subliminal shame of Jewish survivors, tried to assimilate in Britain. But my mother was a transplant that would not take.Hollowness: spaces between the wires, empty spectacle frames and shattered glass. My mother looked for an anchor in a strange land. Her mind raged like an infernal machine, or folded into inertia.My young cousin in Tel Aviv who took her life, an Israeli unable to establish her own borders in a Jewish state of uncertain borders.The horror is endlessly refracted.I feel a great unease. We have embarked on the 21st century with the painful yet essential knowledge of the last one slipping from us. Last month, some American Jews cheered a dangerous demagogue.Two thousand years ago Hillel admonished us: \u201cIf I am not for myself, who will be for me? But if I am only for myself, who am I? If not now, when?\u201dIt is incumbent on all the inheritors of the silence of the lost to raise their voices against the barbarians and bullies before it is too late.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "The comedian Albert Brooks once said there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no special line at the bank for being ahead of your time. It may be unfair, but while some artists are celebrated as innovators during their lifetimes, others never quite become household names.Mr. Josephson, who was born in Detroit, has spent nearly his entire career in Chicago, where he taught for many years at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. He had studied with Harry Callahan and Aaron Siskind at the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s famed Institute of Design, graduating with a master\u2019s degree in 1960. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy to see their influence in his early work, with so many modernist, dynamic, chiaroscuro urbanscapes.Looking back, Mr. Josephson recalled what it was like learning from the two historically important instructors.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHarry would usually just gesture,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHis greatest compliment was saying: \u00e2\u0080\u0098That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really a good picture. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good idea. Good picture.\u2019\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd Aaron would explain what Harry meant, because Aaron was so much more verbal.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBefitting a trailblazer, Mr. Josephson made up the rules during his initial conceptual forays in the 1960s. In fact, he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even know what to call his initial efforts. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what conceptual art was, when I first started doing it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said in a recent interview. \u00e2\u0080\u009cUntil someone said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098You do conceptual photography,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and I said: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh. Do I? O.K.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u200a\u00e2\u0080\u009dAs his style matured, he began to build pictures based upon ideas, and to work in open-ended series to give them shape. \u00e2\u0080\u009cImages Within Images,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which he began in 1964, offers the perfect example of how his style seemed to presage the culture to come. In \u00e2\u0080\u009cDrottingholm, Sweden, 1967,\u00e2\u0080\u009d made during a year there on a teaching exchange, the photographer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arm and hand jut into the frame, holding a postcard image of a royal residence in Sweden, in front of the building itself. The outstretched hand evolved into a repeating motif going forward, and that sort of self-referencing became the norm in our meta-obsessed 21st century. (As did his inclusion of himself and his family in his work.)Another image from that series, \u00e2\u0080\u009cChicago, 1964,\u00e2\u0080\u009d shows a Polaroid image of a tree, placed within the bark of the same tree, which he then photographed with the embedded picture. It calls into question the way in which photography is illusion, rather than an objective representation of reality, years before famed \u00e2\u0080\u009cPictures Generation\u00e2\u0080\u009d artists like Cindy Sherman played with those ideas in the \u00e2\u0080\u009970s and \u00e2\u0080\u009980s.So why isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Mr. Josephson better known for getting there first?Stephen Daiter, his longtime dealer, who helped edit and produce the book, says that a lot of Chicago artists don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get their due from the outside world. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe photo world has been traditionally based in New York, and a little bit elsewhere,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not in New York, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not seen in the same way that you are elsewhere.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAdditionally, he pointed out that Mr. Josephson is not big on self-promotion, perhaps because of his classic Midwestern humility.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shy. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s soft-spoken,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Daiter said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat also works a little bit against him, because he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not somebody who will go out, and scream and yell, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m the greatest.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty quiet and reserved in most contexts.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe book shows the tremendous range of image-making styles, from street photography to collage, poignant family photos, references to photo history, and cheeky nudes. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy to imagine they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to resonate deep into the future as well.Not surprisingly, the book\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cover image seems to encapsulate his art-making philosophy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cStockholm, 1967\u00e2\u0080\u009d depicts an old black Volvo, blocking the winter sun from melting snow on the street beside it, which forms a perfectly shaped snow shadow. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a sly take on the photographic medium itself, which relies so heavily on positive/negative. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also an act of cosmic synchronicity that represents what photography does best.

{"Headline": "U.S. Adds China\u2019s Internet Controls to List of Trade Barriers", "Date": "2016-04-07", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 China\u2019s notorious online controls have long been criticized as censorship by human rights groups, businesses, Chinese Internet users and others.Now they have earned a new label from the American government: trade barrier.United States trade officials have for the first time added China\u2019s system of Internet filters and blocks \u2014 broadly known as the Great Firewall \u2014 to an annual list of trade impediments. The entry says that over the last decade, the limits have \u201cposed a significant burden to foreign suppliers, hurting both Internet sites themselves and users who often depend on them for business.\u201dThe move, which isn\u2019t likely to have immediate repercussions, speaks to the American government\u2019s growing concern over Chinese Internet regulations and could foreshadow more aggressive actions. It also underscores the opposing visions the world\u2019s two largest economies have on how the Internet should work and be managed.The United States argues against overt censorship and policies that block the flow of data across borders. China has been pushing its agenda that each state should have the right to closely control what websites are available within its borders.The report from the Office of the United States Trade Representative said that over the last year, the \u201coutright blocking of websites appears to have worsened,\u201d noting that eight of the top 25 most popular global sites are blocked in China.\u201cMuch of the blocking appears arbitrary; for example, a major home improvement site in the United States, which would appear wholly innocuous, is typical of sites likely swept up by the Great Firewall,\u201d the report said.Officials at China\u2019s commerce and foreign affairs ministries, as well as at its top Internet regulatory agency, did not respond to requests for comment.In recent years, China and the United States have clashed over trade in the technology industry. Last year, the Obama administration responded to lobbying from American companies against a number of Chinese laws that the companies said were devised to push them out of China. Beijing toned down language in an antiterrorism law, and it scrapped a regulation restricting what foreign hardware could be sold to Chinese banks.Still, any effort by the United States to persuade China to reduce its Internet censorship would most likely be a nonstarter. The Chinese government considers the close control of online discourse a matter of national security, largely out of concerns about the Internet\u2019s power to aid the organization of protests and the spread of dissent. As a result, Beijing has shown little flexibility on issues of censorship, and it tends to block any Internet media it feels it does not have complete control over.Scott Kennedy, deputy director of the Freeman Chair in China Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the move by the United States trade office illustrated the gulf between the attitude represented by China\u2019s heavy regulation of the Internet and the one put forward by the United States through trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\u201cChina is far less willing to separate commercial and national security concerns,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cThis difference in approach is unlikely to disappear anytime soon, no matter how much the U.S. highlights the issue.\u201dChina cites the threat of online espionage, pointing to disclosures by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, that showed American intelligence efforts to use American hardware abroad to gather information.Online filters in China create an Internet largely walled off from the rest of the world, violating the fundamental idea of the web as an open channel of communication among people across the globe. Detractors say that the practice is anticompetitive, prohibits freedom of expression and ultimately damages Chinese economic growth by limiting access to information. Supporters of China\u2019s policies say that the rules have allowed the country to foster a thriving set of domestic Internet companies.The United States trade office added China\u2019s Internet censorship policies to its annual National Trade Estimate Report, released on March 31.

{"Headline": "Paul Ryan, a Mirage Candidate, Wages a Parallel Campaign", "Date": "2016-04-10", "News": "Supported byMr. Ryan is creating a personality and policy alternative to run alongside the presidential effort \u2014 one that provides a foundation to rebuild if Republicans splinter and lose in the fall. \u201cHe is running a parallel policy campaign,\u201d said Senator Tim Scott, Republican of South Carolina.He is shaping an agenda that he plans to roll out right before the convention, a supplement of sorts to the official party platform. He gives regular speeches on politics and policy \u2014 particularly on poverty and economic issues \u2014 then backs them up in the news media.It is not a move without risks. His policy positions on immigration and trade, which have contributed to his mirage candidacy, are in great tension with the views of many Republican primary voters.\u201cI\u2019m a big fan of Paul,\u201d said Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama and one of the very few Trump supporters in Congress. \u201cHe\u2019s a good person and he\u2019s smart, but issues like trade and immigration are going to be important, and I don\u2019t think anybody gets the Republican nomination that\u2019s not in sync with a substantial majority of the American people on those two key issues.\u201dStill, his name is a major draw. Mr. Ryan raises substantial sums of money for Republicans, even while keeping his promise to spend Sunday at his children\u2019s sporting events in Janesville, Wis., instead of golfing with donors. The National Republican Congressional Committee raised $185,000 from two emails from Mr. Ryan last month, more than the group\u2019s entire haul in March 2014, during the last House races. He became speaker late last year.\u201cThere is no question that Ryan is operating in a very ambitious way,\u201d said Peter Wehner, a former director of the White House Office of Strategic Initiatives under President George W. Bush who has known Mr. Ryan for two decades. \u201cHe is trying to set forth a path for the party with ideas and policy proposals and principles,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is unusual for a speaker in an election year, but Ryan himself is a very different person, and this is the product of this very unusual presidential year.\u201dMr. Ryan is the architect of his party\u2019s plan to rein in spending on entitlement programs, while Mr. Trump has vowed to leave such spending untouched. Mr. Ryan has also been a leader in his party in supporting an overhaul of the immigration system; opposing this is at the center of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.Yet even if Mr. Cruz prevails, Mr. Ryan may still offer a supplemental set of talking points for the rest of his party to follow.For example, if the Republican nominee does not provide an alternative to the Affordable Care Act \u2014 something Republicans have failed to do since it passed in 2010 \u2014 Mr. Ryan intends to do so, just as he will lay out an anti-poverty plan. Mr. Ryan will even take the highly unusual step of presenting a national security agenda that may not be in step with the nominee\u2019s.These moves could prove useful to rank-and-file Republicans seeking a life raft in Trumpian seas. \u201cI do think we would be ready to move ahead with our principles,\u201d said Representative Adam Kinzinger, Republican of Illinois. \u201cI am definitely not selling out on mine, and many of my colleagues are in the same boat.\u201dAt this point, Mr. Ryan\u2019s early efforts have done little more than to elevate the speculation about a presidential candidacy that he keeps publicly tamping down. His moves certainly have not unified the party.\u201cThe House and the Senate and the candidate have to come together on policy ideas,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who was a White House contender and an early Trump antagonist, and is now a reluctant Cruz supporter. \u201cIf you can\u2019t get everyone on board, it makes it harder.\u201dAnd while Mr. Ryan\u2019s positions remain popular with many Republicans in Washington, they are out of step with the white-hot populism that has fueled this year\u2019s campaign. He remains a proponent of changes to the immigration system even though some Republican voters have been attracted to Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to ban Muslims from entering the country and force Mexico to pay for a wall at the border.Even within the House, Mr. Ryan\u2019s ideas have met with resistance. He cannot get a budget passed, largely because he will not support the deep spending cuts favored by conservatives like Mr. Cruz.\u201cI don\u2019t think he would use his position as the stick in the eye of Trump or taunt him,\u201d Mr. Wehner said.\u201cBut I don\u2019t think Ryan would be at all shy about laying out the agenda of the Republican Party, because, remember, there are a lot of people voting against Trump out there.\u201dOne of Mr. Ryan\u2019s central demands when he was drafted to be speaker was that he could spend weekends at home with his family, and not on the road raising money, as John A. Boehner, the previous speaker, did.Advertisement"}

For instance: Sneeze particles can fly over 30 feet in the air, at a velocity of up to 200 miles per hour.Lovely. And what\u2019s actually happening when we sneeze?\u201cThe body is overprotective, just like our parents,\u201d he said.To elaborate: The inside of your nose is coated with mucus, and when you inhale, pollutants and allergens enter the nostrils and get stuck to it, he explained.Underneath the mucus are cells and nerve endings that detect these allergens as well as potentially dangerous particles, and when those nerves become irritated, they set off a reflex, he said.\u201cLike when the doctor hits your knee, but it causes us to take a deep breath in and suddenly release a forceful jet of air.\u201dWe live in the concrete jungle. Can we escape pollen if we avoid the suburbs? Not quite.\u201cWe get most of our pollen from New Jersey, because of the winds moving west to east, but the wind moves quickly past our buildings, creating a wind tunnel effect,\u201d he said.Sometimes we may feel even worse in the city, he says, because a person standing in the middle of an avenue can get exposed to a tremendous amount of pollen.Then what\u2019s making us sneeze here?Tree pollen \u2014 most notably from oak, maple and birch trees, he said.And when?\u201cIt\u2019ll usually crescendo in May.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:Like a nose in spring, it\u2019s going to be drippy.The city is most likely to be flushed out with showers in the evening. Until then, expect watery skies, with light sprinklings \u2014 cloud sneezes.SaturdaySunday But we want to enjoy the outdoors!Dr. Reisacher offers tips to battle the boogers.First, try to avoid the allergens. Pollen levels are highest from 5 to 10 a.m., he said, so keep your windows closed then.Shower when you head inside, and use over-the-counter saline gels and antihistamines. They work nicely.And finally, let it rip.\u201cI\u2019ve seen a few instances of people with dizziness and hearing loss after holding in a forceful sneeze,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Germany Cracks Down on Far Right With Arrests and a Trial", "Date": "2016-04-19", "News": "Supported byBERLIN \u2014 The German authorities moved against right-wing groups on two fronts on Tuesday, with an early-morning raid that led to the arrest of five people suspected of attacks on refugee shelters and the opening of a trial of the leader of an anti-immigrant group.Two hundred police officers, including members of elite anti-terrorist units, conducted searches at several homes and unidentified properties in the state, federal prosecutors said.Later in the morning, Lutz Bachmann, a co-leader of the movement that organized the demonstrations, Pegida, went on trial in Dresden, the capital of Saxony. He faces charges of incitement for calling refugees \u201ccattle,\u201d \u201cbrutes\u201d and \u201ctrash.\u201d\u201cWith today\u2019s operation, the security authorities have dealt a powerful blow to a regional right-wing terrorist group,\u201d Interior Minister Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re said in a statement. \u201cThis shows that the state is moving decisively and early against far-right terrorist structures and criminals.\u201dThe five people detained on Tuesday were said by prosecutors to have formed an organization known as Group Freital last July, along with three other men detained earlier, at an unspecified date.The announcement by the authorities that at least these eight people were involved was the first in which they had publicly linked a particular organization with some of the hundreds of attacks on refugee shelters over the past year.Of the people now in custody \u2014 seven men ages 18 to 39, and one 27-year-old woman \u2014 two were said to be the ringleaders of the group. The pair, identified only as Timo S., 27, and Patrick F., 27, in keeping with German privacy laws, are also suspected of attempted murder, the prosecutors said.Four others are also suspected of other crimes, including attempted murder, causing grievous bodily harm and causing explosions and damage.Prosecutors linked the group to the purchase of pyrotechnic explosives, which are banned in Germany, from the neighboring Czech Republic. The explosives were mounted on the windows of at least two refugee shelters in Freital in attacks in September and November.In the second attack, one refugee suffered facial wounds from glass splinters. In both cases, fatal injuries were avoided only because refugees either were not in the rooms or had fled in time, the prosecutors said.In a third case, Group Freital attacked an alternative housing project in Dresden, prosecutors said, causing damage but no reported injuries.Mr. Bachmann made the comments over which he is facing trial in a post on Facebook in 2014, several weeks before he began calling on Germans unhappy with the leadership of Chancellor Angela Merkel to march through the streets of Dresden.On Monday night, several hundred people marched through Dresden, and some of them turned up outside the courtroom on Tuesday, The S\u00e4chsische Zeitung reported.Prosecutors charge that Mr. Bachmann\u2019s remarks, in which he referred to asylum seekers as inhuman and called them \u201ccattle,\u201d attacked the human dignity of refugees, incited hate against a minority group and posed a threat to public peace.Several dozen of his supporters waved signs outside of the courtroom as his trial opened, calling for \u201cresistance.\u201d The police were also present, but declined to comment on their exact security measures.Advertisement"}

I am sure that Beyonc\u00e9 would not include her daughter in her empire unless she felt it benefited her character. And there is a great deal to admire about the way she empowers others, particularly girls and women. (\u201cMy goal with Ivy Park is to push the boundaries of athletic wear and to support and inspire women who understand that beauty is more than your physical appearance,\u201d she said in a statement.)That said, there is still something disconcerting about seeing celebrities enlist their children in service of their brands, even if there is some ancillary political value.But if he also cast his child in commercials, and that was on top of a web campaign in which the little boy or girl was otherwise a prominent fixture, and if my friend already inhaled the rarefied air of the ultrarich and I suspected the deployment of the adorable tyke was a strategic showcase for his own relatability as a normal parent and a measure to downplay the crass commercialism of the enterprise \u2014 well, then I might be concerned.And yet many parents on social media are doing much the same thing, albeit in less conspicuous fashion, and usually with a goal of praise, not profits.We, too, are using our children on the Internet to burnish our personal brands, from the C.E.O. who wants to let everyone know she still takes the time to attend her child\u2019s piano recital to the stay-at-home caregiver wanting recognition for his exhausting work.Obviously, not every instance of posting information about children on the Internet is calculated. Relaying joyful photos or anecdotes for family and close friends is often more convenient over social media. In addition, these networks can provide support and advice to parents who are confounded, upset or isolated.Earnestly asking for guidance on how to get through a flight with an infant sounds quite different from a faux self-deprecating remark complaining that your baby cried nonstop on the way to your Hawaiian vacation, which seems designed to alert others to both one\u2019s glamorous lifestyle and parental stamina.Then there are those progenitors who appear to detach themselves from the act of parenting, shruggingly referring to their children online as \u201cthe kid\u201d (or \u201cthe boy\u201d or \u201cthe girl\u201d) when reporting their cute acts. Using the definite article rather than \u201cmy,\u201d even sardonically, also might be seen as elevating one\u2019s child from the pack and effacing the rest, as if theirs is \u201cthe\u201d sole child in existence.Less pettily, there are serious questions to be asked here about privacy and consent. For most children raised in analog eras, embarrassing Polaroids and stories were small-scale mortifications at worst. But now the possibility of mass exposure looms, and while most conscientious parents know better than to circulate, say, a photo of a child bathing, they do distribute other data that the young subject may someday wish had been kept confidential.The 5-year-old clearly cannot approve with full understanding the uploading of these images, just as the only way Blue Ivy can refuse to endorse her mother\u2019s marketing campaign is by throwing a temper tantrum. We have strict child labor laws, and I am certain that any applicable ones were upheld during Blue Ivy\u2019s cameo. (I also imagine that she had fun.)I do not doubt that he is smitten with his daughter. Furthermore, parading one\u2019s child in front of the cameras may be an inevitable consequence of mega-celebrity (see under West, North), either because of the futility of keeping the paparazzi and fans at bay or because one is so accustomed to life in the spotlight that it doesn\u2019t seem tacky.While love for and from a child is absolutely something to be cherished and celebrated, it may also explain why children are such perfect props for online self-promotion. If someone were to post daily pictures of and stories about his spouse, he would soon find himself without any virtual friends.To integrate a child into a Twitter post or Instagram picture, then, is to acknowledge a deeply intimate connection we have to a world untouched by these corrupting media platforms, to signal to others that when we put down the phone or close the computer, there exists a human being whose life is wholly dependent on us, who wants to hear a bedtime story rather than another hot take on the latest scandal, who loves us not for how many followers we boast but for the tender, sacrificial care we give them.And yet we use a cold piece of machinery to affirm that warm human sentiment.A picture caption last Sunday with an article about people who feature pictures of their young children on social media accounts misidentified the woman and child shown in a photograph projected behind Mark Zuckerberg. They are not his wife and son.Advertisement"}

So maybe you can expect to have a bunch of purple-themed icons preloaded on your next smartphone.But I want to get to a bigger thing I\u2019m preoccupied with. And that thing is Twitter, of course, the medium of choice for self-centered journalists like myself.The bigger win here, I think, is Twitter\u2019s chance to convince people to come watch TV on Twitter and stick around long after. With these games, Twitter has 10 chances to show old and new users that it\u2019s a worthwhile service to come back to again and again. That\u2019s something they\u2019ve missed the opportunity to do in the past. And that means Twitter needs to nail the experience of watching the games on the service this time around.Maybe Twitter will have more success this time around. It has some advantages, including the ability of viewers to comment on the games alongside their feed, mimicking the community feeling and fun of watching the N.F.L. with friends or at a bar. (Which will be handy when I need to bemoan the state of my New York Giants.)Yahoo did manage to improve on audiences for previous streamed N.F.L. games. But Twitter will need to do significantly better \u2014 and in the process find the perfect way to energize its stagnant audience growth \u2014 if it hopes to reap a good return on this investment.Anyway, thanks for dropping by, Michael! I\u2019ll have to have you back another week, perhaps to complain to you when my phone is filled with little purple icons. Ciao!Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Women Who Run, the Bathroom Problem", "Date": "2016-04-14", "News": "Want to start a new running habit? We make it easy to get started, get inspired and stay on track. Are you ready? Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s go!On a recent weekend trip to Washington, I was running in Rock Creek Park when the water and coffee I\u2019d had that morning caught up with me. I\u2019d run there only once before so was unsure where relief lay. I\u2019m also a woman, so I couldn\u2019t just pull over to the nearest bush or tree and relieve myself discreetly, the way guys do, through the benefits of outdoor plumbing.And then, like a beacon of hope and light, just as the need became painfully pressing, I came across a Porta-Potty. One big problem: It was perched on the side of the road, inches from two lanes of traffic, with a door that opened into those lanes. I waited for a gap in traffic, opened the door, ducked in and did the deed  greatly relieved, but through it all hoping that a stiff wind wouldn\u2019t push me over into the road or that I would meet my demise on my way out. When to go and where to go is a tricky issue for female runners. On training runs, at least I can plan. I make sure my route intersects with at least one coffee shop, fast-food restaurant or that one Porta-Potty in the park near my house that\u2019s always clean. But races can be far more unpredictable. One choice is to throw modesty to the wind and simply bare all. But that involves some deep squatting \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not something that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always easy to do on race-weary legs. The problem is made even worse if, like me, you wear shorts that are tight instead of baggy and must be pulled all the way down to the knees to go. Another option is to give up many precious seconds, or even minutes, waiting in line for a Porta-Potty that may or may not be where you need it, when you need it, and then going through the motions to get out of your shorts, then back into them.Or, you can always just let it go and hope that no one notices. One female runner I know, who asked to remain anonymous, couldn\u2019t get through the bathroom line at the start of the 2013 Philadelphia Marathon. So she let loose as the race started, grateful that she was wearing sweat wicking tights, which she told me dried fast. Where to go isn\u2019t a problem limited to amateurs, either. During the 2005 London Marathon, Paula Radcliffe stopped on the side of the racecourse to relieve herself \u2014 in the sight lines of a media truck \u2014 and then went on to win the race. Before the 2013 Boston Marathon, both Shalane Flanagan and Kara Goucher didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have time to get to a Porta-Potty before the start, so they asked race officials to block the view from the crowds at the start. The officials obliged, using their bodies as a shield.  Now a new solution may soon be available: the Gotta Go running skirt. Skirt Sports, the company that makes the product, plans to release the Gotta Go on a limited basis at the end of May. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a version of its running skirt that includes what the company calls \u00e2\u0080\u009ca trap door and relief hatch.\u00e2\u0080\u009dTo release the hatch, \u201cYou lift the skirt up, open the Velcro from the front, the flap comes down and there\u2019s an opening that\u2019s anatomically positioned,\u201d said Nicole DeBoom, the founder and chief executive of Skirt Sports. The trap door is adjustable, to provide a personalized fit and accommodate women who want to wear sanitary napkins while running as well.The idea for the product, Ms. DeBoom said, came from their customers, who complained about incontinence issues arising from pregnancy, childbirth or aging. She\u2019d also heard from women who told her they wouldn\u2019t drink anything before a race because they didn\u2019t want to have to stop to relieve themselves \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a potentially dangerous situation that could lead to dehydration and serious medical issues. But really: Would anyone buy a skirt with a hole in it? To float the idea, Skirt Sports put up a Facebook post on April Fools\u2019 Day 2015 envisioning \u201csome kind of magical skirt that knows when you\u2019re about to pee and opens up,\u201d Ms. DeBoom said. Some 2,000 female runners responded with their ideas about what they would use the skirt for, with relieving themselves and replacing tampons or sanitary napkins during heavy periods at the top of the list. That led to a Kickstarter campaign, which drew 800 supporters who pledged $75 each. Contributors will receive their Gotta Gos once they become available.Ms. DeBoom says that if the feedback is positive, they\u2019ll consider adding it to Skirt Sports\u2019 regular line in both short and Capri length. Though I\u2019m not a huge fan of running skirts \u2014 the extra swishing bothers me \u2014 at least someone is working on a solution. Until then, I\u2019ll keep waiting in long Porta-Potty lines, or hope I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be able to enlist a fellow runner to shield me should I need to peel off to the side of the road.Or, I could always learn to do what the ultramarathoner Deborah Paquin learned to do: go standing up. She got the idea in the late 1990s, after getting stuck in a Porta-Potty at the start of one race then, in another, accidentally mooning a fellow runner. \u201cI needed to find a better way,\u201d she said. After a few mishaps, she found success \u201cif I tilted my pelvis under a little and spread my legs wide enough and really engage my abs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Personally, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m up for the trial and error.Related:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s Cloud Business Lifts Its Profit to a Record", "Date": "2016-04-28", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 Amazon delivered a blowout quarter on Thursday, joining Facebook as one of the rare bright spots in a technology sector that has recently produced a string of disappointing earnings reports.Helped by its fast-growing Amazon Web Services business, the company jumped to the most profitable quarter in its nearly 22-year history.Amazon often flip-flops between showing profits and losses, depending on how aggressively it decides to plow money into big new business bets. Investors have granted the company much wider leeway to do so than other technology companies of its size often receive, because of its history of delivering outsize growth.Revenue at the company rose to $29.13 billion from $22.72 billion a year ago.\u201cThe fact that they\u2019re profitable is a big deal,\u201d said Christian Magoon, chief executive of Amplify Investments, a fund manager that counts Amazon as a top holding. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a big deal after some of the disappointing numbers from Apple and others.\u201dThe results were well above the average estimates of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters for earnings of 58 cents a share and revenue of $27.98 billion.\u201cI saw the number, and I thought, \u2018O.K., did I read this wrong?\u2019\u201d Mr. Magoon added. \u201cThe beat was big. On the income side, it was fantastic.\u201dFor the last four quarters, Amazon has run in the black, even if it is still not quite as profitable as some technology companies. Facebook, by contrast, reported that its net income for the first three months of the year tripled to $1.5 billion from a year earlier.The biggest source of the company\u2019s profits is Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing business that started just over a decade ago and is now on track to bring in more than $10 billion a year in revenue. A.W.S., as the business is known, is the most popular cloud service for start-ups and for a growing number of big companies that want to rent computing capacity, rather than run their own hardware and software.Cloud computing is also much more profitable than Amazon\u2019s North American retail business, which runs on thinner margins, and its international retail business, which runs at a loss. The operating income for A.W.S. more than tripled in the quarter to $604 million.The profits from A.W.S. represented 56 percent of Amazon\u2019s total operating income, even though the $2.57 billion in revenue from A.W.S. \u2014 up 64 percent from a year earlier \u2014 amounted to less than 9 percent of total revenue.On a conference call, Brian Olsavsky, Amazon\u2019s chief financial officer, said the company continued to make hefty long-term investments in initiatives, singling out original content for its Prime video service.In a statement announcing the earnings, Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, highlighted the performance of another growing area of investment \u2014 hardware devices \u2014 though with the lack of detail that has often characterized Amazon disclosures. He said customers bought twice as many Fire tablets during the first quarter as they did a year earlier, and he said the company could not keep its Echo intelligent speaker in stock.Last year, Amazon reached $100 billion in annual sales. Investors believe that even at that size, the company can become a lot bigger because online commerce still represents a relatively small portion of total retail sales. Online sales in 2016 are expected to reach about $385 billion in the United States, or 8 percent of total retail sales, according to eMarketer, a technology research firm.Amazon is the rare technology company of its size to still deliver double-digit revenue growth. The company\u2019s retail sales in North America jumped 27 percent to almost $17 billion for the quarter, while its international retail sales rose 24 percent to $9.57 billion.Amazon said revenue in the current quarter is expected to be between $28 billion and $30.5 billion, with operating income between $375 million and $975 million.Advertisement"}

They typically are based on a decades-old formula for determining maximum and desirable heart rates. Each of us has a maximum, which is the point at which our heart cannot beat any harder, no matter how strenuously we exert ourselves. Your heart rate plateaus at that point.The old-fashioned formula for determining maximum heart rate requires subtracting our age from 220.But in recent years, researchers have found that this formula typically overestimates or underestimates any given person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actual maximum heart rate by as much as 15 beats per minute, and sometimes even more.Unfortunately, the charts then rely on the same outdated formula to suggest \u00e2\u0080\u009cheart rate zones\u00e2\u0080\u009d that people should stay within to gain either the greatest exercise response or to keep their hearts safe. Most of us, if we slavishly stick to the suggested heart rates on those charts, are likely to find that we either do not feel as if we are exercising hard enough or that we are pushing ourselves more than feels comfortable, because our personal maximum heart rate does not comply with some mythical \u00e2\u0080\u009caverage.\u00e2\u0080\u009dA stress test can determine your exact maximum heart rate, which you can then use to set your own \u00e2\u0080\u009ctraining zones.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In general, most fitness experts advise working out at between 70 to 85 percent of your maximum heart rate to gain the most health and fitness benefits. You also can ditch the heart rate monitor and listen closely to your body. Rank each workout on a scale of 1 to 10. Ten would be the hardest exertion that is possible for you. Exercise that feels like an 8 or so should be comparable to about 80 percent of your maximum heart rate but, unlike the heart rate charts at gyms, would be personalized to your body.But of course, consult with a doctor before changing your exercise routine, particularly if you have heart problems, and stop exercising if you feel unwell or have any symptoms such as chest pain.Related:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

Trump's stance against a North Carolina law barring transgender people from bathrooms and locker rooms that do not match the gender on their birth certificates.The post featured a crude photograph of an overweight man in women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clothing and a wig, along with the message, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLET HIM IN! to the restroom with your daughter or else you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a narrow-minded, judgmental, unloving racist bigot who needs to die.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn a statement, ESPN called itself an \u00e2\u0080\u009cinclusive company\u00e2\u0080\u009d and said Mr. Schilling was told that \u00e2\u0080\u009chis conduct was unacceptable and his employment with ESPN has been terminated.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMany social conservatives were quick to condemn Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comments, saying he could face a backlash, especially among voters in the Republican base, some of whom are already skeptical of his past support of abortion rights.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of Republicans that are very uncomfortable with this issue, to say the least, or think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ridiculous that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going down this path and some people believe putting our children at risk,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Greg Mueller, a conservative strategist. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor somebody who is trying to build a coalition of conservatives and evangelicals, and then maybe some Democratic votes to get you into the White House, you are taking somewhat of a political risk in the position he took this morning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cHis instincts are wrong on our core values,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe has spent his life surrounded by Manhattan elites who have never shopped in a Target. Of course he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get the outrage. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if this will ultimately hurt him but it should.\u00e2\u0080\u009dRepublican primary voters next head to the polls on Tuesday in a series of more socially moderate, Northeastern states, where Mr. Trump is unlikely to pay a political penalty. But his comments could hurt him in states like Indiana, which votes on May 3, or California, which votes on June 7 and contains many conservative pockets.Bruce Haynes, a Republican strategist and founding partner of Purple Strategies, said that, like many of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comments that seem defy Republican orthodoxy, this one is unlikely to dramatically affect the contours of the presidential race.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not really sure it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of those things that changes votes at this point,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Haynes said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think voters who are big picture, big economy voters, are probably already with Trump, and I think voters who are very issue centric, and certainly social conservatives, are already with Cruz.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBut, Mr. Hayes added, the comments could provide Mr. Cruz with an opening to help him win over unbound delegates \u00e2\u0080\u0094 currently the shadow fight playing out between Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSince convention delegates tend to be more socially conservative than the primary electorate at large, it could be another wedge issue that Cruz tries to use to peel off second and third ballot delegates or to prevent Trump from picking up unbound delegates on the first ballot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

Trump paid his first-ever visit to the September 11 Memorial Museum on Saturday, a gesture on a rainy day that was unmistakably aimed at Senator Ted Cruz with the New York primary a little more than a week away.Mr. Trump\u2019s foundation also made a contribution of $100,000 to the museum, a spokesman for the nonprofit organization, Michael Frazier, confirmed. It was the first Trump-associated donation to the museum, which took years to complete and was steered mostly by the former mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, who secured donations for years and serves as its chairman.The tour was led by the museum president, Joe Daniels, and lasted just under 30 minutes. Mr. Trump and his wife, Melania, left their black Suburban around 12:20 p.m. and entered the service entrance on West Street. Mr. Trump did not stop to look at the outdoor memorial, which was coated in rain, where the names of the victims are engraved.Mr. Trump has pointed to the city\u2019s resilience after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center as an example of New York at its best. Mr. Cruz has tried to portray Mr. Trump as too liberal for the Republican Party, and said before the Iowa caucuses that the real estate developer represents \u201cNew York values.\u201dMr. Cruz is fighting to keep Mr. Trump, who is leading in statewide polling, below 50 percent of the vote in the April 19 primary. Mr. Trump and his aides have sought to remind voters of the \u201cNew York values\u201d remark, and they have had plenty of help in doing so from the city\u2019s tabloids.Reporters who were invited late on Friday to join Mr. Trump for the museum visit, which was not on his schedule, were kept in a media van as he entered the museum. An aide said he would speak with reporters afterward, but Mr. Trump then decided against it. His aides sent out a photo of the Trumps inside the museum about 90 minutes later, along with a statement saying that the rebuilding of ground zero was \u201cwhat \u2018New York values\u2019 are really about.\u201dThe donation check was from Mr. Trump\u2019s foundation, not from him personally. He had been approached over the years by people trying to raise money for the museum, but he never did, until Saturday.People inside the museum posted on Twitter about the surprise of finding Mr. Trump and his entourage there. Some said they were aggravated that he was there, while others simply posted photos, including one dimly lit shot of Mr. Trump in front of a wall of photos of some of the victims.https://www.twitter.com/WhatCaySay/status/718838717075562496Rudolph W. Giuliani, the mayor at the time of the attacks and a friend of Mr. Trump, said that it was wise of him to cancel the discussion with reporters outside the museum.\u201cThat was classy, that he decided not to do it,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said in a phone interview. He said that Mr. Trump might be criticized no matter what he did, but that he had no issues with a candidate making their first visit to the museum during a political season.\u201cI think if you\u2019re running in New York, you should go to show respect,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said, pointing out that the museum is a haunting experience for some people. \u201cI could also see why up until now you might not do it.\u201dBut others were troubled that Mr. Trump brought media in the first place.\u201cOf the tens of millions of people from all over the world who have come to the place where so many people died, and where so many heroes sacrificed their lives to save others, Mr. Trump may be the only one to bring along the press to chronicle his first visit,\u201d said Debra Burlingame, who lost her brother, Charles, the pilot of the American Airlines flight that crashed into the Pentagon. \u201cI leave it to the public to judge his timing and motives.\u201d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Target Steps Out in Front of Bathroom Choice Debate", "Date": "2016-04-27", "News": "Supported byA new policy over bathroom choice has thrust the retailer Target into the center of a nationwide debate over gender identity, civil rights and privacy.The company\u2019s announcement \u2014 the most prominent position taken by a national retailer \u2014 was greeted by cheers from supporters of transgender rights. It has since also made Target the intense focus of conservative activists, lawmakers and consumers, who oppose the company\u2019s stance, highlighting the potential risks when a company takes a position on a hotly debated social issue.\u201cI will no longer be shopping at your store and neither will any of my family members and friends,\u201d one person commented on Target\u2019s Facebook page. \u201cYou have all lost your minds.\u201dEquipped with a growing arsenal of digital tools to organize boycotts, spread poor reviews and otherwise negatively impact sales, consumers are increasingly putting pressure on companies to address their concerns. Policies on gender and sexuality have repeatedly become points of contention, putting some businesses on the front lines of battles over social issues.Last year, for example, a number of companies vocally opposed so-called religious freedom laws intended to give businesses legal cover to deny services to gays and lesbians. Walmart, the nation\u2019s largest retailer, was among the most prominent voices, and its influence was widely credited with pushing the governor in its home state of Arkansas to sign an amended version of the state\u2019s religious freedom bill.And the head of Chick-fil-A, the restaurant chain, took a position against gay marriage in 2012 only to back off two years later and say that he had not meant to alienate customers.\u201cGenerally speaking, as you saw in the gay marriage debate, the big corporations tend to be out in front of Congress and most of the states in implementing anti-discrimination policies,\u201d said William Eskridge, a professor at Yale Law School and a co-author of \u201cSexuality, Gender and the Law.\u201d\u201cThe policies generally do not cost the corporations anything or very much, and they create some degree of good will,\u201d he said.The ordinance in Oxford would make it a misdemeanor for people to use bathrooms that do not correspond to the gender on their birth certificates. Target\u2019s liability in such a situation is unclear.A company spokeswoman, Molly Snyder, said Target would comply with all local laws. But she also said, \u201cOur belief in and commitment to inclusivity has not changed.\u201dMs. Snyder said the company\u2019s policy had applied to employees for years, though it had not been as widely distributed. She referred to the original announcement, which said that Target \u201cregularly\u201d assesses issues that could affect business, guests and employees, and \u201cgiven the specific questions\u201d raised by recent legislative proposals, \u201cwe felt it was important to state our position.\u201dTarget may be betting on a more progressive shift in national attitudes on gender and sexuality. Many states have updated their statutes barring employers from discriminating based on sexual identity to include gender identity, too.\u201cMaking these progressive value statements is a new form of advertising,\u201d said Jonah Berger, an associate professor of marketing at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.\u201cAny employer that has a rule to the contrary is going to find itself in very hot water,\u201d said Jillian T. Weiss, a professor of law and society at Ramapo College who has worked on a number of cases involving transgender workplace issues. \u201cCompanies have got to be aware that federal law essentially prohibits them from having rules like the one passed in Alabama.\u201dOther companies, including Barnes & Noble and Hudson\u2019s Bay Company, also have policies explicitly allowing transgender people to use a bathroom that does not correspond to their birth certificate gender.\u201cWe\u2019re hoping that other corporations will see that there is a price to pay, potentially at least, for pushing this L.G.B.T. agenda too far,\u201d said Tim Wildmon, the president of the American Family Association. \u201cWe just think this is a bridge too far.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Every Day\u2019s a Holiday (or Two)", "Date": "2016-04-14", "News": "Supported byCultural StudiesHolidays have always been occasion for angst, ambivalence and sometimes, despite everything, genuine celebration. The greeting card industry has long mastered the art of amplifying holidays to tug at our impulses, whether generous or guilty. But the Internet and its social media accomplices have upped the ante, fabricating new holidays and ushering other time-honored rituals, solemn observations and family quarrels into the ether, where they are louder than ever.Private rituals are now public. Communal events are worldwide. Everyone is invited, and please bring a smartphone.Some of this leads to a genuine expansion of the holiday spirit. But given the multitude of noteworthy occasions, it\u2019s hard to keep up with all the celebrating.In this socially aware holidaysphere, not only are you meant to post an image of your own Passover plate, you\u2019re to scroll through everyone else\u2019s buffet and like it. With all the sharing and hearting, if you don\u2019t hop on the holiday bandwagon, you feel as if you\u2019re violating some kind of invisible social contract.\u201cThere\u2019s always been Thanksgiving and Halloween and Christmas, but suddenly this year, it seemed like there were all these photos of Easter dinner,\u201d said Whitney Joiner, a senior features editor at Hearst Digital Media. \u201cThere were people celebrating boozy Easter brunches! It made it seem like Easter was this big national holiday we were all supposed to be celebrating.\u201dAnd there\u2019s so much more to celebrate. Sure, some of the latest holidays exist purely in the confines of the cloud. No reasonable person is going to grab the nearest vegan because of Hug a Vegetarian Day. But other \u201cmicroholidays\u201d or hashtag holidays have crossed over into the real world.Susan McPherson, 51, a corporate responsibility consultant, was invited last year for the first time to a pie party in observation of Pi Day. \u201cThere were tons of pies,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course, I posted a picture; the pies were so beautiful.\u201dWhether they originated as public relations opportunities or alleviators of boredom, these gratuitous celebrations can stir some of the same emotions the old stalwarts do. And just like traditional holidays, the new ones can manage to make you feel full and empty at the same time. \u201cHolidays online can be a wonderful way to feel like you\u2019re not alone in the world,\u201d Ms. McPherson said. \u201cBut it can also make you feel like the loneliest person in the world.\u201dAt the same time, social media celebrations can be a boon to the lonesome. \u201cHolidays online are a way for me to take the air out of how lonely it can be,\u201d said Tim Federle, an author and co-writer of the Broadway musical \u201cTuck Everlasting.\u201d \u201cOne Valentine\u2019s Day, I saw a heart-shaped balloon sticking out of a garbage can, and I took a photo and posted it on Facebook with the caption \u2018Too soon!\u2019 It got so many likes, it really bolstered me.\u201dIn some cases, offline holidays have migrated into the ether. Andrea Schneider, a director of product management at the Internal Revenue Service who lives in Bethesda, Md., recently started observing Rosh Hashana online. She, her husband and their two children curl up on the sofa and stream a service they like at a synagogue in Ohio. \u201cAt services around here, I always felt a little lonely without my entire extended family,\u201d Ms. Schneider said. \u201cWatching online with my kids, I feel like I get back some of the feeling of togetherness I was looking for.\u201d Friends of hers have set up a Google Hangout where they light Sabbath candles together.On the Internet, all are included: distant relatives and friends, elderly aunts and sick grandparents can be virtually drawn into a physical gathering they may otherwise miss. This used to happen post facto, when photographs were mailed; now celebrants keep cellphones by their side throughout dinner, posting images as they eat. But it can take away some of the intimacy and informality.Jen Nedeau, director of strategic communications at Bully Pulpit Interactive, said, \u201cSocial media brings us to a community table where we get to experience holidays in the same room.\u201d As she sees it, social media functions the way Hallmark used to, helping us figure out which holidays matter to us, and fostering communities that mimic the experience of small towns where everyone can digitally laugh together at what Grandma just said.Pamela Paul is the editor of The New York Times Book Review.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For News Outlets Squeezed From the Middle, It\u2019s Bend or Bust", "Date": "2016-04-17", "News": "Supported byMediatorGrandkids: It was not so long ago \u2014 oh, say, five, maybe six years \u2014 that traditional news organizations like this one could laugh at BuzzFeed\u2019s gag along with everyone else, smugly secure. An exploding watermelon was just an exploding watermelon.Well, not really. We may not yet be the watermelon. But executives who run news organizations almost universally say that we\u2019d all better find our own watermelons \u2014 and find them yesterday.It means big changes are coming fast in the way major news institutions present their journalism, what that journalism includes, and how decisions are made about what to include. The goal: to draw big, addicted audiences.A lot of it is being done in the rushed panic that comes with the demands of quarterly earnings. And yet, given the highest calling of the news industry \u2014 hold politicians to account, unearth corruption \u2014 the importance to our political and civic life could not be greater.A good way to understand the fast-evolving thinking is to check in on people who are trying to build a news and information business from scratch. I did that last week over breakfast with Jim VandeHei, a co-founder of Politico, and Mike Allen, one of the site\u2019s best-known journalists. Both are also veterans of The Washington Post.Mr. VandeHei, who stepped down last week as Politico\u2019s chief executive, and Roy Schwartz, the company\u2019s departing chief revenue officer, have been seeking potential investors and video and television partners. Mr. Allen is for the time being continuing to write his vital morning tip sheet at Politico, \u201cPlaybook,\u201d seven days a week.When I met with Mr. VandeHei and Mr. Allen, they were tight-lipped about their next venture. They would only describe it in the broadest terms, as \u201ca media company\u201d that will focus on news and information, exist largely on mobile devices and social media, and not directly compete against Politico.But that was O.K. for my purposes. I was more interested in hearing what this venture wouldn\u2019t be doing. Their answers may require a trigger warning for the proudly ink-stained set.It starts with Mr. VandeHei\u2019s admittedly provocative proposition that \u201cjournalists are killing journalism.\u201d They\u2019re doing this, he says, by \u201cstubbornly clinging to the old ways.\u201d That\u2019s defined as producing 50 competing but nearly identical stories about a presidential candidate\u2019s latest speech, or 700-word updates on the transportation budget negotiations.Survival, Mr. VandeHei says, depends on giving readers what they really want, how they want it, when they want it, and on not spending too much money producing what they don\u2019t want.It\u2019s not only about creating big audiences for advertisers, he and Mr. Allen said. It\u2019s about convincing already-inundated audiences that they want what you\u2019re producing, and they want it so badly that they will pay for it through subscriptions. That\u2019s essential as advertising revenue drops to levels that will not support robust news gathering.Hooking people on your news product is a lot harder than, say, hooking them on heroin or even coffee. But news organizations have ways they never had before to figure it out.This is the biggest and least talked about development in traditional print media as it converts to digital: It now has ratings, just as television does.That\u2019s a big deal, and in Mr. VandeHei\u2019s and Mr. Allen\u2019s view \u2014 as well as those of the bosses at The Times, The Post and elsewhere \u2014 it shows that big, important work will prove more valuable than fun stunts that may or may not draw big online audiences.\u201cWe didn\u2019t know if, in a newspaper, people were reading our 600-word piece on the transportation markup on A10 \u2014 now we do,\u201d Mr. VandeHei said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying you let the audience dictate everything, but a smart, aggressive, forward-leaning media company is going to write what it thinks is important and its audience thinks is important.\u201dThis is talk you hear in newsrooms across the country, and it\u2019s where there is some cause for concern.Once ratings come into the picture, will reporters still want to pursue those smaller stories? And will their editors, who once called these stories \u201cspinach,\u201d want to publish them?The answer from Mr. VandeHei and like-minded news executives is yes, but it\u2019s incumbent upon news organizations to do a better job with them \u2014 make them shorter and more distinctive, with data and striking visual presentation.Understood. All I\u2019m asking is that we be careful not to lose too many core values on our way to the future. Otherwise, it\u2019s watermelon flamb\u00e9 at the Kardashian inauguration, and yes, we\u2019re the watermelon.The Mediator column on Monday, about traditional media\u2019s difficulties in competing for attention with social media stunts, including wild videos, misidentified the country in which a train was shown on video going through a narrow alleyway.

Chavez\u2019s 1,000-mile hike, known as the \u201ccaminata,\u201d from the Mexican border to the agricultural heartland of the Central Valley, galvanized support for better wages and working conditions. Paging through the book \u201cThe Crusades of Cesar Chavez,\u201d by the journalist Miriam Pawel, Ms. Plumb, who had recently retired from San Jose State University, decided to finally go through her old work and opened the boxes.The summer of 1975 came rushing back like a hot wind in the valley.Celestino Rivas, an organizer, shrouded in fog as workers listened. The Amezcua family marching together. Anonymous musicians carrying their instruments along a road. \u201cI was like, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh, wow, look at this one,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u200a\u201d she recalled, using a stronger word than \u201cwow.\u201d She added, \u201cI thought the work was better than I had thought at the time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u201cI had never really seen photos like hers,\u201d Ms. Pawel said. \u201cShe had a different eye and a different focus and intuitively focused on the farmworkers as opposed to the leadership of the movement, and that made her photos really different.\u201dIndeed, many of the images stand out. Ms. Plumb found one of Chavez she had never printed before. But what really drew her eye, the true treasures of the project, she said, were the scores of shots of the workers, many anonymous or their names lost to time, doing the painstaking work of persuading field workers, mostly impoverished Mexican immigrants or their descendants, to join the cause.Ms. Plumb gained entree to their world through Bob Barber, a journalist who made introductions before she ventured out on her own. His recordings of interviews and rallies and meetings provide the site\u00e2\u0080\u0099s audio. Ms. Plumb, who grew up in Northern California suburbs and was a San Francisco Art Institute student at the time, did not speak Spanish, but through her youthful charm, she said, she broke down whatever barriers with her subjects.She used a small, discreet camera favored at the time, a Leica M2R with a 35-millimeter lens, sometimes a 50 for close-ups. \u201cI don\u2019t let myself edit myself that much,\u201d she said. \u201cI took pictures very rapidly and kept my fingers crossed that I would get something. It\u2019s a net that I threw out there. It\u2019s not more thought out than that.\u201dMs. Plumb quickly discerned the importance of the movement, but rather than photograph Chavez or the union offices, she felt drawn to the workers in the fields.

{"Headline": "Poll Watch: Just How Competitive Is the New York Primary?", "Date": "2016-04-13", "News": "On the Democratic side, Senator Bernie Sanders is running hard against Hillary Clinton, and has pulled even with her upstate, according to most polls. But more than two-thirds of New York\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Democratic votes will likely be cast in the New York metropolitan area, and Mrs. Clinton leads by double digits there.In the Republican race, which uses a winner-take-most system, Donald J. Trump has a commanding lead across most demographics \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and he stands a chance to achieve an outright delegate sweep.Mrs. Clinton fares especially well in the New York City suburbs, where her lead is almost 20 points, and she maintains a 13-point lead in the five boroughs, but that is down from her 24-point advantage in early February.In 2008, when Mrs. Clinton ran for president against Senator Barack Obama, she won every borough. The race was closest in Brooklyn, the most populous borough and where both Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton have campaigned hard.White voters, though, have been crucial to Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s success, and they make up a minority of Brooklyn residents, as they do in Queens and the Bronx. Statewide, where about one-third of all residents are black or Latino, the candidates\u00e2\u0080\u0099 patterns of support appear familiar. Mrs. Clinton leads by about 2-to-1 with black voters, and by a slimmer 12-point margin among Latinos, according to the Siena poll. She holds an almost 20-point lead among women. The rivals are effectively tied among whites and among men.Though Mr. Sanders would be the first Jewish presidential nominee, Mrs. Clinton pulls some of her strongest support from New York\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Jewish voters, six in 10 of whom back her. Mr. Sanders does best with those who do not identify as Roman Catholic, Protestant or Jewish; he takes a slim majority of these voters.On the Republican side, about half of likely voters identify as Catholic \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and a majority live outside of New York City and its suburbs. Mr. Trump is stronger in the metropolitan area, but even upstate he leads Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, his closest rival, by double digits, according to the Siena poll. Upstate is the only part of the state where he does not command an outright majority, the poll found.In the fight to prevent Mr. Trump from sweeping all of the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 95 delegates, two things are in play. First, most delegates are district-bound, and the winner of each congressional district gets all of its delegates. The other route to averting a Trump blowout runs through New York\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 14 at-large delegates. They will be allotted proportionally only if the winner does not take an outright majority of the vote statewide. (Even then, candidates must win at least 20 percent of the vote to receive delegates.)This will not be easy. Even among upstate voters, Mr. Trump has the highest favorability rating of the three candidates, with 57 percent expressing a positive opinion of him. He wins a majority of voters statewide with family incomes below $100,000 a year, and he takes 45 percent of those earning more, according to the Siena poll. Mr. Trump is particularly popular among men \u00e2\u0080\u0093 54 percent support him \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and voters with a union member in their household, who support him 55 percent of the time.Giovanni Russonello is a member of The Times\u00e2\u0080\u0099s news surveys department.This is one of an occasional series of posts taking a deeper look at polling during this campaign cycle.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

He told Reuters that it was his idea to invite the senator.At the end of a week of rising tension between Mr. Sanders and Hillary Clinton, the Clinton campaign appeared to relish the situation. Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, gleefully re-posted a report on Twitter indicating that the Vatican was angered by its dealings with Mr. Sanders.Mr. Sanders tried to move beyond the controversy and stressed his fondness for the pope and the importance of his visit. In an interview on Friday, he said Pope Francis had played a \u00e2\u0080\u009cprofound role in raising consciousness throughout the world, not just within the Catholic community but within all communities.\u201d\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo me, this a source of real pride and excitement that I have been invited to speak to a major conference at the Vatican on how we can create a world economy that is moral and how we address the massive levels of wealth and income inequality that exist around the world, how we deal with unemployment, how we deal with poverty and how we create an economy that works for all people rather than the few,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said.On MSNBC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d Mr. Sanders explained that while he disagreed with Pope Francis on issues relating to women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rights and gay rights, he admired the pope for speaking about income inequality and the need for people to help one another.Mr. Sanders also addressed his clashes with Mrs. Clinton this week over their respective qualifications to be president and tried to soften some of the recent rancor.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the truth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said during a town-hall-style event on NBC. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve known Hillary Clinton for 25 years.

An 11 percent drop in revenue for the first three months of the year puts an exclamation point on the lack of progress in almost four years with Marissa Mayer as chief executive. Google and Facebook are cleaning up in digital advertising, especially mobile. It\u2019s time to offload Yahoo\u2019s core business before bidders like Verizon lose interest.Ms. Mayer\u2019s enthusiasm is unflagging. Even after the poor showing reported on Tuesday, which included an operating loss of $167 million, she keeps talking about her ability to kick-start growth while considering other alternatives. It\u2019s hard to see what options are left.Yahoo\u2019s so-called mavens are moving at an analog pace. This Mayer-named collection of mobile, social, native and video ads represent a little more than a third of Yahoo\u2019s top line and grew only 7 percent in the first quarter. By comparison, Facebook\u2019s mobile-ad revenue increased 81 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier and accounted for nearly the entire $5.8 billion generated.Most companies put a gloss on themselves when they are up for sale to woo suitors. Yahoo, a $35 billion company that has lurched from strategy to strategy, is struggling to manage even that. Ms. Mayer is making potential bidders listen to prerecorded messages while providing little financial detail, according to media reports. It suggests that there may be something messy inside or that the chief executive isn\u2019t especially keen to sell.Despite having to press for the pitch book, suitors are showing interest nonetheless. The telecom titan Verizon Communications signaled it would bid in an attempt to marry Yahoo with AOL, which it acquired last year for $4 billion. The private-equity firm TPG Capital and the digital-advertising remains of the phone-book publisher Yellow Pages also may be in the mix.Some potential bidders have already hung up on Yahoo. Comcast, AT&T, Time and Barry Diller\u2019s Internet hodgepodge IAC are among those that media reports say considered making offers but did not.Yahoo expects the second quarter to be even worse, with at least a 12 percent decline in sales from a year ago.

Armenians commemorate April 24, 1915, as the start of the genocide by the Ottoman Empire, and it is generally said to have continued through 1917. The Armenian population went from some two million to fewer than 400,000 by 1922, as some 1.5 million were killed in what most historians consider a genocide. There were executions into mass graves, and death marches of men, women and children to concentration camps with many dying along the way. The Turkish government disputes many of these accounts and rejects the term genocide.Ms. Armenakyan, 39, grew up in Armenia while it was still under Soviet control and learned only the basic facts of the genocide in school. The government, she said, discouraged any sense of Armenian identity.Most of the survivors she photographed \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in their 90s or over 100 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 were children when they escaped the violence. Afterward, they survived the extreme hardships under Stalin and during World War II.

{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Privacy Watchdogs Call for Changes to U.S. Data-Transfer Deal", "Date": "2016-04-13", "News": "Supported byThe agreement, the so-called E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield, which would allow companies to continue sending personal data back and forth across the Atlantic, is still widely expected to be ratified by early summer. But by sounding the alarm over the current deal, national privacy watchdogs from France, Germany and other European Union member states have served notice that American companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon could face protracted country-by-country legal battles.The regulators say they worry that companies could misuse data, including information from search engine queries and social media posts. They also say they fear that American law enforcement and intelligence agencies might gain access to European citizens\u2019 personal information without sufficient safeguards in place.\u201cFrom the outside, it must look like Europe can\u2019t speak with one voice on privacy,\u201d said Patrick van Eecke, a data protection lawyer at DLA Piper in Brussels. \u201cThis is becoming kind of a circus.\u201dAnd the protest from the regulators signals that they could open cases and levy fines on companies that rely on moving data such as employees\u2019 financial information or social media posts across the Atlantic.As part of their announcement on Wednesday, European national privacy regulators said the data-transfer agreement was an improvement on previous rules. But they added that they remained concerned over American intelligence agencies\u2019 seemingly indiscriminate access to citizens\u2019 personal data when it is transferred to the United States.That access, according to the privacy watchdogs, is not subject to protections that match those currently offered in Europe. The regulators also said that new legal mechanisms to allow Europeans to monitor how their data is used in the United States needed to be strengthened.Ms. Falque-Pierrotin called on the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union that negotiated the data-transfer pact, to make further changes to the deal to meet the regulators\u2019 concerns.Those included fears that the indiscriminate bulk collection of Europeans\u2019 data by United States and European intelligence agencies failed to comply with the region\u2019s data protection rules. The privacy agencies also said the independence of a United States ombudsman reviewing European data protection complaints had to be strengthened.Vera Jourova, the European justice commissioner, said in a statement on Wednesday that she would try to incorporate the regulators\u2019 views into the final Privacy Shield pact, though she did not say which of the proposals would be included.But Ms. Jourova also emphasized that attention should now turn to getting European countries\u2019 approval for the data-transfer agreement by next month.\u201cI count on data protection authorities to help ensure that the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield works well in practice,\u201d she said.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.American officials contend that new oversight mechanisms \u2014 including an ombudsman in the State Department to handle European data queries \u2014 sufficiently protect privacy. They also say that American safeguards over how national intelligence agencies gain access to personal data go beyond what is available in many countries in the European Union.Despite Europe\u2019s national regulators raising concerns over Privacy Shield, legal experts and policy makers still expect the agreement to be approved by European countries by early summer.That is because the European Commission has the sole power to agree to the new rules, and because some countries, particularly the likes of Britain and Ireland, where many American technology companies have headquarters, have given their support to the trans-Atlantic deal.It remains unclear how the European Commission will alter Privacy Shield to answer national regulators\u2019 concerns, though it is unlikely that European officials will reopen negotiations with their American counterparts.\u201cNo national regulator wants to put companies in a legal limbo,\u201d said Alexander Whalen, a senior policy manager at Digital Europe, an industry body whose members include Google and Microsoft. \u201cWe\u2019re now in a waiting game.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the surname of a senior policy manager at Digital Europe. He is Alexander Whalen, not Whelan.Advertisement"}

The capitalist class is screwing us over.The rich people of the world who buy our labor for a pittance reap all the profits and use tax havens to avoid the tax man. As a result, the tax burden is disproportionately shifted to those of us who cannot afford elaborate tax schemes.This leak is big. It should be consequential. Heads should roll.

I was desperate to leave \u2014 or to scream at him \u2014 but I would never abandon my mom in the same way the Catholic Church has abandoned half my family.As for this encyclical \u2014 far too little, far too late.Consider the story of the two brothers, Villanova\u2019s Kris Jenkins, adopted by North Carolina junior Nate Britt\u2019s mother in 2007, who happens to hit the final shot that breaks his brother\u2019s heart.Or consider in the crowd, the old basketball coach, Rollie Massimino, who coached Villanova to a shocking upset of the mighty Hoyas of Georgetown, led by Patrick Ewing in 1985.Or consider Michael Jordan in the crowd and his interview with Craig Sager, who is battling cancer, and Michael asking, \u201cHow you feeling?\u201d and then saying, \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, brother.\u201dThen consider the game with its ebbs and flows, and the incredible double-pump shot by Paige to tie the game, then Jenkins\u2019 improbable game ending shot.What a game!I would be so thankful that his timeline crossed with mine before we went our separate ways in life.And, most of all, I would be thankful that Bernie Sanders was able to teach my children that not everything is rotten in Washington, D.C., and that \u201cgovernment of the people, by the people, for the people\u201d are not simply a few words from the most famous American speech, but a call to action, a call never to be forgotten, as we strive through generations to achieve a just and equitable society.This article received more than 3,000 comments.Kasich did not \u201ceviscerate voting rights in Ohio\u201d; in fact, in many instances, he moderated the positions of the more conservative Republicans who control both houses in the legislature.In the end, I firmly believe Kasich is the only candidate who could take on the massive budget deficits which are looming, and that\u2019s enough to get my support.This article received more than 1,125 comments.After our shift at the factory was over, I would often go out with some of the older guys for a beer before heading home. I\u2019ll never forget the afternoon when someone dropped a few quarters in the juke box and I heard for the first time Merle Haggard singing \u201cWorkin\u2019 Man Blues.\u201dThat is when I realized what real country music was and why Merle was the poet of the common man.There are so many great country songs \u2014 you can never really pick just one as the best.

The favoritism was obvious, even though I think they did love their children.In the end, my friend killed herself in her twenties. She had many challenges, but I think the first and perhaps the most lasting was the pain of believing she would never be good enough for her parents.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Outshone by Smaller Screens, PCs Aim to Be Seen as Cool Again", "Date": "2016-04-03", "News": "Supported byPALO ALTO, Calif. \u2014 Dion Weisler, the chief executive of HP Inc., recently held out a bulky laptop that was the pride of 2012. \u201cThis is the laptop we had when I came here,\u201d he said.He opened it to reveal another HP laptop within its hollowed-out insides. Then he opened that machine to produce another smaller and lighter laptop. Like the last in a set of nested Russian dolls, a final and even more slender laptop emerged from inside the third machine.\u201cPretty spectacular, right?\u201d said Mr. Weisler, a toothy and optimistic Australian.It was an impressive visual trick \u2014 and one with a point. On Tuesday, Mr. Weisler will publicly introduce a personal computer similar to the slimmest one he brought out of the nested machines, with a 13.3-inch screen but even thinner. At less than 11 millimeters thick (less than half an inch), he said, it beats the best effort by Apple and shows that HP\u2019s PCs are still hip and innovative. In fact, HP has made a small number of the new slim laptops in gold and diamonds, to be sold for $25,000 each for charity, with the unveiling planned for a New York Times Luxury Conference in Paris.HP\u2019s new laptop, called Spectre, underlines the lengths to which PC makers must now go to attract customer attention. Apart from HP, PC makers like Dell and Lenovo are also pumping money into the design of desktop and laptop computers, coming up with increasingly sleek machines, as well as \u201ctwo in ones,\u201d whose screens detach to become tablets. There are PCs that fit in a pocket, understand voice and gesture, or sense when they need repairs and call on their own for a remote tuneup.The sales decline was just the latest in several years when the PC market faced an onslaught of smartphones and tablets as cooler alternatives. The falloff is expected to level off this year, with PC sales even expected to begin growing slowly in 2017. But that still leaves the question of whether PCs can seem cool again.Even people who depend on the PC industry now lack passion for these onetime miracle products. \u201cIt\u2019s one of many ways onto the Internet now,\u201d Mikako Kitagawa, an analyst at Gartner, said of the PC. \u201cThe big companies are pretty much making similar devices.\u201dThat clearly sticks in the PC industry\u2019s collective craw.\u201cI hear \u2018post-PC era\u2019 and think it\u2019s rubbish,\u201d said Jeff Clarke, president for client solutions at Dell. \u201cWe sell a quarter-billion devices. The installed base is 1.9 billion devices. Maybe it\u2019s taken for granted, but the innovation is second to none.\u201d\u201cIn aggregate, devices like PCs, tablets and smartphones are still growing, but they are also shifting,\u201d said Mr. Weisler, 48, who has spent his career in PCs, working at Acer and Lenovo before joining HP. \u201cYou can create new categories.\u201dTo do that, Mr. Weisler has modestly increased research and development spending and plans to raise that amount. Under Hewlett-Packard\u2019s previous chief executive, Meg Whitman, printing and PCs \u201cdidn\u2019t get investment dollars,\u201d Mr. Weisler said. He also plans to merge HP\u2019s consumer and commercial PC businesses, hoping to bolster the cachet of PCs both at home and at the office.Obstacles remain in the way of Mr. Weisler\u2019s vision. When Hewlett-Packard was one giant company, it was valued at $60 billion. Now HP Inc. and the separate enterprise company, called Hewlett Packard Enterprise, are worth about $53 billion.Even so, he insists on a bright future. On a recent day, he showed off the early results of his push at the company\u2019s Silicon Valley headquarters. One device that looked like a small tablet or a large smartphone could, in fact, be either of those \u2014 or a PC, or a laptop. It worked on its own, or it could fit into a dock attached to a keyboard and a big screen, functioning like a PC. It could also connect wirelessly with a keyboard and folding screen, making it a laptop.Another machine in the room was simply a laptop, but the edges hid a series of quality microphones. It had Internet phone controls built in, and it was designed to open up until it was completely flat. That way it could be used for conference calling, catching voices all around the table.Nearby, HP\u2019s latest printers had lost their moving nozzles in favor of an 8.5-inch bar that spits about a billion dots a second. The company said it could now do laser-quality printing twice as fast and for half the cost, setting it up for the day when 3-D printing becomes commonplace.\u201cWe\u2019re bringing an elegance of design,\u201d Mr. Clarke said, adding that Dell planned to increase spending on research and development.And for all the challenges, Mr. Weisler thinks HP can thrive when PC demand picks up, and it might even get itself some of the shine that surrounds Apple \u2014 which has soared in value on the back of the iPhone \u2014 after the last diamond-encrusted PC leaves his desk.\u201cThere is value in building things that are close to people and understand things like facial expressions,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you focus on building for the high end, your other devices get better, too.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Because the brain is so interconnected, this rogue volume control also affects nausea-, spatial equilibrium, thinking and vision, among other areas.\u201cAnd that\u2019s why you see patients retreat to this dark room,\u201d Dr. Dodick said. \u201cThey\u2019re not depressed, they just can\u2019t handle the light.\u201dImportantly, it\u2019s not the light, per se, that causes the migraine; it only activates those networks. The same story goes for factors like stress, anxiety and depression, according to Dr. Dodick.\u201cWhen you let someone (maybe yourself) get away with thinking of migraine as caused by a trigger,\u201d he wrote, \u201cit either makes it your fault (you ate that cheese after all) or hopeless (you are screwed; you can\u2019t control the weather).\u201dWhen people blame migraines on a person\u2019s failure to control something in their life \u2014 be it anxiety, stress or environmental factors \u2014 they are succumbing to this same scientifically flawed logic.

The twin primaries in the state have the potential to further muddle the Democratic and Republican presidential races.

What reader wouldn\u2019t want to follow them? Hamilton\u2019s debut novel, the first in a planned series, invites us to Miraji, a kind of supernatural Wild West full of shape-shifters and sharpshooters, warring princes and steaming locomotives.Any time a young adult book throws a girl and a guy together, the clock starts running on the countdown to the kiss. But \u201cRebel of the Sands\u201d is not principally a romance. It\u2019s about a girl who disguises herself as a boy and crosses the desert in a terrifying (and sexist) land, discovering along the way who she is and what she\u2019s capable of and how she figures into an epic uprising. When Amani tries to get hired to protect a caravan, an obnoxious competitor laughs at her scrawniness \u2014 so she shoots the booze out of his hand. \u201cYou shot me!\u201d he whines, to which she replies coolly, \u201cNo, I shot your glass.\u202f.\u2008.\u2008. I don\u2019t need a lot of muscle to pull a trigger.\u201d\u201cRebel of the Sands\u201d is a winning bit of storytelling, as well as a homage to storytelling itself. It evokes such disparate influences \u2014 \u201c1,001 Arabian Nights,\u201d Hindu lore and Navajo myth, as well as, inevitably, the triumvirate of Tolkien, Lucas and Rowling \u2014 that at times you wonder whether Hamilton can pull it all off. She can. She has circled a spot on the map and claimed it for her own.Try to be brave, grown-ups. O\u2019Neill\u2019s second novel may be scary, but it is riveting and essential. Teenagers will recognize its difficult truth and devour it \u2014 behind your backs, if need be.Emma O\u2019Donovan, a gorgeous 18-year-old Irish girl, is a snob and a boyfriend stealer. She wields her sexuality like somebody waving a gun. At a party, she drinks heavily, ingests a mysterious drug and hooks up with a local soccer star. And then she is gang-raped and dumped unconscious on her porch.Emma remembers nothing, a small mercy. But photos of the attack have been uploaded to a Facebook page called \u201cEasy Emma,\u201d on which cruel comments bloom by the minute. Her big brother sees it. Her mam. Even her beloved dad, who can\u2019t bear to look at her now.Because the rape comes back to Emma only in flashes, \u201cAsking for It\u201d depicts less violence against women than many TV shows. O\u2019Neill is most interested in capturing the voice in Emma\u2019s head: She\u2019s so traumatized that her first instinct is to apologize to her attackers, and she\u2019s buried under so much shame that she feels as if \u201cthe bones of my skeleton are shifting, moving in like a cage around my heart, squeezing all the air out of my lungs.\u201d You may be staggered by Emma\u2019s inability to make a self-respecting decision, even as her story goes international. But you\u2019ll be lit up with pain and rage on her behalf, and grateful for the few who stand by her. Emma always seems incontrovertibly real. What\u2019s terrifying is that the world she lives in \u2014 full of misogyny and deep, communal denial \u2014 does too.The cover of Wallach\u2019s second novel (after the best-selling \u201cWe All Looked Up\u201d) looks like a still from a lost Wes Anderson movie: A wary teenage boy stares at a beatific,\u00ad \u00adtinsel-haired woman of indeterminate age in the lobby of a once-grand hotel. It nails what\u2019s most endearing about \u201cThanks for the Trouble\u201d: its tacit plea for connection and its affection for all the wounded eccentrics.Parker Sant\u00e9 hasn\u2019t spoken in years, since witnessing his father\u2019s horrific death. Zelda Toth looks not much older than Parker, but claims to have been born in Germany in 1770. They meet at a San Francisco hotel when he makes off with the cash in her handbag, only to find he\u2019s left his journal behind. Zelda, existentially weary after so many lifetimes, plans to jump off the Golden Gate Bridge. She proposes a blowout weekend: She\u2019ll live it up for the last time, Parker for the first.Parker can be off-putting \u2014 \u00adimmature and casually profane one moment, insightful beyond his years the next. (It\u2019s easier to believe that Zelda is 246 than that a teenager could have composed some of the fable-like stories he writes in his journal, which are included as interstitial chapters.) But Zelda\u2019s a sparkling creation, as mysterious as a mermaid. Even Parker\u2019s classmates are drawn to her: \u201cI could see they were seeing me in a different light now; I felt like a pitted little moon that had just been discovered orbiting a supernova.\u201d It\u2019s a pleasure to watch Zelda flirt, fling money and coax Parker out of what, emotionally speaking, is less a shell than a bunker. At its best, the novel carries a worthy message: No life is without pain \u2014 or promise.Rock\u2019s first Y.A. novel is so haunting and elliptical, it takes you over like a fever. Our narrator, 15-year-old Vivian, is in the grip of a disorder no one can diagnose. She has a history of \u201cbecoming agitated.\u201d She craves connection so desperately, she\u2019ll put on a life jacket just to simulate being held. Vivian\u2019s parents police her meds and live in fear she\u2019ll unravel. Her classmates flinch when they see her, afraid she\u2019ll hit. But Vivian is a true innocent (\u201cI never hit anyone,\u201d she promises). We\u2019re flooded with the sense that something terrible is coming for her.Rock\u2019s prose calls to mind Kazuo Ishiguro, not just for its spareness but also for its mix of wonder and creepiness. All that moors Vivian to the world is her 17-year-old sister, Audra, who calms her by stroking her hair and whispering \u201cKlickitat,\u201d the street Beverly Cleary\u2019s Ramona lived on. She lets Vivian grab her fiercely when, as Vivian puts it, \u201cthe blood was roaring around in my body and racing in my ears and all I wanted was to hold on.\u201d But Audra is plainly trouble. She has met a man who\u2019s going to help them escape their parents\u2019 hollow life and live in the woods as some sort of feral new family.After a few chapters in Vivian\u2019s company, grown-ups will not just pray for her safety but also want to sue for custody. Teenagers may be frustrated by the elusiveness. Dramatic events happen offstage; questions are left hanging. But Rock taps into something moving about love and disconnectedness \u2014 and how hard it is for a young, dented heart to process the world when the world can\u2019t process her.Jeff Giles\u2019s debut young adult novel, \u201cThe Edge of Everything,\u201d will be published next year.

{"Headline": "Is Milan the Real Capital of Italy?", "Date": "2016-04-26", "News": "Supported byMILAN \u2014 IF you walk around Rome, and you survive the speeding mo-peds and the taxi drivers fuming at the tourists wandering across the road, you soon understand why locals claim to live in the most beautiful place in the world. The city is a breathtaking concentration of history, art and charm \u2014 every corner could fill your eyes, your camera and your typical American romantic comedy.But Rome, despite all of this, is a gloomy place these days. The economy is stagnant, corruption is rife and no one seems to know or even care how to get things moving again.In contrast, if you walk around Milan, and you survive the bus drivers swearing at pedestrians who cross against the lights, hunched over their phones, you soon understand why the Milanese think their city is Italy\u2019s actual guiding light. It has become, in the last few years, an irresistible magnet for young people from all over the country, who flock here to work in design, media, fashion and food.You can hear regional accents from every corner of the country and see all kinds of faces, from wiry, dark-haired Sardinian girls to tall, blond boys from Alto Adige. That\u2019s why Milan, today, is happy.Rival cities are commonplace: New York and Los Angeles, Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo, Beijing and Shanghai, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, Madrid and Barcelona. In Italy, it\u2019s Rome and Milan. But the match has never been more uneven.Rome is in a foul mood. It\u2019s gone from scandal to scandal, some of them truly embarrassing. Last year a major investigation known as Mafia Capitale revealed the cozy relationship between organized crime and Italian politicians. As a result, Rome\u2019s mayor, Ignazio Marino \u2014 not an accomplice, more of a hapless bystander \u2014 resigned in October.Then it got worse. The city is plagued not only by widespread corruption but also by everyday inefficiency and insiderism. Francesco Paolo Tronca, who replaced Mr. Marino, found out that the municipality owns more than 28,000 real estate units, on which the unpaid rents amount to $400 million. Apparently, 85 percent of the tenants don\u2019t care to cough up, or don\u2019t have to. Or they pay $36 a month for a villa with a view over the Colosseum \u2014 or $5.50 for a place on the Campo de\u2019 Fiori. Yes, really.Milan, on the other hand, is in an ebullient mood. Last year\u2019s expo, with 21 million visitors, seven million of them from abroad, was an unexpected success. The city\u2019s annual Salone del Mobile, the annual furniture fair, is now the benchmark for the furnishing and design industries, the largest of its kind in the world. This month it attracted 400,000 visitors \u2014 70 percent of them foreigners \u2014 and transformed the city in another weeklong movable feast.High-rise towers are going up across the city, transforming the skyline. Fashion, design, art, advertising, publishing \u2014 Milan is the go-to city for all these sectors, as well as, increasingly, manufacturing and finance. Rome stays afloat with politics, public television and cinema.The comparison is even harsher when it comes to the public sector: hospitals, garbage disposal, transportation and infrastructure. Around 40 percent of Rome\u2019s streets have major cracks and potholes; there are several blogs and Facebook pages devoted to the \u201cbuche di Roma\u201d (\u201choles of Rome\u201d). Milan, in contrast, does all these things right.Exacerbating the difference is Rome\u2019s indifference. A columnist wrote last week in Corriere della Sera: \u201cRomans believe they know everything. They look down cynically at the world from what they call the Eternal City.\u201d Maybe it\u2019s a little harsh, but there\u2019s some truth in it. The place is so beautiful that its residents think beauty alone is enough. When they realize that modern urban life needs more than that \u2014 efficient public transport and honest managers, for instance \u2014 they say they want to change things. But change is painful. And beautiful, seductive Rome is there to whisper: \u201cWhy bother? Don\u2019t!\u201dIn June, both cities will choose new mayors. In Milan the picture is clear. Two previous city managers, Beppe Sala and Stefano Parisi, represent left and right. Both are considered competent (Mr. Sala was the boss of the Expo). Either way, Milan will be fine.One thing is true of both cities: Whoever wins will have his or her work cut out. Rome must learn to combine its spectacular heritage with higher standards in daily life. La dolce vita must meet la vita pratica halfway. You don\u2019t enjoy the Colosseum if you waste an hour waiting for a bus that never arrives.Over the past hundred years, many of Italy\u2019s pivotal changes \u2014 good and bad \u2014 began in Milan: socialism, Great War fever, Fascism, the resistance to Fascism, the economic boom of the \u201960s, the political turmoil of the \u201970s, the Clean Hands anti-corruption campaign, the populist Northern League. And now, this young, lively and colorful renaissance.Milan\u2019s challenge is to spread its current success to the rest of the country. Show that there\u2019s an entrepreneurial spirit across Italy, and that the young people who flock to Milan to find it might be persuaded to stay at home, if they could find the same opportunities. Give a chance to the smart new Italians that fill the piazzas on these spring nights. They\u2019ll take care of it.Beppe Severgnini is a columnist at Corriere della Sera and the author of \u201cMamma Mia!: Berlusconi Explained for Posterity and Friends Abroad.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Air France Faces Backlash Over Veil Policy on Route to Iran", "Date": "2016-04-05", "News": "Supported byAir France moved to defuse a clash with part of its work force after the airline demanded that female employees wear veils on a new service to Iran, leading a union to accuse the company of \u201can attack on women.\u201dThe company circulated a memo on March 18 that outlined the dress standards, including a requirement that women \u201cwear a head scarf and a wide and long garment to conceal their forms\u201d on their arrival in the country, according to the National Union of Flights Attendants.The union responded with outrage, calling the instructions \u201can attack on freedom of conscience\u201d and demanding that Air France allow female employees to refuse to work on the route to Tehran, which is scheduled to start on April 17.On Monday, the company relented, saying the assignment would be voluntary.The firestorm over Air France\u2019s memo highlighted long-running anxieties in France over the role of Islam in public life, concerns that have grown more acute in the wake of Islamic State terror attacks in Paris and in Brussels. Some accused the company of disrespecting women\u2019s rights, while others said it was surrendering to radical Islam.But the airline pushed back, characterizing its memo simply as a reminder that the Iranian legal system strictly regulates how women can dress in public.The airline told Le Monde that it has previously instructed female employees to wear conservative clothes, including veils, while in Saudi Arabia on its service. Female employees working on its earlier service to Iran, which ended in 2008, also followed Iranian laws on women\u2019s attire while in the country.Employees are \u201cobliged, like all foreign visitors, to respect the laws of the countries they visit,\u201d the airline said.The wearing of the veil is an emotionally charged issue in France, where a form of state secularism known as la\u00efcit\u00e9 is held as a bedrock of the republic. It is illegal to wear a full face veil in public, and religious garments like Muslim head scarves, large Christian crosses and Jewish skullcaps are banned from public schools. Some have depicted Islam as a threat to secular tradition.Elayne Oliphant, a professor of religious studies at New York University, said larger anxieties over terrorism and the cultural assimilation of France\u2019s Muslim minority have led some people see a threat in \u201creasonable suggestions, such as dressing in ways that accord with the local laws of a country.\u201dThe controversy provided grist for France\u2019s right-wing politicians, who have made a regular practice of capitalizing on the country\u2019s fears over radical Islam.\u201cIn Iran, whether all of us involved in the issue like it or not, the veil is worn,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is just how it is, it is part of the tradition of Tehran and the Iranians.\u201dAdvertisement"}

So she picked up and left for Paris and from there took trains to the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland and Hungary, spending about three weeks in each country.Her timing couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have been more interesting: It was the 1990s, just a few years after the fall of the Berlin Wall and right after the breakup of Czechoslovakia. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe process for getting permission to photograph in the Eastern European baths was far more bureaucratic than California where I had been just before,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI met with the spa directors, we would discuss the project and their bathhouse, they would take my passport for a day and then they would let me know if I could shoot or not. They would also tell me when I could shoot and often escort me. For the shoots I was given a white lab coat like a doctor, and then introduced to the staff and bathers.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBecause management didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give bathgoers much of a choice about whether they wanted to participate, Ms. Kaplan was sensitive to any discomfort. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can sense it right away,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll shut down a little bit or they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll turn in a certain way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Although she did some research beforehand, most of the time she arrived on location without much of a plan. Most photographs are relaxed and seem to be taken reacting to the moment. But Morocco, where she went in 2002, was a bit different. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor one thing it was the only place where I worked with a guide and paid the city hammams to get permission to shoot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey then found the subjects, so in a way they were set up. There were many cultural taboos against photographing in the baths, especially women, though it varied from the cities to the villages.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn the end, she said her work was about transcendence and celebration of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cepic nude,\u00e2\u0080\u009d with all of its flaws and imperfections. Her father was an artist and she grew up surrounded by paintings and sketches of human figures. It was only natural that she gravitated toward photographing bodies suspended, like still lifes, in water. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is very powerful being in the bath,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rooted in the physicality of how people express themselves through their bodies.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}

{"Headline": "Reaching for the Stars, Across 4.37 Light-Years", "Date": "2016-04-12", "News": "Supported byCan you fly an iPhone to the stars?In an attempt to leapfrog the planets and vault into the interstellar age, a bevy of scientists and other luminaries from Silicon Valley and beyond, led by Yuri Milner, a Russian philanthropist and Internet entrepreneur, announced a plan on Tuesday to send a fleet of robot spacecraft no bigger than iPhones to Alpha Centauri, the nearest star system, 4.37 light-years away.If it all worked out \u2014 a cosmically big \u201cif\u201d that would occur decades and perhaps $10 billion from now \u2014 a rocket would deliver a \u201cmother ship\u201d carrying a thousand or so small probes to space. Once in orbit, the probes would unfold thin sails and then, propelled by powerful laser beams from Earth, set off one by one like a flock of migrating butterflies across the universe.Within two minutes, the probes would be more than 600,000 miles from home \u2014 as far as the lasers could maintain a tight beam \u2014 and moving at a fifth of the speed of light. But it would still take 20 years for them to get to Alpha Centauri. Those that survived would zip past the star system, making measurements and beaming pictures back to Earth.Much of this plan is probably half a lifetime away. Mr. Milner and his colleagues estimate that it could take 20 years to get the mission off the ground and into the heavens, 20 years to get to Alpha Centauri and another four years for the word from outer space to come home. And there is still the matter of attracting billions of dollars to pay for it.\u201cI think you and I will be happy to see the launch,\u201d Mr. Milner, 54, said in an interview, adding that progress in medicine and longevity would determine whether he would live to see the results.\u201cWe came to the conclusion it can be done: interstellar travel,\u201d Mr. Milner said. He announced the project, called Breakthrough Starshot, in a news conference in New York on Tuesday, 55 years after Yuri Gagarin \u2014 for whom Mr. Milner is named \u2014 became the first human in space.The English cosmologist and author Stephen Hawking is one of three members of the board of directors for the mission, along with Mr. Milner and Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook founder.The \u201cBreakthrough Starshot\u201d space mission to Alpha Centauri inpsired us to revisit the imagined trips to the star system in books, comics, TV, movies and video games.\u201cWhat makes human beings unique?\u201d Dr. Hawking asked. He went on to say, \u201cI believe that what makes us unique is transcending our limits.\u201dDr. Hawking added, \u201cToday we commit to the next great leap in the cosmos, because we are human and our nature is to fly.\u201dThe project will be directed by Pete Worden, a former director of NASA\u2019s Ames Research Center. He has a prominent cast of advisers, including the Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb as chairman; the British astronomer royal Martin Rees; the Nobel Prize-winning astronomer Saul Perlmutter, of the University of California, Berkeley; Ann Druyan, an executive producer of the television mini-series \u201cCosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey\u201d and the widow of Carl Sagan; and the mathematician and author Freeman Dyson, of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J.\u201cThere are about 20 key challenges we are asking the world\u2019s scientific experts to help us with \u2014 and we are willing to financially support their work,\u201d Dr. Worden said in an email.Estimating that the project could cost $5 billion to $10 billion, Mr. Milner is initially investing $100 million for research and development. He said he was hoping to lure other investors, especially from international sources. Both NASA and the European Space Agency have been briefed on the project, Dr. Worden said.Most of that money would go toward a giant laser array, which could be used to repeatedly send probes toward any star (as long as the senders were not looking for return mail anytime soon) or around the solar system, perhaps to fly through the ice plumes of Saturn\u2019s moon Enceladus, which might contain microbes \u2014 tiny forms of life.In a sense, the start of this space project reflects the make-it-or-break-it mode of Silicon Valley. Rather than send one big, expensive spacecraft on a journey of years, send thousands of cheap ones. If some break or collide with space junk, others can take their place.Interstellar travel is a daunting and humbling notion, but Alpha Centauri is an alluring target for such a trip: It is the closest star system to our own, and there might be planets in the system. The system, which looks to the naked eye like one star, consists of three: Alpha Centauri A and Alpha Centauri B, which circle each other, and Proxima Centauri, which may be circling the other two. In recent years, astronomers have amassed data suggesting the possibility of an Earth-size planet orbiting Alpha Centauri B.It would take Voyager 1, humanity\u2019s most distant space probe, more than 70,000 years to reach Alpha Centauri if it were headed in that direction, which it is not.Over the years, a variety of propulsion plans have been hatched to cross the void more quickly. In 1962, shortly after lasers were invented, Robert Forward, a physicist and science fiction author, suggested they could be used to push sails in space.By all accounts, Mr. Milner was initially skeptical of an interstellar probe. But three trends seemingly unrelated to space travel \u2014 advances in nanotechnology and lasers and the relentless march of Moore\u2019s Law, making circuits ever smaller and more powerful \u2014 have converged in what he called \u201ca surprising way.\u201dSince New Horizons beamed back photos of Pluto, the question has loomed: What\u2019s next? More than 1,600 Times readers shared their ideas.It is now possible to fit the entire probe with computers, cameras and electrical power, a package with a mass of only one gram, a thirtieth of an ounce.That, Dr. Loeb said, is about what the guts of an iPhone, stripped of its packaging and displays, amount to.Power would come from a tiny radioactive source like americium, the element in smoke detectors. Propulsion would come from foil sails that would unfold to catch laser light.The laser is the most intimidating and expensive of the challenges. It would have to generate 100 gigawatts of power for the two minutes needed to accelerate the butterfly probes to a fifth of the speed of light (subjecting its tiny innards to 60,000 times the force of normal gravity, by the way). That is about as much energy as it takes for a space shuttle to lift off, Dr. Loeb said, and about 100 times the output of a typical nuclear power plant.NASA\u2019s Kepler mission has discovered more than 1,000 confirmed planets orbiting distant stars.To achieve that energy would require an array about a mile across combining thousands of lasers firing in perfect unison.Moreover, to keep the beam tightly focused on one probe at a time would require an adaptive optics system that compensated for atmospheric turbulence \u2014 something astronomers know how to do over a span of 10 meters, the size of a big telescope mirror now, but not over a mile.Posing another challenge is the design of the sails, which would have to be very thin and able to reflect the laser light without absorbing any of its energy. Absorbing as little as one part in 100,000 of the laser energy would vaporize the sail.Another challenge might simply be to the imagination. Nobody knows what the Starshot fleet might find out.\u201cLooking is very different from going and visiting,\u201d Dr. Loeb said.As he noted, referring to recent physics experiments, \u201cNature teaches us that its imagination is better than ours.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yahoo Agrees to Give 4 Board Seats to Starboard Value", "Date": "2016-04-27", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For over a year and a half, Yahoo has been tormented by a prominent activist investor who has criticized virtually everything about the company, from its business strategy to its efforts to sell major assets.Now that hedge fund, Starboard Value, is finally getting a seat at the embattled Internet company\u2019s table, heading off a potentially distracting fight and perhaps easing the way for a potential sale of its core business.\u201cWe look forward to getting started right away and working closely with management and our fellow board members with the common goal of maximizing value for all shareholders,\u201d Mr. Smith said in a statement.The move may let Yahoo focus more on its sales efforts while also quieting one of the company\u2019s biggest and most persistent gadflies, since Starboard must now refrain from public criticism. The company had engaged two sets of bankers over the last several months: some to run defense against Starboard, others to supervise the auction.Giving those seats to Starboard may also remove some additional doubts about the seriousness of Yahoo\u2019s intent in exploring a sale, a process that several people involved have described as messy and confusing. The hedge fund had latched on to those concerns as part of its activism campaign.As part of the settlement, two existing directors will step down, leaving the board at 11 members. Coupled with the two new directors appointed by Yahoo last month, more than half of the company\u2019s board will be new this year.The other new additions to the board are Tor R. Braham, a former technology investment banker at Deutsche Bank; Eddy W. Hartenstein, a director of Tribune Publishing and former chief executive of The Los Angeles Times; and Richard S. Hill, chairman of Tessera Technologies.At the same time that a settlement has been reached, Yahoo and its board are still combing through the preliminary bids received last week. Among them were proposals from Verizon Communications, seen as the early leader in the sales process, and from investment firms like TPG Capital, Silver Lake and a consortium led by Bain Capital and Vista Equity Partners.Removing Starboard\u2019s threat of a board fight might mean that Yahoo no longer feels compelled to complete its sales process before its next annual shareholder meeting. The agreement with Starboard says Yahoo must hold its meeting by June 30. Still, company executives have expressed confidence in the speed of the process, and Mr. Smith is likely to keep pressing for a timely conclusion.Hopes for a deal have helped lift Yahoo\u2019s stock price more than 11 percent so far this year. But investors largely shrugged off the agreement on Wednesday, and shares closed down 0.43 percent.For investors, little matters more now than whether Yahoo can find a buyer for its core Internet business, including its huge sports, finance and mail arms. A weak quarterly earnings report last week, in which sales fell 11 percent, underscored the continuing troubles that have plagued the company.Despite its huge presence in the early days of the web, Yahoo has steadily lost ground to newer competitors like Google and Facebook, leaving it to grasp for solutions to turn around its business. A succession of chief executives, the latest being the Google veteran Marissa Mayer, have failed to find an effective answer.That has drawn a number of activist investors over the years that have sought to shake up the company. Before Starboard it was Third Point, the firm run by the billionaire Daniel S. Loeb, who successfully ousted Ms. Mayer\u2019s predecessor and called for the hiring of the Google engineer.But Ms. Mayer\u2019s various initiatives have not panned out. In September 2014, Starboard \u2014 a roughly five-year-old firm with a growing reputation as a successful activist investor \u2014 emerged, leading with criticism of the company\u2019s strategy.Starboard and Mr. Smith later added criticism of how Yahoo planned to sell its remaining stake in the Alibaba Group of China and, eventually, Ms. Mayer\u2019s overall performance, to their complaints.Little love has been lost between the two sides in the last year and a half, with Ms. Mayer believing Starboard to be a nuisance and disrespectful and Mr. Smith publicly calling for the ouster of Yahoo\u2019s board. The relationship took a further hit last month when Yahoo filled two board seats hours before the company was set to sit down with Starboard.But both sides continued to work on reaching a settlement, which has become more and more common in corporate America as companies and activists alike seek to avoid the expense and uncertainty of running a full-blown proxy fight.While corporate boards initially viewed such rabble-rousers as threats to be fought, they have increasingly opened up and offered director seats to end hostilities.Starboard won seats on Wednesday not only at Yahoo but also at Marvell Technologies, a chip maker that the hedge fund had fought against for only a few months. At Marvell, the activist investor won four board seats and will have a say in the selection of the company\u2019s next chief executive.Some on the receiving end of Starboard\u2019s campaigns have eventually formed cordial relationships with the hedge fund. One of the new Yahoo directors who had been proposed by Starboard, Mr. Hill, was on Tessera\u2019s board when that company battled against the activist investor three years ago.The alternative could be far worse. Starboard, for instance, ousted the entire board of Darden Restaurants, the parent of the Olive Garden chain, after rallying fellow investors unhappy with the company\u2019s financial performance.\u201cThis constructive resolution will allow management and the board to keep our focus on our extremely important objectives,\u201d Ms. Mayer said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cManagement is looking forward to working with the entire board, including the new directors, to maximize shareholder value.\u201dGiving activist investors a role in the boardroom also helps to silence them, since such settlements \u2014 like the one at Yahoo \u2014 include nondisparagement clauses that prohibit these firms from publicly criticizing their companies.Advertisement"}

It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a whole concept that we should regard as a Middle Eastern situation.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn November 2014, Islamic State militants surrounded Kobani, and their advance could be seen from where Mr. Temir was situated on the border. Kurdish civilians from nearby towns gathered and watched the course of the battle from Turkish rooftops or hills. They cheered when they saw rockets launched by the Kurdish People\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Protection Units, or Y.P.G. Mr. Temir was wise enough not to go to the front lines. Instead, he watched from the border where it was safe. \u201cThis was one of the weirdest moments of my life, watching the war with a naked eye,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I entered the city I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.So, through smoke-filled streets and funerals for Y.P.G. fighters, bodies beneath the rubble and unexploded bombs, Mr. Temir began taking pictures. He captured squashed homes; folded clothing neatly stacked on the shelves of a shop studded with bullet holes; piles of debris that seemed to rise naturally from bottomless landscapes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is not like some kid from America coming to the Middle East,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was born here and was not mentally that far from war psychology.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Temir was born in Sivas, a small town in central Turkey. He earned a scholarship to attend cinema school in Istanbul, but instead found himself photographing in Iraq and at the Syrian border. After deciding to become a full-time photojournalist (while continuing his cinema studies on the side), he dived into photography archives from magazines, agencies and collectives. He also acquired darkroom skills. His drive to pursue photojournalism, he explained, is related to his upbringing. He grew up without television or the Internet and with little connection to the outside world. Literature was his escape. By the time he was 12 he had read most of the books by Sophocles and Hemingway.\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt one point, I got tired of searching for reality in books and got interested in photojournalism to become a part of that reality.\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wanted to become a witness.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}

{"Headline": "A Decades-Old Study, Rediscovered, Challenges Advice on Saturated Fat", "Date": "2016-04-13", "News": "A four-decades-old study \u2014 recently discovered in a dusty basement \u2014 has raised new questions about longstanding dietary advice and the perils of saturated fat in the American diet.The research, known as the Minnesota Coronary Experiment, was a major controlled clinical trial conducted from 1968 to 1973, which studied the diets of more than 9,000 people at state mental hospitals and a nursing home.During the study, which was paid for by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and led by Dr. Ivan Frantz Jr. of the University of Minnesota Medical School, researchers were able to tightly regulate the diets of the institutionalized study subjects. Half of those subjects were fed meals rich in saturated fats from milk, cheese and beef. The remaining group ate a diet in which much of the saturated fat was removed and replaced with corn oil, an unsaturated fat that is common in many processed foods today. The study was intended to show that removing saturated fat from people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s diets and replacing it with polyunsaturated fat from vegetable oils would protect them against heart disease and lower their mortality.So what was the result? Despite being one of the largest controlled clinical dietary trials of its kind ever conducted, the data were never fully analyzed.Several years ago, Christopher E. Ramsden, a medical investigator at the National Institutes of Health, learned about the long-overlooked study. Intrigued, he contacted the University of Minnesota in hopes of reviewing the unpublished data. Dr. Frantz, who died in 2009, had been a prominent scientist at the university, where he studied the link between saturated fat and heart disease. One of his closest colleagues was Ancel Keys, an influential scientist whose research in the 1950s helped establish saturated fat as public health enemy No. 1, prompting the federal government to recommend low-fat diets to the entire nation.\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy father definitely believed in reducing saturated fats, and I grew up that way,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. Robert Frantz, the lead researcher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son and a cardiologist at the Mayo Clinic. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe followed a relatively low-fat diet at home, and on Sundays or special occasions, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have bacon and eggs.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe younger Dr. Frantz made three trips to the family home, finally discovering the dusty box marked \u00e2\u0080\u009cMinnesota Coronary Survey,\u00e2\u0080\u009d in his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s basement. He turned it over to Dr. Ramsden for analysis.The results were a surprise. Participants who ate a diet low in saturated fat and enriched with corn oil reduced their cholesterol by an average of 14 percent, compared with a change of just 1 percent in the control group. But the low-saturated fat diet did not reduce mortality. In fact, the study found that the greater the drop in cholesterol, the higher the risk of death during the trial.While it is unclear why the trial data had not previously been fully analyzed, one possibility is that Dr. Frantz and his colleagues faced resistance from medical journals at a time when questioning the link between saturated fat and disease was deeply unpopular.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt could be that they tried to publish all of their results but had a hard time getting them published,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Daisy Zamora, an author of the new study and a research scientist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.The younger Dr. Frantz said his father was probably startled by what seemed to be no benefit in replacing saturated fat with vegetable oil.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen it turned out that it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t reduce risk, it was quite puzzling,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd since it was effective in lowering cholesterol, it was weird.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u201cI don\u2019t think the authors\u2019 strong conclusions are supported by the data,\u201d he said.To investigate whether the new findings were a fluke, Dr. Zamora and her colleagues analyzed four similar, rigorous trials that tested the effects of replacing saturated fat with vegetable oils rich in linoleic acid. Those, too, failed to show any reduction in mortality from heart disease.\u00e2\u0080\u009cOne would expect that the more you lowered cholesterol, the better the outcome,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Ramsden said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut in this case the opposite association was found. The greater degree of cholesterol-lowering was associated with a higher, rather than a lower, risk of death.\u00e2\u0080\u009dRon Krauss, the former chairman of the American Heart Association\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dietary guidelines committee, said the new research was intriguing. But he said there was a vast body of research supporting polyunsaturated fats for heart health, and that the relationship between cholesterol-lowering and mortality could be deceiving.People who have high LDL cholesterol, the so-called bad kind, typically experience greater drops in cholesterol in response to dietary changes than people with lower LDL. Perhaps people in the new study who had the greatest drop in cholesterol also had higher mortality rates because they had more underlying disease.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible that the greater cholesterol response was in people who had more vascular risk related to their higher cholesterol levels,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.Dr. Ramsden stressed that the team\u2019s findings should be interpreted cautiously. The research does not show that saturated fats are beneficial, he said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut maybe they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not as bad as people thought.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe research underscores that the science behind dietary fat may be more complex than nutrition recommendations suggest. The body requires omega-6 fats like linoleic acid in small amounts. But emerging research suggests that in excess linoleic acid may play a role in a variety of disorders including liver disease and chronic pain.Eating whole, unprocessed foods\u00c2\u00a0and plants\u00c2\u00a0may be one way to get all the linoleic acid your body needs,\u00c2\u00a0Dr. Ramsden said.Related:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

Mr. Cruz has outmaneuvered Mr. Trump in getting his supporters named as delegates, but in Mr. Trump\u2019s telling, it had little to do with organizational effort.Mr. Trump said he did not want to \u00e2\u0080\u009cwaste\u00e2\u0080\u009d money \u00e2\u0080\u009cto wine and dine and to essentially pay off all these people, because a lot of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a payoff, you understand that.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe argument is an extension of his fight with the Republican National Committee, which he has accused of rigging rules to make it harder for him to get the nomination. He has expanded his team to bring on the seasoned Republican hands Paul Manafort and Rick Wiley to help him navigate the delegate process.Mr. Manafort has expansive purview in\u00c2\u00a0the Trump campaign, but the most challenging task he or any adviser faces is controlling Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s message, which is frequently shoot-from-the-lip and ad-libbed.

One girl, 15, was badly burned.The shattered, charred frame of the bus, the wailing sirens and the television interviews with survivors revived for many Israelis the memory of the second Palestinian uprising that erupted in 2000. Then, suicide bombers blew up buses in Jerusalem and other Israeli cities, killing scores.

Israeli forces killed more than 200 Palestinians during that period, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.Most of the Palestinians were killed while carrying out, or attempting, attacks. While individuals undertook most of the attacks, senior Israeli military officials have said in recent weeks that small cells of Palestinians are trying to undertake more organized, deadly assaults, including by making homemade bombs and guns.Suggesting that Mr. Abu Srour was not acting alone, the Israeli domestic intelligence agency, known as the Shin Bet, said in a statement that other Hamas activists had been arrested a day after the attack.\u201cThey are suspected of involvement and participation in the planning and execution of the attack,\u201d said the statementAt the men\u2019s section of the wake, the family sought to connect Mr. Abu Srour to his extended clan, famed for its militant activities against Israel.One of the banners showed Mr. Abu Srour\u2019s grandfather.

{"Headline": "In Cramped and Costly Bay Area, Cries to Build, Baby, Build", "Date": "2016-04-16", "News": "An activist who calls her group BARF is pushing for more housing, pitting cranky homeowners and the political establishment against newcomers who want the region to make room for them, too.Supported bySan Francisco does not have enough places to live. Sonja Trauss, a local activist, thinks the city should tackle this problem by building more housing.This may not sound like a controversial idea. But this is San Francisco.Ms. Trauss is a self-described anarchist and the head of the SF Bay Area Renters\u2019 Federation, an upstart political group that is pushing for more development. Its platform is simple: Members want San Francisco and its suburbs to build more of every kind of housing. More subsidized affordable housing, more market-rate rentals, more high-end condominiums.Ms. Trauss supports all of it so long as it is built tall, and soon. \u201cYou have to support building, even when it\u2019s a type of building you hate,\u201d she said. \u201cIs it ugly? Get over yourself. Is it low-income housing? Get over yourself. Is it luxury housing? Get over yourself. We really need everything right now.\u201dThe organization also inflamed Sierra Club volunteers in San Francisco by trying to elect its own pro-development candidate to the environmental group\u2019s executive committee. That effort failed, and last week her candidate, Donald Dewsnup, was arrested and charged with voter fraud \u2014 a move that Ms. Trauss claims is political retaliation. \u201cThere\u2019s no other explanation for why the district attorney of a major city would investigate and charge one person for registering at an inaccurate address,\u201d she said.In an interview, Mr. Dewsnup said he was homeless and simply used an address near the place where he was sleeping at the time.Across the country, a reversal in urban flight has ignited debates over gentrification, wealth, generational change and the definition of the modern city. It\u2019s a familiar battle in suburbs, where not-in-my-backyard homeowners are an American archetype.In San Francisco, though, things get weird. Here the tech boom is clashing with tough development laws and resentment from established residents who want to choke off growth to prevent further change.Ms. Trauss is the result: a new generation of activist whose pro-market bent is the opposite of the San Francisco stereotypes \u2014 the lefties, the aging hippies and tolerance all around.Ms. Trauss\u2019s cause, more or less, is to make life easier for real estate developers by rolling back zoning regulations and environmental rules. Her opponents are a generally older group of progressives who worry that an influx of corporate techies is turning a city that nurtured the Beat Generation into a gilded resort for the rich.Those groups oppose almost every new development except those reserved for subsidized affordable housing. But for many young professionals who are too rich to qualify for affordable housing, but not rich enough to afford $5,000-a-month rents, this is the problem.Adding to the strangeness is that the typical San Francisco progressive and the typical mid-20s-to-early-30s member of Ms. Trauss\u2019s group are likely to have identical positions on every liberal touchstone, like same-sex marriage and climate change, and yet they have become bitter enemies on one very big issue: housing.\u201cWe have liberal Democrats, and very liberal Democrats, and yet we are as polarized as the rest of the country,\u201d said Tim Colen, executive director of the San Francisco Housing Action Coalition.Ms. Trauss is smart and energetic and unpolished. She called her group the Bay Area Renters\u2019 Federation because \u201cfederation\u201d reminds her of \u201cStar Trek\u201d and because her roommate thought it would be funny if her group\u2019s acronym spelled \u201cBARF.\u201dThis might make it tempting to dismiss Ms. Trauss as just another colorful activist in a place where activism is a local sport. But the anger she has tapped into is real, reflecting a generational break that pits cranky homeowners and the San Francisco political establishment against a cast of newcomers who are demanding the region make room for them, too.Every few weeks, when a company like Zillow puts out a new price report, both sides hold up the numbers as an example of how San Francisco has failed the middle class. Zillow puts the city\u2019s median home price at $1.1 million, neck and neck with Manhattan. The region\u2019s rent, at $3,500 a month for an average apartment, is the highest in the nation.\u201cBARF is an important voice in this housing debate, and that is the voice of young people who are asking the question: \u2018What is my future in this city?\u2019\u201d said Scott Wiener, a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. \u201cAnd you can agree or disagree with them, but they have activated a new generation of pro-housing activists.\u201dThe group\u2019s build-more platform may be politically contentious, but economically speaking, it is anything but controversial. The Bay Area was expensive even before the tech boom. And the supply of new projects, while increasing, remains decades behind population growth.Much of San Francisco\u2019s progressive establishment feels the city is building too much market-rate housing. Some go so far as to argue that the appetite for real estate here is so high that supply-and-demand rules don\u2019t really apply.To get prices down, \u201cYou\u2019d have to, like, build another city on top of the city,\u201d said David Campos, a progressive-wing member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. He thinks the city should focus the vast majority of future development on affordable housing limited to people making well below the city\u2019s median income.\u201cMany housing programs \u2014 vouchers, rent control and inclusionary housing \u2014 attempt to make housing more affordable without increasing the overall supply,\u201d the report said. \u201cThis approach does very little to address the underlying cause of California\u2019s high housing costs: a housing shortage.\u201dMs. Trauss, 34, is a born activist from Philadelphia whose father is a lawyer who defends low-income homeowners against foreclosure. She moved to the Bay Area in 2011, shortly after getting her master\u2019s degree in economics from Washington University in St. Louis, and taught math at local community colleges. She intended to live in San Francisco, but settled across the bay in Oakland.Today BARF is her full-time job, allowing her the financial wherewithal to become one of those strangely persistent people who speak regularly at City Hall. To an outside observer, this can feel like watching an obscure and slow-moving sport.This is a town with an app for everything and where people get fussy when an Uber driver takes more than five minutes to arrive. City Hall, with its Beaux-Arts architecture and government-grade wait times, can feel like an anachronism.Ms. Trauss may be a plugged-in millennial, but she loves it. \u201cEven in this modern era of, whatever, the Internet and people like interacting in a place that\u2019s no place at all, City Hall is still a center,\u201d she said.One recent afternoon, she spent an hour on the hard wooden benches in the chamber of the Board of Supervisors. She was there to make a two-minute public comment in favor of a dull-but-important proposal to streamline the permitting process for some affordable-housing projects.Three days later she was back, this time to support a \u201cdensity bonus\u201d \u2014 a proposal to let developers build taller buildings in exchange for including more affordable housing as well. When she arrived, Mr. Campos, from the Board of Supervisors, was blasting the proposal from the City Hall steps, surrounded by 70 or so supporters.Ms. Trauss and another member of her group stood opposite and held up signs that said \u201cStop Affordable Housing.\u201d This was meant to be ironic. Their point was that Mr. Campos was opposing legislation that would create more market-rate housing \u2014 but also more affordable housing.Nobody seemed to get it, so Ms. Trauss went inside City Hall to add her name to a list of people making public comments before the planning commission. Her chance to speak would be hours away, so she trekked around City Hall, past bronze busts and wedding parties, in search of a quiet place to take a lunch break. She was joined by a man whose legal name is Starchild.Starchild is the sort of only-in-San Francisco character you end up making friends with if you spend enough time at City Hall. He works nights as an \u201cerotic service provider.\u201d Asked if this meant he was a prostitute, he said, \u201c\u2018Prostitute\u2019 is O.K. as long as it\u2019s said in a respectful way.\u201d Starchild spends his days campaigning for libertarian causes and running doomed campaigns for office.\u201cThis is my life,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous.\u201dMany longtime San Franciscans view groups like BARF as yet another example of how the technology industry is robbing San Francisco of its San Francisco-ness. Far from the hippies of the 1960s, many of today\u2019s migrants lean libertarian \u2014 drawn by start-up dreams or to work for the likes of Google or Apple, two of the world\u2019s most valuable companies. They tend to share a belief, either idealistically or na\u00efvely, depending on who is judging, that corporations can be a force for social good and change.But BARF members are so single-minded about housing that they can be hard to label politically. They view San Francisco progressives as, in fact, fundamentally conservative. That is because, to the group members at least, progressive positions on housing seem less about building the city and more about keeping people like them out.On a drizzly Sunday in December, Ms. Trauss hosted the SF YIMBYParty Congress, a gathering of pro-housing groups held at a Market Street co-working space full of start-up touches like mismatched furniture, a foosball table and lots of white men. Toward the beginning, a debate broke out about whether they should call themselves moderates to distinguish themselves from progressives.Ms. Trauss joked that she liked moderate because you can shorten it to mod, and mod sounds cool. Mr. Wiener, the supervisor, disagreed, noting that in San Francisco, a moderate Democrat \u201cmight have a Bernie Sanders sticker on their car.\u201dOne man, who seemed exasperated by the discussion and the idea of using his Sunday to talk about politics, said, with more colorful language, that he did not give a hoot about progressives versus moderates \u2014 he just wanted some darn housing.The tech boom takes much of the blame for soaring housing prices. But the pro-development movement has less to do with tech as an industry, and everything to do with newcomers as a class.Brian Hanlon, a federation member who regularly attends Board of Supervisors meetings with Ms. Trauss, has a day job doing administrative work for the United States Forest Service. Two years ago, when he started worrying that his claim to an $835-a-month room in a rent-controlled apartment might be in jeopardy, he reacted in classic San Francisco fashion. He started marching in anti-eviction protests next to people beating drums and signs that said things like \u201cTech = Death.\u201dBut he quickly broke ranks. Many of his fellow protesters also opposed building new apartments \u2014 putting him at odds with them.\u201cThey want to be on the side of tenants, but they don\u2019t have any real plan for how do we become a welcoming metropolitan area for new people who don\u2019t have money,\u201d Mr. Hanlon said. \u201cTheir plans are only to allow current incumbent renters to stay in their place, presumably until they die and some rich person comes along.\u201dThe progressive movement has played a guiding role in creating the quirky and picturesque San Francisco that many people love today. Progressives battled plans to crisscross the city with freeways and opposed urban renewal programs that destroyed black neighborhoods. They have fought for, and won, rent-control protections and funding for affordable housing, along with various open-space amenities that many newcomers take for granted.The question is how to handle a long-run demographic reversal in which cities across the country have regained population following years of \u201cwhite flight\u201d to the suburbs. After losing population for two decades through the 1970s, San Francisco resumed growth in the \u201980s and has only accelerated from there.\u201cThere\u2019s that book, \u2018What\u2019s the Matter With Kansas?\u2019\u201d said Gabriel Metcalf, executive director of SPUR, an urban policy research organization. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with San Francisco? Why is it that in a city that\u2019s two-thirds renters we have adopted a housing policy that is horrible for renters?\u201dOf the 11 propositions on San Francisco\u2019s ballot in November, seven were either directly or indirectly related to high home prices and the influence of the technology industry. Michael Hankinson, a Harvard Ph.D. candidate who is studying land-use and housing prices, surveyed voters for his dissertation and found renters skeptical that new development would do anything other than raise prices.For instance, a recent proposal to temporarily stop market-rate development in the city\u2019s Mission District, a gentrifying neighborhood popular with technology workers, failed citywide. But Mr. Hankinson found that a majority of renters favored it because they did not think that new development would do anything for them \u2014 and feared that it might, somehow, get them evicted.\u201cBARF has to convince renters that neighborhood change will benefit them in the long run,\u201d he said. Today, when eviction is a hot party topic, most renters are unwilling to take that gamble.So Ms. Trauss is taking her campaign to the courts. In December she sued the city of Lafayette, Calif., an East Bay bedroom community, after it took a parcel that had been set aside for higher-density apartments and office buildings and rezoned it for single-family homes instead.She wrote the petition herself, saying the move violated the California Housing Accountability Act, a 1980s law and \u201canti-Nimby\u201d statute that limits cities\u2019 ability to downsize housing developments. Recently, she hired a lawyer to litigate the case.Asked about Ms. Trauss\u2019s lawsuit, Steven Falk, Lafayette\u2019s city manager, said the city actually faced another lawsuit over the same development. The second group is suing, he said, because they think it is too big.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Thriving at Age 70 and Beyond", "Date": "2016-04-25", "News": "Jane Brody on health and aging.It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the first time I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve considered the implications of longevity. When one of my grandsons at age 8 asked, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGrandma, will you still be alive when I get married?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI certainly hope so. I want to dance at your wedding.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But I followed up with a suggestion that he marry young!Still, his innocent query reminded me to continue to pursue a healthy lifestyle of wholesome food, daily exercise and supportive social connections. While there are no guarantees, like many other women now in their 70s, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already outlived both my parents, my mother having died at 49 and my father at 71.If I have one fear as the years climb, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fit in all I want to see and do before my time is up, so I always plan activities while I can still do them.I book cycling and hiking trips to parts of the world I want to visit and schedule visits to distant friends and family to be sure I make them happen. In a most pragmatic moment, I crocheted a gender-neutral blanket for my first great-grandchild, but attached a loving note in case I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m no longer around to give it in person.Of course, advancing age has taken \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and will continue to take \u00e2\u0080\u0094 its incremental toll. I often wake up wobbly, my back hates rainy days, and I no longer walk, cycle or swim as fast as I used to. I wear sensible shoes and hold the handrail going up and down stairs.I know too that, in contrast to the Energizer Bunny life I once led, I now have to husband my resources more carefully. While I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m happy to prepare a dish or two for someone else\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gathering, my energy for and interest in hosting dinner parties have greatly diminished. And though I love to go to the theater, concerts, movies and parties, I also relish spending quiet nights at home with my Havanese, Max, for company.What are the most important issues facing these women as they age, and how might society help ease their way into the future? Leading topics the women chose to explore included work and retirement, ageism, coping with functional changes, caretaking, living arrangements, social connections, grandparenting and adjusting to loss and death.As members of the first generation in which huge numbers of women had careers that defined who they were, deciding when to bow out can be a challenge. Some have no choice, others never want to, and still others like me continue to work part-time. However, sooner or later, most will need to find rewarding activities to fill their now-free time.The authors reported that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe women seemed to fear retirement before the deed was done, and then to relish their newfound opportunities afterward.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Several warned against rushing into too many volunteer activities, suggesting instead that retirees take time to explore what might be most meaningful and interesting, from taking art classes or music lessons to mentoring students, becoming a docent or starting a new career.As one woman said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are many places where you are needed and can make a difference.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Another said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more like putting new tires on a car\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 re-tiring!\u00e2\u0080\u009dStill, many lamented society\u00e2\u0080\u0099s focus on youthfulness and its failure to value the wisdom and knowledge of elders like themselves. Ageism abounds, they agreed. As one woman wrote, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt my institution, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an unstated policy that anyone over 55 won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get a job. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re thought to be out of touch with the younger population and assumed to be lacking in the necessary technical skills.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A practicing attorney admitted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople might not listen to me if they knew I was 71, so I keep it to myself.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAdjusting to physical changes that accompany advancing years is often tough. Grandchildren, though a great joy to many, can be exhausting, necessitating a restorative nap. Adjustments are needed to reduce the risk of falls and fractures. Better lighting, hearing assists, a reliance on Post-it notes and lists as well as canes and walkers can become essential for safe and effective functioning.As Ms. Giddan and Ms. Cole wrote, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur bodies change as we age, even when we eat healthfully, exercise and try to take good care of ourselves. Sight, hearing, bones, joints, balance, mobility, memory, continence, strength and stamina \u00e2\u0080\u0094 they will never be what they once were.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThere is also the matter of attending to or accommodating various aches and pains. As one physician reassured a woman of 70, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll my patients your age who are free of pains are dead.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not one to run to the doctor the moment something hurts. Rather, I give it a few weeks \u00e2\u0080\u0094 maybe a month \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to see if it will go away on its own. Even if fully covered by Medicare, doctor visits cost time and effort, and tests that ensue may have side effects.Also important as women age are social connections, especially with other women. Whether married, single, widowed or divorced, participants reported that women friends were their greatest source of support and comfort.Related:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

And you know what we do? Nothing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump said at a subdued rally here on the outskirts of Milwaukee. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEither they have to pay up for past deficiencies or they have to get out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd if it breaks up NATO, it breaks up NATO,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he concluded.

Mr. Cruz has criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s comments on NATO, saying that the United States needed to support the organization\u2019s fight against terrorism and to counterbalance Russia\u2019s influence.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was really designed for the Soviet Union, which doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exist anymore,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t designed for terrorism.\u00e2\u0080\u009dLater, at an event in Wausau, Wis., Mr. Trump seemed to acknowledge the controversy his initial remarks about NATO had prompted.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI said here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the problem with NATO: it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obsolete,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump said, recounting his comments. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBig statement to make when you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know that much about it, but I learn quickly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In the Times interview, Mr. Trump also said he was open to allowing Japan and South Korea to build their own nuclear arsenals rather than relying on the United States for protection. The United States has been wary of nuclear proliferation in the Asia Pacific region, and President Obama on Friday rebuked Mr. Trump for his comments, saying he worried the real estate billionaire \u00e2\u0080\u009cdoesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know much about foreign policy or nuclear policy or the Korean Peninsula or the world generally.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Trump responded Saturday, saying at his first event, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say anything about letting Japan go nuclear.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But, he continued, \u201cWe have to let them take care of themselves and if that means they have to some day get nuclear weapons \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in all fairness folks, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really like this \u00e2\u0080\u0094 eventually they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to want to get them anyway.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAt his second event, he returned to the question of a nuclear Japan, arguing both sides of the issue in almost the same sentence.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would rather have them not arm, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to continue to lose this tremendous amount of money,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd frankly, the case could be made, that let them protect themselves against North Korea.

{"Headline": "Bangkok\u2019s River of Kings", "Date": "2016-04-28", "News": "Supported byWhen Somerset Maugham staggered from the Bangkok train station one steaming day in 1923, he knew exactly where to head: the Chao Phraya \u2014 the River of Kings \u2014 whose fresh breezes and open skies were even then a relief from the intensity of the Thai capital. Feeling the onset of malaria, Maugham checked into the Oriental Hotel, where verandas overlooked the busy waterfront. As his temperature climbed to 105 degrees, the writer, soaked in sweat and addled by hallucinations, overheard the Oriental\u2019s owner telling his doctor that it would be bad for business if the author should die on the premises.Maugham\u2019s verdict on Bangkok would make a brutal TripAdvisor review today. In his travel memoir \u201cThe Gentleman in the Parlor,\u201d he reviled the city\u2019s \u201cdense traffic,\u201d its \u201cceaseless din,\u201d its \u201cinsipid\u201d cuisine and \u201csordid\u201d houses. The Thais, he declared petulantly, are \u201cnot a comely race.\u201dBut once he recovered, Maugham experienced a rush of euphoria at the waterside setting. He watched the parade of barges, sampans and tramp steamers pass by with \u201ca thrill of emotion,\u201d and conceded that the wats, the gilded and glittering temple complexes rising along the river, made him \u201claugh out loud with delight to think that anything so fantastic could exist on this sombre earth.\u201dI had a taste of Maugham\u2019s extreme reactions as I sat in Bangkok\u2019s nefarious traffic trying to get to the river on the first morning of a recent trip, although I was addled by nothing more dangerous than jet lag from the epic 21-hour flight from New York.Laden with literary reference, the Oriental \u2014 now the Mandarin Oriental, although nobody calls it that \u2014 is still the obvious introduction to the Chao Phraya, which has in recent years returned to its status as an escape from the city\u2019s urban chaos. The colonial-era edifice where Maugham stayed is now called the Author\u2019s Wing. Although overshadowed by a 1970s addition, its exterior looks much as it did when it opened in 1887 and astonished the city with its luxurious imported carpets, Parisian wallpaper and electrified chandeliers. And the setting has not lost its soothing effect.I pulled up a chair feet away from the \u201cliver-coloured water swirling by,\u201d as another famous guest, No\u00ebl Coward, put it. A parade of ferries, barges and steamboats still battles the surging currents, while islands of vegetation float past, washed downriver from the jungles of the northern provinces. It was a step back into a leisurely past, worlds away from the explosive neon energy of the central city.It\u2019s no secret that, despite recent political disorder, Bangkok has emerged as the unofficial capital of Southeast Asia. Everyone from Swedish aid workers to Vietnamese I.T. specialists prefers to live there and commute around the region to less dynamic cities.The most alluring consequence for travelers has been the revival of the Chao Phraya, which was once the heart and soul of Bangkok. It was by its shores that the sumptuous royal district was built in the 18th century and, although Thailand is one of the few Asian countries never to be colonized, where European powers erected their legations and warehouses in the 19th.It was along the river that Bangkok\u2019s first road was built (an elephant track that became known as the New Road) and where a raucous Chinatown sprang up. The river was then so alluring that Bangkok was affectionately called \u201cthe Venice of the East,\u201d a serene warren of canals, floating markets and stilt houses.But after World War II, the focus of Bangkok moved north and east. The river districts fell into decay, their waters polluted. Travelers mostly stayed away and visited the waterfront as part of a day trip to the famous wats. It is only over the last two or three years that the river has been rediscovered by bohemian Thais and intrepid expats, creating a mix of decay and contemporary chic that evokes an Eastern New Orleans.The parallels to New York\u2019s adventures in urban renewal are not lost on Thai preservationists. Last year, Bangkok River Partners invited Joshua David, the co-founder of the High Line, to speak at a conference. He became fascinated by the Chao Phraya. \u201cThe river allows you to experience Bangkok in a completely different way,\u201d said Mr. David, now president of the World Monument Fund. \u201cAn amazing variety of watercraft is still used by local communities and will take you to places you would never imagine existed.\u201dTo me, the river also made Bangkok seem manageable. Over years of travel in Asia, I had somehow failed to venture outside its airport, in part because I was daunted by the prospect of navigating a megalopolis of over 8.5 million people that can seem like an alternate set from \u201cBlade Runner.\u201d But the idea of exploring by water made Bangkok more human-scale. I decided to spend my time entirely on the river to reimagine its golden age.My inspiration would be less the jaundiced Maugham than Jozef Konrad Korzeniowski, a Polish sailor soon to be renowned as the author Joseph Conrad, who found himself in 1888 frequenting the Oriental Hotel saloon for a little over two weeks, chatting with the barflies, as was his wont, \u201cof wrecks, of short rations, and of heroism.\u201dConrad had taken over command of an Australian ship, the Otago, but was stuck in Bangkok waiting for his crew to recover from tropical illnesses \u2014 an experience that is reworked in his novel \u201cLord Jim\u201d and the shorter works \u201cThe Shadow-Line,\u201d \u201cFalk\u201d and \u201cThe Secret Sharer.\u201d Although he had his life savings of 32 pounds stolen by his Chinese steward (who thoughtfully brushed and folded his clothes before disappearing), Conrad still felt fondly toward Bangkok, and never forgot its \u201cgorgeous and dilapidated\u201d temples, or the city\u2019s \u201cvertical sunlight, tremendous, overpowering, almost palpable, which seemed to enter one\u2019s breast with the breath of one\u2019s nostrils and soak into one\u2019s limbs through every pore of one\u2019s skin.\u201dAs Conrad would surely agree, if the river traffic was hypnotic to watch, it was more satisfying to join. The variety of watercraft churning between the bobbing jetties was bewildering, ranging from high-speed long tail boats to private vessels and public ferries. I found the ferries definitely the most exotic, if not always the most comfortable. In peak hours, crowds squeezed into the sweltering below-decks like sardines, with yellow-robed monks and dapper businessmen alike jostling for elbow room while harangued by boat workers with megaphones, who bellowed \u201cGo down! Go down! Go down!\u201dThere are no continuous walkways along the river, so I made surgical strikes from the piers on foot, ducking in and out of laneways to the lapping waves. All along the right bank stood poetic ruins. The splendid 1887 offices of the East Asiatic Company sat vacant and awaiting rescue, while the stately Old Customs House had become a fire station sprouting greenery from gaping cracks. Catholic cathedrals and European embassies staggered on in crumbling glory, while the iron pins used to moor steamers that Conrad may have used quietly rusted.One crooked lane led to the river temple where albino elephants were cremated, another to the sacred slab upon which Thai royals could be executed. (It was forbidden for royal blood to be spilled, so a bag was placed over the victim\u2019s head and he was cudgeled to death \u2014 a considerate gesture.)Its marquee site is the Jam Factory, a renovated warehouse complex set around a grassy courtyard with a high-end restaurant called the Never Ending Summer, all designed to appeal to natives first, tourists second. \u201cOur real ambition is to get Bangkokians back to the river,\u201d said Mr. Robinson of River Partners. \u201cTravelers will follow. People want authenticity.\u201d\u201cIt has been an epic journey,\u201d said Christine McGinnis, then the director of the Bangkok office of the United States design company AvroKO, which has overseen the project since 2008. \u201cIf this house was a child, it would be speaking and in school by now.\u201d Construction problems included dealing with the ghost of the first owner\u2019s mistress, who regularly spooked workers by overturning paintings she didn\u2019t like during the night. (\u201cIt\u2019s Thailand; there is always a story,\u201d Ms. McGinnis said, laughing.)Working with the city\u2019s Fine Arts Department, the designers had to maintain the building\u2019s historic integrity while making it commercially viable. Its Corinthian columns have elephant motifs carved into their wooden pediments; the color scheme is drawn from the Royal Thai costume, but the tapestries and artworks are all by contemporary local artists.Afterward, we strolled back to the nearby pier to catch ferries in different directions. \u201cEveryone is getting back to the river,\u201d Ms. McGinnis said. \u201cEveryone is getting inspired.\u201d\u201cThere is definitely a new interest in preserving Thai history,\u201d said Dan Fraser, a Canadian expat who qualifies as a walking atlas to forgotten Bangkok, as we plunged by foot along the dark waterfront of the Talat Noi (\u201csmall market\u201d) neighborhood. Here, the streets were built only broad enough to allow two rickshaws to pass, while shoulder-width alleys snake to the docks. \u201cWealthy Thais are coming back from trips to Europe, looking around and asking, \u2018What have we done? Why are there so many 7-Elevens,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Fraser said. \u201cFor the first time, people are openly admitting that unchecked development has all but destroyed Bangkok.\u201dEven a year ago, the conventional wisdom was that the river is thriving by day but dead after dark. All that has changed \u2014 if you know where to look. At least that was what I had been assured by Mr. Fraser, who has one of the most colorful r\u00e9sum\u00e9s in the Thai expat world. He first arrived 15 years ago to tutor the children of the royal family in English and tennis, and he later achieved minor celebrity status as the star of Thai-language TV shows exploring local culture and food \u201cthrough the eyes of a foreigner.\u201dThe riverfront at night is his ideal stamping ground. \u201cThis used to be the real core of the city,\u201d he said, as we zigzagged from the old Portuguese district toward Chinatown. \u201cBut since the 1960s, people have wanted to get away from here. So development has bypassed this area altogether, which is perfect for me. It\u2019s maintained its Old World charm.\u201dIn Talat Noi, the alleys were dark and deserted, but concealed secret worlds. Behind one screen door lay a bar with a broad wooden porch opening directly onto the river and decorated with mismatched retro furniture as if for a backyard barbecue. On the edge of Chinatown, a carved portal marked Teens of Thailand turned out to be the entrance to a bar by that name, with a dozen rickety seats and erotic photographs hanging on distressed concrete walls.\u201cBangkok had no gin bar!\u201d said Niks Anuman-Rajadhon, the bar\u2019s co-owner, who sported a black T-shirt and a pompadour Elvis would have envied, as he concocted a batch of martinis with fresh pomegranates. \u201cEvery city has to have one, so I thought, let\u2019s do it! We got about 30 gins together \u2014 including Bangkok\u2019s own Iron Balls \u2014 and started experimenting.\u201dBefore long, the night began to feel like the premise for \u201cThe Hangover Part IV.\u201d I had not the slightest idea where we were \u2014 \u201ceven if we\u2019d used a ball of twine, I doubt we could retrace our steps,\u201d Mr. Fraser said happily \u2014 when we heard the haunting strains of traditional Thai music coming from what seemed to be a dilapidated merchant\u2019s mansion.Shouldering open the door, we found an establishment called Tep Bar, whose interior was lined with century-old worn teak and crowded with arty Thais; the ambience lay somewhere between a speakeasy and an opium den. The bar\u2019s co-owner, Kong Lertkangwarnklai, was so excited that a pair of farang (foreign) explorers had arrived by accident that he insisted we sample an array of ya dong, ancient whiskey infused, he said, with 20 exotic herbs.A half-dozen shot glasses materialized on a sumptuous golden tray adorned with mango pieces and pickled grapes. \u201cTechnically, ya dong is medicine,\u201d Mr. Kong said, pushing the potent spirits forward. As I knocked the first glass back, I had a sudden vision of myself waking up in an alley with my memory of the night erased, perhaps with a tattoo across my forehead and a monkey on my shoulder.\u201cEveryone in Bangkok is trying to be someone else,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what about our roots? Why are we throwing everything away?\u201d At first, the retro impulse behind the bar, which Mr. Kong opened last year, felt like a quixotic gamble, he recalled. \u201cNobody believed in us. They thought the location, the concept, everything would fail! They didn\u2019t think Thai people would come to such a place.\u201d The bar was packed with a crowd that seemed spellbound by the music (enhanced, no doubt, by the ya dong).It was about 3 a.m. when I wandered back to a lonely pier, staring out at the inky waters reflecting the lights of passing barges. A decade from now, Mr. Robinson, of the Bangkok River Partners, predicted, the Chao Phraya would be transformed but still be recognizable. \u201cOur vision is of a cleaner river, with more walkable areas, enriched with creative industries and renovated warehouses and clusters of art galleries you can visit without sitting all day in a taxi,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the same time, all the old roast duck shops and congee stores will still be there. They\u2019ll just be 10 years older.\u201dEven Somerset Maugham would have to approve.Tony Perrottet is the author of five books on history and travel, most recently \u201cThe Sinner\u2019s Grand Tour.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And a mother who had left her alone so she could smoke methamphetamine nearby.As the police described the case of a rape at a northeastern Utah home, its horrifying details have shaken the small city where the attack unfolded and have reverberated far beyond, with some even calling for vigilante justice.In the days that followed, Larson RonDeau, 36; Josiah RonDeau, 20; Jerry Flatlip, 29; and Randall Flatlip, 26, were arrested one by one and locked up in the county jail.The men made their first appearance in district court on Tuesday on charges of felony rape and sodomy of a child, G. Mark Thomas, the county attorney, said in an emailed statement. They did not enter a plea, but each has maintained his innocence in statements to investigators.Local news reports about the case generated a furious outcry, leading the sheriff\u2019s department to take the unusual step of appealing for calm as some people on social media suggested ways for the men to be killed.\u201cIt has not been our intent to \u2018try the case\u2019 in the media or fuel hateful speech or actions,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s department added. \u201cAgain, we thank you for your amazing compassion and concern, and we understand the outrage felt as a community, and as human beings.\u201dMr. Thomas, who was in court on Tuesday, said the four men were held pending bail hearings. If found guilty, they could face minimum 25-year mandatory prison sentences for each count, with an additional five years for acting with two or more persons. The maximum sentence is life in prison.\u201cWe are deeply bothered anytime a child is abused,\u201d Mr. Thomas said. \u201cThis case is particularly troublesome because the allegation is that the child was abused by multiple adults simultaneously. Our office will work to pursue some form of justice.\u201dThe girl was taken into state custody after the attack, the authorities said.According to court documents, the girl\u2019s mother said she had gone to the house of a friend, whom she had become acquainted with in jail, to spend Easter weekend. After disappearing into the garage with her for about 30 minutes, the mother returned to find her daughter \u201cupset,\u201d with her dress \u201cpulled up past her waist.\u201dThe mother told investigators that she called a taxi and returned with the girl to their apartment. The next day, after her daughter told her about the rape and that one of the men threatened to kill her if she told anyone, the woman called the police.The girl told investigators that the men had taken turns raping her twice, holding her down by her hands, before putting her back on the couch, the statement said.A Facebook statement by the sheriff\u2019s department on April 3 became an outlet for public rage over the case, drawing more than 2,000 comments. Some called for the girl\u2019s mother to be charged and for the men to be publicly hanged, castrated, thrown into a pit to \u201csuffer,\u201d or to be shot by firing squad.\u201cI say let them loose and let the community handle them,\u201d one person wrote. \u201cEven the death penalty is too tame for them. They need to feel pain.\u201d\u201cI want hard-core punishment for what they have done to this child, because that shouldn\u2019t happen to anybody,\u201d the grandmother, Elizabeth, said.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misspelled part of the name of a law enforcement agency. It is the Uintah County Sheriff\u2019s Department, not Utah County.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "John Doerr to Step Aside and Become Chairman at Kleiner Perkins", "Date": "2016-03-31", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 John Doerr, one of Silicon Valley\u2019s most prominent venture capitalists, is stepping back from the day-to-day management of his firm, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, in a changing of the guard.Mr. Doerr, 64, who joined Kleiner Perkins in 1980, will become its first chairman. The shift reflects a reprioritization of his time from managing the firm to grooming the next generation of leaders.While Mr. Doerr will continue to focus on the investments that he has already made and the board seats he currently holds, he is no longer responsible for the success of new investments made out of new funds.It\u2019s unclear who will replace Mr. Doerr as the person who oversees Kleiner Perkins, a 45-year-old investment firm that helped put the venture industry on the map and made Silicon Valley the center of the technology start-up world. Mr. Doerr raised the profile of the firm in the late 1990s and in the early 2000s with his hugely profitable investments in Amazon and Google.In his blog post, Mr. Doerr said his management duties will be split for now among several Kleiner partners \u2014 Ted Schlein, Beth Seidenberg and Mary Meeker. Mr. Doerr also highlighted the firm\u2019s younger generation, including Mike Abbott, Eric Feng, Wen Hsieh and Mood Rowghani.At the same time that Kleiner Perkins was focused on clean technology, rival firms including Accel Partners and Greylock Partners were betting on new Internet companies including Facebook, which ended up proving to be hugely successful. Kleiner Perkins has since de-emphasized its investing in green technology and has refocused on tech investments.Mr. Doerr did not refer to the case in his blog post.\u201cThe venture industry is changing all the time,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe must keep changing to better compete and serve entrepreneurs.\u201dAn article on April 1 about a changing of the guard at the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers described incorrectly a change in the role of John Doerr, who has been its day-to-day manager and will become its chairman. Mr. Doerr will continue to invest in new start-ups; it is not the case that he will not make such investments. However, he will no longer have fiduciary responsibility for the success of those investments.Advertisement"}

I want to change the planet.The way I want to change the planet is through me!If I can attain mindfulness and wellness, and others follow, we will create a sustainable planet and harmony will prevail.For many generations, people wanted to acquire stuff. They didn\u2019t really care where it came from. I want the things I buy to tell a story. I am into experience rather than possessions. For example, I want the journals I record my life experience in to be made from acid-free paper sourced from sustainably managed local forests.That way, my journals speak to me, just as my shirts made from sustainable organic cotton comfort me \u2014 and nothing I own hurts the earth or anyone on it.Conventional politics, like conventional business, is finished. Ideology is like bricks-and-mortar retail: a hangover from another age. Sharing is the new owning. Luxury is less. The remote eco-lodge is the new Ritz. Getting healthy is the new getting high. My parents don\u2019t get it. One day they will.Everyone has a story to tell and, through smartphones, everyone has a full production studio in his or her (or some other possessive pronoun) pocket. We are the empowered generation. We can hold corporations accountable, demand transparency and the appointment of chief sustainability officers, and reject what they manufacture if it\u2019s not compatible with a better, happier, smarter, more ethical planet. That\u2019s the power of me!Occasionally, I have random thoughts that are not reflective of true mindfulness. I\u2019ve wondered if the happy chickens portrayed on the boxes of cage-free organic eggs would be that happy if they knew their eggs were inside. But in general I feel good knowing that the eggs I eat came from contented chickens on a local farm. We all know that happy pigs produce the best pork (not that I eat meat).Carnivores leave huge carbon footprints. I have nothing against them, of course. But if they thought about how much we need to cut greenhouse gas emissions to avoid climate change, disrupted ecosystems, rising ocean temperatures, and vast movements of people deprived of livelihoods, they might be a little less selfish and aggressive.Plus, if they adopted plant-based food they\u2019d be getting a great combo deal: lowering their sky-high cholesterol and helping the planet. Livestock is responsible for a lot of greenhouse gas emissions (O.K., dairy is not so great either).That\u2019s one of the terrific things about the politics of me. There are so many combo deals! What you wear and eat, how you travel, and what you do are your own political statements. They make you feel good about yourself at the same time as they advance world peace. What thinking person would not switch to a quinoa-based veggie burger for that cause?You are not less male for eating kale. The humble Brussels sprout is embarrassingly trendy \u2014 not seen a menu without them for a while \u2014 but still a lot better than prime rib in planetary terms.Overall, I\u2019d define myself as a small-batch, vegetarian \u201clocavore\u201d into yoga (and Instagram yoga communities), integrity, interconnectedness, mindfulness, and artisanal authenticity (but wary of calculated authenticity), dedicated to reimagining the planet for the post-fossil-fuel era.To which you might say, \u201cThat\u2019s a mouthful and who the heck cares?\u201dThat\u2019s what my Dad says, by the way, but he\u2019s way behind the curve these days. Got \u201c20th-century\u201d written all over him.It\u2019s past time to celebrate the politics of me. The selfie is the political and cultural portrait of our time. The great failing of all past attempts to change societies is that they did not start from changing self. In fact they were often a diversion from that core responsibility.I care about the planet, and I\u2019m me, and I\u2019m proud to be me. The age of hierarchies and bullies is over. Anyone with a smartphone can build an audience. Not that you will find me in the smartphone prayer position for hours on end. I am mindful enough to know that getting offline from time to time is important for getting in sync with my inner self.I hesitated to say this but I\u2019m also into gluten-free. I know a lot of people are these days \u2014 there is talk of an \u201cepidemic\u201d \u2014 but so what? I just feel better eating gluten-free, so I encourage others to try it, and some of them get irritated, but that\u2019s their problem, not mine.Once they\u2019ve raised their consciousness and attained greater mindfulness, my guess is they\u2019ll come over to the gluten-free side. Just because gluten has been around in wheat for about 12,000 years doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s good.I\u2019m also lactose intolerant, but that\u2019s another story.The revolution is underway.

The employees there were the first car washers to join a labor union, the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which allowed them to win contracts that provided higher wages and job protections.Mrs. Clinton, who greeted workers with Stu Appelbaum, the president of the union, described it as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cgreat effort.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve campaigned at a lot of gas stations, some of which had car washes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Clinton said when asked if that was her first campaign stop at a car wash. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut this is special because the workers here at this car wash have been organized.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBefore the tour of Queens, Mrs. Clinton greeted nurses at St. John\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Riverside Hospital in Yonkers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can tell you this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she told the crowd of women gathered in the hospital cafeteria. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will not let someone like Donald Trump or Ted Cruz say what he is saying about the people, the hardworking people, including immigrants, but everyone who works hard in New York.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "A Roomful of Funny Women, Bonding Over the New York Comedy Life", "Date": "2016-04-10", "News": "Supported byThe idea was simple but novel: Take one picture of as many women in New York City\u2019s varied comedy scenes as possible.And so on Saturday afternoon, despite the cold and rain, more than 200 female comedians gathered to have their photo taken together at a performance space in Brooklyn. Amid a festive, buzzing energy, some of the comedians were in formal wear and extravagant makeup, while a few were in full costume (an elderly woman with a walker, a Vine star with painted-on eyeglasses and crab claw hands). The motley looks could have come from the \u201cSgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band\u201d album cover.Balanced on a stepladder in front of the risers of women, the photographer Mindy Tucker paused to reflect on the moment. \u201cI\u2019ve been in comedy a long time, and this has never happened before,\u201d she said as the room cheered.The photo was the brainchild of Jessica Delfino, a New York comedian and founder of the annual New York Funny Songs Fest. She was inspired by a private Facebook group for female comedians in the city. \u201cThere\u2019s a protective kind of environment,\u201d Ms. Delfino said of the group. \u201cWe can talk very frankly about things that are irritating to women in comedy, or are just funny. I love the community. And I said to myself, It would be great to be able to take all these women and get them together.\u201dIn March, she brought her idea for the group photo to Ms. Tucker, who has been documenting the comedy scene in New York since 2008. \u201cShe\u2019s very valued in the community, and when she says for people to show up somewhere at a certain time, they do,\u201d Ms. Delfino said.At the same time, nurturing women in comedy has become of particular interest to a younger generation. Selena Coppock, a comic who founded the private Facebook group with another comedian, Katie Compa, said, \u201cUsually you\u2019re the only woman\u201d in a standup show,\u201d she explained after the photo. \u201cIt\u2019s like nine men, one woman. So it was really hard for us to even know each other, or collaborate, or network.\u201dThe photo shoot was an opportunity to socialize and make contacts in person. The setting was Littlefield, the Gowanus home to regular comedy shows like Night Train and Punderdome 3000. The assembled comics, though little known beyond the city\u2019s stages, represented the wide range of performance today, from stand-up and improv to Vine videos and podcasting. There were also bookers, directors and other professionals in the industry. Using the hashtag #WomenInComedy2016, comedians who couldn\u2019t attend contributed their photos on Instagram, with \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d co-creator Lizz Winstead, the NPR host and comedian Ophira Eisenberg and others submitting from afar. (Some 340 R.S.V.P.\u2019d, and about 215 showed up.)As yet, the organizers haven\u2019t decided where, if at all, the photo will be displayed. \u201cOur idea was just let\u2019s take the picture,\u201d Ms. Delfino said, adding, \u201cThen we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201dAn article on Monday about a gathering of more than 200 female comedians in Brooklyn to have their picture taken together omitted a founder of a private Facebook group for female comedians in New York.

He treats cops like criminals and criminals like freedom fighters.\u00e2\u0080\u009dTicking off a list of particulars against Mr. de Blasio, the ad criticizes him for ending stop-and-frisk policing and for liberal immigration policies that put out \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe red carpet for illegals.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd Cruz will instruct the Justice Department to hold corrupt politicians accountable,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the ad says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMaybe that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why de Blasio fears Ted Cruz. Send de Blasio a message. Vote Cruz for president.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe ad exaggerates the crime rate under Mr. de Blasio: While the murder rate increased in 2015, it did not approach 10 percent, and homicides remain low by historical standards.Karen Hinton, a spokeswoman for Mr. de Blasio, said Mr. Cruz\u2019s ad was misleading in its portrayal of violent crime, and pointed to the sharp drop in murders in the first quarter of 2016. She accused Mr. Cruz, whom Mr. de Blasio has repeatedly rebuked for his past criticism of \u00e2\u0080\u009cNew York values,\u00e2\u0080\u009d of once again belittling the city and its residents.\u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Cruz doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deal in facts, only insults, and he just insulted New Yorkers once again by lying about the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s murder rate, the officers who have kept murders and shootings at record low numbers and the millions of immigrants who work and live in New York City,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Hinton said in an email.Mr. Cruz and Mr. de Blasio have clashed repeatedly, sometimes in harshly personal terms, over the last few months, as Mr. de Blasio has inveighed against the Texas senator\u2019s positions on issues like immigration and national security, and Mr. Cruz has held up Mr. de Blasio as an example of misguided Democratic governance.Politically, the rivalry has served both men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s purposes. For Mr. Cruz, brawling with Mr. de Blasio is likely to win applause from conservative voters in a city where Donald J. Trump has dominated in Republican primaries, and in areas upstate where Mr. de Blasio is unpopular.And by criticizing Mr. de Blasio, Mr. Cruz has tried to soften the backlash against his past criticism of Mr. Trump for his \u00e2\u0080\u009cNew York values.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The values he was criticizing, Mr. Cruz has said, are those embodied by New York\u00e2\u0080\u0099s liberal politicians.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

I didn\u2019t know Chinese people hated us [North Korean defectors] that much. A lot of Chinese people believe the Chinese government, and think I\u2019m a traitor. I thought China was the right place to deliver this talk.I don\u2019t hate the Chinese. We\u2019re brothers and we share a border. I just hate the government, politicians, policies, not the people. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here. I want to at least change some of the information they\u2019ve been given.Chinese policy is: If you report a North Korean defector, you\u2019ll get paid. The prices, I understand, are 3,000 to 5,000 renminbi [about $460 to $770] if you report defectors. There are Chinese in border towns who are reporting on them for the money. It\u2019s really sad.Last year, nine defectors were caught in Vietnam. They were returned to China. Why does China always want to support North Korea, even on defector issues? Why are you the savior of North Korea? Why do you ignore the international community\u2019s demands?The key is still China. That\u2019s why I\u2019m asking the big countries, like America, do whatever you can to change the Chinese government\u2019s mind.If they read my book, they\u2019d understand. I did my best to escape. I think it\u2019s all a miracle. It\u2019s not because Chinese policemen were stupid enough to believe my fake story. I think it was a miracle. That\u2019s why sometimes I think God exists.And it wasn\u2019t just me. Once I met a Chinese student who was studying in South Korea. When she saw the news in South Korea about her own country, she said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t my country. This isn\u2019t happening.\u2019\u2019 At that moment I realized we were all brainwashed.Living in South Korea, I can reach any website. But this time when I arrived in Beijing, I was shocked that you can\u2019t access Google, Facebook, Gmail. I\u2019d heard about this. But experiencing it, it\u2019s freaking me.One day, one of my best friends said, \u201cYou never talk about your family, you never visit your hometown at New Year\u2019s.\u201d She was Korean Chinese, from Yanji. I wanted to tell her the truth, but I couldn\u2019t trust anyone. It was really tiring always pretending to be someone else. Not my life, not my real name, nothing.China has such an important role. Whether North Korea collapses or we have unification, or everything stays as it is, depends on China. So if China or other countries support those high-ranking officials, giving them power to bring about change, it\u2019s possible to bring about regime change.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Chris Hardwick, King of the Nerds, Is Expanding His Empire", "Date": "2016-04-07", "News": "Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 It was a typical Tuesday for Chris Hardwick, the excitable ringmaster of nerd culture.Most people know him as the host of AMC\u2019s \u201cTalking Dead,\u201d which has 6.5 million viewers each week, but on this March day the stand-up comedian, podcast pioneer and digital media entrepreneur was devoting a 16-hour stint to the geekier outposts of his empire. In the writers\u2019 room at \u201c@Midnight,\u201d the Comedy Central game show in which he and guest comedians riff on Internet culture, Mr. Hardwick cracked jokes about the just-announced return of Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones. Across the studio lot, he recorded his weekly Nerdist podcast with the comedian and musician Reggie Watts, confessing that weed-induced paranoia keeps him from smoking pot. And late in the evening, he delivered new material about make-out burps, temptress nannies and Linux-based operating systems at the stand-up comedy workshop he hosts in the back of a Hollywood comics store.\u201cI\u2019ve just channeled all that energy that went into drinking into time-management skills,\u201d said Mr. Hardwick, 44, of his packed-to-the-gills schedule (he\u2019s been sober for nearly 13 years).After riding high in the 1990s as a co-host of MTV\u2019s dating show, \u201cSingled Out,\u201d only to see his career sputter for the next decade, he decided to embrace his obsessions with zombies, superheroes, video games and tech. And with his instinctive understanding of connecting with fans over social media, he\u2019s transformed those once-niche interests into an ever-growing kingdom.In the process, he\u2019s become the model of an entertainment brand for a multiscreen generation, seeding every sort of outlet and venue (no matter how small) with a constant barrage of fanboy content. Besides the millions who watch him each week on \u201cTalking Dead\u201d after every episode of \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d (and starting on Sunday, April 10, \u201cFear the Walking Dead\u201d), 5.5 million people download his Nerdist podcast each month, while the Nerdist website draws close to 10 million visitors. He has 2.8 million followers on Twitter and another million on Instagram. Then there\u2019s his embrace of Snapchat, Periscope, Facebook Live and Twitch. As nerd culture has become more mainstream, he is its attractive, welcoming emissary.And later this year, he will try to cross over to network television when he hosts an NBC trivia game show called \u201cThe Wall.\u201d\u201cChris has been able to build a brand because he is genuine, and authentic,\u201d said Thomas Tull, the chief executive of Legendary Entertainment, the company behind \u201cJurassic World\u201d and the Christopher Nolan Batman trilogy. (It bought Nerdist Industries in 2012 and in turn was purchased in January by a Chinese conglomerate for $3.5 billion.) \u201cIn a world with plenty of white noise, he cuts through because he loves what he does, and the fans sense that.\u201dOf course, the building of a media empire comes with its share of possible pitfalls. If Mr. Hardwick gets stretched so thin he can\u2019t keep up with the latest twists in the Marvel Universe or the time-jumps of Doctor Who, his bond with the audience could fray. After all, his fans know a real nerd when they see one. Here\u2019s what it was like to follow him around for a week.\u201cNothing makes me hotter than dividing the circumference of a circle by its diameter,\u201d Mr. Hardwick said. \u201cIt\u2019s the only thing that can bring me to cli-math.\u201d (Puns, preferably drenched in sexual innuendo, are a favorite of Mr. Hardwick\u2019s.) \u201cThat, and reciting pi to the one-hundredth decimal.\u201dDuring rehearsal that afternoon, Mr. Hardwick suddenly splayed his fingers over his closed eyes and reeled off, rapid fire, pi to more than 100 places.The show\u2019s writers and producers, jaded sorts, began to clap. A \u201cwow\u201d was even heard.\u201cYou\u2019ve always said you were a nerd, but I didn\u2019t believe it till now,\u201d said Josh McDermitt, who plays the mullet-sporting Eugene on \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d when the host repeated the trick on the show.Mr. Hardwick was one of those chess club kids who actually got stuffed in a garbage can. Nine pounds of Dungeons & Dragons dice live in a vase in his \u201c@Midnight\u201d dressing room. And his love of the British science-fiction show \u201cDoctor Who\u201d is so intense that half of the cake at his August wedding (to the actress and publishing heiress Lydia Hearst) will be a re-creation of the Tardis, the time machine masquerading as a police call box.But for the first chunk of Mr. Hardwick\u2019s career, such animating interests had little connection to the jobs he filled. His first break came in 1995, when he, along with Jenny McCarthy, was chosen to host \u201cSingled Out.\u201dThe show lasted three years, and Mr. Hardwick\u2019s image in Hollywood seemed cemented: the snarky comedian trafficking in generic pop-culture jokes. He filmed a string of unsuccessful pilots, often as the host of a dating show. There were auditions for lots of Jack Black-type roles on sitcoms, at least until he quit drinking and got in shape. (In his self-help book, \u201cThe Nerdist Way,\u201d Mr. Hardwick jokes that through his dissolute 20s \u201cI was consuming a baby elephant\u2019s weight in alcohol every day.\u201d) And the smattering of TV and movie appearances (like \u201cZoey 101,\u201d \u201cHouse of a Thousand Corpses\u201d) did little to provide professional fulfillment.It all came to a head in 2007. He couldn\u2019t get work, his stand-up career was going nowhere, and he owned a house he could barely afford. \u201cEarly one morning, I just had this moment of clarity: I need to just do the things I love,\u201d he said. \u201cAt least I\u2019ll be happy.\u201dEmbracing his inner nerd, Mr. Hardwick immediately got himself a job hosting \u201cWired Science\u201d on PBS. Next came a gadget reviewer gig on G4\u2019s \u201cAttack of the Show,\u201d which led to \u201cWeb Soup.\u201d His zombie expertise, and a connection with a top AMC executive from his MTV days, helped him land \u201cTalking Dead\u201d in 2011, and \u201c@Midnight\u201d followed in 2013. All the while, the Nerdist blog he began in 2008 grew into a full-fledged digital media company, with a news website, nearly 50 podcasts, a YouTube channel and even an improv and sketch comedy academy.That Mr. Hardwick now has a career that allows him to hang out with the likes of Weird Al Yankovic never ceases to amaze him: \u201cSo much of my life are moments my 12-year-old self wouldn\u2019t be able to fully process.\u201d\u201cHow\u2019s everyone feeling?\u201d Mr. Hardwick asked as he convened what he calls his \u201cweekly ritualistic therapy session.\u201dOn display was what makes Mr. Hardwick an in-demand host (and moderator for Comic-Con panels): his natural rapport with his guests. Stand-up comedians don\u2019t always make the best television hosts. They\u2019re typically both the author and executor of their material, not collaborators, and their interviewing skills often leave much to be desired.Mr. Hardwick is a good listener, and his deep familiarity with his guests\u2019 work allows him to be quick on his feet. \u201cHe is very adept at making his guests funnier,\u201d said Kent Alterman, who\u2019s the president of original programming at Comedy Central. He also likes to hang out with them after the show. After tapings of \u201cTalking Dead,\u201d he revels in taking his guests down into the bowels of CBS Television City so they can (surreptitiously) spin the wheel from \u201cThe Price Is Right.\u201dMr. Hardwick, who was glued to game shows in his youth like \u201cMatch Game\u201d and \u201cJoker\u2019s Wild,\u201d will get to host his first non-comic one when NBC airs the LeBron James-produced \u201cThe Wall.\u201d Two-person teams \u2014 chosen for their inspiring back stories \u2014 will answer trivia questions as a ball is dropped down a giant wall lined with slots marked with monetary values.But today\u2019s host \u2014 or any rising entertainment personality, really \u2014 can\u2019t just call it a day when the TV taping is done.So Mr. Hardwick quickly changed out of his Theory suit, plopped down on the couch with his laptop and opened his iPhone to a Facebook video app. It was time for a Facebook Live chat with \u201cTalking Dead\u201d fans.\u201cThis is basically \u2018Talking Talking Dead,\u2019\u201d Mr. Hardwick said.Though he mentioned he\u2019d be doing the session at the end of \u201cTalking Dead,\u201d all told it drew more than 110,000 viewers and 23,000 comments.The imperatives of being an entertainment personality now require more than unmediated conversations with the audience. There has to be new content, tailored to the different social-media platforms.At the SXSW festival last month in Austin, Tex., Mr. Hardwick filmed an episode of \u201c@Midnight\u201d that appeared only on Periscope, Twitter\u2019s live streaming video project. There\u2019s also a weekly \u201c@Midnight\u201d show for Snapchat called \u201cStupid Points.\u201d\u201cWe had it so easy for so long because we only ever had to focus on one platform,\u201d Mr. Hardwick said. \u201cBut particularly in television, you\u2019ve got to chase the audience a bit.\u201dIn the back of Meltdown Comics, on a forlorn stretch of Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, Mr. Hardwick popped onto the stage of the Nerdist Showroom just past 9 p.m. on Tuesday night. Beta Test, a regular comedy workshop he runs for himself and his comedian pals, was now in session.Mr. Hardwick loves mixing it up with the audience at his comedy gigs. Greeting the folks individually in the first row, he riffed rapid-fire about their occupations. To the woman who said she was on sabbatical: \u201cThat\u2019s a very romantic term for unemployed. It makes it sound like it was your choice.\u201dBut Mr. Hardwick\u2019s barbs are directed more at himself than at the audience. It\u2019s all up for discussion \u2014 his anxiety, his love life \u2014 as his comedy has become much more personal in recent years. The Funcomfortable Tour, which culminated in January with two shows at the Palace of Fine Arts Theater in San Francisco (filmed for a Comedy Central special on April 30), dealt with his most cringe-inducing moments.\u201cSome of the things that I actually admit on stage are kind of odd when I think about it,\u201d Mr. Hardwick said.Like losing his virginity to a blowup doll in high school.Steve Martin and Joan Rivers were among Mr. Hardwick\u2019s comedy gods growing up. Raising him in Memphis, his parents \u2014 his father a professional bowler and his mother a real estate agent \u2014 placed no restrictions on what he could watch or listen to, even buying him Mr. Martin\u2019s albums. When his father took him along to tournaments in Las Vegas, he remembers seeing Ms. Rivers in concert. He wasn\u2019t yet 10.Mr. Hardwick\u2019s comedy, though, is more nakedly autobiographical than theirs \u2014 the death of his father in 2013 runs like a backbone through the \u201cFuncomfortable\u201d special. He comes across to his fans as one of them, even if he is marrying Ms. Hearst and just moved into an $11 million home with breathtaking views of the city.

And those 50 dates don\u2019t include his drop-in sets at clubs in Los Angeles. \u201cIf you sat next to Chris on an airplane and asked him what he did for a living, he would say he was a stand-up comedian,\u201d said his manager, Alex Murray, of Brillstein Entertainment Partners.Mr. Hardwick\u2019s commitments add up to one seriously crazed schedule. One that could damage, or derail, a painstakingly built career built on authenticity. If he doesn\u2019t know as much as his fans (or more) about the their favorite TV shows, movies, comics and other hallmarks of geek culture, he could be pegged as a poser \u2014 or \u201ca fake nerd\u201d as some of his online critics put it \u2014 who isn\u2019t worthy of their attention.Mr. Hardwick is aware of the problem. He\u2019s cut back on the number of Nerdist podcasts he records each week, from three to one. He doesn\u2019t play the time-sucking video games he dearly loves much anymore. And he insists he turns down plenty of projects.\u201cI\u2019m not so psychotic that I don\u2019t know how to say no to things,\u201d he said.Earlier on Tuesday, Mr. Hardwick arrived just before 6 p.m. at the offices of Funny or Die, the humor website and production company that boasts Will Ferrell and the director Adam McKay among its co-founders. It was the second official gathering of Spitball, a previously unannounced venture that aims to offer fledgling companies media consulting and comedic video-production services.It was not your typical business meeting. Yes, there may have been cash-flow projections displayed on a screen, and buzzwords like \u201cpublic facing\u201d bandied about. But there were also tasteless jokes about colonoscopies.Diversifying outside the entertainment world is the motivation for Mr. Hardwick and his partners, which include Funny or Die. The pitch: The people behind Spitball understand both comedy and social media and how to combine the two to build a brand. \u201cThe advantage we have is we know how to talk to people,\u201d Mr. Hardwick said.Spitball is but one part of Mr. Hardwick\u2019s plan to build his off-camera career.His latest contract with Comedy Central calls for him to be a digital guru of sorts for the network. \u201cIt\u2019s great for us to tap into his brain,\u201d said the network\u2019s Mr. Alterman.And he\u2019s getting into TV production himself, through Nerdist Industries. Syfy nixed \u201cNerdist News,\u201d but a pilot at Comedy Central with the magician Justin Willman remains in the running. (An animation company he co-owns has a pilot, \u201cDanger & Eggs,\u201d on Amazon.)Most ambitious among the company\u2019s expansion plans is a streaming video network that would seek to bind its audience closer together, and in the process, to Nerdist. \u201cAs connective as the Internet is,\u201d Mr. Hardwick said, \u201cit\u2019s actually remarkably isolating. Because you interact with it alone.\u201dThe Internet can be a harsh place, full of nasty personal attacks. Mr. Hardwick, a digital evangelist if there ever was one, gets particularly exercised about such viciousness. Discussing his philosophy for the podcast, he said he \u201calways wants people to leave feeling a little bit better than when they got there.\u201d And that optimistic maxim serves as a guiding principle.His celebratory tendencies get him bashed regularly on social media as a cheerleader \u2014 don\u2019t turn to Mr. Hardwick if you\u2019re looking for a brutal takedown of \u201cBatman v Superman\u201d \u2014 but he wears those criticisms proudly.\u201cI feel there\u2019s enough negativity, there\u2019s enough cynicism, there\u2019s enough walled garden and exclusionary behavior,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can get that so many places.\u201dThere\u2019s none of that snobbishness in Mr. Hardwick\u2019s empire.\u201cThe soul of it, if I were really breaking it down psychologically, is pretty simple: I always felt excluded when I was in grade school, and I wanted to create something where no one would ever have to feel that way.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Disney\u2019s Savvy Marketing of \u2018The Jungle Book\u2019", "Date": "2016-04-17", "News": "Supported by\u201cAll of this, honestly, is one big magic trick.\u201dStudios hate to discuss their marketing for fear of coming across as corporate versions of Kaa, the slippery \u201cJungle Book\u201d python who hypnotizes prey. (\u201cTrusssst in me.\u201d) But movies \u2014 especially ones as tricky as \u201cThe Jungle Book,\u201d a stylized film based on a cartoon musical, based on a classic book \u2014 do not sell themselves. Here are some of the tricks that Disney, which declined to comment, used to move the masses:This was the first marketing stunt for \u201cThe Jungle Book,\u201d which cost roughly $175 million to make. By going to happy, peppy Disneyphiles first, Disney ensured that the movie\u2019s initial blast on social media would be a positive one.When animals talk in a movie, unless it\u2019s a comedy, older moviegoers tend to skip it. Most of Mr. Favreau\u2019s animals are not cartoonish and cuddly (not by a long shot), but Disney could not rely on trailers and TV spots to convey that message.In part to make \u201cThe Jungle Book\u201d appeal to a finicky high school crowd \u2014 older siblings tend to influence younger brothers and sisters \u2014 Disney packed the first trailer with scary moments (pouncing panther, snarling tiger, stampeding buffalo) while hiding the musical numbers and keeping Baloo\u2019s goofier moments to a minimum.Stars are another way to make adults pay attention. To elevate \u201cThe Jungle Book\u201d in the minds of grown-ups, Disney in March circulated dramatic photographs that paired voice actors with their onscreen characters \u2014 Idris Elba with the tiger Shere Khan, Ben Kingsley with the panther Bagheera, Lupita Nyong\u2019o with the wolf Raksha.Generally speaking, women and girls see Disney\u2019s magic castle logo on a trailer and are pulled closer. The opposite can be true with guys. So Disney aggressively and repeatedly pitched \u201cThe Jungle Book\u201d to male audiences.Commercials on ESPN portrayed the movie as coming not from the studio that made \u201cCinderella\u201d but \u201cfrom the studio that brought you \u2018Pirates of the Caribbean.\u2019\u201d An extended 3-D trailer for \u201cThe Jungle Book\u201d was attached to \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens,\u201d which had an audience that was 58 percent male.And Disney rolled out an action-oriented trailer during the Super Bowl.Studio marketers have learned that Hispanic moviegoers tend to buy tickets in particularly large groups; if you hook one family member, you can get an exponential result. To achieve that goal, Disney teamed with Univision for a five-week stunt that brought \u201cJungle Book\u201d characters and clips to telenovelas, talk shows and sports coverage. Disney even built a tool to allow Univision personalities to appear in scenes.Various corners of the Disney empire pitched in to promote \u201cThe Jungle Book.\u201d A New Year\u2019s Day stunt on the Disney Channel, for instance, was used to portray the film as one of the year\u2019s first blockbuster offerings for families and children.But the synergistic heavy lifting was done by Disney theme parks. During the jam-packed spring break weeks, park theaters in Florida and California offered sneak-peek footage of the movie, with Mr. Favreau providing introductions.The many (many) theme park stores that sell Disney merchandise had \u201cJungle Book\u201d sections. And Disney built photogenic \u201cJungle Book\u201d sand sculptures at its Animal Kingdom and Epcot parks in Florida.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Israel, Iraqi Jews Reflect on Baghdad Heritage", "Date": "2016-04-27", "News": "Supported byGIVATAYIM, Israel \u2014 During a boisterous Passover Seder with her extended family, Sabiha Ziluf, 75, paused and said softly that she could still see the Baghdad streets of her childhood. \u201cI would love to visit Bab al-Sharji,\u201d she said, referring to an old neighborhood near where her aunt lived.Among those viewing the center\u2019s reconstructions of the shops and crooked alleys of Baghdad\u2019s old Jewish quarter were swarms of children, generations removed from those who experienced Babylon\u2019s allure firsthand. \u201cThey are heroes,\u201d Liel Ovadya, 13, said of the Jews of Baghdad, who included his grandmother Oshrat Berko, who immigrated to Israel at 15. As of 2014, there were 227,900 Jews of Iraqi descent living in Israel, according to government data.Families with ties to Iraq are among several communities of Israelis from Arabic and North African countries newly embracing their origins after struggling to be accepted by the Ashkenazi Jews of Europe, who founded Israel and for decades dominated its political, military and academic elites. The resurgent interest comes as the number of Jews in Iraq has dwindled to nearly none, and as the Islamic State and other hostile groups are sowing chaos in the streets, shrines and graveyards where Jews lived, died and celebrated their faith for nearly three millenniums.In recent interviews, many Israelis pointed to two unlikely cultural icons \u2014 Dudu Tassa, a 39-year-old rock star, and Eli Amir, a 78-year-old novelist \u2014 as forces that have accelerated Iraqi Jews\u2019 efforts to preserve their past before it vanishes forever.\u201cThe Dove Flyer,\u201d a novel by Mr. Amir, and the 2014 film based on it, culminate in the 1951 Israeli airlift that brought nearly 110,000 Jews to Israel from Iraq with little more than the clothes on their backs. Arriving shortly after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, the newcomers largely suppressed their culture, Mr. Amir said in an interview, because \u201ctheir language was the enemy language and their music was the music of the enemy.\u201d\u201cThis was a kind of a terrible wound that each and every one of us tried to handle differently,\u201d Mr. Amir said. His work, he said, was meant \u201cto put my visiting card on the table of every Ashkenazi to let them know we didn\u2019t come from the desert and caves and trees \u2014 that we came from a civilized country.\u201dIraq\u2019s Jewish history dates about 4,000 years to the birth of the biblical patriarch Abraham in Ur, where there is a shrine and archaeological digs. Long after Abraham left for what was then called Canaan, generations of Jews were sent to exile in Babylon, between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers in what is now Iraq.An Ottoman census in 1917 counted 80,000 Jews in Baghdad out of 202,000 residents, a community that Nissim Rejwan, the author of \u201cThe Jews of Iraq: 3,000 Years of History and Culture,\u201d described as \u201cperhaps the wealthiest, and certainly the best educated\u201d in that era.Ali Adeeb, who once worked for The New York Times in Baghdad and who now teaches at New York University, said that in the first half of the 20th century, Jews were not only major forces in Iraq\u2019s financial institutions, but also produced the nation\u2019s most renowned historian, most famous singer and most influential composers \u2014 including Mr. Tassa\u2019s grandfather and great-uncle.Iraqi Jews had always been the targets of sporadic attacks. But the danger soared with the rise of the Nazis\u2019 influence in the 1930s as well as unhappiness around the Arab world with Zionism\u2019s push for a Jewish state. A pogrom in June 1941, the Farhud, killed nearly 200 Jews in Baghdad.Sammy Smooha, 74, a sociology professor at Haifa University, said his father was stabbed repeatedly during the pogrom but survived by pretending to be dead, stirring only after he had been loaded onto a truck with other bodies.\u201cThis is the point where they realized there is no future in Iraq,\u201d said Lily Shor, a guide and events manager at the Babylonian Jewry Heritage Center in Or Yehuda, outside Tel Aviv.Still, as Mr. Amir describes in his work, there was disagreement among Jews on whether to take the airlift to Israel in 1951; thousands remained behind. For those who left, a new challenge awaited, said Dina Zvi Riklis, 66, a Tel Aviv filmmaker: starting over with nothing as a Mizrahi \u2014 the Israeli term for Jews from the Middle East and North Africa \u2014 in a young country dominated by Ashkenazis from Eastern Europe.\u201cI told my mother not to speak to me in Arabic,\u201d Ms. Riklis said. \u201cI denied that I came from Iraq.\u201d She recalls her father being ridiculed by Israelis who called his traditional Arabic dishdasha, or a full-length garment, \u201cpajamas.\u201dWith Jewish life all but extinguished in Baghdad, Ronit Azouri, the general manager of the heritage center, said the institution was \u201cthe only place you can see what it was like for Jews in Iraq.\u201dOne of the center\u2019s exhibits shows the Iraqi version of charoset, a staple of the Passover Seder plate, using date honey and nuts, and a Haggadah, the text guide to the Seder itself, in Iraqi Jewish dialect \u2014 largely drawn from Arabic but written in Hebrew letters.Professor Smooha, who came to Israel on the airlift when he was 9, said some rapprochement between Iraqi Jews and their heritage had been occurring for more than a decade. But he said he saw new changes: In December, Israel began offering a stipend of about $950 a year, as well as assistance with prescription medication, to those who were affected by the Farhud (along with those from Algeria and Morocco who suffered under the Vichy government).As for Mr. Tassa, he said that in merging his grandfather\u2019s work with his own, he was forced to confront not only technical challenges but also his very identity. At concerts, he said, he has been \u201csurprised to see three generations of audience,\u201d adding, \u201cThe grandparents, the parents and the children all related to the show.\u201dJames Glanz reported from Givatayim and Or Yehuda, Israel, and Irit Pazner Garshowitz from Jerusalem.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Freedom Looks Like", "Date": "2016-04-13", "News": "Supported byUnbuttonedIs it fashion\u2019s responsibility to ease acceptance of different identities; to foster tolerance and understanding \u2014 or to promote a specific aesthetic expression of liberty?This may seem like a ridiculously weighty question for an industry built on the supposedly superficial business of selling clothes, as opposed to political philosophies. But it is at the core of a debate currently roiling France.In 2014, DKNY created a Ramadan capsule collection of its more covered-up items (think jumpsuits, ankle-length shirtdresses and skirts) available in the Middle East.That was followed the next year by similar ventures from Tommy Hilfiger and Uniqlo. Last year H&M featured a model in a head scarf in its \u201cClose the Loop\u201d sustainable-fashion ad campaign, and Net-a-Porter devoted a section on its website to what it called a \u201cRamadan edit.\u201dAnd in January, Dolce & Gabbana introduced a collection of floral print, lace and polka-dot abayas (loosefitting full-length robes) with matching headscarves sold not only in the Middle East, but also in select Dolce stores in London, Milan, Munich and Paris.Which meant that, along with the M&S bathing suit, such collections were no longer relegated to a specific geographical niche. They had penetrated the Western mainstream.She then went even further, comparing Muslim women to \u201cconsenting slaves,\u201d but later recanted that part of her statement after a public outcry. Still, it was as if the floodgates had opened.\u201cCreators should have nothing to do with Islamic fashion,\u201d he said. \u201cDesigners are there to make women more beautiful, to give them their freedom, not to collaborate with this dictatorship which imposes this abominable thing by which we hide women and make them live a hidden life.\u201d He then implied that the designers were exploiting a misogynist system that, for financial gain, forces women to hide their bodies: \u201cRenounce the money and have some principles,\u201d he said.On one side are those who say the social contract demands that everyone eschew symbols of their personal belief systems in service of the secular collective; on the other, those who insist that freedom includes the freedom to wear whatever you want (and sell whatever you want).It didn\u2019t take long for those in the latter camp to attack the attackers right back. A new hashtag was spawned, #rossignolresignation, and the Collective against Islamophobia in France (the CCIF) issued a news release stating that it was bringing a class-action lawsuit against Minister Rossignol for her statements.Sarah Dundarawy, a Saudi television presenter living in Dubai, wrote in an email: \u201cI graduated from Boston College in Boston, MA and did my masters at the London School of Economics in London, U.K. In general, I dress modestly and when I am in Saudi I wear an Abaya out of respect for my culture and convenience. Does that make me oppressed? Not beautiful? Of course not. As for the special collection of Abayas designed by Dolce & Gabbana, I saw it a nice gesture and an attempt to appeal to a large segment of the fashion market.\u201dAt The New York Times luxury conference in Versailles last week, Bernard Kouchner, the founder of Doctors Without Borders and former foreign minister of France, was asked directly what he thought of the issue. He waved his hand and said: \u201cIt\u2019s a free market. Let them wear what they want.\u201dThings have reached something of a standoff.Pointedly, the brands that started it all have done their best to stay out of the situation. None have issued public statements, though when asked, they are happy to provide anodyne emails from a \u201cspokesperson.\u201d\u201cH&M is a global fashion company that takes inspiration from all over the world,\u201d one such response said. \u201cWe are proud to be in 61 markets and welcome all people inspired by fashion regardless of ethnic background, gender or culture.\u201d\u201cM&S provides a wide range of quality swimwear offering our customers lots of choice,\u201d another said. Dolce & Gabbana simply said it did not comment on the matter.It\u2019s understandable. This is a complicated subject at the best of times, and these are the most fraught of times. And no brand wants to alienate a potential shopper. Yet this silence is also silly.The history of fashion is, in many ways, about facilitating acceptance; creating a bridge between the unfamiliar or the challenging, be it religious or sexual or gendered or transgressive, and the everyday.It is arguably one of the things the sharp point of the industry does best, whether by transforming underwear into outerwear, putting women into pants and men into women\u2019s wear or otherwise redesigning the trappings of revolution. (Think of all those fur-lined military surplus coats.)It forces confrontation, and by \u201cfashionizing\u201d what was hitherto seen as foreign, absorbs it, co-opts it and \u2014 to a certain extent \u2014 defangs it.

{"Headline": "New Jersey University Was Fake, but Visa Fraud Arrests Are Real", "Date": "2016-04-05", "News": "Supported byNEWARK \u2014 On the surface, the University of Northern New Jersey seemed legitimate. It had a website, with a seal featuring the Latin words \u201cHumanus, Scientia, Integritas,\u201d a list of business-oriented degrees offered and a promise of \u201can exceptional educational experience.\u201dIt was so exceptional it did not exist.Instead, the university was a fake, set up by the Homeland Security Department as part of a sting operation to ensnare criminals involved in student visa fraud.On Tuesday, that operation resulted in the arrests of 21 people, the United States attorney for New Jersey, Paul J. Fishman, and Sarah R. Salda\u00f1a, the director of United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement, announced at a news conference here.The people arrested were brokers who recruited foreign students who were mainly from China and India to an institution that they knew would not have real classes. The brokers, working with people posing as university officials, then charged the students in a scheme that allowed them to maintain their student visas and stay in the country, the government said. Some brokers also arranged, illegally, for work visas and jobs, the authorities said. Some of these so-called students, according to a law enforcement official, even used the fraudulent visas to get jobs at high-profile companies.Those arrested were mainly naturalized citizens and legal permanent residents, Mr. Fishman said. Six live in New York City, including three in Flushing, Queens.\u201cOur message is pretty loud and clear,\u201d Ms. Salda\u00f1a said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re out there, we have intelligence to identify you, we\u2019re going to find you and bring you to justice.\u201dThe brokers arranged student visas for the University of Northern New Jersey for a total of 1,076 people. Most of the \u201cstudents\u201d will ultimately have their visas revoked, Ms. Salda\u00f1a said.Mr. Fishman said all of the recruited students were already living in the United States, having initially obtained visas legally, but were looking for a way to stay. Many were living and working throughout the country.\u201cAll the defendants were pretty stunned about the charges,\u201d said Michael Horn, whose client, Tajesh Kodali, 44, of Edison, N.J., pleaded not guilty. \u201cThey\u2019re hopeful the truth will come out.\u201dThe operation, the government said, was a way to understand the extent of the criminal network behind visa fraud, including how students are recruited, how fake universities work and what happens after the students are enrolled.While the case exposed a network of fraud, it also exposed a gap in national security, the officials said on Tuesday. The brokers who negotiated visas did not do any background checks on their clients or their potential connections to terrorist organizations. Mr. Fishman said the United States government did vet the people who applied for student visas and did not find any threats to security.The official confirmed that one person did enlist, and that only one person was employed by Facebook, one person by Apple, two at Morgan Stanley and several at other prominent financial institutions.The University of Northern New Jersey opened in 2013, according to the complaints filed on Tuesday. The location was an office building in Cranford, N.J.The university may have been billed as an institution of higher learning, but no learning took place. It purported to offer undergraduate and graduate degree programs in areas like accounting, marketing and health care management. To lure recruiters, it was listed as state-licensed and certified by the Homeland Security Department. But there were no classes and no faculty members.No matter. \u201cOnce word got out, brokers descended on the school, clamoring to enroll their clients,\u201d Mr. Fishman said.The Homeland Security Investigations unit, which conducted the sting operation, had undercover agents accept calls from recruiters, according to several of the 14 complaints filed on Tuesday. These agents, in recorded telephone calls, warned the brokers that there would be no classes.A defendant named Chaun Kit Yuen, 24, responded, according to the complaint, \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing this for years, no worries.\u201dSome of the agents also obtained fraudulent work authorizations through the university in order to outsource their foreign national clients as full-time employees. A broker from Brooklyn, Syed Qasim Abbas, 41, who is an American citizen, owned an \u201cinformation technology staffing company\u201d in East Northport, N.Y., called Fastnet Software International, according to the complaint.He paid the university $6,000 to obtain 20 visas for skilled workers, known as H-1B visas, the complaint said. (The government never issued them.) He paid another $17,750 to the school for arranging the extension of student visas.Some brokers negotiated thousands of dollars of commissions from the undercover officials, one worth as much as $4,000, according to the complaint. Other brokers received illicit payments for placing students in jobs.About 1.2 million students are currently in the United States on student visas, a majority of whom are legitimately attending universities, government officials said.There have been several high-profile student visa fraud cases in recent years from California to New York, which represent a security concern for a government under pressure to screen visa applicants for possible terrorism ties.In 2012, a Government Accountability Office report faulted Immigration and Customs Enforcement for not providing enough control in the verification process for student visas. Officials with ICE said it had since been trying to tighten its accreditation protocols.Although the officials would not discuss how many fraudulent schools might actually be operating, Mr. Fishman said they were \u201ctoo prevalent.\u201dFor the recruiters, he added, \u201cthe University of Northern New Jersey was another stop on the \u2018pay to stay\u2019 tour.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated Preet Bharara\u2019s role in a case against three executives of Micropower Career Institute.

It is also potentially the last time each party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s candidates will be in the same place before their conventions. In Manhattan, Donald J. Trump, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio will appear at a black-tie fund-raiser for the state Republican Party. How Mr. Trump will feel about sharing his hometown event with his rivals remains to be seen. But it is the first time they will be together since they decided to abandon the so-called loyalty pledge they signed last year to support whoever becomes the party nominee. It is also one of the few times that Mr. Trump has appeared at a public campaign event in the five boroughs, where Republican votes are scarce. Mr. Trump is trying to bolster his tally of votes statewide to keep his percentage north of 50 percent so he can claim more delegates. There is a looming prospect of a thousand protesters outside the dinner, which, if they materialize, could be another disruption that Mr. Trump is forced to contend with. As for the Democrats, Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont will hold a debate at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, hosted by CNN and NY1. Their contest has become increasingly nasty, although it is genteel compared with the Republicans. But they are clearly sick of each other and tired of hiding it. Mr. Sanders has struggled in New York amid tough questions, and he has been tripped up on issues related to Israel. The borough is home to a large Orthodox Jewish population, a fact that might come up. Brooklyn is also home to a large African-American population.

Ping. Ping.But the attention, it turned out, was for the worst reasons possible.The mother, Jeanie K. Ditty of Spring Lake, N.C., had contacted Mr. Jo a month after her 2-year-old daughter, Macy, died on Dec. 4, 2015.Ms. Ditty sent three photos of herself at a cemetery, and Mr. Jo photoshopped faded images of Macy in an aura of light next to or walking with her mother.\u201cTo me, she seemed like a grieving mother,\u201d he said. Touched by her circumstances, he said he did about $500 worth of retouching work for free.But Mr. Jo said he was stunned to learn March 26 that Ms. Ditty, 23, and her boyfriend, Zachary E. Keefer, 32, had been charged in what the authorities said was the beating death of Macy.Ms. Ditty had posted the retouched photos \u201ceverywhere\u201d Mr. Jo said, and they were widely cited in news accounts about her murder charges. The result, he said, was thousands of mentions of his name on Facebook.\u201cI\u2019ve gotten a lot of hate because of this,\u201d he said. \u201cThe amount of backlash is just terrible.\u201dMr. Jo said Ms. Ditty told him through Facebook\u2019s Messenger that she gave her daughter a banana and that Macy began choking on it and then choked on her own vomit, cutting off oxygen to her brain.But the police in Fayetteville, N.C., painted a different picture of what happened.Police officers responded on Dec. 2, 2015, to Cape Fear Valley Medical Center to a report of an unresponsive child. Members of the medical staff found bruises all over Macy\u2019s body and determined she had suffered life-threatening injuries consistent with child abuse, the police said.After further evaluation, it was determined that her injuries appeared to have been inflicted within 24 hours of her arrival at the medical center, the police said.Macy died just 10 days shy of her third birthday.Ms. Ditty and Mr. Keefer are each charged with first-degree murder and felony child abuse.\u201cIt\u2019s very hard for the family on all sides of the fence,\u201d said Bernard P. Condlin, the chief public defender in Cumberland County, N.C., who is representing Ms. Ditty.Charges were filed months after Macy died because the police were awaiting a report from the chief medical examiner, who ruled her death a homicide.\u201cRight now, we are still in kind of a fact-finding posture because we don\u2019t know what happened to the baby,\u201d Mr. Condlin said, adding that his office is awaiting a formal report on Macy\u2019s cause of death.He said Ms. Ditty was being held in the Cumberland County Detention Center on a high bond amount. He said Mr. Keefer had yet to be assigned a lawyer.Tina Goodwin, 46, of Enterprise, Ala., who is Macy\u2019s paternal grandmother, said the family had seen no hint of trouble.Ms. Goodwin\u2019s son is Kevin C. Ditty, Macy\u2019s father. He and Ms. Ditty were married in 2012. He is a sergeant in the United States Army who is now at Fort Bragg, N.C., but had served overseas for much of his daughter\u2019s life, Ms. Goodwin said.Ms. Ditty was enlisted in the Army from June 2011 through November 2012. She enlisted again in April 2015 and is on active duty with a status of \u201cconfined by civil authorities,\u201d according to an Army spokeswoman.Ms. Goodwin said she was walking in the door with her granddaughter\u2019s birthday gifts when her son called with the news that Macy was in the hospital on life support.\u201cThis is a 2-year-old baby that got the life beaten out of her for no reason at all,\u201d said Ms. Goodwin. \u201cWe\u2019ll know the how, the what, the when, but we\u2019ll never know the why.\u201dAs for the retouched photos that Ms. Ditty had done, Ms. Goodwin said of her daughter-in-law: \u201cShe was mocking that baby\u2019s death. She honestly thought she was getting away with that baby\u2019s death. She showed more attention to that baby in her death than when that baby was alive.\u201dFor Mr. Jo, the attention has put an unexpected harsh spotlight on his work.He said his \u201cOne More Time\u201d service, which he began about a year ago, accounts for up to 50 percent of his business. \u201cI haven\u2019t worked in five days,\u201d he said in a telephone interview last week.The idea for the service was born after his father died of lung cancer in 2012. Mr. Jo was at his father\u2019s grave and asked his brother to take a photograph of him after feeling his father\u2019s presence at the site.Mr. Jo later took the photo and photoshopped an image of his father standing behind him. For five months he did nothing with the photo but, he said, when he posted it to Facebook, it was met with an outpouring of interest.The mayor of New York ordered an investigation into his practices, and P.T. Barnum testified for the prosecution at his trial in 1869. Mr. Mumler was acquitted but also discredited after being suspected of manipulating photo plates.An earlier version of this article misstated which relative created the Facebook page Justiceformacy.

Have you ever been that driver?Given that road fatalities are rising in part from distracted driving, should it be punished like drunken driving? Why or why not?Over the last seven years, most states have banned texting by drivers, and public service campaigns have tried an array of tactics \u00e2\u0080\u0094 \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt can wait,\u00e2\u0080\u009d among them \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to persuade people to put down their phones when they are behind the wheel.Yet the problem, by just about any measure, appears to be getting worse. Americans confess in surveys that they are still texting while driving, as well as using Facebook and Snapchat and taking selfies. Road fatalities, which had fallen for years, are now rising sharply, up roughly 8 percent in 2015 over the previous year, according to preliminary estimates.That is partly because people are driving more, but Mark Rosekind, the chief of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said distracted driving was \u00e2\u0080\u009conly increasing, unfortunately.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cRadical change requires radical ideas,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said in a speech last month, referring broadly to the need to improve road safety. N.H.T.S.A. plans to release the final fatality numbers as early as Thursday.So to try to change a distinctly modern behavior, legislators and public health experts are reaching back to an old strategy: They want to treat distracted driving like drunken driving.\u2026 The most provocative idea, from lawmakers in New York, is to give police officers a new device that is the digital equivalent of the Breathalyzer \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a roadside test called the Textalyzer.It would work like this: An officer arriving at the scene of a crash could ask for the phones of any drivers involved and use the Textalyzer to tap into the operating system to check for recent activity.The technology could determine whether a driver used the phone to text, email or do anything else that is prohibited by New York\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hands-free driving laws, which only allow talking on a phone while using a headset. Failure to hand over a phone could lead to the suspension of a driver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s license, similar to the consequences for refusing a Breathalyzer.\u00e2\u0080\u0094 How aware are you of campaigns that discourage distracted driving? Have you ever been in a car with a driver who texted or was on social media? Have you ever been that driver? \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Do you think distracted driving is \u201cstill socially acceptable,\u201d as one person quoted in this article contends? Do you think it is as dangerous as drunken driving and should be punished to the same degree? \u00e2\u0080\u0094 What do you think of ideas like the Textalyzer? Will they work? \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Do you think developing distracted-driving campaigns backed by major television networks and promoted by presidents, sports leagues and corporations will have a bigger effect on people\u2019s behavior than punitive laws?

In workshops, he asks the kind of big-picture questions that politicians, intellectuals and billionaires like to answer.Orville Schell, a China scholar at the Asia Society in New York and an adviser to the Berggruen Institute, said that Mr. Berggruen gained access to Chinese leaders because he focused on philosophy and culture, not politics and human rights, and noted that his approach was \u201castute.\u201dIt also helped that Mr. Berggruen did not appear to have a business agenda. \u201cIn some ways he is a thinking man\u2019s Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Schell said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want anything from anybody, except to be of consequence.\u201dWhile Mr. Berggruen has arrived, even in his early days he wasn\u2019t exactly an arriviste. His father, Heinz Berggruen, was an art dealer who fled the Nazis in 1936, romanced Frida Kahlo in New York and befriended Picasso in Paris.The younger Mr. Berggruen attended Le Rosey, an exclusive Swiss boarding school, and studied finance at New York University, but he says he began investing as a teenager, borrowing a few thousand pounds from a friend to buy stocks. Forbes estimates his fortune to be about $1.5 billion. Last year, Town & Country magazine named him one of the world\u2019s 50 most eligible bachelors.And last month, he became a bachelor father. Or, as he put it when asked who the mother is: \u201cMe. I am the mother and the father.\u201d Mr. Berggruen has two newborns, a boy and a girl, born three weeks apart to different surrogates and conceived using eggs from two donors.Single fatherhood has now tethered him to Los Angeles, he said, but not too tightly: He bought the apartment one floor down for the children and their nannies.Since 2015, his institute has been funded by his Bermuda-registered charitable trust. He says it has a $1 billion endowment. Foreign status means that Mr. Berggruen forfeits United States tax breaks but can give away money as he chooses. Bermuda has almost none of the restrictions or disclosure rules that bind American nonprofits.In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, Mr. Berggruen said, he began to question his life\u2019s purpose. That led him, in 2010, to hire professors from the University of California, Los Angeles, to tutor him in philosophy.Brian Walker, a political science professor and expert in Chinese philosophy, was one of those. Professor Walker would discuss Plato and Confucius with Mr. Berggruen over lunch in his suite at the Peninsula Hotel. \u201cIt was sort of a surreal setting, but he always did the reading and asked good questions,\u201d Mr. Walker said. \u201cI found him a little mysterious. He didn\u2019t invite personal confidences.\u201dMr. Berggruen is courteous and even courtly: In restaurants, he stands when his date leaves the table. But he isn\u2019t a schmoozer. His Stanford conference ran from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. with little time for small talk.At the philosophy dinner, he asked that his guests discuss harmony and freedom in the East and West. He was playful, but only on topic. \u201cI am going to say something that will make all of you want to kill me,\u201d he said, bringing conversation and forks to a halt. \u201cThe West is absolutist, India is pluralist, and China is \u2014 and I don\u2019t mean this in a negative way \u2014 conformist.\u201dMr. Berggruen spoke proudly of the work his Think Long Committee did to address California\u2019s deficit, including supporting Proposition 31, which among other things would have barred lawmakers from creating expenditures over $25 million without finding the money for them. Mr. Berggruen spent more than $1 million to get the proposition on the ballot. The initiative was voted down in 2012.In 2010, Mr. Berggruen took the Giving Pledge \u2014 which has become a kind of social register for big-time philanthropists \u2014 joining billionaires who have promised to give away more than half of their fortunes. But he is not a spendthrift. He is a trustee of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and tax records show that in 2014 he gave the museum $100,000, the minimum annual gift required; many give double that amount, or more, according to two trustees. That year, Mr. Berggruen gave U.C.L.A. $4,750.Mr. Berggruen says he wants to nurture innovative thinking, not just donate to causes. His institute, he said, is \u201cnot just a money-giving operation; it\u2019s an ideas and energy-producing operation.\u201dSeveral scholars say that Mr. Berggruen\u2019s interdisciplinary approach to philosophy is refreshing in an academic world that can be siloed. Kwame Anthony Appiah, a philosopher at New York University, said he attended a Berggruen event because it gave him a chance to talk to experts about Confucianism, which is not his primary field of study.\u201cI can\u2019t say whether it\u2019s the best use of his money,\u201d Professor Appiah said. \u201cI can only consider whether he is making the world better or worse, and in this case I would have to say, better.\u201dAn article last Sunday about the Berggruen Institute, the think tank operated by the billionaire investor Nicolas Berggruen, misstated, using information from the institute, the number of scholars it is currently funding. There are six scholars, not five.Advertisement"}

Trump on Tuesday night seemed \u00e2\u0080\u0094 dare we say it \u00e2\u0080\u0094 almost presidential, or at least a bit more refined. He referred to his chief rival, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, as \u201csenator\u201d rather than the crude nickname he has favored, and offered a brief, even restrained, primary night toast from the lobby of Trump Towers.By Wednesday, however, Mr. Trump was back to his more familiar self.He opened an afternoon speech in Indianapolis by dinging Mr. Cruz as \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d (and re-upped his efforts to brand Hillary Clinton as \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d), shouting to remove protesters from the rally and repeatedly returned to one of his favorite topics \u00e2\u0080\u0094 trashing the news media.  \u201cI love running against Crooked Hillary, I love that \u2014 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so much fun,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding, \u201cI call her Crooked Hillary.\u201d    Mr. Trump, who was interrupted several times by protesters, ordered them out with his trademark \u00c3\u00a9lan. \u201cGet him out of here, get him out,\u201d Mr. Trump said, as a man was removed. \u201cGet! Him! Out! Of! Here!\u201d (Though, in a nod to decorum, or perhaps his general election calculations, the New York real estate magnate was careful to warn his supporters not to hurt the protesters).He also broached a contentious topic he has discussed previously \u00e2\u0080\u0094 his support for waterboarding, an enhanced interrogated technique banned under President Obama. Referring to an earlier debate, in which he supported the practice, Mr. Trump said: \u201cI love it, I love it.\u201d \u201cAnd I said, \u2018The only thing is, we should make it much tougher than waterboarding,'\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it works folks, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re wrong.

We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to have to make ourselves tougher.\u201d In his nearly hour-long remarks, Mr. Trump returned time and again to another favored target, calling the press corps \u201cthe worst,\u201d \u201cvery dishonest people\u201d and \u201cterrible.\u201d \u201cDo we like the media?\u201d he asked the crowd.\u201cNo!\u201d came the roared reply.\u201cDo we hate the media?\u201d Mr. Trump continued.\u201cYes!\u201d his crowd shouted.But then, seeming to struggle with his more refined message \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a deliberate effort by Mr. Trump and his newly expanded campaign team to prepare him for the rigors of a general election \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Mr. Trump paused and turned, briefly, reflective.\u201cNo, I don\u2019t hate anybody,\u201d he said. \u201cI love the media, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re wonderful.

{"Headline": "Education Overhaul Advocates Express Concern About Bill Clinton\u2019s Remarks on Testing", "Date": "2016-04-08", "News": "Officials involved with what has become known as the education reform movement expressed concern over a statement this week by former President Bill Clinton about his wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s view of mandatory testing.He said that it was not that his wife believed that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be tests\u00e2\u0080\u009d or that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be measures.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBut he added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe idea of having to give a national test every year for five years in a row for people from the third to the eighth grade doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make as much sense as investing the same amount of money in helping the teachers to be better teachers. That would make more difference.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe Politico story was tweeted by leaders with the American Federation of Teachers, a group that has endorsed Mrs. Clinton. Those involved in the education reform movement have grown increasingly alarmed with Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relationship with the teachers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 unions.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u2019re going to reach out to her senior campaign leadership,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Jeffries said in an interview. Teachers unions have long been skeptical, if not outright opposed, to annual testing, especially as those tests have been used in many states to grade the teachers themselves, which they say unfairly punishes teachers for circumstances, like student poverty, outside their control. Education reform advocates contend that annual testing is necessary to gauge which students \u2014 and teachers \u2014 need the most help.An aide to Mr. Clinton said that he was not suggesting that his wife believes that testing should be altogether tossed, but merely that a balance needs to be struck.Mrs. Clinton, as a senator from New York, voted for the No Child Left Behind Act, a signature education measure under President George W. Bush that required states to administer math and reading tests to students in grades three through eight.In her primary against Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mrs. Clinton has sought support from major unions, and she has a long friendship with the A.F.T. president, Randi Weingarten. But Democrats involved in the education overhaul movement have generally favored the approach of President  Obama, whose administration has generally supported testing, leaving Mrs. Clinton to walk a sometimes-difficult line. \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "E.U. Charges Dispute Google\u2019s Claims That Android Is Open to All", "Date": "2016-04-20", "News": "Supported byGoogle has long stressed that Android, its popular mobile software, is open for anyone to use, including its rivals.Margrethe Vestager, the European Union\u2019s antitrust chief, said Google had required some of the cellphone manufacturers to preinstall the company\u2019s services, including its Google Play smartphone application store, and had given them unfair financial incentives to favor Google\u2019s services on their mobile devices. Those practices undermined competition and consumer choice, she said.\u201cGoogle has abused its dominant position,\u201d Ms. Vestager said on Wednesday. The company\u2019s \u201cbehavior has harmed consumers by restricting innovation in the wider mobile space.\u201dThe company denies it has broken European competition rules, and the charges may not lead to financial or other penalties against Google, which now has three months to respond to the accusations.By taking aim at Android \u2014 the mobile software that holds more than 80 percent of the worldwide market share for smartphone operating systems \u2014 Europe has opened the latest chapter in its continuing battle with American technology companies.Europe\u2019s antitrust claims highlight Google\u2019s increasingly thorny relationships with smartphone manufacturers such as HTC and Samsung, among others. Ms. Vestager said Android\u2019s prominent role in the mobile market was not in question but that she was concerned the contracts the company signed with smartphone manufacturers had made it difficult, if not impossible, for rival search engines and smartphone app stores to compete in the European Union.\u201cIf a company is dominant, that\u2019s fine,\u201d Ms. Vestager told reporters. \u201cBut if that dominance is abused, then we have an issue.\u201d She declined to name which cellphone manufacturers might be affected, citing their right to privacy.The device makers, already struggling against cutthroat competition, have become reliant on Google\u2019s digital services available on Android, even as they have tried to persuade consumers to try their own mobile services or those of Google\u2019s competitors. Some, including Samsung, have backed rival operating systems to loosen Android\u2019s grip, but such efforts have so far proved unsuccessful.And while global cellphone manufacturers once profited from using Android to expand rapidly, particularly in emerging markets, their growth has since slowed.Analysts say these cellphone makers\u2019 inability to wean consumers off Google\u2019s popular mobile mapping, email and other services has potentially shut them out of billions of dollars in extra revenue as people\u2019s digital habits \u2014 including online search and e-commerce purchases \u2014 shift to mobile devices.\u201cTheir attempts at beating Google\u2019s services haven\u2019t worked,\u201d said Neil Mawston, a mobile analyst at the technology research group Strategy Analytics. \u201cFor most companies that want to operate in the smartphone market, there isn\u2019t another option but to use Google.\u201dRepresentatives from the leading smartphone manufacturers declined to comment on their relationship with Google.The dominance of Android, at least in Europe and the United States, is almost absolute.The basic Android software can be downloaded for free and modified by device makers and telecom operators.In total, Google\u2019s version of Android powers more than 98 percent of the Android-based smartphones in Europe and the United States, according to Ian Fogg, a senior director at IHS, a technology consultancy in London.Only in China, where Google is banned, and Russia, where the local search engine Yandex holds a significant market share, does Google not dominate in mobile.\u201cIf someone buys an Android device in Europe or the U.S., it\u2019s almost certainly Google\u2019s version,\u201d said David McQueen, research director at ABI Research in London.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.If Google is found to have broken European rules, the company may face fines of as much as 10 percent of its annual revenue. Given the company\u2019s recent annual revenue, that could be roughly $7 billion. Such a high financial penalty is unlikely, however, according to legal experts.The company could also be forced to alter its Android software to give competitors a greater position in its mobile software or to change its existing contracts with cellphone makers.That would potentially provide Europeans with a wider choice of mobile services than would be available to their American counterparts. Most people in the 28 member states of the European Union, though, still rely primarily on Google services for many daily activities.Paulo Trezentos, chief executive of Aptoide, a rival Portuguese Android app store that is one of the complainants in the European competition case against Google, said his company would welcome greater access to Android users.\u201cGoogle makes it difficult for people to install applications from rivals,\u201d Mr. Trezentos said. \u201cIt\u2019s actively making it harder to compete.\u201dIn the United States, some lawmakers on Wednesday called on the Federal Trade Commission to more closely scrutinize Google after Europe\u2019s charges. In 2013, the F.T.C. closed a two-year antitrust investigation into Google\u2019s search business, citing a lack of evidence for pursuing a case. The F.T.C. said it did not comment on or confirm investigations.Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, who is a member of the Judiciary Committee, said regulations and laws differed in Europe and the United States but \u201cthe spirit and goal of our laws is very similar.\u201d\u201cThere is now clearly a need for exacting and penetrating scrutiny,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal said in an interview. \u201cPerhaps it is overdue. But it is now clearly necessary.\u201dAn article on Thursday about European Union antitrust charges against Google misstated the process though which Google receives revenue related to its Android operating system. Google earns revenue from, among other sources, advertising generated from services like mobile search that are included in the software. It does not receive fees from device makers.Cecilia Kang and Farhad Manjoo contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

For the 2016 game, though, the brand wanted to reach more younger people, who tend to watch less TV.The company turned to Snapchat, the mobile photo messaging app popular with teens and millennials. Aiming to \u201cdemocratize the dunk,\u201d according to Kenny Mitchell, senior director of consumer engagement, Gatorade created a \u201csponsored lens\u201d ad that allowed people to overlay an animated dunk of the drink onto their selfies. They did so 165 million times in just two days.But should brands insert themselves into one of the most personal activities online? Many apps, such as games, allow advertising, but who wants ads from Pampers cluttering their most intimate chats with friends?Marketers are wary, too.\u201cIf we misstep with certain audiences, they\u2019ll unplug,\u201d said Suzy Deering, chief marketing officer at eBay.That doesn\u2019t mean brands are completely unwelcome on messaging apps. But it does mean that so far on these services, they are remarkably restrained in their approaches, focusing less on promotion and more on providing entertainment or utility \u2014 or both. In some cases, the marketing isn\u2019t even in the form of paid ads.On WhatsApp, for instance, the shoe brand Clarks avoided an overt sales pitch, and instead created three virtual characters to promote its venerable Desert Boot, allowing users to connect to them on the app to receive messages, videos and music playlists.Focus Features, a film division of NBCUniversal, used a chatbot created by Massively, an interactive marketing technology start-up, to promote its 2015 movie \u201cInsidious: Chapter 3.\u201d People could converse on the Kik chat app with a bot version of a main character in the film, Quinn Brenner. A sample snippet of a chat:Quinn: Do you believe in life after death?Me: Not really.Quinn: A little while ago I might have agreed with you\u2026 but lately\u2026This might sound crazy\u2026 but I tried to contact my mom on the other side.Me: Did it work?Quinn: It was like I could still feel her, you know? I thought if I just reached out, maybe I could speak with her. ...Over a period of a few days, the Quinn-bot sent increasingly intense messages about being haunted and threatened. Some 350,000 people exchanged an average of 69 messages. Kik, which has done 80 of these \u201cpromoted chat\u201d campaigns, on Tuesday plans to open a \u201cbot shop\u201d for consumers to try out more of them.\u201cBots are a creative canvas just starting to be realized,\u201d said Josh Jacobs, president of Kik Services, a company unit exploring messaging-related services like banking and shopping.In fact, these kinds of interactions might not be advertising at all. Several marketers say they are talking to Facebook about connecting clients to users of its Messenger app for personalized customer relations, such as answering questions or making appointments.\u201cAn interaction in messaging may look very different from other marketing,\u201d Matthew Idema, Facebook\u2019s vice president of monetization product marketing, said in an interview.In reality, nearly all the marketing in these apps remains experimental. Because the apps vary in their user appeal and acceptance of ads, companies often have to create different campaigns for each app, a costly and time-consuming process. And they lack the tools to track results as well as they can with other forms of advertising.Besides, said Kira Wampler, chief marketing officer at the ride-hailing service Lyft, \u201cWe have a lot on our plate with our other marketing channels.\u201dBut perhaps not for long. \u201cMessaging is a more human and conversational way to interact, much more powerful than throwing out a bunch of media dollars,\u201d said David Hewitt, a vice president for mobile strategy at the agency SapientNitro.An article on Monday about a Gatorade advertising campaign on Snapchat described incorrectly a function of the Gatorade \u201csponsored lens.\u201d It can overlay an animation of a bucket of Gatorade being dumped on a Snapchat user\u2019s photos or video clips. It cannot do the same on photos or video clips of the user\u2019s friends.Advertisement"}

Do you like knowing about \u2014 and seeing photographs of \u2014 the children of the famous? Is it fair to the children?\nIf I had a friend who told me he was starting a business named after his young child, I might find it cute, perhaps even touching. If he were using his son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s or daughter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s likeness as the logo (\u00c3\u00a0 la the Wendy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s franchise), I could understand how that might be fine, though I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d wonder how his offspring might react later to seeing his cartoon image plastered ubiquitously.But if he also cast his child in commercials, and that was on top of a web campaign in which the little boy or girl was otherwise a prominent fixture, and if my friend already inhaled the rarefied air of the ultrarich and I suspected the deployment of the adorable tyke was a strategic showcase for his own relatability as a normal parent and a measure to downplay the crass commercialism of the enterprise \u00e2\u0080\u0094 well, then I might be concerned.And yet many parents on social media are doing much the same thing, albeit in less conspicuous fashion, and usually with a goal of praise, not profits.We, too, are using our children on the Internet to burnish our personal brands, from the C.E.O. who wants to let everyone know she still takes the time to attend her child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s piano recital to the stay-at-home caregiver wanting recognition for his exhausting work.\u2026 Less pettily, there are serious questions to be asked here about privacy and consent. For most children raised in analog eras, embarrassing Polaroids and stories were small-scale mortifications at worst. But now the possibility of mass exposure looms, and while most conscientious parents know better than to circulate, say, a photo of a child bathing, they do distribute other data that the young subject may someday wish had been kept confidential.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard enough to get through puberty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Amy Webb wrote, in a widely read 2013 essay on Slate, about a friend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unfettered Facebook pictures of her 5-year-old daughter. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy make hundreds of embarrassing, searchable photos freely available to her prospective homecoming dates?\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe 5-year-old clearly cannot approve with full understanding the uploading of these images, just as the only way Blue Ivy can refuse to endorse her mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s marketing campaign is by throwing a temper tantrum. We have strict child labor laws, and I am certain that any applicable ones were upheld during Blue Ivy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cameo.

{"Headline": "Fashion's Love Affair With Film", "Date": "2016-04-05", "News": "Supported byA virtual Karlie Kloss walks through your living room in something from the latest Givenchy collection: She takes a turn and you take a closer look at the cut of the dress, the way it falls and moves across the body. You decide you like it, you want it, and you buy it \u2014 just like that. It arrives three days later.Could this be the next step in fashion\u2019s relationship with visual imagery?The website conducted a global search for new stars last October (the director Maxim Bashkaev won the 10,000 pounds, or $14,000, prize money, which is to be used to make a film for SHOWstudio with Mr. Knight\u2019s mentoring). It also has plans for a three-day fashion film festival at the end of the year. Move over, street style.\u201cThe Internet is probably our primary source of fashion, and I think it\u2019s the best way of showing it \u2014 the fashion currency of the Internet will be fashion film,\u201d Mr. Knight said.\u201cI see fashion film very much as an extension of fashion photography \u2014 you look at a fashion photograph and go \u2018Aahh, I want to have that piece of clothing\u2019 \u2014 that was the basic premise of the photograph,\u201d he continued, adding that the same desire has to come from moving fashion images.\u201cNow we\u2019re working in 3-D, and we weren\u2019t before. It\u2019s a different dimension and space, and we\u2019re looking at a very different way of looking at imagery.\u201dFor example, do you own your digital image? \u201cNo one has got in there yet but they really should do,\u201d said Mr. Knight, who has been making 3-D scans of his models for years and used the technique for his \u201cBlack Skinhead\u201d film with Kanye West. \u201cI have data on all of these girls and it\u2019s not long before you say, \u2018Here\u2019s a 3-D version of Karlie Kloss.\u201d\u2019As computer-generated imaging and green screen already are used in filmmaking, he added, it won\u2019t be long before they make the transition into fashion. \u201cIt\u2019s all very technically possible \u2014 just about tying up the loose ends.\u201dWhile the reason for the intersection of fashion and the screen hasn\u2019t changed \u2014 it still is intended to sell clothes and accessories \u2014 now those images come to us through Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat, Vimeo, Vine, Twitter, Facebook, Periscope and animated gifs, the channels now used by everyone from the designer to the retailer.In 2014 Black Frame opened a division, Framework, to cater especially to the increased demand for film. \u201cOn a global level across cultures, people connect with music and movies,\u201d said Mr. Phillips. \u201cVideo is the most compelling and interesting form of communication.\u201dMr. Knight noted that every job he does now includes a request for film, sometimes with more emphasis than the photograph itself. Why?\u201cEverything comes alive with film: the mood, the emotion, the storytelling,\u201d said Anne-Marie Verdin, the Mulberry brand director. \u201cFilm is the new way we absorb content, especially in a digital, mobile world. It captures attention and adds visual depth.\u201dLorna Tucker, a filmmaker who works regularly with Vivienne Westwood, noted, \u201cYou\u2019re more likely to pore over a film than you are a campaign still\u201d \u2014 so job done, it resonates.Most recently, he collaborated with the London department store Selfridges for a display that featured a dress and, alongside, a monitor playing a film of the garment being made that had been captured on Periscope, an online video channel. The video added another layer of attraction and interest to the display and, as Mr. Pugh noted, \u201cIt\u2019s about broadening the experience of the consumer and involving them in the process.\u201dBut fashion film, or fashion and the screen, is still very much a genre in its infancy \u2014 only about 20 years old, a short time in contrast with the lengthy careers of fashion illustration and, in turn, photography. \u201cIt always surprises me that fashion film took such a long time to take off, but that\u2019s only because the Internet wasn\u2019t around,\u201d Ms. Hogben said.Christopher Bailey, the brand\u2019s chief creative and chief executive officer, said it has been proud to partner with the British Academy of Film and Television on the Breakthrough Brits program. \u201cThe partnership identifies emerging talent and introduces them to mentors from across the industry who help them build their experience and guide their career,\u201d he said in an email.Most recently Burberry teamed with the director Steve McQueen, who is making his advertising debut with the new Mr. Burberry fragrance.While fashion video\u2019s popularity is soaring now, it didn\u2019t go down as well in the beginning. \u201cPeople got bored very quickly of a woman leaping around a corn field,\u201d noted Kathryn Ferguson, filmmaker and former curator of the Birds Eye View Film Festival\u2019s \u201cFashion Loves Film\u201d initiative. \u201cPeople have really had to think about the craft of filmmaking.\u201dNow we \u201cshare\u201d and we \u201clike,\u201d and fashion and film seem to work in tandem. \u201cEmotionally, we are transferring ourselves onto the Internet,\u201d Mr. Knight said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Utah\u2019s War on Pornography Finds Skeptics", "Date": "2016-04-21", "News": "Supported byThe governor of Utah signed two pieces of legislation in recent weeks in an effort to portray pornography as a public health crisis akin to alcohol and tobacco.Opponents of pornography in the state appeared ready to take the fight to businesses and public spaces.On Tuesday, State Senator Todd Weiler, a Republican who is a chief sponsor of the legislation, said public libraries and fast food restaurants that offer free Internet were part of the problem. He also issued a plea to the adult entertainment industry: \u201cHelp us protect our children from your evil, degrading, addictive, harmful substances.\u201dThe nonbinding measure, S.C.R. 9, attributes a wide range of social ills to what it called \u201cthe pornography epidemic,\u201d including objectification of and violence against women, the \u201chypersexualization\u201d of teens and children and the development of \u201cemotional and medical illnesses\u201d and \u201cdeviant sexual arousal\u201d in those who view it.Erick Janssen, a researcher at The Kinsey Institute at Indiana University and a professor of neuroscience at the University of Leuven in Belgium, said the concerns about pornography expressed in the Utah measures \u201chave always been there.\u201d\u201cIf porn was really that bad, and if you\u2019d look at the number of people viewing it, there would be rapes at every street corner,\u201d he said in an email. He added that debates over the issue \u201ctend to rely more on attitudes than science.\u201dMany of the studies used to support claims about the harmful effects of pornography were done in the 1980s, when it was not as widespread, according to Ana J. Bridges, a professor of psychology at the University of Arkansas. She said the studies should be viewed with a degree of skepticism because they gauged correlation, not causation. More recent studies have not been conclusive.\u201cA lot of the claims in the Utah bill, especially those that center around the notion of addiction like a drug or around erectile dysfunction or brain stuff \u2014 the research is entirely too nascent to be able to make those claims at this point,\u201d she said. \u201cAt this point the science is a question mark.\u201d\u201cYou have a void, you refuse to fill that void with proper sex education and then you provide hours and hours of screen time,\u201d she said, referring to online pornography. \u201cSo the cocktail is one that might actually be a public health crisis, but it is one of our own making in many ways.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But she also found herself stirred by the spirit of the event.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t about looking good or weight loss or fitting into a certain type of clothing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she recalled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Hey, you fat person, you need to do this or you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to die.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 It was, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I love you and I want you to love yourself enough to invest in 30 minutes a day, to walk yourself to freedom like Harriet Tubman did.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And that spoke deeply for me because my life work is showing up for other people, but I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t showing up for myself.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThames completed the 100-minute walk that day. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy body was in pain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she recalled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut it felt good to be out there with other women. It was really encouraging because it was something I could do. So I committed to walking every day.\u00e2\u0080\u009dShe kept that promise. Over the past three years, she has lost more than 230 pounds. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI gained mental clarity and the resolve to take care of myself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.In the Forest Hill section of Jackson, Miss., for example, 15 to 20 women meet every weekday at 4:30 a.m. for a brisk walk. They call their team \u00e2\u0080\u009cFour Dark Thirty\u00e2\u0080\u009d (they meet before sunrise).\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a chore, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not exercise, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just going for a walk, and having a moment to reflect,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Cynthia Thompson, an assistant director at Greater Bethlehem Temple Church, who is a volunteer city captain for GirlTrek in Jackson. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSome people in my church never had an in-depth conversation with each other until we started walking. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s amazing the conversations that come up when you walk.\u00e2\u0080\u009dEach week, thousands of trekkers participate in \u00e2\u0080\u009cSuperhero Saturday\u00e2\u0080\u009d walks. Groups of black women in bright blue T-shirts walking together have become regular features in hundreds of neighborhoods and parks.Bennett was so impressed that he joined GirlTrek\u00e2\u0080\u0099s board, as did Dr. Regina Benjamin, a former United States surgeon general. Together, they lead a committee focused on research and evaluation of GirlTrek\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impact on health.GirlTrek grew out of the experiences of its two founders, Vanessa Garrison and Morgan Dixon, friends from college days, and began as a simple act of self-care and love. Garrison grew up in Seattle. When she was 5, her mother started using heroin; she was an addict for 15 years and spent eight years in prison. Garrison was reared by her grandmother and aunt and recalls a lot of emotional pain in the household.\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo much was happening negatively for the women who raised me: depression, despair, sadness and loneliness,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI felt a lot of guilt, but I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t able to give back to them in any substantial way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She began walking as \u00e2\u0080\u009ca very personal way of how you can heal from childhood traumas.\u00e2\u0080\u009dDixon grew up in Sacramento. Her parents came from Oklahoma. Her grandparents had been sharecroppers; one of her grandmothers had 11 children while the other had nine. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy maternal grandmother gave birth to one of her kids on an abandoned school bus,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy mother desegregated her high school in 1958. She experienced lots of trauma and she still wears that.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAfter college, the two began successful careers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe had good jobs and husbands, but it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel good because so many of the women we knew weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t living the life we were living,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dixon recalled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe thought, \u00e2\u0080\u0098How do we start helping the women we know come along on this journey with us?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And being overweight was the outward manifestation of what we knew to be deeper themes.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn 2010, they got the idea for a 10-week walking challenge. They emailed 200 black women and asked them to forward the message. Six hundred responses came back from across the country. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt the end of 10 weeks, we weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t prepared for what happened,\u00e2\u0080\u009d recalled Garrison. Stories flooded in. People said they were amazed they had been able to stick with it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe heard: \u00e2\u0080\u0098This is changing my life. When are we going to do it again?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009dThey began to wonder: Was there a need for a health movement for black women, led by black women, grounded in their values and culture? They mined inspiration from black history, the poetry of Nikki Giovanni and Sonia Sanchez, hip-hop and gospel music. They created a Facebook page as a platform for sharing stories. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen we first Googled \u00e2\u0080\u0098healthy black women and girls,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 porno images came up,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dixon recalled. They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t any longer. Within two years, they had 100,000 followers and 12,000 trekkers who were reporting their walks every week and regularly posting pledges, testimonies and photos.Read previous contributions to this series.One problem is that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to inspire behavior by focusing on long-term goals. Behavioral scientists say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more effective to highlight near-term benefits embedded in an activity itself.That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what GirlTrek\u2019s members do. They emphasize the rewards of taking time for yourself, getting outside and connecting with others in a nonjudgmental and noncompetitive environment. They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t talk about hypertension or body mass index, but about feeling less anxious and having more energy. They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t talk about looking good, but about looking alive: having the \u00e2\u0080\u009cGirlTrek glow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They inspire women with images of courage and dignity. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey have lots of process motivators around black history \u00e2\u0080\u0094 walking as Harriet Tubman did or retracing the steps at Selma \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and they rapidly recycle them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bennett.They acknowledge the struggles and inequities that women face. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe mental act of saying every day, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to set aside time to do something that is healthy for myself even though I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m overwhelmed because I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pay my bills, my neighborhood is riddled with crime, and there are no sidewalks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that in itself is an act of resistance,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Garrison.One million is an audacious goal, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be following up to see how it goes. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s striking to consider how much change GirlTrek has already put in motion \u00e2\u0080\u0094 especially given that it has a full-time staff of six and a budget of $725,000. \u00e2\u0080\u009cInnovation doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t require a lot of money,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Garrison. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt requires a lot of passion. And we have that.\u00e2\u0080\u009dFor Thames, her weight loss has been just the beginning. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can lose the physical weight and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still carrying around the mental stuff,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are moments when I see a booth in a restaurant and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m still nervous if I can fit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m doing work on defining myself and my relationships with others,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis body renders me vulnerable in a way that I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t consider before. When you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in a \u00e2\u0080\u0098normal\u00e2\u0080\u0099 size body, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all this sexuality and fashion and consumerism that gets put on it. There are a lot of layers of perfectionism that get added to this body that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m in now.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAnd there are new pleasures. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI went out to Colorado with GirlTrek and we hiked up a mountain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBeing able to do that was overwhelming.

{"Headline": "Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton Spar Over Presidential Qualifications", "Date": "2016-04-07", "News": "At a rally in Philadelphia, a newly invigorated Bernie Sanders took up Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s challenge about who is qualified to be president.After weeks of subtle sniping, the frustration first boiled over at a rally in Philadelphia on Wednesday night when Mr. Sanders took issue with recent criticism over his understanding of financial regulation policy and assailed Mrs. Clinton from multiple angles. And he intensified the attacks Thursday, saying of Mrs. Clinton, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople might wonder about your qualifications when you supported virtually every trade agreement, trade agreements which have cost the American worker millions of decent paying jobs.\u201dAt the Philadelphia rally Wednesday night, he first raised the issue of Mrs. Clinton not being qualified to lead the country, citing donations to the \u201csuper PAC\u201d supporting her.\u201cShe has been saying lately that she thinks that I am, quote-un-quote, not qualified to be president,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cLet me just say in response to Secretary Clinton, I don\u2019t believe that she is qualified if she is, through her super PAC, taking tens of millions of dollars in special interest funds.\u201dHe added: \u201cI don\u2019t think you are qualified if you have voted for the disastrous war in Iraq. I don\u2019t think you are qualified if you supported the Panama free trade agreement.\u201dAt an event in Philadelphia, Hillary Clinton questioned the rhetoric of her Democratic rival, Bernie Sanders, asserting that he \u00e2\u0080\u009cdoesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a plan at all\u00e2\u0080\u009d in a number of areas.The Clinton campaign pushed back against Mr. Sanders\u2019s attack on her qualifications, calling it the mark of a desperate candidate. Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, called on the Vermont senator to take back his words and said he had reached a \u201cnew low.\u201dFacing long odds, Sanders is inventing grievances & nonexistent paths to the nomination to rile his supporters & keep fundraising spigot onProminent surrogates for Mrs. Clinton such as Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York and Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri vouched for her qualifications and warned that Mr. Sanders was crossing the line.\u201cCalling Hillary Clinton not qualified is like fingernails on a black board to many women across this country, and I think Bernie probably knows that,\u201d Ms. McCaskill told MSNBC on Thursday.Jeff Weaver, Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign manager, defended the more pointed approach, noting that Mr. Sanders, who grew up in Brooklyn, was ready for a New York-style \u201crough and tumble\u201d campaign if that was what Mrs. Clinton wanted. However, Mr. Weaver warned that Mrs. Clinton risked alienating Mr. Sanders\u2019s supporters and creating a fissure within the Democratic Party if she treated the senator unfairly.\u201cTo sort of gratuitously attack Bernie Sanders, I think, is a very dangerous move for the Clinton campaign,\u201d Mr. Weaver said in a separate interview on MSNBC.Mr. Sanders showed no sign of backing down at a news conference in Philadelphia on Thursday morning. While saying that he does respect Mrs. Clinton, he continued to express doubts about her qualifications and made clear that he does not intend to hold back.\u201cIf Secretary Clinton thinks that I just come from a small state of Vermont, \u00e2\u0080\u0098They are not used to this.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Well, we will get used to it fast,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to get beaten up. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to get lied about.

Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rough week was followed by a rough weekend, as he suffered potentially consequential losses at party events related to precious convention delegates in two states. Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s poor showing at Republican conclaves in Tennessee, a state he won, and in North Dakota in terms of accruing support emphasized a reality that he has not been able to surmount: an organization that cannot keep up with his poll numbers, speeches and support among voters. Nominations are not won by words alone, and Mr. Trump is learning that the hard way. He says his delegates are being \u00e2\u0080\u009cstolen\u00e2\u0080\u009d in places like Tennessee and Louisiana, despite the fact that his  campaign has not engaged in the type of brinkmanship and parliamentary tactics needed to win. Mr. Trump recently hired a veteran delegate wrangler, Paul J. Manafort, but Mr. Manafort\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tenure is only beginning. In the meantime, North Dakota\u00e2\u0080\u0099s delegates, who are not bound to any candidate, so far have little reason to bend toward Mr. Trump. On the Democratic side, there were debates about debates, conflicts over how many donations from the fossil-fuel industry constitutes \u00e2\u0080\u009ca lot\u00e2\u0080\u009d and a county-by-county delegate slog in Nevada in which Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont fared well over Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary. Each side has accused the other of negotiating in bad faith for a New York debate, for which a range of dates and venues has been proposed. Then there was the battle over donations to Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign from people involved in the coal, oil and gas industries, which Mr. Sanders has denounced. Mrs. Clinton has said her rival is overstating those donations, a point she made with frustration when asked on a rope line at a campaign stop. And there was the more consequential battle at the Clark County Democratic convention in Nevada. Mrs. Clinton won Clark County, the largest county in Nevada, during the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s caucuses. But Mr. Sanders had more supporters at the county convention, meaning he could have a bigger presence from the county at the state Democratic convention in May. Mrs. Clinton maintains a wide lead in delegates, but Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s backers will point to such skirmishes as evidence of why he should fight on.  That same logic is held by Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio, who, Mr. Trump said on Sunday, should drop out of the race.Soon after Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wins in New Hampshire and South Carolina, some of his top advisers assured him that the fight would be over shortly. That was weeks ago. Around that time, some in Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s circle urged him to bring in a more-seasoned group of top operatives. If Mr. Trump loses Wisconsin to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, as polls suggest he is on track to do, he is likely to reassess just how his campaign has served him in a variety of contests in which he was in contention, but lost.  Speaking in Green Bay, Wis., on Sunday, the Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz promised to drive down student loan debt and protect religious liberty.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "He Disavowed Radical Islam. Was He Lying?", "Date": "2016-04-26", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 Ten young Muslim men, bored by a mundane life in France and haunted by a \u201cfeeling of uselessness,\u201d as one put it, were seduced by a leading Islamic State recruiter in Europe in 2013. Within months, they were in Syria under the watchful eyes of hooded, Kalashnikov-wielding militants, doing push-ups, fiddling with weapons and imbibing the ideology.But the harsh regimen, most have since told investigators, was not to their liking, and it was not long before they hastened back to their families in the Strasbourg area, where they were almost immediately picked up by the French authorities.What to do with hundreds, perhaps thousands, of such young men in Europe is now among the biggest challenges facing governments and security services.At the heart of the debate is whether to take pre-emptive legal action against people who have not committed terrorist acts or even been implicated in a plot, but who have simply been to Syria and possibly received training in Islamic State camps.Several urgent factors have propelled the debate: the steeper risks of terrorist attacks, the fact that monitoring the sheer numbers who have returned is overwhelming security services, and the difficulty of building cases against suspects who may have been trained and indoctrinated in distant lands.At least 14 European countries have made receiving terrorism training a criminal offense. Nine have made travel to the war zones of Syria and Iraq an offense.In France, more than 900 people have left the country to be jihadists, making it Europe\u2019s biggest wellspring of foreign fighters. The government is now debating whether to allow house arrest even if there are merely \u201cserious reasons for thinking\u201d someone has been in an overseas war zone.Two trials involving French jihadist cells were held in Paris this month, with the defendants in one of them receiving sentences of up to 10 years on charges of \u201ccriminal conspiracy with the aim of preparing acts of terrorism.\u201dSetting policy for dealing with returning jihadists is just one example of how Europe, like the United States after the Sept. 11 attacks, is being forced to weigh security concerns against civil liberties.Even before the Paris and Brussels assaults, cases like the one in Strasbourg were highlighting the difficult choices posed by European citizens coming home from Syria.At least 1,300 European jihadists have returned to the Continent, and those are only the ones identified by the police. Three times as many Europeans may have gone to Syria, some slipping back undetected, with disastrous consequences.One member of the Strasbourg group, Foued Mohamed-Aggad, returned after the others and was not detected by the authorities. He ended up as one of the three killers at the Bataclan concert hall in Paris, where 90 people were shot dead on Nov. 13.Of the nine others from Strasbourg known to have gone to Syria, two were killed there in January 2014, but seven returned, were quickly arrested in May 2014 and now await trial.The record of their interrogations afterward is a dance of denial that they intended any harm in Europe.\u201cThis is a radical, extremist Islam which has nothing to do with basic Islam, and which I disavow,\u201d Foued\u2019s brother, Karim, told investigators, according to documents recounting the interrogations.There is no policy covering all of Europe, and in some instances the returning jihadists are not immediately locked up. Though they are almost always placed under some form of monitoring, this puts a big strain on the police and intelligence services.Fifteen to 20 officers per jihadist are required for constant surveillance, said Magnus Ranstorp of the National Defense College in Sweden, a country where about 80 have returned. In Belgium, the biggest per-capita furnisher of jihadists in the European Union, 50 to 120 have returned.But after the recent attacks, and with the Islamic State promising more terrorist strikes, a period of relative laxity is over, analysts said.\u201cThey will be arrested, and the evidence will be gathered,\u201d said Edwin Bakker, director of the Center for Terrorism and Counterterrorism at Leiden University in the Netherlands.More prosecutions are being undertaken preventively, even when there is little firm evidence of a plot, as the French examples show.But the Strasbourg cases illustrate the difficulties of building a prosecution.The Strasbourg group, all men in their mid- to late 20s, had met in hookah bars and fast-food joints. They included a delivery driver, a service station attendant, a physical education instructor, several who were unemployed and a petty criminal.Their departure for Syria in December 2013 had been well publicized. So when they returned, from February to April 2014, France\u2019s internal security agency, the D.G.S.I., knew whom to look for, and where.After their return, the investigators listened and watched, finally pouncing on May 13, 2014, in the same working-class neighborhood they had left.In the eyes of the authorities, their crime was simple: being enlisted by a well-known French recruiter, traveling to Syria and Islamic State safe houses or training centers, training with Kalashnikov rifles and other weapons, and returning to France.Yet in their interrogations, none of the men admitted wrongdoing, and several insisted that they had gone to Syria for humanitarian reasons.The men now claim to reject Islamic State ideology and tactics and profess regret for their \u201cstupidities,\u201d as one put it under questioning.But investigators are well aware that Islamic State training manuals urge recruits to practice the art of taquiya, or concealment. One suspect in Strasbourg, Mohamed Hattay, went through five interrogation sessions before admitting he had even been to Syria.As a result, the authorities try to find evidence from mobile phones, social media posts and other sources that shed light on motivations and true intentions.\u201cWe know sometimes people try to suggest they are disillusioned, but they are just hiding it,\u201d said Gilles de Kerchove, the European Union\u2019s counterterrorism coordinator.\u201cWhen we intercept their communication, we discover it is not true,\u201d he said.The seven Strasbourg suspects portray themselves as full of regret for having made the trip to Syria.\u201cI wasn\u2019t brought up with that way of thinking, and I am totally against it,\u201d one of the men, Miloud Maalmi, told interrogators in 2014.\u201cWhen I was there, they kept me isolated, and they made me undergo truly abominable things,\u201d Mr. Maalmi said. \u201cI want to turn the page.\u201dAnother of them, Radouane Taher, said, \u201cOnce I got there, I understood very quickly what a mess I had gotten myself into, and that I had fallen in with a bunch of madmen.\u201dEven escaping was a risk, Karim Mohamed-Aggad said. \u201cEach one of us, we had to play games in order to flee the country, because our lives were in danger,\u201d he said.Yet investigators said they had found photographs on Facebook, phones and computers showing some of the men posing with the Islamic State flag, wearing military gear and holding rifles. There were also photographs of decapitated corpses, the investigators said.He met Mr. Maalmi at a McDonald\u2019s in Kehl, Germany, across the river from Strasbourg. \u201cAll the jihadists the newspapers are talking about, they passed through me,\u201d Mr. Far\u00e8s told Vice from Syria.Mr. Far\u00e8s is now in jail in France.It is difficult to tell from the mostly bland answers in the transcripts how radicalized the suspects became, though the investigators were able to catch them in inconsistencies and evasions.\u201cThis interrogation contradicts the two preceding it; there being no place in this part of the story for \u2018humanitarianism,\u2019 \u201d the investigators noted in their summary of statements by Ali Hattay, another suspect.\u201cThe people that return now, they will probably be hunted down,\u201d said Mr. Bakker, of the Center for Terrorism and Counterterrorism.\u201cThe general approach is really to try to convict these people,\u201d he added. \u201cIn the past there was the attitude, \u2018Let it go.\u2019 But we\u2019ve really gone beyond that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Neill recalled nights talking with band members over drinks at the trendy Ad Lib club in London about what they might do once the Stones had become pass\u00c3\u00a9.\u00e2\u0080\u009cNone of us thought this was going to last much longer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said in an interview. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe used to talk about what jobs we were going to get when this was over. We used to joke about Mick Jagger doing this at 40.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Neill, who was 25 when he got the call to photograph the Stones in London in 1963, added: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have to remember that we were all just starting our lives, and the blues idols whom the Stones copied were not even huge.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cNineteen sixty-five was a momentous year for the Stones and for putting down a basis and foundation that was going to be with them forever,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Mankowitz said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey had now become one of the biggest bands in the world.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe book harks back to simpler times before the Stones became a full-blown international music sensation with elaborate world tours and the trappings of a Fortune 500 corporation. There are shots of the band members carrying their own instruments and bags through the streets. There are intimate portraits of Mr. Jagger, Mr. Jones, the guitarist Keith Richards, the drummer Charlie Watts and the bassist Bill Wyman (who is no longer with the band) smoking cigarettes and eating meals together. One image shows Mr. Jagger under a hair dryer and another captures Mr. Richards shaving with an electric razor plugged into a light socket. There are pages of the Stones in the studio and on tour: coming down the stairs of a TWA plane, performing shows and preparing back stage. And there are moments of boyish frolicking.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is important about the book is that it focuses on and encapsulates those first three years \u2014 what I call the Brian Jones years \u2014 that lead up to the years of the band\u00e2\u0080\u0099s big success,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Mankowitz said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTerry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pictures give you insight into the five guys just starting to emerge from the initial breakthrough.\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd then my pictures show a clear transition to a new confidence and a confrontational look in front of the camera,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Mankowitz said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd as you progress through \u00e2\u0080\u009965, you see that the Stones are developing a more dandyish, stylish image. Keith, for instance, goes from looking like an art student to looking a rock and roller.\u00e2\u0080\u009dFor Mr. O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Neill, the collection of photographs in the book captures something very specific from the early days of the band\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long, complicated and unprecedented history: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe na\u00c3\u00afvet\u00c3\u00a9 and innocence of that time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}

Polls show Mr. Sanders trailing Hillary Clinton in at least four of the five states voting on Tuesday \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Connecticut, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. Still, Mr. Sanders, who visited those states and the fifth state, Delaware, is not preparing to drop out of the race but will look into how to adjust how he talks about his prospects.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf we are sitting here and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no sort of mathematical way to do it, we will be upfront about that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Tad Devine, Mr. Sanders\u2019s senior strategist, said in an interview. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf we have a really good day, we are going to continue to talk about winning most of the pledged delegates because we will be on a path toward it. If we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get enough today to make it clear that we can do it by the end, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be hard to talk about it. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not going to be a credible path. Instead, we will talk about what we intend to do between now and the end and how we can get there.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBefore Mr. Devine\u2019s remarks, which he made in an interview, the Sanders campaign has resisted the notion that the senator would not have a path to the nomination.Mr. Devine explained that on Wednesday, Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s senior advisers will talk about a range of issues, including how to adjust their messaging about the election process, what route if any they have to winning the nomination, and where they should focus on gaining ground. He said he could still see a mathematical path to winning the nomination, but he added that if that changed with Tuesday night\u2019s results, the campaign would have to adjust.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe may decide we have to pick up some more delegates in some of these caucus states,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Devine said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMaybe we have to get some more people on the ground between now and the state conventions some place because we are not going to win as many as we thought we were going to win in primaries. But we have got to make up the difference elsewhere \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the reassessment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d   Mr. Devine was careful to stress that the senator has already decided that he will compete in every contest, including in California and the District of Columbia, which vote in June.\u00e2\u0080\u009cReassess does not mean that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not going to be part of this race,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Devine said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cReassess does not mean that his message, that we think is the most powerful message, is going to change.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMichael Briggs, a spokesman for Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign, also stressed that Mr. Sanders is staying in the race. \u201cThe senator has been clear that this grass-roots campaign is moving forward,\u201d Mr. Briggs said in an email. \u201cHe thinks voters in California, the biggest state in the country, and the other states and territories where Democrats still haven\u2019t voted deserve a choice and voice in the democratic process.  He\u2019s going to give them that choice.  He\u2019s going to take the campaign all the way to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.\u201dMeanwhile, Mr. Sanders, in what has become somewhat of an Election Day tradition, spent Tuesday posing for pictures, shaking hands, and walking the streets as he courted voters in Philadelphia. The senator visited Reading Terminal Market before walking by City Hall and stopping into a coffee shop.

Now, the old services and hardware business are in trouble, but it showed progress in selling cloud and artificial intelligence services. The company also almost doubled its cash on hand, to $14 billion, in just one quarter.Microsoft has to adjust to selling fewer PC operating systems and making money off its cloud, and before Thursday\u2019s slip saw its shares near a 16-year high. It has $105 billion in cash, up $9 billion in the last three quarters.Wall Street appears to be worried that Google increased its head count over the last quarter, but net income per employee was $65,616 in the recent quarter, up from $63,426 a year ago. Earlier this week Goldman Sachs, considered pretty good at making money, had per-employee net earnings of $31,095. Google also bumped the cash it has on hand by about $2 billion over the quarter, to $75 billion.If the new hopefuls don\u2019t make it and have to sell at big markdowns compared with their once-lofty valuations, there are a few big tech companies that have gathered the cash to buy them.Advertisement"}

What\u2019s the difference between a primary and a caucus? How does the delegate system work? Keep in mind that these are questions that also confound many Americans.When The New York Times en Espa\u00f1ol began in early February, the task before us was to present the best of The Times \u2014 around 10 or so of our 300-plus daily articles \u2014 to a new Spanish-speaking audience. But where to begin?Elections seemed like a good place.Elections in the United States have always generated a lot of interest worldwide, but the insurgent candidacy of Donald J. Trump has, unsurprisingly, caught the attention of readers in Mexico and across Latin America, in part because of his comments about immigrants.People in Latin America and Spain, contrary to what most people might assume, have varied opinions about his candidacy. Most see it as hostile toward Hispanic immigrants and, by extension, hostile to them. But others see him as a self-made man who can take his business acumen to the White House.Beyond Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy, our readers also care about the United States\u2019 foreign and environmental policies, the intersection of money and politics in the campaign, and the impact Latinos will have on the election.\u201cMany of our readers are decision makers in Latin America,\u201d Mr. Linares notes. \u201cFor good or bad, the governments in the region set the tone of relations with the United States based on who gets elected president.\u201d\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of interest because in many countries in Latin America democracy is still a work in progress,\u201d observes Dulce Ramos, the editor in charge of audience development for The New York Times en Espa\u00f1ol. \u201cAnd there\u2019s no democratic system in the region like the American system, so people are genuinely curious.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Murder Trial Plumbs Gang Violence, Adding to a Family\u2019s Pain", "Date": "2016-04-10", "News": "Supported byIn the Grant Houses, a public-housing project in West Harlem, he was known simply as Bam, short for the superstrong cartoon baby Bamm-Bamm in \u201cThe Flintstones.\u201d He had a reputation as a fierce street fighter. At 15, he posted a video in which he knocks a man out cold in a hallway.Prosecutors say Taylonn Murphy was also eager to be a leader in the housing project\u2019s gang, a loosely aligned group of older teenagers who called themselves 3 Staccs and regularly battled two nearby crews, Money Avenue and the Make It Happen Boys \u2014 sometimes with fists or pipes, sometimes with guns.Mr. Murphy, 20, was one of those indicted on murder and conspiracy charges. Now he is standing trial, accused not only of being an active member of 3 Staccs but also of gunning down a rival gang member, Walter Sumter, who had mocked his sister\u2019s death in a rap video.For Mr. Murphy\u2019s parents, the trial has been the second act of a family tragedy. After Ms. Murphy\u2019s murder, they became advocates for more city services for teenagers to counter the lure of gangs, even as they demanded justice at the trials of the two men accused of killing her. Now they sit on the defendant\u2019s side of the courtroom. They have listened with pained expressions over six weeks as prosecutors presented evidence of their son\u2019s involvement with the 3 Staccs crew, even before Ms. Murphy died. Closing arguments in the trial are expected this week.\u201cTo think about losing two children \u2014 one child in prison and one in the grave \u2014 that\u2019s enough to drive anyone crazy,\u201d Mr. Murphy\u2019s father, Taylonn Murphy Sr., said. His mother, Tephanie Holston, said social programs for teenagers might have helped her son. \u201cThere was no structure,\u201d she said during a break in the testimony. \u201cI guess, being young, they created their own.\u201dThe raid in June 2014 led to an immediate drop in violent crime in the neighborhood around Broadway and 125th Street, where the Grant Houses are, but it also prompted some residents to question whether the authorities had cast the net too widely, using a conspiracy statute to link everyone in a social circle to crimes committed by a few.Beyond the murders of Ms. Murphy and Mr. Sumter, the turf war between crews was responsible for 19 other nonfatal shootings between January 2010 and May 2014, the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., said.As homicides in New York have fallen sharply over the last two decades, the tit-for-tat violence between crews like 3 Staccs has persisted, frustrating the authorities. The victims are often crew members themselves and generally refuse to testify, preferring to respond on the street. Witnesses, too, go quiet for fear of being attacked, the police say.To crack the silence, New York City prosecutors have begun using conspiracy statutes to charge everyone affiliated with a crew with all of the crimes its individual members have committed, even if only some of them were present at each attack.The conspiracy statute lets prosecutors stitch together a string of arrests for gun possession, attempted shootings and assaults, holding the entire group responsible.The indictments in the Murphy case rested on the work of two detectives, Fernando Espindola and Julio LaSalle, who pored over hundreds of hours of surveillance video, listened to hours of recorded jailhouse calls and sifted through thousands of social media posts to gather evidence supporting conspiracy charges.The strategy has worked. Ninety-three of the defendants have pleaded guilty, and several have agreed to cooperate. Four members of the Money Avenue gang were convicted at trial last summer, and one of them, Davon Pinkston, was sentenced to 60 years to life in prison. Crime in the Grant and Manhattanville Houses has plummeted by a third in the past two years, and shootings have fallen by half, the police say.\u201cIt\u2019s down big time,\u201d said Carlton G. Davis, president of the residents\u2019 association at the Grant Houses. \u201cWe don\u2019t have shots fired, no gun play, nothing.\u201dHow long the calm will last is uncertain. If the past is a guide, old gangs tend to regroup and new ones emerge within a couple of years of a major crackdown, as young teenagers fill the vacuum left by the cohort sent to prison, police commanders and prosecutors say.Some people who work with young people in Harlem argue that in the long run the conspiracy strategy does more harm than good. Many young men caught in the net are not hardened criminals, but followers who have adopted tough street poses, the skeptics say. Time in prison, where many join gangs like the Crips and Bloods for protection, makes them highly unlikely to return as law-abiding citizens.\u201cYou are not treating the disease,\u201d said Derrick Haynes, a youth counselor who works in the neighborhood. \u201cYou are putting a Band-Aid on the cut, but the infection is already in there.\u201dMr. Murphy\u2019s lawyers, Lewis Gladston and Patrick J. Brackley, have said that there is little evidence linking Mr. Murphy to most of the attacks 3 Staccs gang members have committed. They have also denied the conspiracy charge, portraying the chatter on Facebook and jailhouse calls as the empty posturing and braggadocio of teenagers.The defense has also said that the evidence that Mr. Murphy murdered a rival is thin, and relies heavily on the eyewitness accounts of three former gang members who are testifying for the state to avoid long prison terms.That testimony has given jurors a look at the warrior subculture of some young men in and around Harlem projects. The gang members described how they would venture into another gang\u2019s territory to commit assaults, and then trumpet their exploits on Facebook, daring their rivals to respond. They would pool money to buy communal guns that they would keep close at hand for fights that escalated.Though some gang members sold marijuana and cocaine, the disputes were mainly about respect and revenge. \u201cShootings, stabbings, other things, fights, just causing harm to other people, selling drugs,\u201d one of the witnesses, Javon Brown, said when asked why 3 Staccs was formed.\u201cShootings and stabbings directed at whom?\u201d the lead prosecutor, Andrew Warshawer, asked.\u201cAt rival gang members or anybody who disrespects us,\u201d Mr. Brown answered.The jury has heard evidence about six shootings and an assault in which Mr. Murphy did not play a direct role. Indeed, he was in jail when two of the attacks were carried out. But the jury has been presented with phone calls and letters from Mr. Murphy to friends, in which he talks about his undying loyalty to 3 Staccs and pens epithets like \u201c3 Staccs to the death of me.\u201dVideos have also been exhibited, showing that Mr. Murphy took part in the mugging of one Manhattanville teenager and a drunken assault on a second one. His involvement in those episodes, however, pales in comparison with the main charge against him: the murder of Mr. Sumter, 18, who was shot dead on Dec. 30, 2011 outside a party on West 154th Street.Two weeks earlier, Mr. Sumter posted a rap video online taunting members of 3 Staccs after Ms. Murphy\u2019s murder, and Mr. Murphy responded with a message on Facebook threatening him. \u201cDead on sight beef,\u201d the message said.Two of Mr. Sumter\u2019s friends, Kenneth Thomas and Dominic Washington, both Money Avenue members, testified that they were with Mr. Sumter at the party when Mr. Murphy and four other young men from the Grant Houses arrived, and dared Mr. Sumter to come outside. Mr. Sumter, who had a prior robbery conviction, had left his own 9-millimeter pistol in a trash bin a block from the party, but he rushed downstairs to confront the Grant Houses crew, the witnesses said.Mr. Thomas said that he had implored Mr. Sumter to stop because he had seen another teenager hand Mr. Murphy what looked to be a gun, but that his friend had just run toward the 3 Staccs group, daring Mr. Murphy to shoot. Then, he said, Mr. Murphy, who was 16, stepped forward from between two cars, raised the pistol and fired into Mr. Sumter\u2019s chest.\u201cI heard a shot, saw the muzzle flash,\u201d Mr. Thomas said. \u201cI saw Bam shoot him.\u201dMr. Washington, who was standing on a second-floor balcony, also identified Mr. Murphy as the gunman. \u201cHe was pointing it like this,\u201d Mr. Washington said, raising his right arm in front of him with his hand in the shape of a gun.On cross-examination, both witnesses admitted they were testifying under cooperation agreements that meant that they would be released within months, rather than spending five to 15 years in prison. Mr. Brackley raised questions about the veracity of their accounts, pointing out that Mr. Sumter had fallen dead 30 yards away from the spot where the witnesses said he had been shot.\u201cDid he run 97 feet from the place you saw him after he was shot in the heart?\u201d Mr. Brackley asked Mr. Thomas, who repeatedly insisted he had told the truth.Mr. Murphy was stopped and arrested not long after the shooting by an off-duty police officer who saw him run from the scene and get into a taxi. He did not have a gun. No scientific evidence presented in the trial ties him to the shooting.Neither Mr. Thomas nor Mr. Washington had identified Mr. Murphy on the night of the shooting, Mr. Brackley said. They kept silent until June 2014, when they were arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit murder. \u201cI wanted street justice,\u201d Mr. Thomas said when asked why. He said that on the day after Mr. Sumter died, he bicycled to the Grant Houses with a .38 revolver in his pocket, looking for Mr. Murphy, but did not find him.Additional testimony came from Mr. Brown, who said he was a longtime member of 3 Staccs. A week before the shooting, Mr. Murphy showed Mr. Brown a derringer he had bought on the street, pulling it from a shoe box in his apartment and demonstrating how to load it.Mr. Brown also testified that Mr. Murphy had confessed to him while they were having drinks two weeks after Mr. Sumter was killed. \u201cHe said, \u2018I shot one shot and it hit him,\u2019\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201c\u2018The bullet had his name on it.

{"Headline": "Turbulent Race Could Mean Cash Crunch for Republican National Committee", "Date": "2016-04-09", "News": "Confronted with a prolonged presidential nomination fight and two leading candidates whom donors are uneasy about, the Republican National Committee could be contending with a cash crunch that limits its ability to pour resources into battleground states.Sean Spicer, the spokesman for the R.N.C., acknowledged that there are certain money targets the committee may not hit, describing the shortfall as a function of not having a clear nominee, as opposed to an issue with fundraising performance. \u201cWhile we are better equipped and have more staff than ever before, I think until we have a nominee there are certain realities we are going to have to face,\u201d Mr. Spicer said. The R.N.C. reported having just over $15 million in the bank at the end of February. But at the close of the last financial reporting period about $4.5 million of that money was restricted to costs such as payments for its headquarters and legal affairs. In 2008, the party had over $21 million on hand at the same point in the race, and more than $23 million in 2012.The money worries come as many high-level party strategists in Washington and swing states are beginning to worry that the R.N.C. will be unable to fully fund what are called \u00e2\u0080\u009cvictory programs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the money sent to the most competitive states for organizing and get-out-the-vote efforts.Hard-fought presidential states like Florida, Ohio, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania also have Republican-held Senate seats up for grabs this year, and the results may determine who controls the Senate.The major differences from previous presidential election years are the chaos around the nomination and the lack of any joint fundraising agreements with the candidates. Under these agreements, candidates share some of the money collected at fundraisers with the party, which effectively gives the party a star rainmaker and allows donors to legally give more money than if they were contributing to the candidate alone. Those agreements have previously meant money transfers to the R.N.C. that have helped it build out its coffers, and its staff. The party committee has vastly more field staff now than the four staff members it had in 2012. But there are other elements of the ramp-up that they had planned that are now on delay, people involved in the effort said. The delays mean fewer resources will be allocated to key battlegrounds, such as Pennsylvania and Ohio, in the coming months. Mr. Spicer confirmed that the R.N.C. is in discussions with all three Republican presidential campaigns about joint fundraising agreements, as reported by the Washington Post.  But Senator Ted Cruz and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, candidates facing longer odds, may have little incentive to raise funds for the party. And Donald J. Trump has no major fundraising network to turn to, and will have to build from scratch. Mr. Trump has supporters who could help, but he has never had to do it before. In fact, he has spent months denouncing the very donors who fund the party. Meanwhile, major donors who once were excited for candidates like Jeb Bush and Scott Walker, are now taking a wait-and-see approach before committing large sums. \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "A Gay, Latino Partner Tests Goldman\u2019s Button-Down Culture", "Date": "2016-04-01", "News": "Supported byR. Martin Chavez possesses the light-filled office of a Goldman Sachs partner, with a sweeping view of the Statue of Liberty. But what sets his office apart is the gallery of objects and books arrayed behind the desk.There is the rose-petal birthday present from his husband \u2014 a framed card that says \u201cI love you\u201d in Braille. Below that stands a picture of a wiry terrier named Galahad, acquired as a \u201csobriety dog\u201d when Mr. Chavez stopped drinking in the 1990s. A few feet down, a basketball perches on a shelf.\u201cBasketball is so not me that I decided to put it up there so people could say, \u2018What is Marty doing with a basketball in his office?\u2019\u201d he said, bursting into a peal of laughter.Mr. Chavez, who is 52 and has a thick beard, represents a departure from the button-down partners of Goldman lore \u2014 plutocrats who wore their power on their sleeves and turned the bank into the most vaunted, feared and secretive company on Wall Street.Today Goldman is trying to change not only that public image, but also some of the central tenets of its culture, like the secrecy and reliance on back-room dealings. The company\u2019s chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, has said he wants Goldman to be thought of as a tech company \u2014 putting it in direct competition for talent with the Googles and Facebooks of the world. No one is more central to these efforts than Mr. Chavez.Mr. Chavez, who was promoted just over two years ago to oversee the company\u2019s 9,000 or so computer engineers \u2014 nearly a third of the staff \u2014 is pushing the 147-year-old company to, among other things, share more of its data and software with clients. His centerpiece project, Marquee, gives clients access to sophisticated trading data previously available only by phoning a Goldman employee.Marquee is so closely associated with Mr. Chavez, in fact, that it was initially called \u201cMartee,\u201d a play on his first name. But it has faced internal resistance. Some colleagues complain that the company is handing out valuable information while paving the way for job cuts.Mr. Chavez has responded forcefully, according to people who witnessed some of these conversations. \u201cHe basically said something to the effect of: \u2018If your job is a purely manual job and you are just clicking buttons, you should look to upgrade your skills set now,\u2019\u201d said Adam Korn, a trading executive. \u201cHe was pretty direct.\u201dSome of Mr. Chavez\u2019s ideas about openness date to his early years in Silicon Valley, where sharing is a religion. They haven\u2019t always worked out: At one start-up, he proposed publicly posting everyone\u2019s salaries, an unpopular idea.For Mr. Chavez, transparency is a kind of personal credo. He displays his gay and Latino identities proudly, as well as the Japanese tattoos on his arms. Conversations with him routinely turn to the intricacies of marrying his husband, a Briton, and raising their baby son, who was born to a surrogate in California. He urges his colleagues to open up more as well, arguing that it can serve as an antidote to the negative public image of Goldman.Mr. Chavez represents broad pressures across the financial industry. The 2008 economic crisis and the regulations that followed it are forcing banks to become less opaque and more technologically savvy and efficient. This has shifted the center of power in the business away from the trading desks, where it was before the crisis, and toward the programmers and engineers \u2014 until recently dismissed as the geeks in the back office.Particularly at a place like Goldman, the changes can be an uncomfortable fit with business practices and a culture that have been built up over decades. Charles M. Elson, an expert on corporate governance at the University of Delaware, said that Goldman, born as an adviser to corporations, is not used to operating out in the open.\u201cFundamentally, it\u2019s trying to refit an old car,\u201d said Mr. Elson, who is the director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance, named for the man who ran Goldman in the 1980s. \u201cIt\u2019s not buffing that\u2019s going to do it,\u201d Mr. Elson said. \u201cIn this new environment you have to rethink the whole chassis.\u201dMr. Elson said that Goldman went through a similar change when it converted from a partnership to a publicly traded company. That led to mass departures and internal battles, though Goldman emerged more profitable. It\u2019s not clear that the current slimming-down and opening-up will lead to the same results.Mr. Chavez says that if efforts like his are successful, clients will see \u201ca very different configuration of the financial services industry than the one we have now.\u201d Goldman will still have the chief product of a bank \u2014 money to lend and invest \u2014 but he thinks that the ways in which customers get access to that money will rely more on software and less on the bankers who traditionally delivered Goldman\u2019s services.Mr. Chavez grew up in Albuquerque with two parents who had not graduated from college and four siblings. All five of the children went to Harvard. His mother, a court stenographer whose parents had come from Mexico and Spain to the United States as immigrants, told Mr. Chavez that, because he was Hispanic, \u201cTo get half as far, you have to work twice as hard.\u201dHe was the statistician for the basketball team and read the Encyclopaedia Britannica front to back. \u201cI have no idea how he did it,\u201d his mother, Rose Chavez, said recently. He earned the nickname \u201cmotormouth\u201d from an uncle.There was, though, at least one thing he didn\u2019t talk about: his sexuality. He only came out the day after he defended his doctoral dissertation, in medical information sciences, at Stanford.The difficulty of being in the closet is part of what convinced Mr. Chavez of the importance of transparency. \u201cIt can be hard to be out \u2014 or one can imagine that it might be hard, which is more often the case,\u201d he wrote in a memo to colleagues in 2011. \u201cBut if that imagination leads to holding back, manufacturing alternative stories of how you spent your weekend or where you spent your time off, that not only impacts your peace of mind, it also has negative consequences for your career.\u201dWhen a recruiter from Goldman contacted him in the early 1990s, he worried that Wall Street wouldn\u2019t take to his sexuality as kindly as Silicon Valley had. At the time he worked for a software start-up and had little notion of what Goldman even did.\u201cI didn\u2019t think much about Wall Street,\u201d he said recently. \u201cI thought I was being clever in getting a free trip to New York City.\u201dDuring interviews at the bank, he said, he was impressed by his interviewers\u2019 quick wits. And his future boss took it in stride when Mr. Chavez said he was gay.Soon Mr. Chavez was plunged into Goldman\u2019s early efforts to automate its trading business with a computer system, SecDB, which is still the spine of its operations. Within the elite trading division where Mr. Chavez was placed, the J. Aron & Company operation \u2014 a shop that groomed many of the company\u2019s leaders \u2014 he worked with Mr. Blankfein, now the chief executive, and Gary D. Cohn, now Goldman\u2019s president.Mr. Chavez struggled, though, with drinking, a vice he attributes to an overindulgence in New York\u2019s gay night life. While going through Alcoholics Anonymous in 1997, Mr. Chavez got Galahad, the dog, to try to help him stay sober.He also decided he wanted a change of scene \u2014 pulling a \u201cgeographic\u201d in the parlance of A.A. Over the protests of Mr. Cohn, he briefly took a job at another Wall Street company, Credit Suisse, then jumped back into the start-up world, building a company, Kiodex, that wrote software to evaluate energy-trading risks.Kiodex had a rough ride. First, the tech bubble burst. Then, Mr. Chavez decided to collaborate with Enron right before the energy company went bust.Sean Patrick Maloney, one of Mr. Chavez\u2019s deputies at Kiodex, said Mr. Chavez\u2019s outsider status gave him an unusual problem-solving creativity. \u201cWhen you cross lines of difference in life \u2014 and you embrace things that to others seem taboo \u2014 it absolutely changes the way your brain works,\u201d said Mr. Maloney, who is now a Democratic congressman from upstate New York. \u201cHe sees things that others miss.\u201dStill, his approach would occasionally go astray. It was at Kiodex where Mr. Chavez proposed making everyone\u2019s salary public. Tom Farley, then Kiodex\u2019s chief financial officer, says he talked Mr. Chavez out of that. \u201cThe type of transparency that Marty espouses isn\u2019t for everyone,\u201d said Mr. Farley, who is now in charge of the New York Stock Exchange.Mr. Chavez, for his part, says the episode helped teach him not to prize \u201cradical transparency for its own sake.\u201dKiodex eventually recovered. Mr. Chavez sold it and retired to his house on Fire Island. He was 40 years old.Mr. Chavez was back at Goldman when the financial crisis hit \u2014 at the center of the bank\u2019s efforts to calculate and track its health during those stressful times. Goldman made it through with better results than most rivals. But that success itself caused problems when government investigations uncovered instances in which Goldman profited from the country\u2019s economic pain.Mr. Chavez recalls friends and family asking: How can you work there? It was a message echoing across the world, with Wall Street under fire for driving the nation to the brink of disaster. Goldman began a charm offensive.The company hired a new public relations chief, Jake Siewert, who previously worked as a chief White House spokesman under Bill Clinton. Goldman also began advertising campaigns stressing its philanthropic work and the financing it provides for projects like a new basketball arena in Kentucky.The crisis gave Mr. Chavez an opening to adopt a more aggressive strategy in his day-to-day work. With Wall Street facing the prospect of declining revenue and rising costs, the company was receptive to his proposals to standardize and automate more of its trading operations. Part of the savings to Goldman came from job cuts, though the bank does not provide detailed numbers.He also pitched automation as a way to help Goldman comply with the Dodd-Frank financial reform, which aimed, in part, to make trading more transparent and easier for regulators to track.In the past, the elite trading-desk programmers \u2014 strategists, or \u201cstrats\u201d in Goldman lingo \u2014 had been in a different division from the traditional I.T. department. Mr. Chavez gained control of both units and unified them, causing some consternation on both sides. The strats worried about being dumbed down, employees say, while the I.T. engineers worried about being marginalized.Symphony is representative of Mr. Chavez\u2019s larger strategy. He gave up the opportunity to develop the software internally and turn it into a source of revenue in order to create something that everyone in the industry might use, and that might allow Goldman to communicate with all of its clients better, even if it is not making money off Symphony itself.But the software, like other programs Mr. Chavez is pushing, faces major hurdles to its success. It still needs to win over investment firms \u2014 the biggest clients of the banks \u2014 and many of them are hesitant to use software that, they worry, might give the banks a way to snoop on their communications.Mr. Chavez\u2019s efforts have also faced skepticism in the technology community, in no small part because of a prominent case in which the company accused a former employee and programmer, Sergey Aleynikov, of stealing Goldman\u2019s software upon leaving the company.Mr. Chavez was not involved in Mr. Aleynikov\u2019s case. And he has been trying to confront Wall Street\u2019s mixed reputation among programmers. He has gone to lead recruiting events at elite institutions like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where the number of students applying to Wall Street has fallen sharply, in part because of the perception of the industry as stuffy and slow-moving.Mr. Chavez has not been shy about pushing the company to embrace social issues as a selling point. He urged its human resources department to expand benefits to gay partners before the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage. He then encouraged Mr. Blankfein to speak out in support of gay marriage.Still, he acknowledges, there is much to do. At the Recode event last fall, he joked about Goldman\u2019s lack of diversity.He was in an office, he said, with a fellow Hispanic executive, when another executive stopped by. \u201cHe opens the door, he sticks his head in, and he says, \u201850 percent of the Hispanic partners of Goldman Sachs, right here, right now.\u2019\u201d The task now, he said, was to take Goldman \u201cto a different place.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Trump\u2019s meeting, like others he held that day, was at the hotel he is building in the gutted body of the Old Post Office, and was kept secret, with attendees invited by phone. Nicholas E. Calio, a former lobbyist who worked on legislative affairs for President George Bush, was in attendance. Mr. Calio is now the president and chief executive of Airlines for America, a large trade group. There was also Juanita Duggan, the president and chief executive of the National Federation of Independent Business, another major trade group. She is a former aide who served in the first Bush and Reagan administrations, and she was once an official with the tobacco giant Philip Morris Companies. An aide to Ms. Duggan confirmed her attendance, but said that she was respecting a request not to discuss what took place. Penny Kozakos, an aide to Mr. Calio, said in an email that \u201cMr. Calio regularly meets with leaders of industry, members of Congress, other elected officials, including those seeking office, about the airline industry and its importance to the economy and jobs.\u201d  Yet Mr. Trump routinely makes \u201cspecial interests\u201d and lobbyists a focus of derision in his stump speeches, making the meeting something of a surprise. Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump, said that the candidate\u2019s adviser, Senator Jeff Sessions, had arranged a meeting with people for whom he has \u201cgreat respect.\u201d \u201cMr. Trump didn\u2019t know them, but it was a brief meeting that took place right after the lengthy foreign policy team meeting,\u201d Ms. Hicks said in an email. In a town-hall-style forum hosted by Greta Van Susteren of Fox News on Sunday night, Mr. Trump was asked about a potential merger of airlines, asking what his antitrust division might look like as president. \u201cI\u2019d look at it very carefully,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI\u2019d look at a lot of that. You know, and that might be not the Republican thing to say. But if we don\u2019t have competition and keep some competition, we\u2019re going to have a lot of problems in the country.\u201d He added: \u201cAnd I see mergers of different things. I won\u2019t say it because what do I need certain industries against me for? But the fact is that you\u2019ve got to have competition to be great. And when you see these big fat mergers and the companies get bigger, they get bloated and they don\u2019t do well.\u201d \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

The two men, now thousands of miles apart, had become closer than brothers in Iraq, serving shoulder-to-shoulder under mortar and rocket fire. Few words were needed.\u201cAll okay, Top!\u201d Mr. Bennett wrote.In interviews, many veterans said they turn primarily to social media sites for support, where former units are at their fingertips, and a lifeline is just a keystroke away.\u201cWe have certainly tasted the same dust,\u201d Mr. Bennett said.For decades now, American veterans have forged bonds on battlefields, sleeping in sand-blown tents, swallowing fear in concrete bunkers, or cramming into the bowels of tanks for a dozen hours. When deployments end, those ties are stretched as veterans fan out across the United States. For Mr. Bennett, 50, the online buddy checks are as important as the conventional therapy that he has used to adapt to civilian life.\u201cIt\u2019s me letting everyone know that I am there for them, and everyone letting me know they are there for me,\u201d he said.\u201cWe tried to convince him that there is absolutely nothing in the world that killing yourself can solve,\u201d Mr. Day said.\u201cI think that ultimately the responsibility for us as a community is to be an open ear,\u201d Mr. Day said.In the video, the father says that he had surgery on his shoulder, but would give the push-ups his all. After struggling through them, he ended the video with, \u201cSave lives.\u201dIn a telephone interview, Mr. Stevenson said his son had talked to him about combat in Afghanistan. \u201cI never felt so afraid in my life.

Mr. Trump never directly answered the question. The moment evoked a similar reach-for-an-aide episode, when, in an interview with reporters in September 2003, the retired Gen. Wesley K.

Tremendously. And yet my Jewish friends go out and have fund-raisers for him.\u201d Mr. Trump also praised his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, who had faced a battery charge in Florida, until prosecutors said on Thursday that they would not pursue it; he was accused of forcibly grabbing and bruising a reporter last month.

Trump Jr.; his lawyer, Donald F. McGahn; his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski; the national political director Michael Glassner; and Mr. Trump\u2019s spokeswoman, Hope Hicks.When the discussion turned to the wrangling of delegates to the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nominating convention in Cleveland this July \u00e2\u0080\u0094 an issue that has dogged Mr. Trump and his skeletal campaign organization for months \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Mr. Priebus explained that states all had different rules governing how they were selected.Mr. Trump has found himself at a disadvantage in some states, as his aides have allowed rival campaigns to peel some delegates away. Mr. Trump mentioned Louisiana, where he won the primary, but where Senator Ted Cruz is likely to come away with more delegates after exploiting peculiarities in the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s system, according to those briefed on the meeting.But when Mr. Priebus explained that each campaign needed to be prepared to fight for delegates at each state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s convention, Mr. Trump turned to his aides and suggested that they had not been doing what they needed to do, the people briefed on the meeting said.In recent days, Mr. Priebus, who insists that the committee has stayed scrupulously neutral throughout the contentious primary fight, has also let it be known that he does not plan to let the Trump campaign take over the party apparatus if he captures the nomination.At an off-the-record happy hour with reporters last week, Mr. Priebus said clearly that, regardless of precedent, he would not be layered over by Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s loyalists, according to two people present.After the account of the meeting was published on Friday morning, Mr. Lewandowski and Mr. Glassner confirmed that the issue of Louisiana had been raised, but said the reports about Mr. Trump expressing aggravation with his team were untrue. \u201cMr. Trump specifically asked the R.N.C., \u2018Do I have a good delegate team, headed by Ed Brookover?\u2019 They said, \u2018Yes you do, he is one of the very best,'\u201d Mr. Lewandowski said. \u201cHe said, \u2018What else should I do?'\u201d From there, he said, the R.N.C. listed some other types of staff additions he could make.

He drinks water, bites down on his pinkie, makes a snoring sound, swivels his hips. He drinks more water. And, puh-kee, ee, ee, ooh, wah, he works his voice up the musical scale, until, ultimately, he finds his lost falsetto.The rituals are familiar to Mr. Platt. He\u2019s already been in films (including as Benji, the singing, sideburned, magic-obsessed dork in the smash \u201cPitch Perfect\u201d films) and on Broadway. And he grew up with an up-close view of the entertainment industry: His father is one of the lead producers of \u201cWicked.\u201dMr. Platt has already done enough musicals to make a revue.

He twitches his eyes and his mouth, tugs on his sleeve, scratches a wrist, picks at a nail, grabs his back pockets, fidgets with a pencil. His voice is halting and soft, punctuated with doubt.His character was developed through trial and error \u2014 many of the verbal tics were scripted by the book writer, Steven Levenson, while the physical gestures were honed by Mr. Platt in rehearsal.\u201cI thought back to a lot of kids in my high school who I think of as more socially awkward, or anxious, or worried about how they\u2019re being perceived,\u201d Mr. Platt said over mint tea after wrapping up his recent voice lesson. \u201cThey are similar to Evan in the way that they would carry themselves, or sit at lunch tables, and walk around school with their heads down looking at their feet and blinking.\u201dHe has transformed his physique for the role, dropping 35 pounds from his Elder Cunningham body by eliminating dairy and gluten from his diet. \u201cI\u2019d never want to make myself unhealthy in any way for a role, but I also felt like he\u2019s not a kid that can stand to eat very much,\u201d he said.Mr. Platt has been with the show since its first reading, nearly two years ago, and he has shaped the character, and it has shaped him, in ways that are now difficult to disentangle. Even out of character, he tugs on his sleeves and toys with a jacket zipper.\u201cAt first I felt very separate from most of the things I endowed Evan with, but now that I\u2019ve lived with him for so long, it\u2019s kind of bled through,\u201d Mr. Platt said.But he says Evan\u2019s social anxiety is significantly more pronounced than his own.\u201cI have had a struggle with anxiety, always, and as a proud Jew, that\u2019s not a surprising thing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think I have as much trouble as he does connecting with people generally \u2014 I think I\u2019m pretty good at that, and that\u2019s his biggest challenge.\u201dThe Platt family \u2014 Ben is the fourth of five children \u2014 takes its musical theater so seriously that friends sometimes refer to the \u201cVon Platt family singers\u201d (an allusion to the Von Trapps of \u201cThe Sound of Music\u201d). The family lives in Los Angeles, and at key milestones, they perform adapted show tunes in honor of the celebrants; at Ben\u2019s bar mitzvah, the family performed a rewritten version of a number from Stephen Sondheim and George Furth\u2019s \u201cCompany.\u201d (\u201cAnother Hundred People\u201d became \u201cAnother Hundred Playbills.\u201d)\u201cMost kids, when they\u2019re young, want computer games and Power Rangers and Ninja Turtles,\u201d Ben\u2019s father, Marc Platt, said in a telephone interview. \u201cBen always wanted a clip-on microphone, so he could perform in the backyard, and one year he wanted a fog machine.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve done as best a job as we can making it clear that I\u2019m earning what I\u2019m earning because of me, and not because of who my father is,\u201d Ben Platt said. \u201cBut at the same time, I\u2019m not ignoring things that would be dumb to ignore, like people that I can know through him, and experiences I can have through him, and things that I can learn from him.\u201dHis role in \u201cDear Evan Hansen\u201d began with a series of fortuitous rejections. When he was 16, he auditioned for the role of Henry, a high school student, in \u201cNext to Normal,\u201d and when he was 18, he auditioned for the role of Bernstein, a young Marine, in \u201cDogfight.\u201dHe was deemed too young for either part, but the director of \u201cNormal,\u201d Mr. Greif, and the writers of \u201cDogfight,\u201d Mr. Pasek and Mr. Paul, were impressed by Mr. Platt\u2019s combination of strong voice, comic timing and emotional intelligence.\u201cI had never seen anything quite like it with someone that young \u2014 I didn\u2019t know who this person was, but I knew he was going to be someone,\u201d Mr. Paul recalled. Mr. Pasek was so struck that, after rejecting Mr. Platt for the role, he reached out to him on Facebook, thinking \u201cwe have to work with this actor.\u201dIn the meantime, Mr. Platt had finished high school (Harvard-Westlake, a prep school in Los Angeles) and had been admitted to college (Columbia University). But a few weeks before the start of his freshman year, he was offered the role in \u201cPitch Perfect.\u201d (\u201cI\u2019d never really played the nerdier, outcastier, marginalized guy before, but I really liked the character and I wanted to try my hand at it.\u201d) Instead of moving to New York, he headed to Baton Rouge, La., where the film, a comedy about college a cappella competitions, was shot.\u201cHe really just felt like he was in that exact place between being a boy and being a man \u2014 \u2018Pitch Perfect\u2019 was about that transitional time in people\u2019s lives, and he completely embodied that,\u201d said Elizabeth Banks, who produced and performed in the film (and directed the sequel, also featuring Mr. Platt). \u201cHe\u2019s very lovable \u2014 he\u2019s like a little brother that you don\u2019t mind having around.\u201dIn the fall of 2012, Mr. Platt began his studies at Columbia. But he only lasted six weeks before being cast in the Chicago company of \u201cMormon.\u201d That was the end of his college career (at least for now \u2014 his parents, while fully supportive of his acting career, also still hope he\u2019ll find a way to pursue an education).Then came Evan Hansen. Inspired in part by the death of a student at Mr. Pasek\u2019s high school, the composers had been exploring the idea of a musical about how collective grief plays out in the era of social media. A producer, Stacey Mindich, introduced them to Mr. Levenson, who wrote the musical\u2019s book. And in 2014 they called Mr. Platt for a reading; he has been bound up with the character since, so much that dialogue and songs have been written for his voice.By now, actor and character are almost like friends.\u201cHe has the fears that all of us are afraid to talk about,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s a brave kid, and he does what he thinks is best. Sometimes he\u2019s selfish, but we can all be selfish sometimes. I just like how imperfect he is.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Players\u2019 Examines Crossroads of Sports and Money", "Date": "2016-04-22", "News": "Supported byBook EntryNo part of the media and entertainment industry has seen a more substantial economic transformation than sports.It is hard to believe that in 1990, when Hearst bought 20 percent of ESPN for a song, RJR Nabisco had long been trying to unload the stake. The remaining 80 percent share today represents the largest part of the largest media conglomerate in the world: the Walt Disney Company. And sports plays an increasing role in more than just the corporate realm. The seemingly perpetual growth of the price of sports rights has relegated a shocking percentage of American families to effective poverty once they have paid for the basic cable video bundle that incorporates these costs. This phenomenon implicates public policy considerations as well.Given this backdrop, the subtitle of a new book by Matthew Futterman, \u201cPlayers: The Story of Sports and Money, and the Visionaries Who Fought to Create a Revolution\u201d (Simon & Schuster), could not be more timely. Mr. Futterman, a sportswriter for The Wall Street Journal, takes us on a half-century tour spanning a variety of widely recognized and lesser-known sports figures and competitions that have played roles in the industry\u2019s development. Mr. Futterman is right that understanding the history is crucial to understanding the current state of sports and the possibility of change.As enjoyable as the journey sometimes is, the problem with the book is reflected in the title itself of \u201cPlayers.\u201d Mr. Futterman focuses on one level of a complex, multilayered industry whose economics are not primarily driven by how individual athletes negotiate their salary and licensing deals.Much more consequential is the structure of the games, teams, leagues and federations and their relationships with brands, broadcasters, cable channels and increasingly diverse potential distribution outlets. It is simply not possible to tell \u201cthe story of sports and money\u201d without broadening the narrative.Unfortunately, half of the book is taken up with tales of the players in golf, tennis and baseball who fought pivotal battles to improve their respective sports\u2019 compensation structures. The topic of escalating rights fees is taken up, only in the final chapter, and then perfunctorily. There is no mention at all, for instance, of the young Fox network\u2019s unexpected decision to submit a huge pre-emptive bid for N.F.L. rights in 1993. That move upended a relationship between football and CBS that dated back to the 1950s and fundamentally altered the trajectory of the cost of all sports rights since.Mr. Futterman\u2019s emphasis on the players has the virtue of lending itself to interesting personal histories. But the frequent flashbacks are disorienting, and the detailed descriptions of various sports matches are only sometimes relevant to the plot. The success of a goofy show in the 1970s called \u201cThe Superstars\u201d in which famous athletes from diverse disciplines competed against each other in a series of haphazardly organized events makes a good story. It demonstrated the increasing importance of the individual athletes\u2019 celebrity relative to the games or teams themselves. This point could be made, however, without a play-by-play of the relay races or tug-of-war competition.\u201cPlayers\u201d does not provide readers with the tools to understand why this might be. There is also no mention of the overall size of the industry or the mix of revenues between gate, media rights, sponsorships and merchandising. And the relative size of the various sports within the industry is not discussed and bears no relation to how much time Mr. Futterman spends on each.Mr. Futterman is as much a sports fan as he is a sportswriter, and the narrow preoccupations of \u201cPlayers\u201d reflect this perspective. The early chapters champion the interests of the exploited players who dare to wrestle a fair share of the pie from the team owners and leagues. Mr. Futterman argues that \u201cempowering\u201d the players \u201callowed them to transform modern sports\u201d by improving the quality of play and professionalism of the overall enterprises.The tone changes in the latter part of the book as the impact of excessive focus on individual celebrity comes at the expense of team performance and the broader values that sports should promote.In the absence of a fuller examination of the overarching industry structure, Mr. Futterman can only offer exhortations rather than any solutions: \u201cFans, who have sustained the industry \u2026 don\u2019t want much \u2013 just the ability to enjoy the games they love and the athletes they admire without getting ripped off, lied to, or insulted, either by the athletes who play sports or the people who run them.\u201dWho could argue with such sentiments? Although it may not seem like much to ask for, nothing in \u201cPlayers\u201d suggests that it will be made available any time soon.Jonathan A. Knee is professor of professional practice at Columbia Business School and a senior adviser at Evercore Partners.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Robert Iger\u2019s Success at Disney Makes Him a Tough Act to Follow", "Date": "2016-04-05", "News": "Supported byA forest of ferns, palm trees and flowering plants stretched down Hollywood Boulevard. A woodland soundtrack (gurgling water, chirping crickets) and flickering tiki torches deepened the fantasy. And standing as sentry at the end of the red carpet was Robert A. Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive and chairman, as sturdy, composed and tan as ever.\u201cAsk me anything about the movie,\u201d he said to a reporter, pre-empting a question about succession and flashing a smile.\u201cMr. Iger is universally acknowledged as having provided exemplary leadership,\u201d Todd Juenger, a Bernstein Research analyst, wrote on Monday. \u201cHow do you follow an act like that? Who could possibly live up? Begging the question, if not Mr. Staggs, then who?\u201dA lot of people in Hollywood and on Wall Street contend the answer is Mr. Iger himself.Was the board\u2019s reluctance to back Mr. Staggs a play by Mr. Iger to stay in power? People inside Disney have aggressively dismissed that notion, saying Mr. Staggs\u2019s departure caused Mr. Iger anguish \u2013 they are friends \u2013 and that the rigor of succession planning is the beginning and end of the story. Furthermore, Mr. Iger has not signaled an intention to sign another deal. If he was so intent on staying, people close to him have argued, he would have simply extended his contract and not let questions swirl.Disney declined to comment on Tuesday.So, back to the question: If not someone from inside Disney, then who? In announcing the departure of Mr. Staggs on Monday, the company said only that it would \u201cbroaden the scope of its succession planning process to identify and evaluate a robust slate of candidates for consideration.\u201dWall Street had a muted reaction to Mr. Staggs\u2019s withdrawal. Disney shares closed down 1.7 percent Tuesday. But some of the company\u2019s managers took the news less in stride. While there was a general opinion inside Disney that Mr. Staggs\u2019s first year as chief operating officer had not been a spectacular success, most people were shocked by his departure. And now, insiders asked, will the next chief executive most likely be an outsider \u2014 a devil we don\u2019t know?The good news is that Disney still has a 27-month cushion to figure out succession before Mr. Iger leaves, if he does not extend again.Anthony DiClemente, a Nomura Securities analyst, wrote on Tuesday that the departure of Mr. Staggs meant \u201cvery little\u2019\u2019 for Disney in the near term.

{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders Continue Back-and-Forth Over Debate Date", "Date": "2016-04-03", "News": "Hillary Clinton on Sunday sought to put an end to the debate over the debate.After much prodding by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont to convince her to agree to another debate before the April 19 primary in New York, Mrs. Clinton said she would attend a debate on April 14 in Brooklyn, the borough that houses both candidates\u2019 campaign headquarters and where Mrs. Clinton spent Sunday speaking to congregants at several black churches.But an April 14 debate, which NY1 and The New York Daily News have proposed sponsoring together, remains a no-go for the Sanders campaign. His campaign says the date conflicts with a major rally Mr. Sanders plans to hold in a prime New York City venue that has already granted a hard-to-get permit. Michael Briggs, a spokesman for Mr. Sanders, said the campaign had proposed four other potential dates. (In December, when the debate schedule was first being worked out, the Sanders campaign had put forth April 14.)The fight over the Brooklyn debate is just the latest dust-up in a Democratic primary in which both campaigns have prided themselves on policy-minded civility.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Sanders campaign needs to stop with the games,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Brian Fallon, a Clinton spokesman, said on Saturday, noting that the Sanders campaign had rejected three proposed dates for a debate before the New York primary.But Mr. Briggs said that at least one of those proposed dates was \u00e2\u0080\u009cludicrous\u00e2\u0080\u009d as it would have conflicted with the N.C.A.A. men\u2019s basketball finals.Since the last debate between the two Democrats, on March 8 in Miami, the race has taken a more combative tone, with Mr. Sanders working hard to try and play catch-up, and Mrs. Clinton working to secure the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nomination against a unexpectedly formidable, and well-funded, opponent.In the interview with NY1, Mrs. Clinton tried to portray Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s increasingly pointed criticism as a sign of desperation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI understand as we get closer to the end there may be some anxiety, frustration and acting out on the other side that has to look at the facts,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Clinton told Josh Robin of NY1.\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook, I have 2.5 million more votes nationwide than Senator Sanders,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Clinton continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have a big lead in delegates.

They have responded to Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s singular message.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe Observer, of course, is owned and published by Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, the husband of Ivanka Trump.The potential conflict of interest that this poses for the weekly newspaper has been a recurring theme throughout the Republican primary. The paper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policy on writing about Mr. Trump has been something of a moving target from the start. Initially, it said it would simply not cover him. The paper eventually lifted the prohibition to include straightforward news articles about him. More recently, it said it would treat Mr. Trump no differently than any other presidential candidate.Even when the paper was not officially covering Mr. Trump, it did not hesitate to advance his agenda, whether arguing that the Republican establishment \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nemesis \u00e2\u0080\u0094 should give up on the 2016 election, or publishing a lengthy takedown of Senator Marco Rubio of Florida (accompanied by a caricature of the former Republican presidential candidate holding a sign reading: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI Am for Sale\u00e2\u0080\u009d).With the endorsement, The Observer has taken its boldest step yet in support of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s candidacy.The editorial criticizes the mainstream media and \u00e2\u0080\u009ccultural elite\u00e2\u0080\u009d for their failure to grasp the Trump phenomenon, while celebrating Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s accomplishments as a businessman. Defending his campaign promise to \u00e2\u0080\u009cmake America great again,\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Observer wrote: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt depends not on 14-point proposals or an SAT-like cramming of policy details. It depends on faith and leadership.\u00e2\u0080\u009dDuring the campaign, Mr. Kushner has appeared frequently on stage beside Mr. Trump, and has made phone calls to various Republican power brokers on his behalf. He also helped write the speech Mr. Trump gave  last month before the American Israel Public Affairs Committee \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with input from the editor of The Observer, Ken Kurson, an old friend of the Kushner family.Mr. Kushner, the scion of a New Jersey real estate dynasty, bought The Observer in 2006 for about $10 million.

The agreement on a debate at the Brooklyn Navy Yard was announced by CNN, which will host it. It follows weeks of public squabbling, with the Sanders campaign urging a debate before the New York primary and the Clinton team saying it had agreed only to a debate sometime in April.Tensions were apparently still a little raw even after the agreement.

{"Headline": "Hope for Reversing Type 2 Diabetes", "Date": "2016-04-18", "News": "Many experts believe Type 2 diabetes is an incurable disease that gets worse with time. But new research raises the tantalizing possibility that drastic changes in diet may reverse the disease in some people.Recently, a small clinical trial in England studied the effects of a strict liquid diet on 30 people who had lived with Type 2 diabetes for up to 23 years. Nearly half of those studied had a remission that lasted six months after the diet was over. While the study was small, the finding offers hope to millions who have been told they must live with the intractable disease.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a radical change in our understanding of Type 2 diabetes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. Roy Taylor, a professor at Newcastle University in England and the study\u00e2\u0080\u0099s senior author. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf we can get across the message that \u00e2\u0080\u0098yes, this is a reversible disease \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that you will have no more diabetes medications, no more sitting in doctors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 rooms, no more excess health charges\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that is enormously motivating.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe researchers followed the participants after they had completed an eight-week low-calorie-milkshake diet and returned to normal eating. Six months later, those who had gone into remission immediately after the diet were still diabetes-free. Though most of those who reversed the disease had had it for less than four years, some had been diabetic for more than eight years.When Allan Tutty, 57, learned five years ago that he had Type 2 diabetes, he asked health care providers if there was a cure. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was a case of, look, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got it, deal with it, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no cure,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Tutty, who manages a home for people with brain injuries in Newcastle.Later, Mr. Tutty spotted a notice recruiting volunteers for a diabetes study that asked, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWould you like the opportunity to reverse your condition?\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Tutty said he jumped at the chance, becoming one of 30 men and women ages 25 to 80 to sign up. Mr. Tutty was one of 13 participants whose fasting plasma glucose dropped, and during the six-month follow-up remained below the seven millimole per liter (or 126 milligrams per deciliter) that defines diabetes. Although Mr. Tutty completed the study nearly three years ago, his fasting blood sugars continue to range from 5.2 to 5.6 mmol/L, he said.Although no one knows exactly why the diet appeared to reverse diabetes, Dr. Taylor said the explanation may be related to how the body stores fat. Excess fat in the liver can spill into the pancreas, inhibiting insulin secretion and the liver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s response to insulin, resulting in insulin resistance and diabetes.Going on a very-low-calorie diet may allow the body to use up fat from the liver, causing fat levels to drop in the pancreas as well. That \u00e2\u0080\u009cwakes up\u00e2\u0080\u009d the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, normalizing blood glucose levels.While some previous studies have shown that blood sugars can normalize after significant weight loss, endocrinologists said they were impressed by the persistence of the lower blood sugar levels for months after the diet.\u00e2\u0080\u009cDecreasing caloric intake for any reason brings with it a rapid improvement in glucose control,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. Robert Lash, the chairman of the Endocrine Society\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clinical affairs committee and a professor of internal medicine at the University of Michigan. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exciting here is that the improvements in glucose control persisted when the participants went back to eating a diet with a normal number of calories.\u00e2\u0080\u009dWhile the research suggests the potential for a cure, questions remain about how long the effect will last and whether it can work for the typical patient with diabetes.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definitely doable,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. George King, the chief scientific officer at Joslin Diabetes Center and a professor at Harvard Medical School. The question, he said, is: Can people maintain the weight loss and \u00e2\u0080\u009ccontinue to have this reversal for many, many years?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is the difficult part,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added.Dr. King said that even short-term remission would reduce or put off some of the serious complications associated with diabetes, like nerve damage, kidney damage, loss of vision, heart attacks and strokes. Yet structured weight loss programs are expensive and often not covered by insurance, and physicians \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who are often not well-versed in nutrition \u00e2\u0080\u0094 may not take the time to counsel patients about diet, Dr. King said.The participants in the Newcastle trial, who ranged from overweight to extremely obese, were told to stop their diabetes medications and start a 600- to 700-calorie-a-day diet, consisting of three diet milkshakes a day at mealtimes and half a pound of nonstarchy vegetables a day.Mr. Tutty, who weighed about 213 pounds before the trial, lost a little more than 30 pounds, the average weight loss in the trial. The people in the study most likely to respond to the treatment were in their early 50s on average and younger than the nonresponders, and they had had diabetes for fewer years. The responders were also healthier before the trial: They had been taking fewer medications than nonresponders, had lower fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1c before the trial, and had higher baseline serum insulin levels. Three of those who went into remission had lived with diabetes for more than eight years.Many of the responders are still in the prediabetes zone and at risk for developing diabetes, Dr. Taylor said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not fair to say they were completely normalized, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re at a level of blood sugar where we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect to see the serious complications associated with diabetes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s such good news.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe big challenge for dieters was returning to normal eating, and trial participants received intensive counseling from a researcher on the team about how to eat after ending the liquid diet, Dr. Taylor said.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey would describe going back to the kitchen and almost having a panic attack,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe used that as an opportunity to instill new habits, and were very directive about how much to cook and how much to eat.\u00e2\u0080\u009dRelated:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "Sean Parker, a Facebook and Napster Pioneer, to Start Cancer Immunotherapy Effort", "Date": "2016-04-13", "News": "Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Sean Parker was a pioneer in music sharing when he co-founded Napster and in social media as the early president of Facebook. Now he wants to pioneer in a field that is already jumping with activity: cancer immunotherapy.Mr. Parker is announcing Wednesday that he is donating $250 million to a new effort that will bring together six leading academic centers to develop ways to unleash patients\u2019 own immune systems to fight cancer.The Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy will try to spur collaboration among the centers, having them share research materials and discoveries and jointly conduct clinical trials to try to accelerate progress.\u201cHow do we get more therapies to market faster and more cheaply?\u201d Mr. Parker said in an interview, adding that his effort represented a new \u201cblueprint for biomedical research funding.\u201dThe academic institutions involved are the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Stanford, and the University of California campuses in San Francisco and Los Angeles.After decades of frustration, researchers have finally figured out how to direct the body\u2019s immune system to recognize and attack tumors, resulting in some striking recoveries for patients on the brink of death. But this approach has worked for only a minority of patients, so there is still much room for improvement.Dozens of companies are pursuing the field, and philanthropists are supporting research. Johns Hopkins University recently announced it would open a center for immunotherapy research using $50 million gifts from Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, and Sidney Kimmel, founder of the Jones Apparel Group. Immunotherapy is also a major thrust of Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s \u201ccancer moonshot\u201d initiative.Mr. Parker said that his institute, which will involve about 300 researchers in 40 laboratories on the six campuses, will try to improve on existing approaches in ways not being pursued by companies.The institute will have a somewhat unusual arrangement with the research centers. While each academic center will own the intellectual property from its work, the Parker Institute will manage the patents and their licensing to companies. Some of the proceeds will go toward future research by the Parker Institute and be shared by all the academic centers, giving them an incentive to cooperate rather than compete.The Parker Institute will also work with companies, including a study with Merck on why some cancers resist treatment by the company\u2019s drug Keytruda. Jeffrey Bluestone, a professor and immune system expert at the University of California, San Francisco, will also serve as chief executive of the Parker Institute, which will be based in San Francisco.Researchers said the money from the Parker Institute would allow them to pursue longer term projects and more radical ideas than they could using government grants.\u201cIf you have a great idea, you should be able to try it tomorrow,\u201d said Lewis L. Lanier, who will lead the project at U.C.S.F. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty stale if you have to wait nine months\u201d to get a government grant.\u201cThis is my primary philanthropic project probably for the rest of my life,\u201d he said.Mr. Parker, 36, said he initially became interested in the immune system because he has asthma and food allergies. But his interest in tamping down the immune system to stifle allergies also drew his attention to efforts to rev it up to fight cancer.On Wednesday evening, Mr. Parker will host a big party at his house in Los Angeles to celebrate the start of the immunotherapy project.Guests will include the actors Tom Hanks and Sean Penn, the directors Peter Jackson and Ron Howard, the venture capitalist John Doerr, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, Jack Dorsey, and Gov. Jerry Brown of California, according to the invitation. Lady Gaga and John Legend are scheduled to perform.Presumably, the cancer researchers will also be there.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "When a Feminist Pledges a Sorority", "Date": "2016-04-09", "News": "Supported byIt was a Thursday evening on the Columbia University campus, and a group from the Kappa Alpha Theta sorority was wedged onto couches eating takeout, some seated cross-legged on the floor. Two discussed an introductory Chinese language class. One thanked a sister for passing along her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 for an internship. And then there were a few talking about spring break.She later posted photos from the trip to Facebook: girlfriends with bronzed shoulders, guacamole and a casual shot of her beach read: \u201cThe Grounding of Modern Feminism,\u201d by the Harvard historian Nancy F. Cott.There was a time, not so long ago, when no self-respecting feminist would be caught dead in a sorority. \u201cIn my day? No way in hell!\u201d said Sally Roesch Wagner, a women\u2019s studies scholar at Syracuse University, who graduated in 1969. \u201cSororities represented to me as a feminist what beauty pageants did: women who were caught in the \u2018get pretty, party, get a guy, get married\u2019 syndrome that we were trying to break out of.\u201dIt is puzzling, then, to discover that even amid the debate about campus sexual assault, and the role that Greek life plays in it, sorority enrollment is at a record high.It has left many people baffled. \u201cHonestly, when she first brought it up, my interior reaction was, \u2018Over my dead body!\u2019 That\u2019s how strongly I felt that Greek life was an abomination,\u201d said Susan Ruderman, a 1984 graduate of Harvard College, whose 18-year-old daughter \u2014 in the midst of the college application process \u2014 informed her that she was considering rushing. Ms. Ruderman, who works in philanthropy in Newton, Mass., said her first thought was: \u201cWhere did I go wrong?\u201d \u2014 though she has slowly come around. \u201cFunny how much principles \u2018evolve\u2019 when it comes to the happiness of one\u2019s daughter,\u201d she said.When Amulya Kandikonda, a Barnard sophomore, told her friends back home in Illinois that she was pledging, \u201cThey were like, \u2018You\u2019re not white, you\u2019re not tall and blond,\u2019 \u201d she said. Which was not dissimilar from the experience of her sorority sister, Jennifer Egbebike, whose parents are Nigerian, but who grew up in Miami. \u201cI was very hesitant to join, because I\u2019m not a \u2018typical\u2019 sorority girl,\u201d she said.\u201cWhat I would love to think is that it\u2019s not your mother\u2019s sorority anymore. That it has evolved.\u201d\u201cI grew up in the South, so going to college I never expected to be a part of a sorority because I did think it was antifeminist,\u201d said Blair Wilson, a Columbia sophomore. \u201cBut when I came to school, all the women I looked up to\u2014those involved in student government, in sexual violence response, in different political groups\u2014were involved.\u201d\u201cWe definitely still have to defend ourselves,\u201d said a Barnard sophomore, Ilina Odouard, a neuroscience and behavior major. \u201cBut I almost feel more into feminism after having joined Theta than going to Barnard.\u201d\u201cThis was a time when female students often had to sit in the back of the classroom, when they were often ignored by the male faculty, or addressed as \u2018Mr.,\u2019 even in coed institutions,\u201d Ms. Turk said. \u201cSo I know that that can sound strange to some people, that early sororities acted in feminist manners before feminist was even a word, but these were women who were really trying to expand the boundaries of what was considered O.K. for women to do.\u201dEven at progressive campuses, tradition remains: fines for missing meetings; elaborate rituals; bans on serving alcohol at parties \u2014 putting fraternities in control of social life. And, of course, the barrier to entry: the class issues, the cost; being chosen, or cut, based on no formal criteria.For generations past, perhaps the only way to reconcile that gap would have been to reject the system. To opt out. \u201cTo us, it just seemed like one more way of the white male establishment consolidating its power, and we were having none of it,\u201d said Ms. Houser, the Yale graduate.Ms. Berg said, \u201cPerhaps part of this allure is that women want that network, too.\u201dWhen the women of Columbia\u2019s Theta chapter decided to decorate that mattress, standing front and center at a rally on campus, they made the conscious choice to use the sorority\u2019s motto \u2014 \u201cLeading Women\u201d \u2014 rather than their Greek letters, so as not to cause a stir within their national office.\u201cOne could argue, that as feminists, maybe we should push back, maybe we should be trying to tear down these systems of supposed oppression,\u201d said Annika Reno, a human rights and political science major at Barnard, who gathered recently with a group of sorority women to discuss feminism and Greek life. Hosanna Fuller, a senior majoring in computer science, added: \u201cWhat if the goal was changing how Greek life operates as a whole? Like what are our actual goals? How can we track success?\u201d\u201cIt is an imperfect system for sure,\u201d echoed Jing Qu, a political science and women\u2019s studies major at Columbia. \u201cBut I think our generation is working to change it from the inside.\u201dAn article on April 10 about the rise of sororities on Ivy League campuses misidentified the college affiliation of Blair Wilson, one of the students interviewed. She is a sophomore at Columbia, not Barnard.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Chatbots Reveal About Our Own Shortcomings", "Date": "2016-04-21", "News": "Supported byOn TechnologyEvery so often, an idea comes along that mesmerizes Silicon Valley and convinces the most powerful people there that this innovation will irrevocably alter the course of humankind. Outsize proclamations are made, lavish events are held and millions of dollars in venture money are funneled into young, unproven companies. Right now, that fixation has landed on chatbots, little artificial-intelligence programs that work like personalized assistants.In January, Sam Lessin, an entrepreneur and former Facebook employee who is working on his own chatbot called Fin, wrote a blog post breathlessly declaring the trend \u201ca fundamental shift that is going to change the types of applications that get developed and the style of service development in the Valley.\u201d If prominent investors, executives and entrepreneurs like Lessin are to be believed, the arrival of the chatbot heralds an entirely new phase of computing, one with the potential to overwrite the current app-centric model that smartphones rely on.In late March, Microsoft invited 5,000 developers to San Francisco for an annual conference called Build. A palpable sense of excitement surrounded the event: Microsoft intended to show off its latest achievement, a software tool kit that would allow anyone to use its A.I. platform to create custom chatbots. Though the company is often viewed as a dinosaur, it has introduced some surprisingly sleek products in recent years, and its bot tool kit seemed interesting enough.Over a live stream, I watched Satya Nadella, the chief executive, pacing triumphantly as he talked about the company\u2019s advances in machine learning and language processing. I nodded along as he described a \u201cpersonal digital assistant that knows you, knows about your world,\u201d a bot \u201chelping you with your everyday tasks.\u201d A few minutes later, an executive giddily showed off a chatbot that lets people order pizza via text message, Skype or Slack. The demonstration centered on what Microsoft presumably found most dazzling about the bot: It could be programmed to recognize slang. You can send it a message like \u201csup pizzabot, send a cheese pizza to my crib ASAP,\u201d and a cheese pizza will still arrive at your crib, ASAP.We\u2019ve long been promised a future augmented by intelligent helpers, of the type depicted in movies like \u201cHer\u201d: benevolent digital beings who remove some of the chaos of modern existence by organizing our lives, all the while offering emotional support through chipper encouragement and cute jokes. Sometimes, these helpers turn on us, as in \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey.\u201d Either way, artificial intelligence represents the manifestation of humanity\u2019s biggest hopes and fears for technology. But for now, it can help us order Domino\u2019s in a different window on the same device we would normally use to order Domino\u2019s.Commerce seems to be the primary preoccupation of the booming chatbot universe. There\u2019s Operator, an all-around assistant bot created by a founder of Uber; Assist, which lets people reserve hotels and concert tickets by text; and x.ai, which books appointments. In April, Facebook announced that it was introducing chatbots to its Messenger app, so that the company\u2019s 900 million users can order food and get the news, simply by \u201cchatting\u201d with the bots on their contact list. Like Facebook\u2019s, most of these bots work right inside messaging apps; it\u2019s like texting with a concierge, or if Siri birthed a litter of smarter, faster and nimbler offspring \u2014 ones you can issue orders to silently and who never get tired, or creeped out, by the nature of your requests.Outsourcing work to bots sounds ideal to me. My attitude toward technology is fueled by a desire for efficiency \u2014 and by laziness. In college, while my friends got into D.I.Y. hobbies like woodworking and sewing, I joked that I was ready for the D.I.F.M. \u2014 do-it-for-me \u2014 revolution. And yet for all the hype, none of these bots seem to work that well yet. Over the last few weeks, I\u2019ve played with a handful and have struggled to make much use of them. I recently needed to make a reservation for a work lunch. I fired up Operator to find me a table, and it quickly sent back a pleasant but unhelpful reply \u2014 declining my request, as it didn\u2019t yet have that capability.I also suspected that many chatbots depend on human workers to complete their requests. Mat Honan, the San Francisco bureau chief for BuzzFeed, was able to uncover the logistics behind M \u2014 a chatbot concierge in development by Facebook \u2014 by sending, of all things, a rental parrot to another Bay Area tech reporter. It worked; the parrot arrived. But afterward, Honan made some phone calls and discovered that M\u2019s artificial intelligence was largely a front. M processed the question and passed it along to a human counterpart to finish the job.Similarly, Operator, Magic and Fin all fall back on hybrid bot-human models. Seen this way, chatbots aren\u2019t that different from hiring a worker through a service like TaskRabbit or Handy, but without ever having to acknowledge there\u2019s another human at the other end. As the sheen of A.I. fades, you can see these chatbots for what they really are: a convenient way to hide human labor. It starts to resemble an update on a centuries-old illusion called the Mechanical Turk, a chess-playing device that was said to be automated but was, in fact, powered by a person hidden inside the \u201cmachinery\u201d itself.Even when the services are truly automated, their functions seem secondary to Facebook\u2019s quest for domination. Bots developed in partnership with CNN and The Wall Street Journal can deliver news headlines by Facebook Messenger; Operator and Spring let people shop from within Messenger for clothing and food. Disney built a bot based on the Muppet Miss Piggy that users can talk to if they are bored, and there\u2019s even a version of Zork, an early, text-based video game, that works in there, too. Eventually, Facebook users will be able to use bots to check movie times, bid on eBay items, browse for hotel deals on Expedia, place an order at Burger King and check their bank balances \u2014 all without ever having to exit Messenger.Indeed, it\u2019s hard not to see that as the depressing point of it all: These bots will simply help Facebook and others rope users in as long as possible, like fishermen trawling the open seas with gaping nets. The current slate of chatbots on Facebook look like innovation clipped for the sake of supremacy. The company has been moving in this direction for some time now. Everything from Facebook Live, its new real-time streaming product, to Internet.org, the nonprofit it oversees that seeks to provide Internet access to the developing world, has been accused of harboring the same goal: keeping users on Facebook\u2019s turf.Bots, which promise to make us more godlike, are instead revealing our all-too-human shortcomings and pettiness. This was on full display when Microsoft tried to show off the prowess of its A.I. in March with a chatbot named Tay, a virtual buddy you could talk to on messaging services like GroupMe and Twitter. Almost immediately, the demonstration turned into a public-relations nightmare as online pranksters taught Tay to mimic hate speech (e.g., \u201cHitler was right I hate the Jews\u201d; \u201cI [expletive] hate feminists and they should all die and burn in hell\u201d). Tay\u2019s rants weren\u2019t the intended work of Microsoft, obviously, but the meltdown revealed an uncomfortable truth: A bot, like any other piece of software, is only as good as its makers\u2019 imagination. Technologies embody the values \u2014 and the biases and prejudices \u2014 of the society that incubates them, and if we can\u2019t imagine the future we want, then neither can our creations.Jenna Wortham is a staff writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}

Trump met Monday at Trump Tower with select members of a recently formed \u201cdiversity coalition,\u201d the brainchild of his company\u2019s adviser, Michael Cohen, who called on longstanding relationships with some black pastors to form a group to rebut questions about Mr. Trump\u2019s attitudes about race.Mr. Trump has been criticized repeatedly for racially and ethnically charged remarks, including his call for a temporary moratorium on Muslim immigrants entering the country and for building a wall along the border with Mexico.Darrell Scott, a pastor from Ohio, said that he and Mr. Cohen, whom he called \u201cmy brother from another mother,\u201d worked to build a group of people \u201crepresenting our individual unique communities.\u201d \u201cThe subject came up between us of our disdain for the mischaracterization of Mr. Trump as some bigoted, xenophobic, racist demagogue.\u201d \u201cRidiculous!\u201d one woman at the front of the crowd said of such claims.On hand was Omarosa Manigault, an original star of the television show \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d who helped herd the group into a cheering squad in the lobby of Trump Tower. She passed out \u201cpledge\u201d cards that the campaign paid for to collect signatures from people in attendance, although she later insisted the meeting had nothing to do with the Trump campaign. There was confusion around the meeting, which was expected to draw about 40 people and mushroomed into more than 100. They all started at the Trump Bar on the ground floor of the building, and were then shepherded downstairs by the Secret Service, where they were screened for weapons before they went down the escalators. They gathered by the waterfall where Mr. Trump delivered his original campaign kickoff speech in June. But no one was entirely sure of what was coming next. Reporters jostled with attendees to get closer to Mr. Trump and his allies. Eventually, just before 1 p.m., Mr. Trump came downstairs and gave a short speech. \u201cThis was going to be a very small little meeting with a few people, and it ended up being a big monster meeting,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cYou look at the other folks running, they couldn\u2019t care less about New York. We care about New York, a lot,\u201d Mr. Trump added. Then he turned and started to leave and one reporter called out, \u201cMr. Trump, will you please come talk to us about this meeting!\u201d But back upstairs he went, leaving assorted members of the diversity coalition, or those who just showed up to support Mr. Trump, lingering in the lower lobby. Two women began to harmonize the song, \u201cI\u2019ll Fly Away,\u201d taking advantage of the acoustics of the marble walls. Others stood by the elevator bank, uncertain as to whether Mr. Trump would come back down. A French radio reporter interviewed Kenny Lee, a singer who recorded a song about Mr. Trump, who came up by bus from Tennessee for the New York primary on Tuesday. But Mr. Trump didn\u2019t come back. Mr. Scott acknowledged that the shuffle of the group from one place to another had disrupted the flow of the event. The \u201cescalator fiasco\u201d had consumed time, he added. But were people left wanting more after waiting so long for a meeting? \u201cThey\u2019re not frustrated,\u201d Mr. Scott said. \u201cThey were in the room with him.\u201d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Ask Well: Does Taking Fewer Than 5,000 Steps a Day Make You Sedentary?", "Date": "2016-04-01", "News": "Reader Question \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 621 votesYour simple question requires a surprisingly complicated answer, because steps, by definition, cannot be sedentary. Walking is a physical activity, whether you take two steps in a day or 20,000. So sedentary status cannot be defined by how many or few daily steps you manage. It depends, instead, on how much you lounge.\u00e2\u0080\u009cPhysical activity and sedentary behavior are best considered as distinct behaviors,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Russell Pate, a professor of exercise science at the Arnold School of Public Health at the University of South Carolina in Columbia.Physical activity involves movement, including standing and strolling. Sedentary behavior, on the other hand, \u00e2\u0080\u009cincludes activities that involve little or no movement,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Pate said, \u00e2\u0080\u009csuch as sitting at a computer, lying on the couch, driving, etc.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBecause the two ways of spending time are so different, someone can exercise regularly \u00e2\u0080\u009cand still engage in a great deal of sedentary behavior,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Pate said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I believe that such a pattern is quite common in our current society.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn other words, you can take 5,000 steps in a day or 10,000, meaning that you would cover either about 2.5 or 5 miles. But in both cases, if you concentrate those steps into a single session of exercise and then spend the rest of your waking hours slumped in a desk chair or in front of a television, you will be more sedentary than active.Ideally, activity monitors would goose you to avoid being sedentary. But many of today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s monitors are better at tracking and encouraging physical activity \u00e2\u0080\u0094 by, for instance, counting the number of steps you take and setting step goals \u00e2\u0080\u0094 than they are at identifying and warning you about over-sitting, Dr. Pate said.So if your activity tracker concentrates on step counts, with 5,000 as its minimum goal, then by all means, reach that total and more. But also try to stand up frequently throughout the day, so that you are both physically active and not sedentary.Related:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "\u2018Periods for Pence\u2019 Campaign Targets Indiana Governor Over Abortion Law", "Date": "2016-04-07", "News": "Supported byThe protesters often post with the hashtag #periodsforpence and mix anatomical details with a touch of humor.The campaign is an attempt to shock and shake up the state capital, but it has also drawn attention from outside the state to the new abortion law \u2014 in particular a requirement that miscarried or aborted fetuses be cremated or interred.Anti-abortion groups praised the law, but abortion providers and women\u2019s groups denounced it as unduly burdensome and far more comprehensive than in many other states. Other states have enacted some of the same provisions, but have often done so piecemeal rather than in a single bill.On Thursday, the Indiana branches of Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union filed a federal lawsuit seeking to block the legislation.\u201cYou should really let him know, since he\u2019s so concerned,\u201d says an early post from the page\u2019s anonymous creator, who identifies herself only as an Indiana woman. \u201cIt will only take a few minutes of your day, but it lets them face an undue and unjust burden, for a change!\u201dThe page\u2019s creator takes particular issue with the requirement that miscarried fetuses be interred or cremated, noting that \u201cfertilized eggs can be expelled during a woman\u2019s period without a woman even knowing\u201d she is pregnant.\u201cI would certainly hate for any of my fellow Hoosier women to be at risk of penalty if they do not \u2018properly dispose\u2019 of this or report it,\u201d the post says. \u201cJust to cover our bases, perhaps we should make sure to contact Governor Pence\u2019s office to report our periods.\u201dMore than 32,000 people had liked that Facebook page as of Thursday, and an associated Twitter account had more than 1,600 followers. Though some Facebook commenters have defended the new law, scores of others have snarkily described their calls to Mr. Pence\u2019s office or detailed their periods.The bill passed both chambers of the Republican-controlled Indiana General Assembly with significant majorities, and Mr. Pence called it a \u201ccomprehensive pro-life measure that affirms the value of all human life.\u201dThe bill signing was met with praise from prominent anti-abortion groups in the state, including Indiana Right to Life, which retweeted some backers of the law who thanked Mr. Pence for his decision.That episode was particularly damaging to Mr. Pence, who had been discussed as a possible presidential candidate but who managed to infuriate both political opponents and members of his own party with his handling of the bill.Mr. Pence is up for re-election this year, and many expect the race to be close. His spokeswoman, Kara Brooks, did not respond to a request for comment about the latest social media backlash.Despite the onslaught of critiques, Mr. Pence\u2019s own Twitter account has remained active, though he has not mentioned abortion in recent days.

{"Headline": "Why Parental Leave Policies Are Changing", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported byHere, three reporters for The New York Times \u2014 Jodi Kantor, an enterprise reporter who has written about gender, politics and the workplace; Noam Scheiber, a labor reporter based in Washington, D.C., and Mr. Fuller, the San Francisco bureau chief \u2014 discuss their views on new family leave laws in California, New York and corporate America and what they might augur in terms of national policy.First up, Jodi Kantor.Dear Noam and Thomas,Here\u2019s a mashup of what I used to hear, as a reporter and parent, about the prospects for ever having state-mandated parental leave in the United States:Paid family leave may be desperately needed, but it\u2019s a political pipe dream. Democrats are unwilling to fight for it. The business world will never go for it. The United States just has terminally shoddy parental leave policies. (Cue dirgelike music and new parents giving longing glances to countries like Sweden, which grants 480 days of paid leave.)But now \u2014 every day \u2014 the statements above are becoming a little less true.To be clear, we\u2019re not talking about the arms race in the corporate and technology worlds to provide deluxe doses of paid parental leave \u2014 like the whole year that white-collar workers receive at Netflix. Those are voluntary corporate policies. We\u2019re discussing laws that will cover far more people: if you\u2019re a supermarket checkout clerk in Albany, your employer will for the first time be legally required to give you paid leave.So why is this finally happening now, and so fast? The push for paid parental leave has no clear leader. Aside from some long-dedicated activists and White House support, there\u2019s barely an organized movement at all. This isn\u2019t like the gay marriage effort, with a well-planned multiyear strategy and deep-pocketed financiers.One answer is demographics. Nearly 70 percent of mothers with children under 18 now work, according to the Labor Department. More than three-quarters of single mothers are sole breadwinners. The need for paid leave is more urgent and desperate than ever before.Another reason: generally speaking, workers are going to pay for the leave themselves, through small paycheck deductions similar to those taken out for familiar government programs like Medicare and Social Security. Most of the new programs are funded by tiny contributions, a dollar or two a week, that will be collected by the employer and paid out to the employee when the leave is taken. This is why opposition is pretty low \u2014 the government isn\u2019t footing the bill, and aside from possibly hiring temporary help to fill in for employees on leave, neither are businesses. The San Francisco law is an exception, requiring larger employers to fill in workers\u2019 paychecks beyond what the state-run system contributes.So, for the first time in United States history, we can start to see what a system of state-mandated parental leave might look like, beyond postpartum disability pay. By Swedish standards, it would still look like a messy patchwork, with wild swings in coverage depending on where you live and work, and plenty of gaps and exclusions. But we\u2019ve never had much of a system at all, so this is still a huge shift \u2014 especially since every one of the new laws covers paternity leave for men.Dear Jodi,I completely agree: the quick succession of the New York and San Francisco measures suggests we\u2019re on the verge of something big here. And the \u201cwhy now?\u201d question really does loom large.In fairness, there have been some well-organized efforts to build political momentum around this issue over the years. The Working Families Party, which was founded in New York in 1998 to pull Democrats to the left on economics, has made a concerted effort to elevate the issue since 2007, and the party is now active in a dozen states. The community organizing that party leaders and activists did back then \u2014 and the polling they consulted \u2014 identified paid leave as a cause that would excite both low-income and middle-class workers, especially women.That said, the movement seems more dispersed, organic, and generally leaderless than the effort to advance marriage equality, as you point out. So we can\u2019t chalk it all up to a vast left-wing conspiracy.I\u2019d argue that economics is a big part of the story. In particular, and maybe a bit paradoxically, I think we\u2019re seeing the result of a tight labor market for those near the top, coupled with wage stagnation and downward mobility in the middle and at the bottom.And why were hourly workers so exercised about this? Again, economics. In the middle and bottom of the income spectrum, you have a generation\u2019s worth of stagnating and even declining real wages (except for a brief period in the mid-to-late 1990s), making it more and more necessary for middle- and working-class households to send two earners into the work force. But with two adults at work and the family dependent on both of their incomes, it\u2019s extremely difficult to take time off to care for a baby or a parent.As the Working Families Party likes to put it, the manufacturing worker who once made $20 or $30 an hour could support his whole family on that income, making it possible for his wife to raise the children or care for a parent.Now that he and his wife both have to work at Wal-Mart \u2014 and still bring home less money combined than he once did alone \u2014 they\u2019re out of luck when that baby arrives.Long story short, when workers who are struggling thanks in part to the lack of paid leave see more affluent workers getting heaping portions of it, it\u2019s no surprise that they start to demand something similar. Consider it a uniquely American form of consciousness-raising.And Thomas FullerDear Noam and Jodi,Greetings from San Francisco! I suppose it\u2019s not that surprising that this was the first city in the United States to roll out fully paid parental leave. San Francisco is so proudly liberal that the label \u201cRepublican\u201d is a throw-down-the-gloves insult to some here.The vote on Tuesday in the board of supervisors was unanimous, and one of the supervisors talked about putting the city \u201con the level of European social democracies that have more forward-thinking policies.\u201d So there you have it, America in 2016: a socialist is winning primaries in the presidential race, and San Francisco is talking about emulating European welfare states.There was opposition to the parental leave measure, but it seemed to me quite muted. The city\u2019s Small Business Commission opposed it during the drafting process but didn\u2019t seem very enthusiastic in speaking out against it. The commission\u2019s executive director didn\u2019t return my call or email.Outside City Hall on Tuesday, the sponsor of the parental leave measure, Supervisor Scott Wiener, had organized some speeches by supporters. But inside the beautiful wood-paneled board of supervisors meeting room, everything was businesslike. The ordinance passed in an almost matter-of-fact, procedural way. One of the supervisors, David Campos, said he was disappointed the measure wasn\u2019t going to take effect faster \u2014 it\u2019s being phased in according to how many employees a company has and will be fully in force in January, 2018.I was interested to learn how the measure came about: a member of Mr. Wiener\u2019s staff is having a baby and looked into parental leave provisions across the country\u2026and a few months later an ordinance was born.Readers, can you tell us how this model will benefit you, or would have benefited you had it existed in the past? Is it enough or do you want more?Advertisement"}

Trump, the leading Republican candidate, came under fire for saying that abortion should be banned and that women who have abortions should be punished. He later backtracked, saying that doctors who perform abortions should be punished. Then he said that the current laws should not be changed.A longtime advocate of abortion rights, Mrs. Clinton is often criticized by anti-abortion groups. In this case, however, she frustrated some abortion rights supporters who said that her characterization of the unborn as a person shamed women who choose to terminate a pregnancy.Abortion opponents also seized on the remark as evidence of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s hypocrisy, arguing that if a fetus can be considered a person then it should have constitutional protections.Rebecca Kiessling, the spokeswoman for the Personhood Alliance, which opposes abortion, said that defining fetuses as persons should mean that they are entitled to a right to life under the 14th Amendment. She considered Mrs. Clinton\u2019s comment to be a \u201cbig gaffe\u201d from the abortion rights perspective.\u201cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interesting that Hillary has now recognized the unborn as person and that she wants to deny them equal protection,\u201d Ms. Kiessling said. \u201cYou can\u2019t have it both ways.\u201dMrs. Clinton\u2019s use of the word \u201cperson\u201d was also seen as a rhetorical victory by those who\u00c2\u00a0oppose abortion and a sign that the debate was shifting in their favor.\u201cI was actually pretty surprised, because usually when you hear her talk it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about the fetus,\u201d said Tina Whittington, executive vice president of Students for Life. \u201cTo acknowledge it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a human person, a human child, to us it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s huge.\u201dThe Clinton campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "In This Snapchat Campaign, Election News Is Big and Then It\u2019s Gone", "Date": "2016-04-24", "News": "Supported byMediatorFor so long, media advancements affected the speed of news. But speed has more or less topped out with Twitter. What\u2019s faster than seconds? (Please don\u2019t say we need to get it to nanoseconds.) Snapchat represents a change to something else: the longevity of news, how durably it keeps in our brain cells and our servers.That is the opposite of the approach taken by The New York Times and other traditional news organizations that are reporting history for the record. Snapchat is recording the here and the now, playing for today. Tomorrow will bring something new that renders today obsolete. It\u2019s a digital Tibetan sand painting made in the image of the millennial mind.The older generations are getting there, too, as daily adult media consumption has expanded beyond television, radio and newspapers to include all the innovations I mentioned above: email, websites, Facebook, Twitter, text messaging, Instagram, Periscope and now Snapchat.It was into this media hurricane that the presidential campaign caravan drove this year, and many of its cars were blown off the road.Experienced strategists and their candidates, who could always work through their election plans methodically \u2014 promoting their candidacies one foot in front of the other, adjusting here and there for the unexpected \u2014 suddenly found that they couldn\u2019t operate the way they always did.Marco Rubio\u2019s campaign marched into the election season ready to fight the usual news-cycle-by-news-cycle skirmishes. It was surprised to learn that, lo and behold, \u201cThere was no news cycle \u2014 everything was one big fire hose,\u201d Alex Conant, a senior Rubio strategist, told me. \u201cNews was constantly breaking and at the end of the day hardly anything mattered. Things would happen; 24 hours later, everyone was talking about something else.\u201dWhich brings me to the good news for presidential candidates. In this \u201chit refresh\u201d political culture, damaging news does not have to stick around for long, either. The next development, good or bad, replaces it almost immediately. This is arguably the best time in modern history to have a scandal. (Note to ethically compromised pols: If you have an embarrassing piece of video that is bound to get out, give it exclusively to Snapchat, then destroy it.) At the very least, it is the best time to be Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump has mastered this era of short attention spans in politics by realizing that if you\u2019re the one regularly feeding the stream, you can forever move past your latest trouble, and hasten the mass amnesia.Fred Hiatt, The Post\u2019s editorial page editor, told me in an email that given \u201cthe constantly churning news cycle,\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s trail of incendiary statements and proposals \u201cmay seem like news from another era.\u201d He added, \u201cIt\u2019s important that they not be forgotten.\u201dWhen I ran all of this by the good people at Snapchat they bristled at my choice of symbolism, understandably. Peter Hamby, Snapchat\u2019s head of news, said Snapchat should not be \u201can emblem for a lack of attention span in our politics.\u201dWith a unique line to younger voters, Snapchat presents substantive stories on issues like the election and the Flint water crisis in ways they can relate to, Mr. Hamby said. Snapchat\u2019s reports are ephemeral, he said, because \u201cit\u2019s about being in the moment\u201d with this young audience, being in the flow of their lives.Of course, that\u2019s where that audience lives, in the moment. Still, as the media habits of the young drive everybody else\u2019s, I\u2019m reminded of that old saw about those who forget history. Now, what was I saying?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Click Effect", "Date": "2016-04-16", "News": "Supported byOp-DocsI\u2019ve long been interested in the capacity of storytelling and journalism to transport an audience. Shooting my first documentary in North Africa 35 years ago, I used multiple projectors and screens to create an immersive experience. The approach at the time was experimental and while I moved on to more traditional storytelling in features, television and documentaries, I always held on to the idea of using immersive environments to transport viewers and allow them to experience an expanded vision of the world.Then last year I visited the virtual reality lab at Stanford, which is at the fore of contemporary immersive journalism. I realized that V.R. had the potential to become a powerful new form of storytelling, and the medium has been evolving faster than anyone had ever expected.They surrounded the divers and started clicking \u2014 they seemed to be saying hello.

I had never forgotten my first open water dive in the Caribbean with my father when I was 17 and the transcendent experience of being suspended 30 feet beneath the surface, midway between the boat above us and the white sand of the ocean floor below. Now my son has become a free diver and as I recently watched him dive silently, on a single breath, his body elongated with outsize fins, unencumbered by tanks, regulators and the noise of escaping bubbles, I saw what James so eloquently described in his book \u2014 a human being interacting with the ocean and marine life in a manner few people can ever experience.\u201cThe Click Effect\u201d is our attempt to create a virtual experience that is equal parts impressionistic and journalistic.

But we do know what to do about one big part of the divide: the information disconnect.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn New York, they know about Harvard, Yale, N.Y.U. and CUNY,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Justine Rosenthal, Hennings\u00e2\u0080\u0099s college adviser at Gateway. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOther private schools have funny names and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never heard of them if you weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t raised in that culture. They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what any of it means.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Some of her students had never heard of the SUNY colleges.\u00e2\u0080\u009cMost of them hit ninth grade thinking, \u00e2\u0080\u0098It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not for me,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Caren Birchwood-Taylor, Gateway\u00e2\u0080\u0099s principal. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe price tag is shocking.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Most are unaware that top colleges give top financial aid packages. For needy students, elite schools can end up cheaper than SUNY, and sometimes cheaper than CUNY. At some elite private schools, the cost to very poor students is near zero.Many students also don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s free money out there. More than a quarter of high-achieving poor students never fill out the Fafsa, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid. The Common Application for college waives its fees for poor students. But 84 percent of high-achieving students with family incomes under $20,000 don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t apply for a waiver.The College Advising Corps is just one of many programs that demonstrate the value of narrowing the information gap. It works with universities in 14 states to hire and train recent college graduates and place them in a high school for two years. The majority of the advisers are first-generation college-goers, almost peers to the students they advise. One is Rosenthal, although she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not first-generation.The program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overall impact on college enrollment is not large \u00e2\u0080\u0094 about a three percentage point rise. But its influence over what kinds of schools students choose may be greater. Aileen Moner, program director of the New York University College Advising Corps, said that high schools in New York City with the program have seen a 30 percent to 40 percent increase in students considering, applying to and attending four-year schools.Those students also stay in college at higher rates than the national average. One reason is that they get more financial aid, and lack of money is the major reason students drop out.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd sending people to the right place is a persistence strategy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Hurd. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMatching actually works.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gateway, where virtually no students have parents who went to college in America, was one of four small schools created five years ago as the giant Jamaica High School was being phased out for poor performance.Rosenthal arrived in 2014, just as Gateway\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first senior class started. The expectation of college was not new \u00e2\u0080\u0094 families hear about it at open house and orientation events even before their children start ninth grade, said Birchwood-Taylor. All ninth graders take the PSAT exam as practice. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe had the structures in place, the college office,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Birchwood-Taylor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe had the guidance counselor. But individualized college counseling \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the type people pay thousands of dollars for privately \u00e2\u0080\u0094 this was our goal. Ms. Rosenthal provides that personalization.\u00e2\u0080\u009dRosenthal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office, the outer room of a suite she shares with Dennis Tai, the guidance counselor, is always crowded, its seven computers almost constantly in use (although sometimes by waiting students playing video games).\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Flags from various colleges line the walls \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the Ivies, Rutgers, Purdue, Xavier, Michigan. Signs ask: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWant money for college?\u00e2\u0080\u009d and urge students to fill out the Fafsa form and apply to the New York State Tuition Assistance Program.When I visited, eight students were waiting for her. One was making sure he had sent in his SAT scores. One had a question about a CUNY assessment test. A group of junior boys was looking for colleges where they could play lacrosse. One boy \u00e2\u0080\u009cjust doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like his fifth-period class,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.She sat with the boy who wanted to set up a CUNY assessment.

She coached him through what he would say. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWant to act it out?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.Hennings is African-American, tall, with glasses. He said Rosenthal has walked him through every step of applying for college. He joined one of the SAT tutoring groups she set up; about 15 kids met twice a week to study. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe concentrate on verbal \u00e2\u0080\u0094 here kids do much better on math,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Rosenthal. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you come at least six times you get a pizza party.Read previous contributions to this series.And, Hennings said, he met alone with Rosenthal about 30 times. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe helped me decide on going, decide what I wanted to do, write the essay, fill out forms about scholarships and financial aid,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe has my mom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s number and stays in contact with me and my mom.\u00e2\u0080\u009d His mother came in several times to fill out financial aid forms with Rosenthal. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe gave us a list of schools that fit our grade point average and SAT scores,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.Hennings went on one of her many trips to visit a college \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to Fordham, in the Bronx. He hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t yet visited Buffalo.

(Another important resource poor kids have less of is college-going peers.)Rosenthal drops into classrooms regularly to talk about college and financial aid.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 She puts up posters around the school. One displays rappers who went to college. Another is titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cImportant People Who Went to CUNY\u00e2\u0080\u009d and lists Jerry Seinfeld, Colin Powell, Andrew Grove and \u00e2\u0080\u009cMimi \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Ms. Rosenthal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grandmother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d among other notables.Last year 100 percent of graduating students were accepted to college, 73 percent to a four-year school. And all graduates who qualified financially filled out the Fafsa.\u00c2\u00a0Students went to, among other colleges, Yale, M.I.T, Vassar, Rensselaer Polytechnic, Colgate, Skidmore, N.Y.U., Brandeis, Wesleyan and Wheaton, along with SUNY and CUNY schools. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too early to know about acceptances this year, but more than 70 percent of students\u00e2\u0080\u0099 applications were to competitive schools, including 116 private schools.While these ideas are scalable, they also require students to seek them out \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and the students who most need them are least likely to know how to do so, or even to believe the information is for them.Andrea Soonachan, the senior director of college and career planning in the New York City schools, said that about 75 percent of high schools have sent at least one person to take the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s six-day course on college counseling. But while training can increase skills and knowledge, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help increase the most precious resource: a counselor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time.Which to choose? All of them. All the models have advantages and disadvantages, but with more investment, together they could form a patchwork quilt covering a lot of students. The number of initiatives is heartening. There have been early visionaries \u00e2\u0080\u0094 J.B. Schramm started College Summit 20 years ago, for example \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but in large part this problem got no widespread attention until the recent research quantifying the yawning dimensions of the college gap. Now the challenge is to reach a million kids a year.Next week: A look at progress \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and more often, the lack of progress \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0 made by colleges in admitting low-income students.More From Fixes \u00bbMore From Private Lives \u00bbMore From Couch \u00bbMore From The Stone \u00bbMore From Moviegoers \u00bbMore From The End \u00bbMore From Draft \u00bbMore From Anxiety \u00bbMore From Menagerie \u00bbMore From Disunion \u00bbMore From Bedside \u00bbMore From The Conversation \u00bbMore From The Great Divide \u00bbMore From Errol Morris \u00bbFollowAdvertisement"}

His telephone number was mysteriously disseminated across the Internet.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was done exactly according to the rules,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. House said, denying claims of underhanded or manipulative tactics. For Colorado Republicans the backlash came as something of a surprise because the party decided last August to do away with its presidential straw poll. After the Republican National Committee decided that the outcome of state straw polls would have to result in bound delegates, the state party decided that it would be too risky to use that kind of system because of potential problems counting that many ballots without state resources.Colorado had a presidential primary election as recently as 2000 but abandoned it because of the costs. The state Republicans held straw polls in 2008 and 2012, but the results were not binding. State Democrats have kept their straw poll.Mr. House acknowledged that there are a lot of deeply entrenched players within the party who think the system works well and believe that those who are the most politically engaged should determine who becomes the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presidential nominee.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I tried to get rid of the caucus, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d string me up,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. House said.Until now voters have not made a huge deal about the current system. However, Mr. House expects that the ferocity of the criticism that Colorado is facing will push state legislators to make changes before 2020.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey have not asked for a presidential primary to be put back in play in a way that got their elected officials to do something about it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. House said, explaining that Colorado voters have the ultimate say in determining the system.In the meantime, the Colorado Republican Party is weathering the blowback. Mr. House said that he was investigating how an official Twitter account was hacked by someone who tweeted #NeverTrump. And, for now, he has no plans to change his cellphone number.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "What Hulk Hogan\u2019s Gawker Lawsuit Means for Our Privacy", "Date": "2016-04-04", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorHULK HOGAN\u2019S lawsuit against Gawker Media, heard in a Florida courtroom last month, had the surreal quality of, well, a professional wrestling match. Mr. Hogan sued the company after Gawker posted a video clip showing the wrestler having sex with the then-wife of his then-friend, the radio personality Bubba the Love Sponge.The amount of damages awarded to Mr. Hogan in the trial \u2014 a total of $140 million \u2014 implies that the excesses of digital media might be causing a backlash. (Gawker has said that it will appeal.) While the balance between privacy and press freedom is typically tipped to the latter in the United States, Amy Gajda, a law professor and author of \u201cThe First Amendment Bubble,\u201d argued in Slate that recent court cases suggested \u201cthat these jurors may not be alone in giving new deference to privacy concerns.\u201dWhat we really need are more nuanced laws that can safeguard privacy in the digital age. Courts in the United States have held that public figures are less entitled to privacy than the rest of us. But the Hogan case became less about who\u2019s a public figure and more about the ways in which the Internet has allowed our private information to be made public in ways we didn\u2019t intend. For all its absurdity, the fight over Hulk Hogan\u2019s sex tape became a fun-house mirror reflection of the issues that affect all of us.Gawker defended the news value of the video, claiming that Mr. Hogan had lost his right to privacy because he was a celebrity and had already boasted for years about his sex life \u201con talk radio and shows like Howard Stern,\u201d Nick Denton, Gawker\u2019s founder, wrote on the company\u2019s website after the verdict. Mr. Hogan, whose real name is Terry Bollea, countered that there was a firm line between the man and the alter ego he plays.\u201cTerry Bollea\u2019s a normal person,\u201d he said, while Hulk Hogan is a crude character who bragged about his sex life \u2014 truthfully and otherwise \u2014 in ways Mr. Bollea never would. That response evoked snickers on social media, but the idea that a person may divulge some information in one context but not another is at the heart of modern privacy theory.In his landmark 1967 book \u201cPrivacy and Freedom,\u201d Alan Westin defined privacy as \u201cthe claim of individuals, groups or institutions to determine for themselves when, how and to what extent information about them is communicated to others.\u201dFor example, many people will readily share shopping information with online retailers, but wouldn\u2019t share that same information with family or friends. No one would argue that companies are entitled to the full details of their employees\u2019 mental health records. And of course, there are private photos intended for one specific person that are not meant to be shared with anyone else.Mr. Bollea\u2019s claim that Hulk Hogan is a character he plays in certain contexts is an unusual reassertion of that right. \u201cWestin\u2019s vision of privacy is that you could control your information as it left you,\u201d says J. Trevor Hughes, chief executive of the International Association of Privacy Professionals. \u201cBut now, on the Internet, that control is increasingly out of our hands.\u201dMr. Westin\u2019s ideas have had a huge influence in Europe, where privacy laws are much more robust. In the United States, his ideas have been more limited by the First Amendment, which tries to balance privacy and press freedoms. It\u2019s no secret where Mr. Denton stands. He founded Gawker precisely because he thought powerful people had too much control over their own stories.But just as the Internet has made it easier to become a publisher, it has also become much easier for ordinary people to suddenly become public figures. Mr. Denton himself said, talking about people who posted on Facebook, \u201cto the extent that they are published and they are viewed, they become some sort of public figure.\u201d That makes public figures of more than 1.5 billion people, who might be shocked to find themselves described that way.Every day, we see examples of otherwise private people who are held up for embarrassment, public shaming or ridicule, when a confidential comment or personal information is broadcast around the world (many of Gawker\u2019s targets over the years have been far less famous and far less eager for attention than Mr. Hogan). True, very few of us have sex tapes widely released. Fewer still have a friend whose legal name is Bubba the Love Sponge. But aren\u2019t we all just one airplane screaming match, ill-advised Facebook post or recklessly shared photo from becoming an online story ourselves?However unusual Mr. Hogan\u2019s circumstances, his essential complaint is one that many of us share in and one that our laws haven\u2019t addressed: How do we control our information in the digital age? Under cross-examination in court, Mr. Bollea admitted that, as Hulk Hogan, he had lied about his sexual endowment. Celebrities, as the saying goes, are really just like the rest of us.Robert Levine is the author of \u201cFree Ride: How Digital Parasites Are Destroying the Culture Business.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yahoo\u2019s Suitors Uncover Few Financial Details", "Date": "2016-04-14", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 As Yahoo prepares to accept first-round bids for its core Internet business on Monday, potential buyers have found themselves facing one big problem: How do you value a company with a declining business when the company appears reluctant to share vital financial details?But several big companies are expected to place bids for Yahoo anyway, according to people briefed on the matter. Verizon Communications, which has publicly expressed interest in buying Yahoo\u2019s core Internet business and merging it with its AOL division, plans to press forward with a bid, some of these people said.The Daily Mail, a British tabloid newspaper and website, said publicly that it had considered joining with potential investors, including one or more private equity firm, for a bid. And the private equity firm TPG plans to make a bid in the first round on its own, according to a person briefed on the matter.Yet other huge companies plan to sit out the bidding. Google, which competes with Yahoo on search and display advertising and has a search partnership with the company, considered making an offer, but is unlikely to proceed because it fears any deal would draw stiff antitrust scrutiny, according to people briefed on the company\u2019s thinking.Other notable businesses, including AT&T, CBS and the investment firms Silver Lake, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and General Atlantic, are unlikely to bid, according to others briefed on their plans. And SoftBank, the Japanese telecommunications giant that controls Yahoo Japan, does not plan to bid despite press reports to the contrary.A 90-slide presentation shown to potential Yahoo bidders is dense with figures, but even people familiar with the company\u2019s operations have struggled to make sense of them. At the same time, Yahoo devoted just a couple of slides to important strategies, like its costly Hail Mary project to create an entirely new mobile search experience to leapfrog competitors like Google, Apple and Amazon.Representatives of Verizon, Google, AT&T and CBS declined to comment. A Yahoo spokeswoman also declined to comment on the sales process.Marissa Mayer, Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, is expected to face questions about the bidding on Tuesday, when the company reports its latest quarterly earnings. The report should offer a window into how Yahoo is weathering the upheaval caused by the layoff of 15 percent of its work force announced in February. The total value of Yahoo shares is now about $35 billion.The company may also disclose sales of patents and real estate, which it began shopping a couple of months ago in the hope of raising $1 billion to $3 billion.One reason for Yahoo\u2019s reluctance to share information may be that the business is worse than the company has publicly disclosed. That has added to confusion regarding the intentions of a board of directors that, just a few months ago, publicly said it had no intention of selling.Ms. Mayer has often said she wants to make Yahoo services a \u201cdaily habit\u201d for Internet users. But after nearly four years of effort, only about 10 percent of the one billion monthly visitors to Yahoo sites return every day, suggesting little attachment to the brand, according to people who have seen confidential internal data. At Facebook, by comparison, 65 percent of users visit daily.Yahoo is in a difficult position. Ms. Mayer\u2019s four-year turnaround effort has failed to deliver significant improvements at a company that has been in decline for a decade. Ms. Mayer argues that she is turning the tide with new investments in areas like video and native advertising.Activist investors, led by the Starboard Value hedge fund, have run out of patience and are pressing the board to sell the core business, separating it from the company\u2019s far more valuable investment stakes in Alibaba, China\u2019s leading e-commerce company, and Yahoo Japan, a separate, publicly traded company.Yahoo\u2019s board, which spent more than a year working on other plans to separate the investment stakes, reluctantly agreed to explore a sale of all or parts of the company and hired three investment banking firms to run the process. Starboard has formally threatened a proxy fight to replace the entire board at the next shareholder meeting if the directors do not follow through on a sale.Ms. Mayer has publicly laid out a path for an independent Yahoo and made the case to potential bidders that they should retain her as chief to carry out the plan.Abandoning previous forays into video and digital magazines, Ms. Mayer, who formerly headed search at Google, is now focused on returning Yahoo to its glory days as a search engine. Although comScore says that Yahoo is currently the No. 3 player in desktop searches, behind Google and Microsoft, Ms. Mayer argues that Yahoo can leap ahead through a \u201ccomplete reimagination of mobile search.\u201dMs. Mayer has assigned about 1,000 people to search products, or about 10 percent of the company\u2019s staff, according to people briefed on the business. The mobile effort, code-named Project Index, has officially been underway for two years and aims to create a search tool similar to Google Now on Android phones, Apple\u2019s Siri, Microsoft\u2019s Cortana and Amazon\u2019s Alexa.But the team has little to show for its work, and many at Yahoo wonder whether it is a hopeless quest. Industry experts as well as Yahoo insiders say that without the location and personal data that Apple and Google have, Yahoo will have a difficult time predicting what people want with enough accuracy to get them to switch from other services.As Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, Ms. Mayer acquired more than 20 companies, but ultimately struggled to turn around the web pioneer.\u201cThere is a massive opportunity for mobile search,\u201d said Keith Rabois, a partner at Khosla Ventures, who invests in search start-ups. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think Yahoo has the core assets or skills you would need to succeed or thrive right now.\u201dA Yahoo spokesman said that the company was exploring many search ideas, including the use of software bots that would fetch information on behalf of users.Ms. Mayer\u2019s vague plans for reversing Yahoo\u2019s decline, along with the lack of disclosure about the company\u2019s finances, have made prospective bidders nervous.Though several private equity firms have been looking at the company, people involved in the bidding process said that they were unlikely to prevail against a determined corporate buyer.Verizon is viewed by analysts as the leading bidder for Yahoo, but its likely offer comes despite trepidation among its executives, according to the people briefed on the bidding.Verizon is still struggling to digest its $4.4 billion acquisition last year of AOL, and some executives worry that buying Yahoo would simply be doubling down on integration troubles.Verizon could certainly combine the content properties and ad products and networks run by Yahoo and AOL.The company, with more than 112 million cellphone customers on top of its landline Internet subscribers, would have the ability to preinstall Yahoo services and distribute them widely.However, the contracts governing Apple iPhones and phones running Google\u2019s Android operating system generally restrict what phone carriers can do to promote alternatives for major services like search and email. So Yahoo would still need to build products good enough to persuade people to switch.Wall Street is hoping for a quick sale, to anybody, at any reasonable price.\u201cWe continue to believe that one of the greatest risks in the stock is the core being a \u2018melting ice cube,\u2019 as a prolonged sale process draws on, creating questions for employees, advertisers and partners,\u201d wrote Robert Peck, an analyst with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, on Wednesday.Because of an editing error, an article on Friday about Yahoo\u2019s reluctance to share financial details with prospective buyers misstated the amount the company hoped to raise by selling patents and real estate. The amount is $1 billion to $3 billion, not $1 billion to $35 billion.Conor Dougherty contributed reporting from San Francisco, and Emily Steel from New York.Advertisement"}

Since taking over as chief executive of Microsoft in early 2014, Satya Nadella has shown a willingness to collaborate more closely with companies that were once bitter rivals.Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google, was named to that position last August, after a major reorganization that formed a new holding company, Alphabet, to oversee Google and other divisions.Despite the detente between the tech giants, Google still faces powerful adversaries, particularly in Europe where local publishers and telecom operators, among others, remain wary of its powerful role in how people in the 28-member bloc gain access to digital services.Some of those companies have filed complaints that have led to two formal documents of accusations against Google from Europe\u2019s competition authorities.Several American tech companies, including Oracle, Yelp and Expedia, also claim that Google has broken antitrust rules in Europe, the United States and elsewhere.At Microsoft, the previous target of multiple European regulatory investigations, the focus has shifted in the last 18 months from attacking Google to lobbying over privacy regulation \u2014 important rules that underpin its fast-growing cloud computing business.Microsoft has been a vocal supporter of Europe\u2019s tough privacy rules \u2014 often positioning itself in contrast to Google and Facebook \u2014 repeatedly highlighting how it has complied with the region\u2019s strict stance on data protection to a greater degree than its rivals.Nick Wingfield reported from Seattle and Mark Scott from Rome.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Do You Change Voters\u2019 Minds? Have a Conversation", "Date": "2016-04-07", "News": "FeatureGoing door to door, a Los Angeles-based activist group tries to reduce prejudice against transgender people. A new study finds that it works.Supported byDave Fleischer \u2014 a short, bald, gay, Jewish 61-year-old with bulging biceps and a distaste for prejudice \u2014 knocked on the front door of a modest home in a middle-class neighborhood on the west side of Los Angeles. It was an enthusiastic knuckle-thump, the kind that arouses suspicion from dogs in yards halfway down the block but, crucially, can also be heard by humans watching cable news at high volume.If he had his way, Fleischer would knock on doors with a golf ball. \u201cThat\u2019s what the Mormons use,\u201d he said on this sunny, bird-chirping Saturday in February. Fleischer\u2019s staff at the Los Angeles-based Leadership Lab \u2014 which goes door to door to reduce bias against L.G.B.T. people, with a current focus on transgender discrimination \u2014 didn\u2019t take to the golf-ball suggestion, but Fleischer wanted me to know that he is \u201cnot opposed to stealing a good idea from the Mormons.\u201dA gray-haired Hispanic woman named Nancy cracked open the front door, though not enough to let her little dog eat our ankles. \u201cWe\u2019re out talking to voters about an important issue \u2014 \u201d Fleischer began, only to have Nancy excuse herself and walk away. I wasn\u2019t sure she would return; the last two voters he\u2019d met pleaded busyness. But after shooing the dog into another room, Nancy appeared in her doorway again. She smiled shyly and asked Fleischer, the Leadership Lab\u2019s director, how she could help him. Had he been completely honest, he might have said, \u201cI\u2019m here to make you less prejudiced. It could take awhile.\u201d But instead he began with a simple question: If she were to vote on whether to \u201cinclude gay and transgender people in nondiscrimination laws,\u201d would she be in favor or opposed?\u201cIn favor,\u201d she assured him. Fleischer asked her to rate that support on a scale from zero to 10. \u201cA 10,\u201d she said. \u201cI have friends who are gay.\u201dA typical canvassing conversation might have ended there. Nancy, it seemed, was a supporter \u2014 no need to worry about her. But Fleischer is wary of what he calls the \u201canti-discrimination declaration.\u201d At the Leadership Lab\u2019s two-hour pre-canvass training that morning, volunteers were warned about \u201cfake 10s,\u201d people who think of themselves as against discrimination \u2014 many of them Democrats \u2014 but who can nonetheless be swayed by emotion-based appeals that provoke prejudice and fear.At the door, Fleischer asked Nancy if she knew any transgender people. She didn\u2019t. He then did something few political consultants would advise: He introduced her to the opposition\u2019s favorite argument. He handed her a small video player, on which she watched a Baptist minister in Houston make the case about bathrooms. Fleischer then returned to his scale, asking Nancy what number felt right for her now. \u201cI know I\u2019m in favor of gays, because I\u2019ve worked with them and socialized with them,\u201d she said. \u201cI think they\u2019re wonderful. But for transgenders? Give me a five.\u201dNancy wasn\u2019t the only person to significantly decrease her support after watching the video. Across the street, a man in his late 30s who said he was liberal and pro-L.G.B.T.-rights moved to a five from an eight, explaining that he was deeply worried about \u201cthe bathroom issue.\u201d The man\u2019s concern seemed informed by his experience in a New York City nightclub; he hinted at his discomfort standing at a urinal next to a drag queen. Nancy had no such seemingly relevant personal experiences, nor did she appear particularly concerned about bathroom safety. For her, the video seemed to clarify that Fleischer was specifically asking her about transgender people, a group she had no experience with and seemed to have little inherent empathy for. To get Nancy to a true 10 capable of withstanding opposition messaging, Fleischer needed to help her \u201ctap into her own empathy and connect emotionally to transgender people.\u201dBetsy Levy Paluck, an associate professor at Princeton who studies bias, believes the study will have broad implications for those in her field. \u201cWhat do social scientists know about reducing prejudice in the world? In short, very little,\u201d she writes in the same issue of Science, adding that the new study\u2019s results \u201cstand alone as a rigorous test of this type of prejudice-reduction intervention.\u201dFleischer is planning more interventions. Though he has devoted much of his political and community-organizing career to L.G.B.T. issues, he believes this kind of canvassing could change people\u2019s thinking on everything from abortion and gun rights to race-based prejudice. He also hopes it will usher in a new era of political persuasion. \u201cModern political campaigns have focused mostly on communicating with people who already agree with them and turning them out to vote,\u201d Fleischer says. \u201cBut what we\u2019ve learned by having real, in-depth conversations with people is that a broad swath of voters are actually open to changing their mind. And that\u2019s exciting, because it offers the possibility that we could get past the current paralysis on a wide variety of controversial issues.\u201dThe idea grew out of Fleischer\u2019s own experience as a \u201cJewish, liberal gay kid\u201d in Chillicothe, Ohio. He likes to say that he has been talking to people who disagree with him since he was 4. \u201cIf I would have only talked to people who agreed with me, I would have only talked to my mom and dad,\u201d he told me. \u201cInteracting with people different than me was a normal thing, and certainly not undesirable or scary. It\u2019s almost the opposite of growing up today in the age of Facebook and political polarization, where it\u2019s easy to always be among like-minded people, your self-isolation complete before you have your first beer.\u201dAt first, Fleischer and his team tried cerebral arguments and appeals to fairness in their doorway conversations with same-sex-marriage opponents who didn\u2019t express deep religious objections. \u201cThat failed miserably,\u201d he said. Eventually, the canvassers tried eliciting more emotional experiences. They urged voters to talk about anyone they knew who was gay or lesbian \u2014 and, more important, to speak about their own marriages. \u201cThat changed everything,\u201d Fleischer told me. \u201cMost people consider marriage the most important and meaningful thing they ever did. Talking about marriage brought up deep emotion. If marriage was the most valuable thing in their own life, wouldn\u2019t they also want their gay friends \u2014 or gay people \u2014 to experience it, too?\u201dThough Fleischer thought his new approach was working, he wanted to know whether the persuasion lasted. During a 2013 trip to New York City, he visited the Columbia Univer\u00adsity political-science professor Donald Green, whose experiments on voter behavior \u2014 including his findings that canvassing is a more effective mobilization tool than telephone calls or direct mail \u2014 partly inspired a focus on building a ground game, a strategy mastered by the Obama campaign.Green was skeptical that the canvassers were as persuasive as they thought they were. His previous research suggested that \u201cpeople don\u2019t change their mind very easily, and when they are persuaded to think differently, the effect is usually temporary,\u201d he told me. But he also knew that political persuasion had not been studied often. \u201cRemarkably, we don\u2019t know very much about what forms of campaign communications are most persuasive,\u201d he said. Green connected Fleischer with Michael LaCour, then a U.C.L.A. graduate student in political science and statistics, who said he could design a study to assess the long-term effectiveness of Leadership Lab canvassers at increasing support for same-sex marriage among voters in Los Angeles who had supported Prop 8. LaCour, joined late in the process by Green as a co-author, published the results in the December 2014 issue of Science. The study claimed to find that though both gay and straight canvassers were effective at the door, only voters contacted by gay canvassers remained persuaded nearly a year later.The study made international news and seemed to confirm what many gays and lesbians believed in their guts: that knowing a gay person is a powerful antidote to anti-gay bias. It also seemed to bolster the \u201ccontact hypothesis\u201d theory of prejudice reduction, which finds that personal contact decreases bias against a minority group. Previous research, though, including a study of teenagers in an Outward Bound program assigned to either mixed-race or all-white groups, suggested that lasting prejudice reduction happened after weeks of regular contact. LaCour appeared to be breaking new ground, showing that one brief but memorable interaction could reduce prejudice.Broockman and Kalla were intrigued by LaCour\u2019s findings and hoped to replicate it for an experiment measuring the Leadership Lab\u2019s transgender canvassing. But the more they analyzed LaCour\u2019s study design and results, the more problems they found. Yes, Leadership Lab volunteers had spoken to voters in Los Angeles about gay marriage. But when pressed, LaCour couldn\u2019t produce any evidence that he had conducted the follow-up surveys of voters that would have been essential to measuring canvassing\u2019s long-term influence. He also admitted to lying about having received funds for his study from several organizations, including the Ford Foundation.A shocked and embarrassed Green requested that Science retract the study; soon after, Princeton rescinded a teaching offer to LaCour. News of the retraction stunned Fleischer, who worried that the Leadership Lab\u2019s marriage canvassing would be tainted by association. He vowed to keep at it, but soon there was no need. When the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage nationwide in 2015, Fleischer and his team could turn their focus to the next L.G.B.T. battlefield: transgender rights.To test whether transphobia could be overcome during a face-to-face encounter, Broockman and Kalla measured a 2015 canvassing effort in Miami by volunteers from the Leadership Lab and SAVE, a local L.G.B.T. organization. The groups feared a backlash against a recent ordinance that prohibited discrimination based on gender identity. The experiment divided voters into a \u201ctreatment\u201d group engaged in a conversation intended to reduce transgender prejudice and a \u201cplacebo\u201d group targeted with a conversation about recycling. Before the canvass conversations, both groups completed what they believed to be an unrelated online survey with dozens of social and political questions, including some designed to measure transgender prejudice. After the canvass, the groups filled out four follow-up surveys, up to three months later.Broockman and Kalla found that the treatment group was \u201cconsiderably more accepting of transgender people\u201d and that a single, approximately 10-minute conversation with a stranger \u201ccan markedly reduce prejudice for at least three months.\u201d Unlike LaCour\u2019s invented finding that the messenger matters more than the message, Broockman and Kalla found that both transgender and nontransgender canvassers were effective. \u201cIt\u2019s too bad that the takeaway was that only gay people could persuade people about gay marriage,\u201d Broockman says about LaCour\u2019s retracted study. \u201cEveryone basically ignored the canvassing aspect, and that the message and the quality of the conversation at the door is what seems to matter.\u201dBroockman and Kalla point to Leadership Lab canvassers\u2019 ability to engage voters in two prejudice-reduction behaviors at the door: \u201cperspective taking\u201d (the ability to empathize with another\u2019s experience) and \u201cactive processing\u201d (deep or effortful thinking). Both were on display during many of the canvass conversations I observed, including the one with Nancy, the woman who moved to a five from a 10 after watching the opposition video.\u201cIs this the first time you\u2019ve thought about transgender people?\u201d Fleischer asked her soon after she backtracked.\u201cYeah, I would say so,\u201d she said. \u201cI know it exists, and I hear stories, and I see them on TV. But I don\u2019t have any friends like I do my gay friends.\u201dFleischer nodded and removed a picture of his friend Jackson from his wallet. \u201cFor me, I never had a transgender friend I was really close to until I was 56,\u201d he said, handing Nancy the picture. \u201cJackson grew up as a girl, but he knew even when he was 5 or 6 that he was really a boy. It was only in his 20s that he started to tell his folks the truth, and he started making the transition to living as a man. He\u2019s married to a woman now, and he\u2019s so much happier. And he can grow a better beard than I can!\u201dNancy laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing \u2014 they\u2019re happier when they come out, whenever everybody knows,\u201d she said. She seemed to be connecting Jackson\u2019s experience to that of her gay friends.\u201cRight, because otherwise you have the biggest secret in the world, and everyone thinks something about you that\u2019s not true,\u201d Fleischer said, before pivoting to a story about Jackson\u2019s being demeaned by a waiter in a restaurant. \u201cI don\u2019t like seeing people mistreat Jackson. To me, protecting transgender people with these laws is just affirming that they\u2019re human.\u201d Fleischer then steered the conversation to Nancy\u2019s experiences with discrimination. \u201cYou\u2019ve probably had a time when people have judged you unfairly?\u201d he asked.\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Nancy said. Over the next few minutes, she recounted several instances of racism after moving to Los Angeles from Central America with her husband. Still, she didn\u2019t appear emotional in retelling the experiences. Fleischer wasn\u2019t surprised; people rarely feel safe enough at first to express deep hurt. It usually isn\u2019t until Fleischer opens up about his own experience \u2014 including feeling different in his small, conservative Ohio town \u2014 that voters feel safe to \u201cget vulnerable, too,\u201d he says. Nancy had mostly dismissed Fleischer\u2019s \u201chow did that make you feel?\u201d questions, but his personal story prompted a shift. As Fleischer returned to the discrimination she had faced, Nancy paused and said, \u201cIt felt terrible.\u201d A few minutes later, when he asked her if she saw a connection between \u201cyour experience and how you want to treat transgender people,\u201d she said she did. \u201cI see transgender people as the same as I see myself,\u201d Nancy told him. She ended a solid 10, a rating he was confident could survive opposition messaging.Knocking on a stranger\u2019s door is scary, and a lot of that morning\u2019s training session was spent boosting the confidence of first-time canvassers. The leaders worked to keep the mood relaxed and optimistic. Fleischer does improv in his spare time, and the training sometimes felt like a well-oiled comedy routine. When the subject turned to potentially awkward initial encounters with voters, the Leadership Lab staff member Laura Gardiner and the longtime volunteer Nancy Williams (who is transgender) did some front-door role-playing.\u201cHi, my name is Laura, and I\u2019m with the Leadership Lab,\u201d Gardiner told Williams, channeling a shy first-time canvasser. \u201cDo you have a few minutes today to talk about transgender people?\u201dWilliams played a busy voter. \u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to teach my hamster to speak Finnish today.\u201dGardiner turned to the volunteers. \u201cWe want to avoid asking for permission,\u201d she told them. \u201cJust dive in. Treat it like the most normal thing in the world. Like, of course we\u2019re on your doorstep on a Saturday talking about transgender issues!\u201dMoments later, Williams reminded the volunteers to be open and nonjudgmental. \u201cWe\u2019re asking voters not to discriminate, to be less prejudiced, and we need to walk that walk,\u201d she said. \u201cThat means not making assumptions based on the voter\u2019s age, race or their religion. Some folks may have a crucifix on the door. That doesn\u2019t tell you about the person inside.\u201dOn this particular day, volunteers would be canvassing in a predominantly black neighborhood, so Gardiner reminded them to be sensitive to experiences of race-based discrimination. \u201cWhat an African-American person has faced because of their race is not the same as the discrimination that I\u2019ve faced for being bisexual, or that my friend has faced for being transgender,\u201d she told the group. \u201cBut there is a similarity, because at the root there\u2019s the feeling of being judged, of having someone make assumptions about you, and that does not feel good.\u201dBut sometimes the gulf between the volunteer and the voter can seem insurmountable. After the first canvass I attended, the Leadership Lab project manager Ella Barrett seemed uncharacteristically sullen. When I asked how her day went, she shook her head and recounted a series of disheartening conversations with voters she couldn\u2019t persuade. In one, a social worker (\u201ca social worker!\u201d Barrett marveled) announced that being transgender is a mental illness; in another, a man matter-of-factly said he hoped to develop a \u201cstraight pill\u201d to change gay people.Though not all voters would engage emotionally, I was surprised by how many did. Canvassers often had to politely extricate themselves after 20 minutes \u2014 voters were sad to see them go. \u201cIf only I could have 10 minutes with Ted Cruz,\u201d Fleischer said once. He was only half joking. Fleischer has an unwavering confidence in his ability to persuade most people to be \u201cmore empathetic and less prejudiced,\u201d and his optimism is shared by progressive groups who train with him. The day before one canvass, representatives from an animal rights group told me they hoped to better understand how to help people connect emotionally to animal welfare.Fleischer is especially interested in learning whether deep canvassing can affect people\u2019s thinking on two issues \u2014 racial prejudice and abortion rights. Beginning in 2014, the Leadership Lab teamed up with Planned Parenthood to canvass in support of pro-choice policies. Though the abortion debate is less obviously rooted in prejudice than transgender discrimination, Fleischer and his canvassers noticed that many voters reacted negatively to a short video of a middle-aged woman recounting having an abortion when she was 22. People would often be \u201cvery judgmental\u201d of the woman on the video or any woman who had had an abortion, Fleischer said. To combat that, canvassers tried to get voters to reflect about challenging decisions they had made in their own sex lives or relationships \u2014 or times they were judged harshly. Volunteers also encouraged people to talk about anyone they were close to who had an abortion.Eager to know if his abortion canvassing was persuasive, Fleischer asked Broockman and Kalla to measure it. But the researchers found that the persuasion attempts had \u201czero effect,\u201d Broockman said. Still, Fleischer isn\u2019t ready to give up. \u201cBecause abortion is such a politically polarized issue,\u201d he said, \u201cit could just be that we have to get better at making voters trust us and open up.\u201d But it could also be that the Leadership Lab\u2019s transgender canvassing success is an anomaly. While a discussion of transgender rights can trigger deeply ingrained feelings about sex and gender roles, the issue is also a fairly recent political consideration for many people. Melissa Michelson, a political-science professor at Menlo College in Atherton, Calif., who studies voter mobilization and public attitudes on L.G.B.T. issues, told me that changing people\u2019s minds about transgender rights might simply come down to \u201cwhich side gets to a voter\u2019s door first to do the persuading.\u201dJeremy Bird, a Hillary Clinton adviser who was the national field director for Obama\u2019s 2012 re-election effort, told me that his team conducted a number of experiments to try to have a greater impact when canvassing. \u201cWe studied everything, from the kinds of conversations we should be having to the characteristics that made a voter persuadable,\u201d he says. \u201cWe trained our volunteers to connect with voters at the door on a personal and values level, not to talk at them with scripted talking points. I think people don\u2019t talk enough about the focus on persuasion we had, because the story line became, \u2018Oh, they won because turnout was so high.\u2019\u2009\u201dBecky Bond, a Bernie Sanders campaign adviser and an admirer of the Leadership Lab\u2019s work, says that the Sanders campaign has focused on marshaling the enthusiasm of volunteers to persuade people. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a campaign that\u2019s put more volunteers on the ground in a primary season to have quality, face-to-face conversations with voters,\u201d she told me.Still, the Leadership Lab is unusual in its focus on quality over quantity. A typical state or national campaign, even one with a ground-game focus, doesn\u2019t want its volunteers spending 10 or 15 minutes at a door. \u201cIf you\u2019re talking about having real, quality conversations with voters, you can\u2019t bring that to scale without a really large number of people,\u201d says Tim Saler, a Republican strategist at Grassroots Targeting, which works to mobilize and persuade voters. \u201cTechnology has helped a bit with the scale challenge, but there\u2019s always the question: Do you knock on as many doors as possible, or do you knock on fewer doors and have potentially more fruitful interactions?\u201dThere\u2019s also a lot that can go wrong when fresh-faced canvassers descend on unfamiliar neighborhoods. In 2004, for example, some 3,500 orange-hat-wearing Howard Dean supporters (many bused in from around the country) managed to annoy Iowa voters days before the state\u2019s Democratic caucus. \u201cThe curse of the orange hats,\u201d read a headline in Salon. There are other potential problems. \u201cCanvassers can get mugged, they can get lost, they can get attacked by wild geese,\u201d Michelson told me. \u201cYou don\u2019t know if they\u2019re at McDonald\u2019s on their iPhone, and you can\u2019t always be sure what they\u2019re saying to voters. That lack of control scares campaigns. It\u2019s much easier to put all your volunteers in a cozy phone bank where everyone gets to hang out and eat pizza.\u201dThough Fleischer prefers talking to voters face to face, he isn\u2019t opposed to sequestering volunteers in a phone bank to help L.G.B.T. activists in another state. In 2014, Fleischer and his team modified their canvassing work to persuade and mobilize voters by phone. Leadership Lab volunteers spoke with 3,330 residents in Pocatello, Idaho, a small, heavily Mormon city facing a ballot referendum that would have reversed a local nondiscrimination ordinance protecting gay and transgender people. The effort helped defeat the anti-L.G.B.T. ballot measure by a mere 80 votes.Several of Riley\u2019s conversations proved poignant. She told voters about her own transgender child, Jie, now an adult. She recounted that when Jie was 3, the toddler responded to a question about possible Christmas presents by asking: \u201cCould Santa turn a girl into a boy?\u201dRiley\u2019s devotion to Jie had a visible impact on several voters, including the mother of a 7-year-old girl. The woman eventually told Riley that she had voted against gay marriage in California, but that she now regretted that choice. \u201cI made a mistake,\u201d she said. On the issue of transgender rights, the woman seemed mostly supportive but stopped at a nine. She said she was trying to evolve on the issue, though. As Riley prepared to leave for the next house on the block, the woman called out. \u201cGive me a few years, and I know I\u2019ll be a 10!\u201dBenoit Denizet-Lewis is a contributing writer for the magazine and an assistant professor at Emerson College.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Anti-Gay Laws Bring Backlash in Mississippi and North Carolina", "Date": "2016-04-05", "News": "Supported byDURHAM, N.C. \u2014 The divide between social conservatives and diversity-minded corporations widened Tuesday with developments in Mississippi and North Carolina related to the rights of gay, lesbian bisexual and transgender people in both states.The measure signed by Gov. Phil Bryant of Mississippi allows churches, religious charities and privately held businesses to decline services to people if doing so would violate their religious beliefs on marriage and gender. Gov. Nathan Deal of Georgia, under pressure from business interests, two weeks ago vetoed a similar bill passed by the State Legislature.PayPal said it had dropped plans to put in global operations center in Charlotte, N.C., because of the state\u2019s recent passage of a law banning anti-discrimination protections based on sexual orientation and requiring transgender people in government buildings and public schools to use bathrooms that match the gender on their birth certificates. PayPal had pledged to bring 400 jobs and invest $3.6 million in the area by the end of 2017.The developments in Republican-controlled states reflected growing fissures between business interests and social conservatives, whose alliance has played a central role in the Republican coalition. Similar disputes have erupted in Indiana, Arkansas and other Republican-controlled states since the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage last year.The divide played out with particular force a year ago in Indiana after a national outcry over its adoption of what was billed as a religious liberty bill. After an uproar that included questions about whether Indianapolis should host the men\u2019s Final Four tournament, Indiana weakened the law somewhat. But that dispute and a continuing fight over whether the state should adopt anti-discrimination protections may have cost Indiana a dozen conferences and $60 million, a state visitors bureau estimated.The dispute was also a wake-up call, said Mark Fisher, the vice president of Indy Chamber, an Indianapolis business coalition. \u201cWe had opposed the law, but we didn\u2019t imagine the extent of the outcry,\u201d he said.In Mississippi, objections have been raised by companies such as Tyson Foods, MGM Resorts International, Nissan and Toyota, all of which are major employers in the state.But the biggest backlash has come in North Carolina, a deeply divided state with conservative, Republican-dominated rural areas and suburbs vying for influence with tech-savvy, Democratic-leaning urban centers like Charlotte and the Research Triangle area of Durham, Raleigh and Chapel Hill.With its announcement, PayPal became the first major company to announce it was pulling out of an existing project, saying that \u201cbecoming an employer in North Carolina, where members of our teams will not have equal rights under the law, is simply untenable.\u201dPayPal\u2019s president and chief executive, Dan Schulman, said that if the state repealed the law, \u201cwe will reconsider our decision.\u201d\u201cBut obviously there\u2019s a time frame,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are now in the process of talking to a number of other states.\u201dPayPal had already joined more than 120 other business leaders in signing a letter to Mr. McCrory objecting to the law.Some, like Google Ventures\u2019 chief executive, Bill Maris, pledged not to make any new investments in the state until the law was repealed. Other signatories included Apple, Facebook and Charlotte-based Bank of America, the largest corporation in North Carolina. Mayors and governors of other states, including New York, Vermont and Washington, have banned most state-sponsored travel there.Asked about PayPal\u2019s decision at a news conference on Tuesday, Mr. McCrory said, \u201cI respect disagreement.\u201dOpponents of the North Carolina law said Mr. McCrory\u2019s hand had been forced by more conservative elements of his party.\u201cHe\u2019s a moderate at heart, but he got rolled on this,\u201d said State Senator Jeff Jackson, a Democrat who represents Charlotte. \u201cThe Republicans in the General Assembly have enough votes to override all of his vetoes. His concern in vetoing this is that he would be overridden and his legislative agenda would be punished for even trying to stand firm on this issue.\u201dMr. McCrory also faces a tough re-election fight this fall against the state attorney general, Roy Cooper, who has said that he would not defend the law.Duke Energy, the state\u2019s largest power company \u2014 for which the governor worked, mostly in human relations, for 29 years, including while he was mayor of Charlotte \u2014 has come out strongly in opposition to discrimination against gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people, but has not taken a position on the law itself.The law\u2019s leading proponents, Speaker Tim Moore of the House and the Senate Republican leader, Phil Berger, issued a fiery news release on Tuesday laying blame for PayPal\u2019s pullout at the feet of Charlotte officials, whose anti-discrimination ordinance covering L.G.B.T. people had prompted the statewide action.The legislative leaders, who have framed the issue as an argument over whether access to bathrooms should be governed by gender identity or gender assignment at birth, accused Charlotte\u2019s mayor, Jennifer Roberts, of teaming \u201cup with a convicted child sexual predator to pass a radical bathroom policy allowing men to use girls\u2019 locker rooms and bathrooms.\u201d This was a reference to an L.G.B.T. advocate who resigned months ago as leader of a local gay-rights group because of controversy surrounding a 2000 conviction for committing a \u201clewd act\u201d with a 15-year-old boy while he was a youth minister in South Carolina, when he was 20.\u201cIf Jennifer Roberts, Roy Cooper and the far-left political correctness mob she\u2019s unleashed really care about the economic future of her city, they\u2019ll stop the misinformation campaign immediately and start telling the truth about this common-sense bathroom safety law before more damage is done,\u201d the Republican legislators concluded.Ms. Roberts responded, \u201cI urge the state to take responsibility for its harmful actions and to listen to its business constituency and quickly find a legislative remedy\u201d before more jobs are lost.Other companies reconsidering their business in North Carolina include Lionsgate, which is filming the musical \u201cDirty Dancing\u201d in the state but said in a recent statement that it would be \u201chard pressed to continue our relationship with North Carolina if this regressive law remains on the books.\u201d Braeburn Pharmaceuticals, which had announced plans for a $20 million expansion in Durham, said it was \u201cre-evaluating our options based on the recent, unjust legislation.\u201dThe irony is that the areas hit hardest by the backlash are cities with progressive mayors, including Charlotte. \u201cI think that was part of the political calculation behind this bill: that if North Carolina suffers as a result it will be the parts of the state that don\u2019t support the current Republican majority,\u201d said Mr. Jackson, the state senator.An article on Wednesday about a backlash in the South against anti-gay laws misstated Duke Energy\u2019s position regarding North Carolina\u2019s law banning anti-discrimination protections based on sexual orientation. While Duke came out strongly in opposition to discrimination against gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people, it did not take a position on the law itself.Jonathan M. Katz reported from Durham, and Erik Eckholm from New York.Advertisement"}

I pursued it as far as I could to explore what happened when a patient tries to be a responsible consumer.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe began calling around to hospitals asking the price of various procedures. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe hospitals said \u00e2\u0080\u0098we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know; ask your insurance company.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 The insurance company said \u00e2\u0080\u0098we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know; ask your hospital,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d said deBronkart. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat was when I smelled a great big rat.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAfter many, many calls, he chose his surgery: excision, total price $868. Today he is fine.But his point stands: Health care operates very differently from anything else we buy.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe actual information I needed in order to be an effective, responsible shopper was by policy blocked from me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said in an interview. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just a matter of lowering costs. It blocks innovation. Somebody does a good job \u00e2\u0080\u0094 better quality, better price \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no way for people to discover them.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThere is practically nothing that we shop for the same way we did 15 years ago. We compare prices online, look at quality ratings and reviews, and read about the experiences of others. We have endless information.Except in health care. Most of us still buy it blind. We do as our doctor directs \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and pray that our portion of the bill will be reasonable. We have very little information about quality and almost none about price. (In contrast to virtually every other field, price and quality are not related in health care.) And we find out the cost afterward.This is a problem for patients with high deductibles, like deBronkart. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a huge problem for the country.This is just starting to happen.But it will be a long time before deBronkart succeeds in getting hospitals to compete for his business, a la LendingTree\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen banks compete, you win!\u00e2\u0080\u009dBut reviews of doctors are not the same as reviews of restaurants, where customer experience is everything. In health care, wait times and bedside manner tell us little about the important stuff: Are doctors and facilities good at making and keeping patients healthy and safe?Most shopping experiences don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t transfer to our current system of health care. Health care is just different. Price and quality are decoupled. The same procedure with the same doctor costs thousands more in a hospital than at an ambulatory surgical center. Even in one facility costs vary widely, depending on the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s insurance. And, of course, prices aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t set by the market. Hospitals can charge $53 for a pair of gloves or $500 for a Tylenol because the chances are good that patients will never know \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and besides, they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t compete on the basis of price.There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another way in which health care is profoundly different from other goods and services, and that might be harder to solve than transparency. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what economists call the principal-agent problem: The party making the buying decisions isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the one footing the bill. Even if all prices were published, many insured patients would still not shop around, because they aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t paying. (Not directly, anyway. Indirectly, we all pay.)Combined with price secrecy and a fee-for-service model \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which gives providers incentive to do more tests and procedures \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the system is perfectly designed to produce unnecessary health care for the highest possible price.Read previous contributions to this series.One way to get patients to care is through cost-sharing: co-insurance that charges the patient, say, 20 percent of the cost of the surgery, or very high deductibles. Boy, do you shop when you have a high deductible. But boy, do you also skip necessary health care.Are there ways to get patients to seek out low-cost health care without sticking them with a big bill? We do this with prescription drugs. Insurers vary the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s co-pay by cost. The cheaper the drug, the less the patient pays.Reference pricing is a new, promising strategy. Before reference pricing, CalPERS, California\u00e2\u0080\u0099s giant public-employee retirement system, sometimes paid $12,000 for a joint replacement \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and sometimes it paid $75,000. The top price it paid for arthroscopic knee surgery was 14 times the lowest price.In 2010 CalPERS worked with its insurer, WellPoint (now called Anthem), to set a reimbursement limit. They chose a price near the median \u00e2\u0080\u0094$1,500 for a colonoscopy, $2,000 for cataract surgery, $6,000 for arthroscopy and $30,000 for a joint replacement. Now if you need a knee replacement, you can go anywhere \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more than $30,000, you pay the difference.Anthem now cites CalPERS\u00e2\u0080\u0099 results when it talks to other clients. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a relatively new program, but as I meet with our major Fortune 500 and large local accounts, this idea has momentum,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Brian Griffin, executive vice president of commercial and specialty business for Anthem. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt will become part of the standard plan design as an option.\u00e2\u0080\u009dA third way to control costs without burdening patients is to reward them for choosing lower-price care. The most advanced program is SmartShopper, which works with employers based in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Florida, Indiana and Kentucky, and is adding more states.With SmartShopper, a patient types in a procedure and city or zip code \u00e2\u0080\u0094 half of users prefer making a phone call instead \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and gets a list of providers and facilities that meet quality standards, ranked by price. If he buys the cheapest M.R.I., he will get a $150 check in the mail in a few days \u00e2\u0080\u0094 automatically, with no forms necessary. A somewhat pricier M.R.I. might bring a $75 check.SmartShopper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Graybill said one woman switched her monthly infusion of Remicade, a medicine for Crohn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disease and rheumatoid arthritis, from a hospital to an infusion center. Her price dropped from $22,000 per month to $3,500.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 She earned $6,000 in incentives in one year \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and her employer saved over $200,000.Mitch Rothschild, Vitals\u00e2\u0080\u0099 chairman, said that SmartShopper takes 15 to 20 percent of the savings, on average. He said that patients don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to switch doctors, just facilities. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t touch the human side,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really about the building.\u201dHospitals, predictably, are not happy. (Main said that Blue Cross in North Carolina also encountered \u00e2\u0080\u009ca large backlash from providers\u00e2\u0080\u009d when it published prices.)\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut certain providers love it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Graybill. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the point of being a lower-cost provider if no one shops based on cost?\u00e2\u0080\u009dMore From Fixes \u00bbMore From Private Lives \u00bbMore From Couch \u00bbMore From The Stone \u00bbMore From Moviegoers \u00bbMore From The End \u00bbMore From Draft \u00bbMore From Anxiety \u00bbMore From Menagerie \u00bbMore From Disunion \u00bbMore From Bedside \u00bbMore From The Conversation \u00bbMore From The Great Divide \u00bbMore From Errol Morris \u00bbFollowAdvertisement"}

Just stop everything else that you\u2019re doing.Mute your music. Turn off your television. Put down your sandwich and ignore that text message. While you\u2019re at it, put your phone away entirely. (Unless you\u2019re reading this on your phone. In which case, don\u2019t. But the other rules still apply.)Just read.You are now monotasking.Maybe this doesn\u2019t feel like a big deal. Doing one thing at a time isn\u2019t a new idea.So, in layman\u2019s terms, by doing more you\u2019re getting less done.But monotasking, also referred to as single-tasking or unitasking, isn\u2019t just about getting things done.Not the same as mindfulness, which focuses on emotional awareness, monotasking is a 21st-century term for what your high school English teacher probably just called \u201cpaying attention.\u201dMs. Zomorodi prefers the term \u201csingle-tasking\u201d: \u201c \u2018Monotasking\u2019 seemed boring to me. It sounds like \u2018monotonous.\u2019 \u201dKelly McGonigal, a psychologist, lecturer at Stanford and the author of \u201cThe Willpower Instinct,\u201d believes that monotasking is \u201csomething that needs to be practiced.\u201d She said: \u201cIt\u2019s an important ability and a form of self-awareness as opposed to a cognitive limitation.\u201dThis is great news for the self-identified monotaskers out there.Jon Pack, a 42-year-old photographer in Brooklyn, was happy to hear that his single-minded manner might be undergoing a rebrand. \u201cWhen I was looking for jobs and interviewing, they\u2019d always want me to say, \u2018I\u2019m a great multitasker,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cAnd I wouldn\u2019t. My inability to multitask was seen as a negative. Now I can just say, \u2018I am a monotasker. I am someone who works best when I focus on one thing at a time.\u2019 \u201dAnd the way we work can have effects that kick in long after we clock out.The term \u201cbrain dead\u201d suddenly takes on a whole new meaning.A good sign you\u2019ve task-switched yourself into a stupor: mindlessly scrolling Facebook at the end of the night or, as in Ms. Zomorodi\u2019s case, looking at couches on Pinterest. \u201cI just stuff my brain full of them because I can\u2019t manage to do anything else,\u201d she said. \u201cThe sad thing is that I don\u2019t get any closer to deciding which one I like.\u201dBut monotasking can also make work itself more enjoyable.\u201cI can multitask \u2014 and do, of course; it\u2019s kind of essential \u2014 but I prefer to do one thing at a time,\u201d Hayley Phelan, a 28-year-old writer, wrote in an email. \u201cIf I keep looking at my phone or my inbox or various websites, working feels a lot more tortuous. When I\u2019m focused and making progress, work is actually pleasurable.\u201dMs. Phelan isn\u2019t imagining things. \u201cAlmost any experience is improved by paying full attention to it,\u201d Ms. McGonigal said. \u201cAttention is one way your brain decides, \u2018Is this interesting? Is this worthwhile? Is this fun?\u2019 \u201dIt\u2019s the reason television shows we tweet through feel tiresome and books we pick up and put down and pick up again never seem to end. The more we allow ourselves to be distracted from a particular activity, the more we feel the need to be distracted. Paying attention pays dividends.This is why, according to Ms. McGonigal, the ability to monotask might be most valuable in social situations. \u201cResearch shows that just having a phone on the table is sufficiently distracting to reduce empathy and rapport between two people who are in conversation,\u201d she said.Twenty-five thousand people participated in Ms. Zomorodi\u2019s Infomagical project, which started the week with a single-tasking challenge. Upon completion, respondents agreed overwhelmingly that single-tasking was the No. 1 thing they wanted to carry into their post-Infomagical lives. \u201cBut they also said it was really, really hard,\u201d Ms. Zomorodi said.Parents of young children found it difficult for obvious reasons, as did people with jobs that permit them less control over their time. In those cases, try monotasking in areas where you can: conversations with your children, reading a book in bed before they go to sleep, dinner or drinks with friends. After all, monotasking is a good skill to incorporate into all aspects of your life, not just work.Even those with more flexibility can find themselves going to great lengths for a little bit of focus. Nick Pandolfi, who works in partnerships at Google, once traveled to northern Sweden in what he described as an \u201cextreme\u201d effort to monotask.\u201cI had to write my business school application essays, and I was having no luck spending an hour here and there after work and on the weekends,\u201d Mr. Pandolfi said. \u201cI just wasn\u2019t inspired. After spending a few days hiking in the Arctic by myself, I was able to get all of them done in just a few days.\u201dTranscontinental trips aside, Ms. Zomorodi stressed that it was important to find ways to practice. \u201cStart by giving yourself just one morning a week to check in, and remind yourself what it feels like to do one thing at a time,\u201d she said.Mr. Pandolfi and Ms. Phelan use exercise to aid them, albeit in different ways. \u201cIf I need to get through a big project and don\u2019t want to get distracted by my inbox and the minutiae of the web, I hop on the treadmill desk,\u201d Mr. Pandolfi said. Ms. Phelan makes a point of running outside, weekly, \u201cwithout listening to music or anything else.\u201dMonotasking can also be as simple as having a conversation.\u201cPractice how you listen to people,\u201d Ms. McGonigal said. \u201cPut down anything that\u2019s in your hands and turn all of your attentional channels to the person who is talking. You should be looking at them, listening to them, and your body should be turned to them. If you want to see a benefit from monotasking, if you want to have any kind of social rapport or influence on someone, that\u2019s the place to start. That\u2019s where you\u2019ll see the biggest payoff.\u201dSo is monotasking a movement? \u201cIt\u2019s not there yet,\u201d Ms. Zomorodi said. \u201cBut I think it will be.\u201dIf enough people pay attention to it, that is.An earlier version of this article misstated Hayley Phelan\u2019s age.

{"Headline": "Online Media Is Tested When Social Platforms Come to Town", "Date": "2016-04-21", "News": "Supported byBitsFacebook now hosts articles created by outside publishers, as well as videos and live broadcasts. Snapchat, with its Discover product, has created a sort of online media in miniature, with TV, newspaper and magazine companies angling to have a channel on the platform. And, of course, media companies publish constantly to Instagram and Twitter, amassing giant audiences.Mr. Hagiu spoke at length with The New York Times about what changes when a platform comes to town, and what it might mean for online media. The interview was condensed and edited for clarity.Would you define a publication as a multisided marketplace?Yes \u2014 we can say it\u2019s a two-sided platform, if we count the two sides as being the readers on one side and the advertisers on the other. Now, there\u2019s a separate question \u2014 we can talk about the \u201cthird side,\u201d which would be the writers.Something like a Tumblr or Medium \u2014 a place where people can just post? Yes, where there\u2019s clearly a direct interaction, and there\u2019s a lot more control by the two sides \u2014 it\u2019s truly on the platform, not a lot of control exerted by the publication as an aggregator.How would you then describe, in similar terms, what a company like Facebook is \u2014 or a company like Snapchat?Facebook, I always say it\u2019s at least a four-sided platform. They have users, they have advertisers, they have third-party application developers, and then finally they have websites that use the Facebook Connect system \u2014 which is to say that you can log in with your Facebook credentials.Where does a company that is producing professional video or journalism for Facebook \u2014 publishing those directly on Facebook and getting some kind of revenue \u2014 fit in?So, basically they\u2019re adding one extra side, which we can call \u201cpremium content publishers,\u201d broadly. It makes sense, and it\u2019s very similar to the transformation that YouTube has gone through. They went from having pretty much one side \u2014 when they started off, for the first few years, everyone was a user. As a user you could watch videos or post videos. But everyone was the same. Sometimes I watch, sometimes I post; some people just watch, some people just post. But they are all the same users. Now they\u2019ve become a lot more sophisticated, with advertising and revenue sharing, and with professional video producers.If a publication-style business becomes a participant in a marketplace like Facebook, what has changed for it?This has been an ongoing concern. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re an established company, and now there\u2019s a multisided platform in your business, what happens? And say you have to play on that multisided platform, because they\u2019re big and everyone else is playing, so you need to get on top of it. The concern is always commoditization. I think partly it\u2019s true \u2014 what a platform does, to some degree, is introduce a lowest common denominator. In particular, they make the substitution, or the switching cost, between the different players a lot lower. I think that\u2019s undeniable. It\u2019s much easier to switch between, say, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal as a user, and as an advertiser by the way, if those are on top of Facebook.When Amazon emerged as the pre-eminent e-commerce platform, a lot of big companies said, we need to find a way to play with them \u2014 it seems like there\u2019s a lot of e-commerce going on there, and we can\u2019t ignore it, so we need to do something. Toys \u201cR\u201d Us struck a deal that turned out later to be not very advantageous. Initially, it was a good deal for Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, and it gave them access to Amazon\u2019s customers. But afterward what happened was Amazon found ways to take advantage of Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, using the relationship, and its presence on their platform, to start a toy category on Amazon, to figure out how to sell toys on Amazon, and then to invite a lot of competing companies on the same platform to compete with Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, which made it a lot less attractive for them to be there.Essentially, they overlooked the possibility that Amazon would just use them as a way to start a category of toys \u2014 they somehow assumed it would be exclusive, without putting it in the contract. And, obviously, if I\u2019m a platform, of course I don\u2019t want to be exclusive with anyone, right? I mean, that\u2019s the point of a platform. I want to have as much competition between whatever participants as possible.So if we grant some sort of comparison between a publishing partner\u2019s relationship with a large distribution platform and a retailer\u2019s relationship with Amazon, that might sound alarming? How do pre-existing companies typically make the transition from being an independent participant in a particular category to being, basically, a platform constituent? That\u2019s a broad question, but \u2014 is there an industry that might have useful parallels to the media industry with something like a major social platform?I don\u2019t think it\u2019s true that transitioning from independence to life on a platform necessarily has to make things worse. One thing that I think a lot about \u2014 in conversations with venture capitalists and others \u2014 is the notion that platforms or marketplaces inherently commoditize. I think more likely what\u2019s happening is the following: I think platforms, or marketplaces, make it a lot easier for, say, the content providers or app developers that are very, very good to rise to the top, and pretty much commoditize everyone else. So if you\u2019re average, it\u2019s definitely going to be very bad. Life is going to be worse on a platform, because you\u2019re exposed to more competition. If you\u2019re very good, life on a platform is a lot better.It\u2019s a little bit like, if you ask drivers how they rate their driving ability, you know, 80 percent say they\u2019re above average. The important qualifier to what I said earlier, about how the best rise to the top, is that, inherently, the platforms force a lot more specialization than before. Previously, in the independent world, players were able to afford to be a little bit broader. I think the problem is, now, you really have to think very deeply, a lot more carefully \u2014 what, exactly, are the one or two things we\u2019re really good at, and focus on those. So there\u2019s going to be a lot of forced specialization, because on a platform, competition will be vertical by vertical.In a case like Facebook, the content was largely there before \u2014 in the form of links.It makes perfect sense, right, to bring more of that content inside, because they can increase engagement.Things load faster, it\u2019s a better experience, and posts and videos are created with Facebook in mind, which means they might feel better inside the platform.Yes, and they want to do as much as possible \u2014 ideally, for them, they want to get as much content as they can to increase readership. There\u2019s probably a function between the well-being of the platform and the quality of the content that they have.This is harder \u2014 for video games, right now, the large game developers are nonexclusive. They used to be more exclusive, and I think this has decreased over time \u2014 it\u2019s become very hard to convince, say, Electronic Arts to give up the Xbox One market to work with the PlayStation. So that has definitely played against the platforms. Game platforms always try to buy or produce their own games for differentiation, but it\u2019s very hard.A different example, the other way, is online video \u2014 Netflix and Amazon. The problem there is very similar. Everyone has, basically, the same movies by now. So this has pushed Netflix and Amazon to start producing their own content. If I\u2019m one of the original providers \u2014 studios, I guess \u2014 then I\u2019m not happy, because now you have this high-quality production from Netflix and Amazon, who are stealing viewers from you.You take this down to the level of articles and shorter videos, and you have different considerations, no? Especially around exclusivity. I\u2019m trying to imagine any sort of leverage.Well, let\u2019s say the content in question requires a lot less investment. First of all, there\u2019s going to be a lot more competition. It\u2019s very hard to compete with the video game Call of Duty. It\u2019s a lot easier to come up with close substitutes for something that requires a lot less investment. The substitution concern on a platform is a lot higher.The most profound piece of this \u2014 the trend that I find fascinating \u2014 is that every year, people look at this and say, these are the products and services that are right now being transacted on these multisided platforms, but there\u2019s a limit. There\u2019s always higher-level, higher-value products and services that are extremely out of reach. Now we\u2019re saying, oh, there are all these on-demand economy platforms like Taskrabbit, but, surely, this is limited to low-skill labor or things that very easily contractable. The reality is, there will be platforms for pretty much everything \u2014 pretty much any product or service that we can imagine. It\u2019s going to happen.Advertisement"}

Not even in middle school yet, they realize that equality shouldn\u2019t be just for the elite but for everyone, including athletes in the 10-team National Women\u2019s Soccer League.Yet you should have. Both issues are important.\u201cSome of the players in the N.W.S.L. get paid so little that they have to have jobs on the side to support their families, and that\u2019s not right,\u201d said Cheyenne Payne, who turned 11 on Monday and who recited so many details about women\u2019s soccer that I\u2019d swear she studied for my interview.Abigail Cole said it was \u201cjust wrong\u201d that she had to watch N.W.S.L. games streamed on YouTube because the games are rarely televised. Amaya Dalton said it was \u201cjust unfair\u201d that pay for the best men and women was so different.How different? U.S. Soccer pays about $54,000 per national player, on top of national team pay, to compete in the N.W.S.L.; the other N.W.S.L. players earn salaries that range from $7,200 to $39,700 for a season that runs from April to October.\u201cFor the U.S. national team players, getting just a $2,000 bonus would be an insult,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cBut for players like me who don\u2019t make money playing soccer for their country, that $2,000 is a huge help.\u201dHer teammate Ashley Nick, an American who isn\u2019t on the national team, supplements her salary with modeling and babysitting jobs, and she said other players work in coffee shops to make ends meet. Nick is not a stranger to pro sports: Four of her cousins (Casey, Clay, Jake and Kevin Matthews) play or have played in the N.F.L.\u201cIf we\u2019re going to eat at Chipotle together, they\u2019re going to pay for the extra guacamole, if you get my drift,\u201d Nick said. \u201cBut we\u2019re just hustling because we have to. We realize that it\u2019s very much the pioneer days of women\u2019s soccer.\u201dThe pioneer days are advancing slowly. The N.W.S.L., just starting its fourth season, is the third league of its kind in the United States. The previous two leagues folded after three seasons. The main difference now is that U.S. Soccer and the Canadian Soccer Association are helping to bankroll the N.W.S.L. as it tries to gain a foothold. In addition to paying the salaries of their national team players, U.S. Soccer and the C.S.A. cover the league office\u2019s costs, a contribution U.S. Soccer pegged recently at about $10 million over the first three seasons.So yes, it\u2019s good to raise awareness about equal pay for equal work in international soccer. But words alone won\u2019t help close the yawning gap between men and women. The stars and the second-stringers of the N.W.S.L. welcome your support on social media. But what they could really use is your support at the ticket booth and in the stadium shop.Better support from fans would help make the league viable for the long haul, and that might allow it to wean itself from U.S. Soccer\u2019s subsidies. And if U.S. Soccer ever stops bankrolling the league, there will be no justification to have different pay structures for its men\u2019s and women\u2019s national teams.\u201cThe lifeblood of football worldwide is club football and professional leagues,\u201d said Moya Dodd, a member of FIFA\u2019s executive committee. \u201cAnd for the women\u2019s game to grow, these women\u2019s leagues need to develop. It absolutely matters.\u201dSo if you really want to help the cause of the women\u2019s players, try helping the larger cause, too. Crack open your wallet and go to an N.W.S.L. game. Any team. Any game. Just go.There\u2019s often plenty of room. Though its home games are played only about 40 miles outside New York City, Sky Blue has been last in attendance since the league began. The team, which plays in Rutgers University\u2019s soccer stadium and lost to the Spirit, 2-1, in the home opener, had only 2,571 fans in the stands on Sunday.\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t even know this league exists,\u201d Sky Blue forward Natasha Kai said. \u201cSo something\u2019s got to change. We just want to play.\u201dAli Krieger, a defender for the Spirit and the World Cup-winning national team, suggested that the league ramp up its marketing efforts. Put fliers on bus shelters, she said, or in coffee shops, or yell from the rooftops. Another option is for N.W.S.L. owners to join forces with M.L.S. teams, as the clubs in Portland, Houston and Orlando have, and sell soccer as a package deal.But it\u2019s up to the public to make the real difference, to do something more than vent on Twitter and Facebook in support of the cause of equal pay. Cheyenne Payne wants to be a professional soccer player one day, and she is going to need a league to do that.\u201cThe world,\u201d she said Sunday, \u201cjust needs to wake up.\u201dEmail: juliet@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Airbnb Wants Travelers to \u2018Live Like a Local\u2019 With Its App", "Date": "2016-04-19", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The home-sharing app Airbnb is pushing into local reviews and recommendations, putting it increasingly into competition with services like Lonely Planet, Yelp and local tourism websites.The company, based in San Francisco, on Tuesday began offering Guidebooks, a feature that lets those who rent out their homes on Airbnb share information about their neighborhood\u2019s best restaurants, bars and attractions, including local spots that might not be found on travel websites or guides, all in the Airbnb app.Guidebooks\u2019 aim is to let people \u201clive like a local,\u201d Brian Chesky, the chief executive of Airbnb, said in an interview.People who use Airbnb previously had to leave the app to find local event and dining information using search engines, travel websites and local review services. But Airbnb\u2019s new feature means people can now eschew Yelp, Facebook, Google and other sites that have all longed to control the connection between consumers and local businesses.Personalization and matching are important because the Internet gives customers an overwhelming amount of information. \u201cThe importance of matching is even more specific to the travel industry, where people traveling to an entirely new destination are making particularly uninformed choices,\u201d Mr. Chesky said.The app clusters listings by neighborhood, and Guidebooks will characterize each area for people who may prefer a family-friendly neighborhood or one near a central business district to one that is filled with late-night revelers.Some Airbnb hosts, like Paul Schirmer in suburban Cincinnati, say they already provide guests with a binder that includes basics like the Wi-Fi password of their home, along with information on popular local restaurants, parks and shops.Mr. Schirmer said having that sort of information in the Airbnb app could make his listing more attractive because many people like to stay in an Airbnb \u201cto live in a neighborhood, relax, make dinner and not feel pressure to eat out every night.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ask Well: Do Pain Relievers Heal Tendinitis, or Just Ease Pain?", "Date": "2016-04-08", "News": "Reader Question \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 2724 votesNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or Nsaids, such as ibuprofen, are commonly given to blunt the pain and inflammation of tendinitis. But most physicians now believe that tendinitis \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the suffix \u00e2\u0080\u009citis\u00e2\u0080\u009d means inflamed \u00e2\u0080\u0093 is misnamed, since the condition may involve little or no inflammation. In recent years, scientists have examined biopsies from both people and animals with supposed tendinitis and found few if any signs of inflammation in the tendons, the tissues that connect muscles to bones. Immune cells associated with inflammation have not been present, and genes known to cause inflammation have not been active. So today, most researchers prefer the term \u00e2\u0080\u009ctendinopathy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d meaning damaged or degenerating tendon. This distinction matters, because Nsaids are anti-inflammatory drugs. If tendinopathies involve little inflammation, then anti-inflammatory drugs will provide little relief \u00e2\u0080\u0093 though it is possible that Nsaids may blunt pain because they are also potent analgesics.But even then, the benefits of Nsaids seem equivocal. In a recent study of treatments for rotator cuff tendinopathy, scientists reported that Nsaids lessened people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s soreness, but the effects were short-lived and did not improve shoulder function. Perhaps more worrying, animal studies suggest that rather than contributing to healing, Nsaids may actually slow healing.

{"Headline": "A Promise to Favor Republicans for Ohio Jobs Spurs Call for Inquiry", "Date": "2016-04-07", "News": "Supported byDemocratic lawmakers in Ohio called for an investigation into the hiring process at the state Department of Transportation after a politician said in a Facebook post that young Republicans would get preference for summer jobs at the agency, raising questions about cronyism in its hiring.A Republican member of the Marietta City Council, Cindy Oxender, wrote a Facebook post on March 29 that advertised six summer jobs for high school and college students with the Ohio department. Young Republicans who applied would have a leg up, she said.\u201cIt\u2019s good money, good experience, and a very nice r\u00e9sum\u00e9 builder,\u201d she wrote, adding between parentheses, \u201cPreference is given to Republican youth on this!\u201dState Representative Nicholas J. Celebrezze, the assistant minority leader of the Ohio House, and State Representative Michael P. Sheehy, both Democrats, asked the state inspector general, Randall J. Meyer, on Wednesday to open an investigation into how the Transportation Department hires seasonal workers.\u201cEmployment based on political affiliation, when it is not required for the effective performance of a position, is generally prohibited by state and federal Civil Service laws,\u201d they wrote in a letter to the inspector general.In a statement, Mr. Celebrezze said, \u201cAny indication that state job opportunities near Marietta are awarded based on political affiliation is deeply troubling.\u201dMs. Oxender apologized for the post in a statement on Wednesday and said the episode had taught her about the \u201crequirements, limitations and restrictions\u201d placed upon public servants. She also shifted the blame, saying she had not written the post, but had merely shared something that was written by someone else.\u201cI made an error in judgment in sharing a post made by a colleague on my private Facebook page which was a summer job notice, and indicating there might be a political preference in the selection process,\u201d she said.Ms. Oxender did not respond to questions on Wednesday about the identity of that person or what, if any, position he or she occupies in state or local government or the Republican Party.The Department of Transportation denied that beliefs play any role in how young people are hired for summer jobs, a process handled at the local level in each of its 12 districts across the state.When asked if the post written or shared by Ms. Oxender reflected the department\u2019s hiring process, a spokesman, Matt Bruning, replied: \u201cOh God, no. No.\u201dMr. Bruning added that a local politician like Ms. Oxender would not be involved in evaluating candidates or extending a job offer. The department looks at applicants\u2019 qualifications, not their voting records, he said.\u201cI have no idea why she felt she needed to say something about political parties\u2019 being part of the equation because that is not something that we do,\u201d he said. \u201cTo write that there is preferential treatment given to a member of a political party is insane.\u201dMr. Bertram, the city legal director and a former Republican City Council president, denied that political cronyism played any role in how government jobs were given out in Marietta. He said doing so would not be \u201ckosher.\u201dHe called Ms. Oxender\u2019s Facebook post \u201can off-the-cuff statement that was inappropriate that has been blown out of proportion,\u201d but said he had trouble understanding why she would have written or shared it at all.\u201cI don\u2019t think she was trying to be funny,\u201d he said. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand. I think it just comes down to she wasn\u2019t thinking.\u201dCity Council members are not directly involved in the personnel decisions of the Transportation Department, he said, but he added that a local politician could recommend job applicants, \u201cand then they are pushed on to the powers that be\u201d for an interview.Mr Bruning, the department spokesman, agreed that a good word from a City Council member could help an applicant for a summer job, but said that it would have no more weight than the endorsement of a \u201cfriend or acquaintance.\u201d\u201cWe get recommendations all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cShe could recommend a person, but that doesn\u2019t mean we would be obligated to hire them.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Missing Money, a Vicious Attack and Slow Healing for a Charity\u2019s Leader", "Date": "2016-04-28", "News": "Supported byD. Alexandra Dyer felt as though her face were on fire.She put her car into drive, but got only a couple of hundred feet before she had to pull over in searing pain and squeeze her eyes shut.Rescuers arrived as the caustic drain cleaner turned her face purple and dissolved her skin. As recounted later by her lawyer, she then screamed four words that they could not possibly comprehend.\u201cKim Williams did this!\u201dMs. Dyer had just left work on that hot evening last August in Long Island City, Queens. As she approached her car, parked on a deserted stretch of Skillman Avenue, a man she had never seen before was waiting for her.Among those charged is Ms. Williams, 47, the charity\u2019s payroll manager, who is accused of stealing more than $750,000 and orchestrating the attack after Ms. Dyer questioned her about bookkeeping lapses. The defendants, including Ms. Williams, have proclaimed their innocence through their lawyers.A lawyer for Healing Arts, David G. Samuels, declined to comment on Thursday because of the continuing suit.But some staff members had noticed a surge of fiscal irregularities in the past couple of years, Mr. Russo said. Checks were bouncing. The credit cards that Healing Arts used to buy blocks of discount tickets for its clients were being refused.The organization\u2019s debt had ballooned from under $100,000 to over $2.2 million from 2012 to 2015, even as the executive director at the time, J. David Sweeny, cut the staff to 14 employees, from 28, and reduced the rent by moving the charity\u2019s offices from SoHo to Queens.At the heart of Healing Arts\u2019 fiscal operation was Ms. Williams. She had been hired in 2011, through an agency called Professionals for Nonprofits, as a payroll clerk. Under Mr. Sweeny, she enjoyed wide latitude, especially after he got rid of the chief financial officer and did not replace her, Mr. Russo said.Soon, she was effectively running the fiscal operations and had several other accounting employees reporting to her.Ms. Williams, who had an apartment in the Kingsbridge section of the Bronx, seemed to live fairly well for someone who had started out at a yearly salary of $43,000 and had worked her way up to $60,000. She drove a late-model Mercedes, had a second home in Florida and posted about her shopping sprees on Facebook.But the real secret to Ms. Williams\u2019s lifestyle, prosecutors and the police say, was that she stole prodigiously from Healing Arts, cutting checks to dozens of phantom employees and direct-depositing them into accounts controlled by her and her best friend, Pia Louallen.\u201cThat\u2019s how the whole financial thing got to us,\u201d Lt. Alexander Fagiolo, commanding officer of the 108th Precinct detectives, said at a news conference this month.From November 2012 through August 2015, according to prosecutors, Ms. Williams embezzled at least $750,000 \u2014 an average of more than $1,000 per workday. She kept $600,000 and gave the rest to Ms. Louallen, prosecutors said.One longtime board member, Kitty Lunn, said that while she did not suspect that Ms. Williams was raiding the till, she was concerned about the declined credit cards and the checks that did not clear. She urged fellow board members to investigate.In January 2015, the board hired a forensic accountant. His finding after several days of reviewing the books, according to Mr. Russo: \u201cNo improper transactions.\u201dConcerned when her new colleagues told her about the money shortfalls and climbing debt, Ms. Dyer began digging around, Mr. Russo said. When she asked Ms. Williams for access to the accounting system, he said, Ms. Williams repeatedly stonewalled her.On Aug. 17, Ms. Dyer introduced Ms. Williams to a new chief financial officer she planned to hire. His name was Frank Williams (no relation to Ms. Williams) and, Ms. Dyer told her, he was an expert fraud-sniffer who would decipher Healing Arts\u2019 imbalanced books.Ms. Williams suddenly came down with a toothache, Mr. Russo said, and left the office. Later that day, the police said, she bought drain cleaner at a supermarket in Queens with her credit card.She was absent the next day, Aug. 18, claiming that she had to go for a dental procedure. Surveillance video revealed that she had come to the office at 6 a.m. and left with boxes of files, Mr. Russo said.Ms. Williams never returned to work and stopped communicating with Healing Arts.The day after that, on Aug. 19, Ms. Dyer was attacked.She spent the next two months at the burn unit of NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center. But she continued to run Healing Arts from her second day in the hospital, Mr. Russo said, meeting with forensic accountants even though her eyelids were sewn shut, and fielding calls from colleagues.More troubles surfaced, Mr. Russo said. Healing Arts, it turned out, was paying workers\u2019 compensation premiums based on a payroll of $5.5 million, more than the charity\u2019s entire budget. A company ledger showed a discrepancy of $480,000 that was noted simply as a \u201cpayment adjustment.\u201dWhile Ms. Dyer mended, the police and the Queens district attorney\u2019s office labored to piece together the criminal case and tracked Ms. Williams, who was spending time in Florida.In December, Ms. Dyer viewed a photo lineup and identified Jerry Mohammed, a 32-year-old from Troy, N.Y., with a record of drug-dealing convictions, as her assailant. Surveillance video taken the day of the attack shows him getting into a Mercedes belonging to Ms. Louallen, the police said.On April 4, Mr. Mohammed and Ms. Louallen were arrested.Ms. Williams fled, prosecutors said, but at 8:57 p.m. she was arrested behind the wheel of a white 2010 Mercedes E350 at a rest area on the New Jersey Turnpike. She was charged with two counts of first-degree assault, two counts of conspiracy, two counts of grand larceny, weapons possession, falsifying business records and 48 counts of identity theft. She is being held without bail and faces up to 25 years in prison.Mr. Mohammed is charged with assault, conspiracy and weapons possession and also faces up to 25 years. Ms. Louallen is charged with grand larceny and conspiracy and faces up to 15 years.Mr. Mohammed\u2019s lawyer, Michael D. Siff, said on Wednesday that Ms. Dyer had picked someone other than his client at an in-person lineup in Queens on April 12. The district attorney\u2019s office declined to comment.And Healing Arts continues its mission to bring cultural medicine to the sick and the injured. Ms. Dyer knows something of this firsthand.Last September, as Ms. Dyer lay in her hospital bed, a folk singer named Kathy Lord, one of Healing Arts\u2019s contractors, entered the room.\u201cOne day at a time, sweet Jesus,\u201d it goes. \u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019m asking from you. / Just give me the strength / To do every day / What I have to do.\u201dTears ran down Ms. Dyer\u2019s ravaged face.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Recruiting Students Overseas to Fill Seats, Not to Meet Standards", "Date": "2016-04-19", "News": "Supported byBOWLING GREEN, Ky. \u2014 \u201cHurry Up!!!\u201d the online posting said. \u201cSpot Admissions\u201d to Western Kentucky University. Scholarships of up to $17,000 were available, it added. \u201cLetter in one day.\u201d The offer, by a college recruiter based in India, was part of a campaign so enticing that more than 300 students swiftly applied to a college that many had probably never heard of.More than 8,000 miles away, at Western Kentucky, professors were taken by surprise when they learned last fall of the aggressive recruitment effort, sponsored by their international enrollment office. Word began to spread here on campus that a potential flood of graduate students would arrive in the spring 2016 semester.The problem \u2014 or one of them \u2014 was that many of the students did not meet the university\u2019s standards, faculty members said, and administrators acknowledged.Western Kentucky\u2019s deal with the recruiting company, Global Tree Overseas Education Consultants, is a type of arrangement that is becoming more common as a thriving international educational consultancy industry casts a wide net in India and other countries, luring international students to United States colleges struggling to fill seats. The university agreed to pay Global Tree a commission of 15 percent of the first year\u2019s tuition of students who enrolled, or about $2,000 per student.But as colleges increasingly rely on these international recruiters, educators worry that students may be victimized by high-pressure sales tactics, and that universities are trading away academic standards by recruiting less qualified students who pay higher tuition.The university senate and the student government association also expressed concerns. \u201cIt is ethically wrong to bring students to the university and let them believe they can be successful when we have nothing in place to make sure they\u2019re successful,\u201d the student association president, Jay Todd Richey, said.With about 1,400 international students and a little more than 20,000 students over all, Western Kentucky, the state\u2019s third-largest public university, has been at the forefront of efforts by universities across the country to increase foreign enrollment. Its slogan is \u201cA leading American university with international reach.\u201dAdministrators say the India Pilot Project, as the recruitment effort is known here, is an experiment to increase enrollment and to diversify the international student body, and fits in with a previously announced plan to double international enrollment.They also say the students \u2014 57 of whom enrolled in January \u2014 were admitted conditionally and have been placed in remedial classes to help them adjust.\u201cInternational is good, but it\u2019s not always easy,\u201d Gary Ransdell, the university\u2019s president, said in an interview. \u201cIt can\u2019t be business as usual. We\u2019re learning that. There are growing pains.\u201dGlobal Tree\u2019s director, Subhakar Alapati, also acknowledged that the program had glitches, saying in a telephone interview, \u201cA problem with the students has arisen because the education system in India is more theoretical than practical.\u201dDr. Ransdell said the university had decided to recruit international students years ago to expose local students to global cultures. But recently, he said, the effort has become more of an economic necessity, partly because of drastic state funding cuts for higher education \u2014 a pattern seen across the country.To combat these cuts, colleges began to look at foreign students, who pay full tuition, as their financial salvation. And although federal law prohibits them from using recruiters in the United States who are paid based on the number of students they enroll, the law does not ban the use of such recruiters abroad.\u201cThe use of agents who are compensated in the form of bonus, commission or other incentive payment on the basis of the number of students recruited or enrolled creates an environment in which misrepresentation and conflicts of interests are unavoidable,\u201d the draft said.A major criticism of the recruiters is that their sales tactics can pressure students by creating a sense of urgency.Other international recruiting companies are also offering so-called \u201cspot admission\u201d or \u201cspot assessment\u201d to a variety of United States universities. One is Study Metro, in Bangalore, India, which posted notices on Facebook offering quick admission, seemingly to the University of Oklahoma, along with fast turnarounds on a document called the I-20, required to obtain a visa.\u201cDear Students, Study Metro invites you with open arms to make avail of the spot admission and I20 program on 31st Jan 2016,\u201d it adds. \u201cDon\u2019t miss the opportunity to fulfill your aspiring dream of studying in USA. Call now for FREE registration. First comes First served.\u201dAbhishek Bajaj, the managing director of Study Metro, said his company\u2019s reference to the University of Oklahoma was an error. Its client, he said, is the University of Central Oklahoma.He defended the urgent tone of the posting, saying that university representatives were in his office that day. \u201cThe urgency is to tell them this is a golden opportunity to meet,\u201d Mr. Bajaj said.Global Tree, the company working with Western Kentucky, also recently offered on Facebook \u201cspot assessment\u201d to \u201cworld top\u201d Purdue University, with a notice saying, \u201cLow Scores, Don\u2019t Worry.\u201d The smaller print reveals that the ad is for Purdue University Calumet, in Hammond, Ind., about 100 miles from the flagship campus in West Lafayette.After being notified about the Facebook posting, a spokesman for Purdue Calumet said the university was reviewing its relationship with Global Tree, calling the message \u201cunfortunate and disconcerting.\u201d\u201cWe do not lower the requirements for our international students,\u201d the spokesman, Wes Lukoshus, said.Global Tree\u2019s director, Mr. Alapati, said in the telephone interview that Purdue Calumet had approved its marketing materials in advance.\u201cThe families are going to pay to have their students flown here, but they\u2019re going to flunk out because they don\u2019t have the academic preparation, and then go home,\u201d Mr. Gough said. \u201cThat\u2019s not good.\u201dMr. Alapati said that Global Tree had dealt with Western Kentucky for years, but that the recent India project was the first time the university had sent its own employees \u201con site in India doing evaluations on the spot.\u201d The idea of \u201cspot admission\u201d was to eliminate long waiting times, he said.He recently visited Western Kentucky\u2019s computer science department, where most of the students enrolled. A professor told him that the students\u2019 knowledge was below that of second-year undergraduates. \u201cThe dean said the department is going to give extra help,\u201d Mr. Alapati said.Eric S. Reed, the interim dean of the graduate school, said that nearly all the conditionally admitted students were required to take language remediation classes, and that some were required to take \u201cdeficiency\u201d classes to teach them a necessary skill.One of the newer buildings on campus is the Honors College/International Center, a three-story, $22 million structure that houses the university\u2019s 17-member international staff.A large bronze globe dominates the atrium-style lobby. Underneath the globe, the woodwork is etched with the phrase \u201cGateway to the World.\u201d\u201cThe university is always striving to diversify our international population,\u201d said Raza Tiwana, the school\u2019s chief international officer, who first arrived on campus as a student from Pakistan.James Gary, the computer science chairman, said his department had approved the students admitted this spring.\u201cFrom my perspective, it has not been a disaster,\u201d Dr. Gary said. But he acknowledged concerns about whether some of them can be successful.\u201cWe really won\u2019t be able to tell anything about that until the end of the semester,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Aims to Drive Down Tech Prices to Expand Its Reach", "Date": "2016-04-24", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, is clear about his vision for his company: He wants to triple the size of his social network, which now has 1.6 billion members.But to reach that new audience, he has to find a way to change telecommunications networks to make connecting to the Internet more affordable, since many of those would-be Facebook users live in developing countries.That could be bad news for the companies that make equipment for those networks, whether they are Silicon Valley giants like Cisco Systems or little widget makers that produce the parts to tie different pieces of the network together.\u201cThere is definitely going to be some pressure, some consolidation\u201d for many tech equipment suppliers, said Akshay Sharma, research director at the technology advisory firm Gartner. \u201cIf you\u2019re in hardware, you\u2019re going to reduce head count from thousands to maybe 10 people, a hundred at most.\u201dNo doubt, Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s grand \u2014 some would say grandiose \u2014 vision could take years to realize. But if he manages to make the way people connect to the Internet more affordable, it would be just the latest instance of how the company has quietly upended the traditional economics of the technology industry.Facebook has changed the way people interact with their friends on the Internet. But less understood outside tech circles is how the social network has come to be perhaps the most aggressive example of a growing number of companies that are unwilling to pay top dollar for products made by traditional technology suppliers.Mr. Zuckerberg has embraced so-called open-source concepts, which have helped him play catch-up with the giant computer networks of companies like Amazon and Google.Open source typically refers to freely shared code or even development plans that companies and people collectively create at a fraction of the price of traditional tech products. Bits of open-source technology can be found in all sorts of things, including Google\u2019s Android operating system and web browsers.Companies like Facebook often contribute to open-source projects since they don\u2019t make money selling products \u2014 instead, they have to buy products that help them offer their service. Keeping tech costs down helps the bottom line.When Facebook reveals the financial results for its most recent quarter on Wednesday, investors will no doubt scrutinize how much the company is spending, particularly since Mr. Zuckerberg has promised to invest more money in searching for new users. One big key to keeping those costs down has been open-source technology.It should not be surprising, then, that Mr. Zuckerberg is relying on open source to reduce the price of building and running the world\u2019s telecommunications networks, a business estimated to be worth about $150 billion a year.\u201cOur rule is 10 times faster or 10 times cheaper or both,\u201d said Jay Parikh, Facebook\u2019s vice president for engineering. \u201cWe want to get a full Facebook experience to every end user, whether that is video, or eventually virtual reality.\u201d\u201cThere is a new force in the system,\u201d said Dave Ward, Cisco\u2019s chief architect. \u201cWe\u2019d rather be on the train than in front of it.\u201dIn the future, Mr. Zuckerberg imagines that \u201ca physical thing, like a TV, will just be a $1 app\u201d inside virtual reality on Facebook, he recently told a conference of software developers building apps for Facebook. But that may be 10 years off, by Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s own admission. People who do not work at Facebook might say it is a fantasy.Facebook even appears willing to turn the price-crushing model on itself. To get virtual reality to every place in the world, Facebook\u2019s Oculus VR headsets, currently $600, may have to cost $5, said Mike Schroepfer, the company\u2019s chief technology officer.Is that another fantasy? For Facebook, getting those costs down could mean controlling the next big communications platform, since Mr. Zuckerberg believes virtual reality may eventually supplant smartphones as a primary connection to the online world.\u201cThe world is making enough phones. It\u2019s better for the world if there are fewer devices,\u201d Mr. Schroepfer said. \u201cIt\u2019s not totally obvious how all this shakes out \u2014 whether we\u2019ll have lots of consumer products, or it all disappears into a couple of VR headsets.\u201dHow much profit this new audience will yield Facebook is an open question. But Facebook would rather control a crucial technology than have to build on top of another company\u2019s products, as it has had to do with PCs and smartphones.\u201cIt\u2019s more opportunity to show ads,\u201d said Danny Sullivan, founder of the technology website Search Engine Land, who is a close watcher of the industry. \u201cIt\u2019s more opportunity to gather data on what we do or who we are connected with. It\u2019s more opportunity to build a new platform where Facebook serves as the broker of connectivity.\u201dAt the same Facebook developers\u2019 conference there were talks on the latest open-source efforts, including an urban wireless network that checks its performance 125,000 times a second, and a long-range wireless system that Facebook says can send a gigabit of data a second, about 10 times the rate of today\u2019s good-performing networks and enough for virtual reality.Both technologies, Mr. Parikh said, will be tested this year, with an eye to releasing them as open-source projects. \u201cWe\u2019ll be into all this stuff,\u201d he said. Facebook does not want to own or sell the gear, he added, but plans to work with \u201chundreds\u201d of local phone companies worldwide on cheaper high-speed connections.But others dismiss some of Facebook\u2019s efforts as hype. \u201cWe are connecting 700 million to 1.5 billion people a year via smartphones and tablets,\u201d said Ulf Ewaldsson, chief technical officer at Ericsson, one of the world\u2019s largest makers of telecommunications hardware.\u201cThey say they can do a 90 percent cost reduction, but that is from phone bills for high-cost customers,\u201d he said. \u201cPoor people need to be covered, and the industry is working on that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Media companies say they have been shocked by the amount of interest in their Live experiments, including a flurry of earnest comments and questions for live streamers.But then there is the issue of money. Executives at the companies remain somewhat wary about investing in yet another product without a clear sense of how it will pay off. Facebook is mostly mum about how \u2014 or when \u2014 money might flow from the videos.Facebook users have their own guesses, of course. Said one: \u201cThey\u2019ll get more people using it, then hide the alerts because we\u2019re already complaining and then charge companies to get the alerts back.\u201dIs this just pessimism? Maybe. But even if Facebook Live unfolds exactly as this commenter imagines \u2014 a spike in viewers followed by a decline as the market becomes more competitive, and then Facebook becoming more sophisticated to promote and prioritize live streams \u2014 what would that tell us?

{"Headline": "\u2018Hamilton\u2019 and History: Are They in Sync?", "Date": "2016-04-10", "News": "Supported byBut even among historians who love the musical and its multiethnic cast, a question has also quietly simmered: does \u201cHamilton\u201d really get Hamilton right?In articles, blog posts and Facebook threads, scholars have debated whether \u201cHamilton\u201d over-glorifies the man, inflating his opposition to slavery while glossing over less attractive aspects of his politics, which were not necessarily as in tune with contemporary progressive values as audiences leaving the theater might assume.The conversation has yet to erupt into a full-fledged historians\u2019 rap battle. But some scholars are wondering if one is due to start.Amid all the enthusiasm for \u201cHamilton\u201d the musical, he added, Hamilton the man \u201chas gotten a free pass.\u201dAnnette Gordon-Reed, a professor of history and law at Harvard and the Pulitzer-Prize-winning author of \u201cThe Hemingses of Monticello,\u201d put it more bluntly.What\u2019s the story behind a show that\u2019s become a Broadway must-see with no marquee names, no special effects and almost no white actors? Erik Piepenburg explains, in six snapshots, why \u201cHamilton\u201d has become such a big deal.\u201cOne of the most interesting things about the \u2018Hamilton\u2019 phenomenon,\u201d she wrote last week on the blog of the National Council on Public History, \u201cis just how little serious criticism the play has received.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an amazing piece of theater, but it concerns me that people are seeing it as a piece of history,\u201d Ms. Monteiro, an assistant professor of history at Rutgers University, Newark, said in an interview.The founders, she added, \u201creally didn\u2019t want to create the country we actually live in today.\u201dMs. Gordon-Reed \u2014 who is credited with breaking down the resistance among historians to the claim that Thomas Jefferson had a sexual relationship with Sally Hemings \u2014 wrote in her response that she shared some of Ms. Monteiro\u2019s qualms, even as she loved the musical and listened to the cast album every day.While the most recent critiques of \u201cHamilton\u201d have focused on race, some scholars have also noted that it\u2019s an odd moment for the public to embrace an unabashed elitist who liked big banks, mistrusted the masses and at one point called for a monarchal presidency and a Senate that served for life.Turning him into \u201can up-from-under hero,\u201d he added, \u201cseems dissonant amidst the politics of 2016.\u201dIn a telephone interview, Mr. Chernow, who is the show\u2019s historical consultant, said the criticisms by Ms. Monteiro and Ms. Gordon-Reed were based on \u201can enormous misunderstanding\u201d of the show, which dramatizes \u201ca piece of political history at a very elite\u201d \u2014 and all-white \u2014 \u201clevel of society.\u201dCasting black and Latino actors as the founders effectively writes nonwhite people into the story, he said, in ways that audiences have powerfully responded to. (The Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History has created a curriculum for 20,000 low-income New York City public school students who will be able to see the musical, in a program funded by the Rockefeller Foundation and subsidized by the show.)\u201cThis show is the best advertisement for racial diversity in Broadway history and it is sad that it is being attacked on racial grounds,\u201d Mr. Chernow added by email. (A publicist for \u201cHamilton\u201d said Mr. Miranda was not available for comment.)The show does include one named black character, Sally Hemings, who appears in a quick cameo that lands mainly as a dig at Jefferson. (The slaveholdings of the Schuyler family, which Hamilton married into, go unmentioned.) The show, Mr. Chernow said, also makes clear that black soldiers fought in the Revolution.Ms. Monteiro, in her article, points out that other historical African-American individuals could have figured in the story.In the show\u2019s last song, his widow, Eliza, sings that Hamilton would have \u201cdone so much more\u201d against slavery had he lived longer.But Ms. Gordon-Reed, in an interview, said that while Hamilton publicly criticized Jefferson\u2019s views on the biological inferiority of blacks, his record from the 1790s until his death in 1804 includes little to no action against slavery.Race and slavery, she added, are invoked directly in the show mainly to underline Hamilton\u2019s \u201cgoodness,\u201d especially in contrast to Jefferson. But Hamilton the ardent lifelong abolitionist, she said, is \u201can idea of who we would like Hamilton to be.\u201dBut Hamilton, he said, was an abolitionist by the standard of the founding period. \u201cThere was a real contrast with Jefferson,\u201d he said.\u201cIt\u2019s about how hard it is to do politics, about how people of fundamentally clashing political views tried to work together to create a shared constitutional enterprise,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd right now, that\u2019s a message we really need.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article, using information from Getty Images, misstated the date of the engraving of Hamilton by John F.E.

{"Headline": "At Chobani, Now It\u2019s Not Just the Yogurt That\u2019s Rich", "Date": "2016-04-26", "News": "Supported byNEW BERLIN, N.Y. \u2014 The 2,000 full-time employees of the yogurt company Chobani were handed quite the surprise on Tuesday: an ownership stake that could make some of them millionaires.Hamdi Ulukaya, the Turkish immigrant who founded Chobani in 2005, told workers at the company\u2019s plant here in upstate New York that he would be giving them shares worth up to 10 percent of the company when it goes public or is sold.The goal, he said, is to pass along the wealth they have helped build in the decade since the company started. Chobani is now widely considered to be worth several billion dollars.\u201cI\u2019ve built something I never thought would be such a success, but I cannot think of Chobani being built without all these people,\u201d Mr. Ulukaya said in an interview in his Manhattan office that was granted on the condition that no details of the program would be disclosed before the announcement.\u201cNow they\u2019ll be working to build the company even more and building their future at the same time,\u201d he said.Chobani employees received the news on Tuesday morning. Each worker received a white packet; inside was information about how many Chobani shares they were given. The number of shares given to each person is based on tenure, so the longer an employee has been at the company, the bigger the stake.Rich Lake, lead project manager, was one of the original group of five employees Mr. Ulukaya hired for the plant in New Berlin. Mr. Lake said on Tuesday that he did not expect Chobani shares to change his life much. \u201cI\u2019m not one for living outside my means,\u201d he said.Rather, he said, the shares are an acknowledgment of what he and the other employees have put into Chobani.\u201cIt\u2019s better than a bonus or a raise,\u201d Mr. Lake said. \u201cIt\u2019s the best thing because you\u2019re getting a piece of this thing you helped build.\u201dThe transfer of money by Mr. Ulukaya touches on a hot-button economic issue: the rapidly expanding gap in pay between executives and average workers. The United States has one of the widest pay gaps, and the topic has played a prominent role in this year\u2019s presidential race, particularly among the Democrats.The shares given to Chobani employees are coming directly from Mr. Ulukaya. The shares can be sold if the company goes public or is bought by another business, neither of which seems imminent. Employees can hang onto the shares if they leave or retire, or the company will buy them back.The unusual announcement comes before TPG Capital, whose $750 million loan helped bail out Chobani, can buy a stake in the company. Tension between Mr. Ulukaya and TPG about the direction of the company emerged shortly after the loan deal.TPG has warrants to buy 20 percent or more of Chobani\u2019s shares, depending on targets set in the original deal it struck. But that percentage would now be calculated from the 90 percent of the remaining shares, after the 10 percent given to the employees, essentially diluting TPG\u2019s potential stake.TPG declined to comment on Tuesday.In addition, a year ago Mr. Ulukaya settled a lawsuit with his ex-wife, who had sought a stake in the company. The terms of the settlement were not released.Technology start-ups often pay employees partly in shares to help recruit them or to compete in a company\u2019s early days for in-demand workers. Early employees of Google and Facebook became overnight multimillionaires thanks to such compensation.But unlike many of those tech companies, Mr. Ulukaya is giving his employees a piece of the company after its value is firmly established.\u201cIt\u2019s very uncommon and rare, especially in this industry, for these kinds of programs to be rolled out,\u201d said Jessica Kennedy, a principal at Mercer, the large human resources consulting firm that worked with Chobani on the new program.Mr. Ulukaya has played a hands-on role in the company since 2005, when he bought a defunct Kraft yogurt plant here with an $800,000 loan from the Small Business Administration. Two years later, he began selling Greek yogurt, setting off a heated competition in what had been one of the sleepier refrigerated cases in grocery stores.Chobani pays employees above the minimum wage and offers full-time employees health benefits and other benefits. Early on, Mr. Ulukaya established a 401(k) plan for employees and pushed them to participate.\u201cI preached and nagged and tried to force them to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, not all did, and I\u2019ve continued to worry about them in retirement.\u201dA few years ago, though, the company ran into financial problems after spending almost half a billion dollars to build the largest yogurt processing plant in the world, a one-million-square-foot facility in Idaho. The new plant allowed the company to expand into new products, like a children\u2019s yogurt packed in a tube and tiny cups of dessert-like yogurts.But the company struggled to get lines up and running smoothly, and public health officials identified mold contamination in some products.\u201cIt was a wake-up call for us,\u201d Mr. Ulukaya said soberly. \u201cIt made me realize that I needed to get this right, and so I\u2019m glad it happened.\u201dThe company had to close lines and invest in improving its food safety regimens. It also took the loan from TPG Capital to help build operations better suited to the billion-dollar business Chobani had become.In a presentation to investors, though, TPG boasted about how it had waited until the last minute to come to Chobani\u2019s rescue with the loan, thus allowing it to negotiate better terms in a deal that it estimated could increase the company\u2019s value to as much as $7 billion. In addition, rumors circulated that TPG wanted to replace Mr. Ulukaya with a new chief executive, which rankled him.But in the last year or so, business has rebounded, thanks in large part to new products made at the Idaho plant.Mr. Ulukaya will still own the vast majority of the company, though his portion will be diluted as well. He said that giving his employees a stake in the company\u2019s success was among the terms he demanded when the deal with TPG was struck.\u201cTo me, there are two kinds of people in this world,\u201d he said on Tuesday. \u201cThe people who work at Chobani and the people who don\u2019t.\u201dMichael J. de la Merced contributed reporting from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

His comments Friday are likely to give fresh ammunition to conservatives who are eager to make abortion illegal, and who have been skeptical of his conversion from an abortion-rights Democrat to an anti-abortion Republican in the last several years. \u201cA question was asked to me,\u201d Mr. Trump told the CBS host John Dickerson. \u201cAnd it was asked in a very hypothetical. And it was said, \u2018Illegal, illegal.\u2019\u200a\u201d He added, \u201cI\u2019ve been told by some people that was an older line answer and that was an answer that was given on a, you know, basis of an older line from years ago on a very conservative basis.\u201dWhen asked how he would further restrict abortion, Mr. Trump said, \u201cThe laws are set now on abortion and that\u2019s the way they\u2019re going to remain until they\u2019re changed.\u201d\u201cI would\u2019ve preferred states\u2019 rights,\u201d he added, saying that the laws now \u201care set.\u201d \u201cAnd I think we have to leave it that way.\u201dA short time later, Mr. Trump\u2019s spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, said in a statement: \u201cMr. Trump gave an accurate account of the law as it is today and made clear it must stay that way now \u00e2\u0080\u0094 until he is president.

{"Headline": "A Familiar Pattern in a Spouse\u2019s Final Act", "Date": "2016-04-09", "News": "Supported byMurder in the 4-0Leer en espa\u00f1olSeventeen cuts lined Alejandro Uribe\u2019s forearm like tally marks \u2014 each, he said, for a year he had been with Nadia Saavedra, his hometown bride from a riverside village in Mexico.Ms. Saavedra had asked her husband to leave their Bronx apartment in late January, after years of absorbing his abuse. But Mr. Uribe grew obsessed, cutting himself and, after Ms. Saavedra called the police, planting himself in the stairwell and knocking on her door.A short stay in a hospital psychiatric ward had not kept him from grasping at a vanishing marriage. He took to walking the 400 or so steps from his new home to Ms. Saavedra\u2019s apartment \u2014 past a boxing gym, a pharmacy, two churches and a mosque \u2014 to watch who came and went. He followed her to Manhattan. He called their 16-year-old son, Uri, almost daily, asking about a man who he suspected was Ms. Saavedra\u2019s boyfriend.On Ms. Saavedra\u2019s 34th birthday, March 7, Mr. Uribe waited in the hall outside her second-floor apartment, this time without knocking. When Ms. Saavedra opened the door to take their 11-year-old daughter, Naiyela, to school, he pushed his way past the girl and forced Ms. Saavedra into her bedroom.She screamed her son\u2019s name, but by the time Uri broke down the door, his mother had been stabbed 13 times. His father, shirtless, moved the 12-inch kitchen knife from one hand to the other before plunging it into his own rib cage, forcefully enough to pierce his heart. Mr. Uribe\u2019s dead body crumpled on top of his wife\u2019s.A neighbor, Celin Feble, 16, heard Ms. Saavedra screaming \u201cStop, please stop!\u201d She did not understand the gravity of what was happening until she saw Naiyela, weeping, emerge onto the sidewalk with a small black-and-white dog. Uri walked outside with blood all over his hands.And, like gang killings and attacks by mentally ill people, domestic murders occur overwhelmingly in poor neighborhoods, where jobs are scarce and seeking help from city agencies is not necessarily the norm. Among those neighborhoods is Mott Haven, part of the 40th Precinct, a two-square-mile trapezoid at the southern tip of the Bronx that is one of several pockets in the city where domestic violence and killings persist.Police officers in the South Bronx are trying to break through the shame and fear that often keep victims from reporting abuse, visiting them repeatedly even if they slam the door.The killing of Ms. Saavedra, who lived in a private, five-story walk-up building, emerged from the same swirl of jealousy, mental instability and silence that makes it difficult for investigators across the city to anticipate domestic violence.Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center, where the police brought Mr. Uribe after that episode, released him after less than two days, reflecting the difficulty in decoding risk factors.At a recent public safety meeting, Sgt. Michael J. LoPuzzo, the commander of the 40th Precinct detective squad, expressed regret that Ms. Saavedra had never told officers she feared for her safety. \u201cMaybe we could have prevented that,\u201d he said.Even in retrospect, relatives struggled to pinpoint the moment a tumultuous marriage had turned murderous.\u201cThey have many problems, for many years,\u201d said Omar Mendoza, a nephew of Ms. Saavedra\u2019s, with whom Mr. Uribe came to stay after leaving the hospital. \u201cIt was nothing new.\u201d But, he added, \u201cI don\u2019t know why he makes this decision.\u201dMs. Saavedra was a doting mother with big hazel eyes and an easygoing manner.\u201cChula,\u201d or \u201ccutie,\u201d Ms. Saavedra called one friend. \u201cPrincess\u201d was the nickname she gave to a niece.\u201cShe was always smiling, always had happy words \u2014 sweet words to say,\u201d said Alejandro, a family friend who played guitar at Ms. Saavedra\u2019s service. He did not provide his last name.On the eve of her birthday, a Sunday, Ms. Saavedra gathered with her sisters and their children at the apartment of her older sister, Maitec Saavedra, which was filled with the chirping of pet birds. There was a cake and a fruit tart. Nadia Saavedra posted photos from the party online the next day, at 7:13 a.m.\u201cTake the time to remember that it\u2019s only one more year that God allowed me to be beside my family is the best thing that could have happened to me, thanks sisters,\u201d she wrote in Spanish.Mr. Uribe, 38, was, by contrast, nearly silent at family gatherings, shutting himself in his room and acting as if no one else was there. A stocky, square-jawed man, he posted photos online of cases of Modelo beer stacked six feet high, and saved his displays of emotion for the makeshift bars where he met friends.The couple had gotten married in their hometown, San Pedro Aytec in Huamuxtitl\u00e1n, Guerrero, about 100 miles from Acapulco, in the heart of a region plagued by violence from cartels vying for control of the drug trade. Ms. Saavedra, 15 at the time, wore a long white dress. Mr. Uribe, whose mother owned a deli, wore a button-down shirt and jeans. They were joined by about 50 guests, who ate and danced at Mr. Uribe\u2019s family home.\u201cThey did seem like they were very much in love,\u201d said Magali Garcia, a neighbor there who attended the wedding and now lives in Florida.The couple moved to the South Bronx soon after, joining other Mexican immigrants settling in New York City neighborhoods that, since the 1960s, had been predominantly Puerto Rican, Dominican and African-American. About 12,000 people of Mexican descent now live in the 40th Precinct, accounting for 13 percent of the population.Mr. Uribe played on an amateur soccer team called Guerrero, after his home state. A friend, Victor Soto, 55, recalled a weekend pickup game this year, where friends and family barbecued shish kebabs with jalape\u00f1os, sipped beers and played \u2014 Mr. Uribe, with his shirt off.\u201cI said, \u2018It\u2019s only 57 degrees, you\u2019re going to get sick,\u2019\u201d Mr. Soto said. \u201cWe were goofing; he wouldn\u2019t even wait for the summer.\u201dAt other times, Mr. Uribe\u2019s manner was erratic and cold.\u201cHe have days when he\u2019s all right, he knows you,\u201d Mr. Soto said. \u201cThe next day, he don\u2019t know you; there were days that he wouldn\u2019t register. Some days I say, \u2018Hi,\u2019 he keep walking. Later in the day he say, \u2018Sorry, I was thinking about something. I had something on my mind.\u2019 \u201dMs. Saavedra worked housecleaning jobs to support the family while she cooked for Uri and Naiyela and helped them with their schoolwork. Mr. Uribe preferred getting drunk while bantering about sports with other men, Maitec Saavedra said. In the quieter setting of home, with his wife and children, he grew anxious and lashed out.\u201cHe would get aggressive when she would go home,\u201d Maitec Saavedra said, \u201cbecause he knew that if he tried to say anything like that in front of them, they would not allow him to behave that way.\u201dShe added, \u201cHe didn\u2019t really pay attention to his kids \u2014 he didn\u2019t really take care of them, Nadia and the kids.\u201dMr. Uribe worked for a time as a laborer around the city. He immersed himself in different brands of machinery and was skilled at fixing engines, so much so that clients would sometimes send cars to pick him up, Mr. Soto said.But he had stopped working in the early winter, creating more friction in the marriage, Maitec Saavedra said.Relatives prodded Ms. Saavedra about why she was still with him; she said it was for the children. As in many cases of domestic violence, the couple mostly hid their discord.A neighbor who lives in Ms. Saavedra\u2019s apartment building in the Bronx said she had heard screaming coming from the apartment on previous occasions. Others said Mr. Uribe was physically abusive. Ms. Saavedra confided to a few friends at a local nonprofit that her husband beat and humiliated her, the group\u2019s founder, Elva Guevara, said.Mr. Mendoza, Ms. Saavedra\u2019s nephew, said the couple\u2019s problems grew as Mr. Uribe become more emotionally unstable. \u201cHe is upset with everybody, with everybody \u2014 with no reason,\u201d Mr. Mendoza said.Near the end of his life, Mr. Uribe became enraged about a relationship that Ms. Saavedra was having with another man, who described the relationship to detectives.The police said they had not learned of any problems between Ms. Saavedra and Mr. Uribe until Jan. 28, when she called 911 to say he had threatened to kill himself during an argument and had slashed his left forearm.By the time officers arrived, Mr. Uribe was gone; the officers, concerned about his state of mind, filled out a missing persons report for him. The police had no indication at that point that Mr. Uribe had been violent toward Ms. Saavedra. They wrote a domestic incident report for harassment and an argument.The next day, around 3 p.m., Ms. Saavedra called the police again. Mr. Uribe was trying to get inside her apartment. Officers arrived and took him to the hospital. He had wrapped his cuts in duct tape, and told the officers that each one represented a year of their relationship, though a court record and her age at marriage suggest they may have been together for longer.Ms. Saavedra went to Family Court that day, seeking an order of protection because Mr. Uribe had cut himself during an argument. She was granted a temporary order that would expire on March 9.Ms. Saavedra alluded to her ordeal on Facebook. \u201cNobody said it would be easy,\u201d she wrote on Feb. 28. \u201cBut with my faith, and this peace that God has given me, I know that better things are coming!!!\u201dBy the morning of March 7, the order had not been served. It indicated Ms. Saavedra needed to \u201carrange\u201d to have it served by contacting the authorities, but police records show that she never did \u2014 a reflection of the onus placed on victims to secure their own protection, say counselors who work with domestic violence victims.The pattern of a deepening desperation \u2014 Mr. Uribe\u2019s threats to kill himself, his paranoia about a boyfriend \u2014 were familiar milestones on the path to domestic homicide.Domestic homicides \u2014 killings that happen within a family or romantic relationship \u2014 fell from 76 in 2002 to 63 in 2014 in the city, according to the Mayor\u2019s Office to Combat Domestic Violence. The decrease was helped in part by an expansion of government options for victims seeking to escape violence. But domestic homicides are much more stubborn than overall murders, which plunged at more than double the rate during the same period. Two-thirds of adult domestic homicide victims from 2002 to 2013 were women, city data show.\u201cThe attitudes that drive domestic violence are deeply embedded in our culture, and are very persistent,\u201d said Liz Roberts, chief program officer at Safe Horizon, a victim services group.There were 10 intimate-partner homicides in the Bronx last year, the highest for any borough; two were in the 40th Precinct. The borough recorded 75,299 domestic incident reports last year, a rate of 544 per 10,000 residents, compared to 347 per 10,000 residents in Brooklyn, the borough with the second-highest rate.In the 40th Precinct, domestic-related major crimes, many of them felony assaults, jumped to 84 so far this year from 58 during the same period in 2015 \u2014 an increase that Capt. Thomas Alps called \u201cvery problematic\u201d at the recent public safety meeting.People without jobs are more likely to abuse their partners, counselors say, in part because they lose their stake in following social norms. Around 40 percent of domestic homicide victims in New York City from 2004 to 2013 lived in communities with high poverty, compared to about a quarter of the city\u2019s population over all.Counselors for victims say immigrants are often especially reluctant to seek help \u2014 because of their immigration status or an inability to speak English or because domestic-violence standards may have been looser in their home countries.Despite those hurdles, police officials in the Bronx frequently try for weeks to track down domestic violence suspects. The police have also begun asking victims to sign statements about their abuse immediately to help in cases in which a victim later decides not to cooperate.Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s administration has sought to improve coordination between psychiatric hospitals and city agencies, and has put crisis teams in the South Bronx to respond to early signs of violence.\u201cNadia Saavedra\u2019s death underscores the urgent need to intervene well before violence happens,\u201d said Sarah Solon, the spokeswoman for the Mayor\u2019s Office of Criminal Justice.Uri was left with cuts and bruises from breaking down his mother\u2019s bedroom door during the attack.His parents\u2019 bodies were returned to their hometown in Guerrero a week later, after separate viewings in New York.On the third day, more than two dozen mourners gathered at Maitec Saavedra\u2019s East Harlem apartment. Prayers and songs spilled out of the open door amid the chirping of the pet birds. A portrait of Nadia Saavedra hung above a shrine of flowers, candles and balloons.Women called out to the Virgin Mary, to which the crowd responded, \u201cRuega por nosotros,\u201d or \u201cPray for us.\u201dMr. Uribe left behind four suicide notes, to his son, daughter, mother and father \u2014 all of them dated Feb. 17, nearly three weeks before the killing. He wrote that he was upset by Ms. Saavedra\u2019s new relationship and that he did not want to share her in life or in death; he would take her with him to heaven.He asked Uri to take care of his sister.Reporting was contributed by May Azcue, Sandra E.

{"Headline": "Trudeau Condemns Killing of Canadian Hostage in Philippines", "Date": "2016-04-25", "News": "Supported byOTTAWA \u2014 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau condemned the \u201cheinous\u201d killing in the Philippines on Monday of a Canadian who had been held captive by Islamic militants for seven months.Mr. Trudeau confirmed that John Ridsdel, 68, a mining executive, had been killed by the Abu Sayyaf group after a ransom deadline expired.\u201cThis was an act of coldblooded murder, and responsibility rests squarely with the terrorist group who took him hostage,\u201d Mr. Trudeau told reporters.Global Affairs Canada, the country\u2019s foreign ministry, said that the government would not pay ransom.\u201cKidnap for ransom is a significant source of terrorist funding, fueling violence and instability,\u201d it said in a statement on Monday.The ministry declined to comment on what military efforts, if any, had been underway to rescue the hostages when the kidnappers\u2019 deadline approached.Bob Rae, who was interim leader of the Liberal Party in Canada before Mr. Trudeau took over, told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that he had been working with Mr. Ridsdel\u2019s family in efforts to free the hostages.\u201cIt\u2019s hard, it\u2019s just very hard,\u201d Mr. Rae, a friend of Mr. Ridsdel\u2019s since the 1960s, told the broadcaster. \u201cWhether things could have been done differently, it\u2019s too soon for that to be said. Certainly the family did everything they could to try to reach a solution.\u201dReuters, quoting a spokesman for the Philippines military, reported that a man on a motorcycle on Monday dropped a plastic bag with a head in it in the center of town on Jolo Island, the remote region where Abu Sayyaf is largely based. The military added that tests were underway to confirm the identity of the victim.While the United States military has said that Abu Sayyaf has links with Al Qaeda and has received support from it, many analysts characterize the group mainly as a ruthless criminal organization, focused on profiting from kidnappings rather than ideology.The Philippines armed forces have said the group is holding a number of other hostages. In November, the group decapitated a Malaysian hostage when that country\u2019s prime minister arrived in the Philippines for an international summit meeting.The Calgary Herald reported that Mr. Ridsdel had worked at the newspaper as a reporter during the 1970s and 1980s before becoming a spokesman and manager for Petro-Canada, a large oil company based in that city. Mr. Ridsdel later managed a mine in the Philippines, and worked part time as a mining consultant in recent years.The Philippine military and police, in a joint statement on Tuesday, expressed condolences to Mr. Ridsdel\u2019s family, and vowed to press their efforts \u201cto neutralize these lawless elements and thwart further threats to peace and security.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Trump went to Washington for his first meeting with his foreign-policy team, an emerging group of advisers that, he told Fox News, would be announced to a fuller degree on Friday.  He also met with Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman, in an effort to smooth the rough patches that have emerged between them in recent weeks. The meeting fell on the same day that the committee issued a list of frequently asked questions that explained exactly how the convention rules work.

{"Headline": "With New Effort, Group Hopes to Show Donald Trump Has a Multicultural Appeal", "Date": "2016-04-04", "News": "Donald J. Trump, criticized for months for his comments on race, is about to be bolstered by a multi-cultural network of supporters hoping to tell a different side of his story. The \u201cNational Diversity Coalition for Trump\u201d was the brainchild of Michael Cohen, a longtime adviser to Mr. Trump at his company, who worked with Pastor Darrell Scott, a Trump supporter based in Cleveland, and a friend of Mr. Cohen. The group is planning to create a website that will showcase other supporters of Mr. Trump, who is a native of a diverse city but who is running in a party primary dominated by older, whiter voters. \u201cI know Mr. Trump and I know that there is not an ounce of truth to any of the allegations lodged against him by the liberal media. He\u2019s not racist, misogynist, sexist or Islamophobic,\u201d Mr. Scott said in an interview on Sunday. \u201cWe need to let the world see that this depiction of Mr. Trump is not the reality that\u201d he and Mr. Cohen know, he said. \u201cIt began as a minority coalition for Trump, but we changed it to \u2018Diversity Coalition for Trump.\u2019 We changed it because we didn\u2019t want to discriminate against white people,\u201d Mr. Scott said, with a laugh. The website is still in formation, but other supporters, such as the former \u201cApprentice\u201d star Omarosa Manigault, who has been a frequent surrogate for Mr. Trump, will appear. Mr. Cohen, who stressed that he is not working for the campaign, said he presented his boss with a request to appear at a mosque recently. \u201cMr. Trump is purely a performance-based critic,\u201d said Mr. Cohen, adding, \u201cThe media and the establishment of both political parties are trying to convince the American people that Mr. Trump can only appeal to white, blue-collar men. That\u2019s patently false.

{"Headline": "Supreme Court Immigration Ruling Won\u2019t End Political Tussle", "Date": "2016-04-15", "News": "Supported byRegardless of how the justices answer that question, their ruling is certain to inflame the volatile immigration debate in the 2016 presidential campaign. The decision will also help determine whether Mr. Obama has a chance to redeem his legacy on immigration, or see it marred beyond repair.The ruling is not likely to come until June, a wait that will be excruciating for the White House, which has been caught between angry demands from Republicans for more border enforcement and rage among Latinos who expected more from Mr. Obama.A victory in the Supreme Court for Mr. Obama would allow millions of immigrants here illegally to come out of the shadows and stay in the country, but it would also be certain to provide new political ammunition for Donald J. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, the Republican presidential candidates who have used anti-immigrant rhetoric to rally support during the primaries.If the court rules against Mr. Obama, or if it splits 4 to 4, it will immediately end the president\u2019s efforts to revamp the nation\u2019s immigration laws. The decision would in turn add to the long-simmering frustration with Mr. Obama among Latinos, who blame his administration for carrying out a record number of deportations and remain angry about what they say was his slowness to act on a sweeping revision of the nation\u2019s immigration system.A loss at the court would also increase the pressure on Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, the Democratic candidates for president, to offer new immigration proposals. Both have said they support Mr. Obama\u2019s use of executive power to defer deportations. Mrs. Clinton said last week that as president, she would create an Office of Immigrant Affairs.Although a loss in the Supreme Court would be a blow to Mr. Obama, it could also energize Latinos to turn out for Democrats this fall in hopes of seizing control of Congress and preventing the election of a candidate like Mr. Trump or Mr. Cruz.Pro-immigration activists are already vowing a huge surge of political energy if the court rules against Mr. Obama. Thousands of Hispanic activists are planning to rally on the steps of the Supreme Court and in front of the White House on Monday. Similar rallies are planned at state capitols and federal buildings across the country, organizers said.\u201cThe tenor of the debate around the issue of immigration \u2014 around Latinos and Muslims \u2014 has been so vitriolic and hostile that there\u2019s a lot of attention,\u201d Ms. Kelley said. \u201cFear can be quite the motivator.\u201dDaniel Stein, the group\u2019s president, described Mr. Obama as a \u201crogue executive\u201d who tried to illegally open America\u2019s borders to immigrants by usurping the power of Congress. Mr. Stein predicted an intense political fight on immigration during the fall election no matter how the court rules.\u201cThis is the most important immigration and separation of powers case to be before the court in decades,\u201d Mr. Stein said. \u201cYou are going to get the same result either way, which is a continuation of the elevated, emotional pitch of the immigration issue in the presidential campaign.\u201dMr. Obama\u2019s supporters agree. Mr. Appleby predicted that Mr. Trump would seize on the court\u2019s ruling if he is the Republican nominee.\u201cIf Obama wins, he\u2019ll say, \u2018Elect me, and I\u2019m going to correct this, reverse this, and build a wall,\u2019 and if Obama loses, then Trump\u2019s going to say, \u2018See, I told you so. What we need is a wall.\u2019 \u201d\u201cThe anti-immigrant bear is loose in the city already,\u201d Mr. Sharry said, adding that Mr. Trump had \u201cactivated the 40 percent of the Republican party that dislikes immigrants and wants to round them up and get rid of them.\u201dSome of Mr. Obama\u2019s immigration policies would be unaffected by the court\u2019s ruling. The president has shifted enforcement priorities to focus more on dangerous criminals and less on immigrants with minor offenses. His administration also ended a program in which immigration agents worked with the local police to find and deport immigrants.But with the court case pending, the president\u2019s aides are wary of offering any robust defense of Mr. Obama\u2019s actions that might be interpreted as an effort to inappropriately sway the justices.\u201cI feel a little limited in what I can say about it, other than to voice confidence in the strength of the legal argument that the Department of Justice will be presenting to the Supreme Court,\u201d said Josh Earnest, the president\u2019s press secretary.Roy Beck, the president of NumbersUSA, said activists on both sides would be anxiously waiting until the court ruling. He said whichever side lost could use the issue to rile up its voters.\u201cSometime in June, we will see through the glass clearly,\u201d Mr. Beck said. \u201cSomething that big, with millions of people involved, this is going to be a big political issue in the campaign.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Drawing the Line on Gossip After the Gawker Trial", "Date": "2016-04-03", "News": "Supported byMediatorI visited those offices last week in part to find out whether the $140 million in civil awards against Gawker, for showing a private sex tape starring the retired wrestler Hulk Hogan, would be its undoing. But I was after a bigger question: Have we finally found the bottom, or more generously, the limit? After decades of journalistic scandal-mongering, each more intrusive than the last \u2014 and then juiced by the Internet \u2014 was the jury in Florida that ruled so decisively against Gawker speaking for the entire culture in saying, \u201cEnough\u201d?I do not come at the question from the monastery. I\u2019ve at times been part of the pack, especially during the early part of my career, which included gossip-writing stints at The New York Post and The Daily News.For Gawker, whose parent company has a net worth of roughly $250 million, it was less a line than a hangman\u2019s noose. Still, the mood at the offices last week seemed unbowed.Not necessarily the stuff to inspire future applicants to the Columbia School of Journalism. And Ms. Dietrick acknowledges the story is \u201cnot the Pentagon Papers.\u201d But it comports with Gawker\u2019s longtime drive to be, as its founder, Nick Denton, says, \u201cUncompromised and uncompromising\u201d in unearthing whatever might drive reader interest, intrigue, truth and web traffic.Suddenly, it was not just the fabulously famous \u2014 Michael Jackson and John F. Kennedy Jr. \u2014 whose lives we were being invited to peer into; it was people just like us. At the same time, as social media made us stars of our own movies, people like us could increasingly relate to the perils of public exposure once known only by the famous.Mr. Denton told me that this phenomenon played a part in the outcome of the trial. He pointed to a moment when a potential juror described being moved to ask a friend to remove an unflattering photo of her from a Facebook post. Social media, he said, made the jury pool \u201cmore sympathetic to the celebrity publicity machine,\u201d which makes similar requests.Such high-minded arguments can be a thin veil when attached to the journalism of exposed genitalia. As Mr. Bollea\u2019s lawyer, Charles Harder, argued to me in an interview last week, if there was one thing the founders didn\u2019t have in mind when they wrote the First Amendment, it was \u201cuncensored sex tapes and secretly filmed private conversations in a bedroom.\u201dMs. Dietrick of Gawker countered by saying that there was nothing unusual about Gawker\u2019s corporate setup and that the company\u2019s appeal would preclude any payments related to Mr. Bollea\u2019s jury award. Gawker\u2019s ability to survive intact depends on whether she is right.Now, the bigger question: Has our culture reached its limit with the invasive and the tawdry?Maybe. But I\u2019m left with a new question: Is that because we\u2019ve become more decorous toward our public figures? Or does it all seem much creepier when, increasingly, we are the public figures?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Republicans Reject Effort to Alter Rules on Allowing New Candidate at Convention", "Date": "2016-04-21", "News": "HOLLYWOOD, Fla. \u2014 A Republican National Committee panel on Thursday overwhelmingly rejected an effort to make preliminary changes to the rules governing the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s convention this summer, batting away a move to make it more difficult for party leaders to draft a \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhite knight\u00e2\u0080\u009d candidate into the race.  On a voice vote, the R.N.C.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rules committee turned back a bid to switch the rules of the convention from those used by the House of Representatives to Robert\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Rules of Order. The committee member who proposed the change, Solomon Yue of Oregon, said in the days leading up to the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spring meeting here that he wanted to alter the rules to prevent the establishment-aligned Republicans running the convention from being able to place in nomination the name of a candidate not already in the race.The House Rules can be interpreted as allowing the chairman of the convention, Speaker Paul D. Ryan, to reopen presidential nominations, while Robert\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Rule would require a majority vote of the conservative-leaning delegates to do so.But the debate over the proposal featured little discussion about the prospect of Republicans\u2019 turning to a presidential candidate not already running, and centered instead on the danger of proposing any significant rule changes when the party may stage its first contested convention in 40 years and was under heavy scrutiny.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to get accused of trying to rig the game,\u00e2\u0080\u009d warned Jeff Kent, the committeeman from Washington.The outcome was not a surprise. Reince Priebus, the party chairman, lobbied members of the rules panel not to submit any changes this week, and the most influential members decided in advance to reject the proposal.  What was striking, though, was how much attention the matter received.  Representatives from the campaigns of both Donald J. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz were present, as were the senior officials in charge of running the convention.  And there were as many members of the news media in the room for the arcane discussion as there were members of the 56-person-strong rules committee. And a bank of cameras was even present to record the deliberations, a rare sight for such internal partly deliberations.   But the prospect of the party going into the convention without a candidate having clinched the nomination, and Donald J. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sustained assault on what he calls \u00e2\u0080\u009ca rigged\u00e2\u0080\u009d process, has raised the stakes on the rules.\u00e2\u0080\u009cAny change we make would be viewed with a large degree of cynicism,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Randy Evans, the committeeman from Georgia.  Mr. Yue, though, was undeterred and told reporters after the meeting that he would raise the issue again when the party meets shortly before the convention in July.  But even if the R.N.C. were to change course and accept his proposal, it would still have to be approved by the convention delegate themselves, who have final say over the rules governing the proceedings.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Labour Party Suspends Former London Mayor Over Hitler Remarks", "Date": "2016-04-28", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 A dispute over accusations of anti-Semitism within the ranks of Britain\u2019s Labour Party escalated on Thursday as the party suspended Ken Livingstone, a former mayor of London, over remarks suggesting that Hitler had at one point supported Zionism.A well-known personality who has often defended Mr. Corbyn, Mr. Livingstone is not a member of Parliament but leads the international policy commission of Labour\u2019s National Executive Committee, its governing body. His suspension comes as a blow to Mr. Corbyn, who has been accused of failing to root out anti-Semitism within the party. The left wing of the Labour Party, to which both Mr. Corbyn and Mr. Livingstone belong, has long been critical of Israeli policy toward the Palestinians \u2014 something its members argue should not be confused with anti-Semitism.The latest dispute occurred in the aftermath of Wednesday\u2019s decision to suspend Ms. Shah, pending an investigation, after it emerged that in 2014, before entering Parliament, she had endorsed a Facebook post displaying a graphic that showed Israel\u2019s outline superimposed on a map of the United States. The map was under the headline, \u201cSolution for Israel-Palestine conflict \u2014 relocate Israel into United States,\u201d with the comment, \u201cProblem solved.\u201dMs. Shah added a note suggesting the plan might \u201csave them some pocket money.\u201dThough Ms. Shah has apologized, Mr. Livingstone inflamed the situation when he was asked in a BBC interview about her suspension on Thursday.\u201cLet\u2019s remember, when Hitler won his election in 1932, his policy then was that Jews should be moved to Israel,\u201d Mr. Livingstone said. \u201cHe was supporting Zionism before he went mad and ended up killing six million Jews.\u201dMr. Livingstone also said that there had been an attempt to \u201csmear Jeremy Corbyn and his associates as anti-Semitic from the moment he became leader.\u201dLater on Thursday, Mr. Livingstone was confronted by John Mann, a Labour lawmaker, who in a series of angry exchanges filmed outside a television studio described him as a \u201cdisgusting Nazi apologist\u201d and accused him of \u201crewriting history.\u201dMoshe Kantor, president of the European Jewish Congress, appealed to Mr. Corbyn to institute a zero-tolerance policy toward anti-Semitism.\u201cCorbyn has to answer why there are special criteria for anti-Semitism as if it is somehow considered a more acceptable form of racism, discrimination and bigotry,\u201d he said in a statement.Mr. Livingstone is no stranger to controversy and has been one of the most acerbic figures on the left wing of the Labour Party for several decades.

{"Headline": "The Unbearable Whiteness of Baseball", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported byOn Sports By instinct, honed reflex and general contrarianism, I root for all \u201cflashy\u201d \u201cshowboats\u201d who are \u201cdisgraces to the game.\u201d It has been this way since I left Boston at age 10 to move to North Carolina, a state with no notable baseball team save the minor-league Durham Bulls, who, at least when I was growing up, seemed more a Hollywood relic than a ball club. Freed from having to like the Red Sox, I began to root for Rickey Henderson of the Oakland Athletics, mostly because I liked how deeply he squatted while taking a lead off first base. He seemed as if he were taunting the pitcher. As I grew older and started feeling alienated from my white classmates, I gravitated toward athletes who, in some way, flouted the white, stoic traditions of American sports \u2014 Allen Iverson, Ken Griffey Jr., Rasheed Wallace, Pedro Martinez. I felt as if this was a moral choice.As this baseball season begins, I\u2019ve been thinking about Henderson because of a problem that has been discussed ad nauseam in sports media: Whether we\u2019re talking about Mike Trout, the young center fielder for the Los Angeles Angels whose beefy efficiency has already put him on track to become one of the greatest players of all time, or Clayton Kershaw, the tall Dodgers lefty with the knee-buckling curveball, or Giancarlo Stanton, the Miami Marlins slugger who signed a $325 million contract, baseball\u2019s pool of young talent just doesn\u2019t captivate fans like the stars of football and basketball.The source of baseball\u2019s diminished hold on our imaginations runs much deeper than social-media strategy. The problem lies in the demographics of baseball\u2019s rosters, and the shameful way in which the majority of its media has failed to pay anything approaching adequate attention to the Latino players who have entered the game over the last two decades.Baseball used to be seen as a reflection of the country\u2019s progress on race. Its 1947 integration, which predated the Civil Rights Act by 17 years, has been upheld as a sign of the sport\u2019s essentially democratic spirit; generations of writers and thinkers, like Philip Roth, Don DeLillo and Chris Rock, found in baseball an embodiment of America\u2019s great experiment, contradictions and all. But there was always a saccharine dimension to the idealism about the game: Baseball represented a very particular, buttoned-up version of American identity, and players who deviated from it were often subject to harsh criticism.The Griffey showdown was one in a long line of coded racial arguments, minor battles between two types: the \u201cstandard\u201d white player and his nonwhite foil. The archetype of the white baseball player has always been a study in negative space. He does not flip his bat after home runs. He does not insult the hard-working fans with talk about politics. He never takes more than one day at a time. As a result, he cannot exist without a foil to embody all those \u201cflashy\u201d or \u201chot\u00adheaded\u201d or \u201cprovocative\u201d things he is not. The foils, of course, have generally been black. But as the demographics of the sport have changed, so, too, has this dynamic.Last year, black players made up just over 8 percent of big-league rosters, down more than 50 percent from 1981. Analysts have been searching for an explanation. Some argue that baseball\u2019s retrograde culture and traditions no longer appeal to inner-city youth who have been mesmerized by the speed of basketball and football. Others focus, far more convincingly, on the rising expenses of youth baseball programs and the relative dearth of scholarships offered by college baseball programs: According to a report from the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport, black players made up only 2.9 percent of Division I college baseball teams in 2014-2015.The decline in black faces in the Major Leagues coincided with a surge in Latino players, who made up roughly 30 percent of rosters last year. But rather than embrace and promote its Spanish-speaking stars, baseball\u2019s media have mostly ignored them. Even the Latino players who were ultimately celebrated and enshrined in the Hall of Fame have had to go through humiliating acculturations to make them seem more American. For example, the press insisted on referring to Roberto Clemente as Bob or Bobby, something he hated. Vladimir Guerrero, the Clemente of the aughts, who hit and threw with a balletic violence, seemed to go through his entire career without a single memorable interview or profile.This year, for the first time ever, all 30 Major League ball clubs will be required to hire a full-time Spanish-language translator. That it took until 2016 for baseball to provide a bridge between Spanish-speaking players and the public shows just how little baseball has cared about any story that fell outside its usual archetypes. But such negligence is shortsighted. It\u2019s hard to imagine the \u201cGriffey in \u201996\u201d campaign without Showalter, or Reggie Jackson\u2019s \u201970s superstardom without the press boxes full of old men who bristled every time he spoke. These stories, and all the conflict, contradiction and excitement they bring, are the very catalysts of nationwide interest.Jay Caspian Kang is a writer at large for the magazine.

The comic has said the verses were a deliberate criticism of the Turkish leader.Mr. B\u00f6hmermann, 35, set off a controversy, putting at its center two of the world\u2019s most prominent leaders: Mr. Erdogan, who has previously sued nearly 2,000 Turks, alleging that they insulted him, and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who last month reached a deal with Mr. Erdogan to stanch the influx of migrants into Europe.Ms. Merkel came under fire after her spokesman said she had agreed that the poem was deliberately hurtful. Critics said she had taken the position out of a concern that Mr. Erdogan would not keep his end of the bargain and that more migrants would arrive en masse.Ms. Merkel said the outdated law would soon be repealed, and most legal experts doubt that Mr. B\u00f6hmermann risks going to prison.The comic had already canceled his weekly show on Thursday, but said Saturday that he would take a longer break. On Facebook, he said that for three years he had satirized the top issues in politics, the arts and the tabloids.

Courtright, told the crowd, proudly describing her as \u00e2\u0080\u009ca local woman that made it big.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMrs. Clinton received an enthusiastic welcome when she and Senator Bob Casey came on stage to Prince\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Go Crazy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Her brothers, Hugh and Tony Rodham, were on hand for the rally, and she wasted no time in recalling her earlier life.Before the event, Mrs. Clinton told the crowd, she stopped at an Italian restaurant in Scranton.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI met people who said things to me like, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I knew your cousins, I knew your uncles,\u2019 \u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI had one man say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t we sled down Court Street one winter?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I said: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Could have been, could have been.

Talking about Mrs. Clinton, Bill Shaw, a retired schoolteacher who has made phone calls to help her, noted how close he lives to the family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cottage. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you listen to her talk,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe seems that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more relaxed when she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in this area.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBut Eileen Occhipinti, a registered nurse, was not moved by Mrs. Clinton\u2019s old-time recollections, though she said she still planed to vote for her. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest: We\u2019ve heard it, and we\u2019ve heard it every time she\u2019s run,\u201d she said.She wanted something more tangible from Mrs. Clinton. \u201cDon\u2019t just use us at election time,\u201d she said. \u201cCome here and throw some money this way.\u201d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

Ms. Musk laughed, her blue-gray eyes twinkling.Ms. von Furstenberg\u2019s team had dressed her that afternoon. Tina Brown walked by, absorbed in her smartphone. \u201cThey both invited me,\u201d Ms. Musk whispered of Ms. Brown and Ms. von Furstenberg. \u201cI hope I get to meet them tonight.\u201d\u201cI was famous until Elon became famous,\u201d Ms. Musk said, half-joking, over oatmeal at Caf\u00e9 Luxembourg the day before.\u201cWe are at a point where people are demanding diversity and inclusion,\u201d said Ivan Bart, president of IMG Models, which has begun representing Ms. Musk. He added, \u201cPeople want to see age and size because that is who their friends are.\u201dBut his client\u2019s motivation is simpler. \u201cI just want to work,\u201d she said.She was born in Regina, Saskatchewan, in 1948, a twin and one of five children, and moved with her family to Pretoria, South Africa, in 1950. Her parents, Joshua and Wyn Haldeman, had a thriving chiropractic practice and a thirst for adventure. In 1952, the couple flew 22,000 miles around the world in a plane Mr. Haldeman brought in pieces from Canada.Her mother prepared maps and slide shows of the trips, which she shared with ladies\u2019 groups and other travelers. \u201cMy parents were very famous, but they were never snobs,\u201d Ms. Musk said.In 1970, she married Errol Musk, an engineer she had met in high school, and a year later, Elon was born, followed by another son, Kimbal, and a daughter, Tosca. Ms. Musk earned a master\u2019s degree in dietetics from the University of the Orange Free State in South Africa. (And later another in nutritional sciences from the University of Toronto.)She worked at home, counseling nutrition clients, while modeling for extra money. The marriage, though, lasted barely nine years, and Ms. Musk left Pretoria for Durban, a coastal town. \u201cI think it\u2019s tougher being in an unhappy marriage,\u201d she said, than being a single mother.In his teens, Elon moved to Pretoria to live with his father, followed by Kimbal. \u201cI think, at the end of the day, she was very hurt,\u201d said Tosca, 41, who stayed with her mother. Ms. Musk would say only that it was \u201csad,\u201d and that their relationship is now good. Kimbal and Elon were not made available for interviews, but in statements Kimbal called his mother \u201camazing\u201d and \u201cdynamic\u201d; Elon chose \u201cawesome.\u201dWith South Africa in upheaval over its apartheid policy, Elon wanted to pursue his interest in technology in Canada, where Ms. Musk\u2019s relatives lived and where she was still a citizen. To pay for his trip to Toronto, Ms. Musk said she sold stock she gave Elon when he was born. \u201cI got a collect call,\u201d she recalled. \u201cHe said: \u2018I\u2019m at the airport. What do I do now?\u2019\u201d Their Canadian relatives weren\u2019t home. \u201cI told him to go to the Y.M.C.A.\u201dShe moved with Tosca to a rent-controlled apartment in Toronto a year later. \u201cWe were not wildly rich people; people forget that,\u201d said Tosca, now a filmmaker living in Los Angeles. Kimbal, a restaurateur and investor, joined his siblings soon after.\u201cThe children knew they wouldn\u2019t have a future in South Africa,\u201d said Julia Perry, Ms. Musk\u2019s longtime stylist.Elon and Kimbal asked their mother to move to San Francisco in 1996, where they started Zip2, a software company. \u201cI was lonely there,\u201d she said. Her children threw her a 50th birthday party at the home of an investor. \u201cJulia flew into San Francisco and said, \u2018We have to get you a nice dress,\u2019\u201d recalled Ms. Musk, adding she told her, \u201c\u2018I can\u2019t afford this.\u2019\u201dMs. Perry had a dress made for Ms. Musk, she said, a gift she believed was from her children. \u201cThey gave me a tiny wooden house and wooden car,\u201d she said. \u201cThey said, \u2018Someday we will buy you a house and a car.\u2019\u201d She now drives a Tesla and owned an apartment in New York for 13 years before moving to Los Angeles in 2013 after visiting Tosca, who had just had twins on her own.Now the Musk family gets together for regular dinners, often at home because Elon is interrupted when they go out. Ms. Musk says she gets at least 100 requests a month from people who want to meet her son.\u201cIt\u2019s all about a pitch,\u201d she said. \u201cI had a New York photographer Facebook Messenger me yesterday and said, \u2018Let\u2019s get together for coffee.\u2019\u201d She hadn\u2019t seen him in six years and asked why. \u201cHe said, \u2018I have a project I want to run by you,\u2019 and I know what that means,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a project he wants Elon to finance.\u201d Ms. Musk politely deferred the request.But being Elon\u2019s mother also has its perks. Last September, Ms. Musk and Nell Rebowe, another model, attended the Banana Republic presentation during New York Fashion Week. There, Charlotte McKinney, the curvaceous GQ cover girl and Carl\u2019s Jr. pitchwoman, walked in with a friend, Zachary Scott, a 26-year-old technology entrepreneur.\u201cNell,\u201d Ms. Musk said she told her friend, \u201cwe have to get a photo with her because it will increase our Instagram followers. I thought: \u2018Oh gosh. I am really going to drop Elon\u2019s name. How else are we going to get a photo?\u2019\u201dMs. Musk was introduced to Mr. Scott. \u201cDo you know Elon Musk?\u201d she asked, adding, \u201cHe\u2019s my son.\u201d Mr. Scott shouted to Ms. McKinney. \u201cThis is Elon Musk\u2019s mother!\u201d\u201cI saw she had 15 agencies in markets all over the world,\u201d Mr. Scott said. \u201cSo I sent her an email and said: \u2018Are you happy with your agencies? They are all small and I think you could have better representation.\u2019\u201dModeling in Los Angeles is tough: fewer fashion shoots, more actresses increasing the competition. \u201cShe knew I was obsessed with Elon,\u201d Mr. Scott said. \u201cBut then she said she was having to go to casting calls and sit in a lawn chair, and I thought: \u2018This is crazy. You\u2019re Maye Musk. How could they treat you that way?\u2019\u201dHe agreed to be her business manager, teaming with Marlon Stoltzman, a fashion agent from South Africa who manages Candice Swanepoel. Mr. Scott said he renegotiated Ms. Musk\u2019s outstanding contracts and began searching for a new home.Mr. Bart of IMG Models started getting calls from agents and others about Ms. Musk last December, and met with her soon after at Chateau Marmont in West Hollywood, Calif.\u201cShe was vocal about wanting to elevate her brand,\u201d he said. But though Ms. Musk is interested in promoting fitness and health, she said she would not take a modeling job that would embarrass her 10 grandchildren. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to see grandma naked,\u201d she said.\u201cShe is the sort of person that it does not matter if it is Vogue or catalog work,\u201d Mr. Bart said. \u201cShe loves to be in the studio. And that is what we are going to do.\u201dOn a recent Monday, Ms. Musk met with Ms. Perry at the design office of Yuna Yang, who is creating Ms. Musk\u2019s outfit for the Met Gala. With the evening\u2019s theme technological, Ms. Yang had constructed an electric-blue pantsuit and cape embellished with brocade, lace and airy ostrich feathers, to be worn with nude Ferragamo heels. Ms. Musk ducked behind a rack of dresses to slip into the outfit, which Ms. Yang and an assistant adjusted to fit her shape.They debated whether she should wear a one-piece undergarment. \u201cI\u2019ve done the jumpsuit thing,\u201d Ms. Musk said. \u201cIt takes a half-hour to take it off, and then people think you got lost.\u201dShe held up her finger. She smiled and shifted her hip. She pouted like a schoolgirl.\u201cThis is my party,\u201d she said, and beamed.Advertisement"}

Mr. Denton, working alongside the Times correspondent Chris Chivers, covered the battlefront, coming uncomfortably close to forces loyal to Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. Their vivid coverage brought attention to a part of the war that had been difficult for foreign journalists to gain access to. After three days they boarded a boat back to Benghazi. Minutes earlier, several photographers, including Mr. Hondros and Mr. Hetherington, arrived in Misurata on that same boat. Mr. Hondros and Mr. Hetherington were killed by a mortar shell three days later.Their deaths affected him deeply, Mr. Denton said, and for a while made it difficult for him to continue covering the war. Still, he and Mr. Chivers returned to Misurata a few days later to follow up on their earlier reports.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cA big part of what drove me to keep covering that story was I believed that continuing their work was a way of honoring Chris and Tim,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Denton said.Since then, Mr. Denton, now 32, has covered dozens of stories for the Times.

{"Headline": "How the $15 Minimum Wage Went From Laughable to Viable", "Date": "2016-04-01", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisBACK in November 2012, when Alterique Hall, an $8-an-hour McDonald\u2019s cashier in New York, joined 200 fast-food workers in the first one-day strike for the Fight for $15 campaign, many scoffed at their demand for $15 an hour as pie in the sky. Frustrated with his meager pay, Mr. Hall said, \u201cIt\u2019s time for a change.\u201d\u201cOnce California and New York go, it is likely that more states will follow,\u201d said Paul K. Sonn, general counsel of the National Employment Law Project, an advocacy group for low-wage workers.In New Jersey, Democratic lawmakers have warned Gov. Chris Christie that if he vetoes a $15 statewide minimum, they will ask voters to approve a constitutional amendment that sets a $15 floor. And in Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser has announced plans to push the City Council to embrace the idea. The Legislatures in Connecticut and Massachusetts are also weighing $15.All this momentum might seem startling at a time when the traditional union movement is on its heels, with the percentage of private-sector workers in unions sliding to 6.7 percent. Indiana, Michigan, West Virginia and Wisconsin have all enacted anti-union, right-to-work laws since 2011. At least the Supreme Court\u2019s 4-4 decision last week saved the nation\u2019s public-sector unions from a crushing defeat that would have hobbled their finances.\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of pro-labor, pro-worker sentiment,\u201d said Michael Kazin, a historian at Georgetown University who has written about populism and popular movements. \u201cInequality is a big issue nowadays. The Fight for $15 has become the way that civil rights was in the early \u201960s \u2014 it\u2019s an issue you can\u2019t avoid. For politicians \u2014 or at least Democratic politicians \u2014 you want to be on the right side.\u201dThe movement for a $15 floor has been partly fueled by the same frustration over wage stagnation and income inequality that has spurred the campaigns of Donald J. Trump and Bernie Sanders. More than 50 million workers earn less than $15 an hour, and many Americans are upset about the loss of millions of factory jobs and the explosion of low-paying service-sector jobs. Mr. Sanders has championed a $15 minimum, but Mr. Trump has attacked the idea, at one point saying that wages are too high. Hillary Clinton has called for a $12 minimum, leaving states and cities to go to $15 if they like.The issue has motivated thousands of protesters to join the Fight for $15\u2019s periodic strikes: What started in one city ultimately swelled to protests in 150 American cities. By many measures, it has become the biggest labor protest in decades, with a wide spectrum of supporters, from college students and inner-city workers to janitors and nursing-home aides. The movement helped to get voters in the Seattle suburb of SeaTac to approve a $15 minimum wage, and not long after in Seattle itself and San Francisco, followed by Los Angeles and Pasadena.\u201cThese victories made people believe this wasn\u2019t some crazy demand,\u201d said Mary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employees International Union, which has spent millions of dollars underwriting the Fight for $15. \u201cThese incremental victories began to add up, and $15 moved from a demand to a standard. Now the fight is, how fast can you get it.\u201d She added that private employers, including Nationwide Insurance, Facebook and U.P.M.C., Pittsburgh\u2019s largest hospital chain, have increasingly embraced a $15 minimum.In California, two union groups were pushing for referendums to create a $15 minimum by 2021. Worried about a divisive, expensive fight, Mr. Brown embraced compromise: phase in $15 by 2022, giving businesses time to adjust. Employers with fewer than 26 workers would be granted a one-year delay, and the governor could suspend increases if California\u2019s economy stumbled.Business groups and some economists warn that a $15 minimum will foster such stumbles. \u201cFifteen is going to be extremely difficult for retailers to work into their business model,\u201d said Bill Dombrowski, president of the California Retailers Association. He said Internet competitors were already hurting many retailers, and \u201cnow you have the Legislature putting an additional burden on brick-and-mortar stores.\u201dDavid Neumark, an economics professor at the University of California, Irvine, estimated that raising the state\u2019s minimum to $15 would reduce employment among the least skilled by 5 percent to 10 percent. Critics of minimum-wage increases predict that workers will be replaced by automation and that businesses will need to raise prices, hurting sales and causing more layoffs. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that a minimum-wage increase will help more people than it hurts,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it takes a lot of people getting a $300 raise to offset someone losing their job.\u201dBut Michael Reich, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said an increase to $15 would have little effect on jobs. He acknowledged that it could lead to more automation and higher prices and less sales volume at some businesses, but, he said, those effects \u201cwould be more than offset by increases in consumer purchasing power. That all results in a very small effect on the economy.\u201dHolly Dias, a $10-an-hour Burger King cashier in Sacramento, hailed the plan for a $15 minimum. \u201cThere are days where I have to choose between buying formula or diapers, paying rent or buying monthly bus passes \u2014 these are choices mothers shouldn\u2019t have to make,\u201d said Ms. Dias, who receives food stamps and Medicaid to help her and her 5-month-old son. \u201cMaybe this will mean I won\u2019t have to be on public assistance.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "Bullfighting was something Alex Quesada watched on television when he was growing up in Spain. Not because it was interesting. But because as a young man, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what you do. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe big corridas are just like the Super Bowl,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.  On a visit to his home country five years ago, Mr. Quesada met To\u00c3\u00b1ete, the 13-year-old son of a family friend. Mr. Quesada was struck by the boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s infatuation with bullfighting \u00e2\u0080\u0094 he was already training to become a matador. Mr. Quesada wrote off To\u00c3\u00b1ete\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interest as a passing fancy, however. After all, his mother is a minor celebrity in Spain, and his father is a wealthy hotel developer. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy would a kid with all the education, all the possibilities for a career choice, and all the support he could want, choose to become a bullfighter in Spain today?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Quesada asked. For a tradition rooted in machismo and bravado, bullfighting now includes people like To\u00c3\u00b1ete, who incessantly fiddles with his iPhone and frequently communicates on social media. To highlight the dissonance between tradition and modernity, Mr. Quesada used black-and-white in some photos to throw off the viewer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sense of time. In one image, To\u00c3\u00b1ete, shirtless and poised, practices in a field. His body is taut, and his stance almost poetic. Were it not for the fresh sneakers on his feet, it would seem as if the photo was from another era. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat picture could have been shot 100 years ago,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Quesada said. To\u00c3\u00b1ete had only four bullfights during the two-week stretch in which Mr. Quesada followed him, so many photos showcase the behind-the-scenes life of an up-and-comer in modern-day Spain: To\u00c3\u00b1ete getting changed into his traditional matador garb in hotel rooms; perfecting his moves with live cows at local breeding ranches. (Breeders look on to identify vacas bravas, or cows with fighting spirit, that are later bred to produce fighting bulls.)Although Mr. Quesada admits he found To\u00c3\u00b1ete to be spoiled at times, he was impressed with the level of concentration To\u00c3\u00b1ete applied to his practice, and the transformation he made before bullfights. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe gets very serious, very solemn, very quiet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Quesada said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhich is probably something you have to do if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be in front of a charging bull.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In one of To\u00c3\u00b1ete\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest encounters, Mr. Quesada estimated that 15,000 people were in attendance. What he recalled most was the kill. Traditionally, the kill comes after the bull has been weakened, and dizzied through fancy cape work. The most experienced matadors then deliver the coup de gr\u00c3\u00a2ce with one plunge of the sword. But To\u00c3\u00b1ete still has much to learn. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe stuck the sword in five times,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was a mess.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Although Mr. Quesada renders many of To\u00c3\u00b1ete\u00e2\u0080\u0099s moves, poses and cape work with grace, he says it was hard to find any beauty in the fatal blow. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe bull bellows,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe makes this horrible sound as he dies,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really upsetting.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Mr. Quesada portrayed this moment, as bull and matador stare each other down, their faces inches apart. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI saw the communication,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Quesada said, reflecting on the picture. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat bull was pleading for his life.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}

Chun, who is presiding over the case. The falsehood, Mr. Shechtman added, was \u201cnot accidental or inconsequential\u201d but rather was \u201ca major lie.\u201dSeizing on this discrepancy, Mr. Shechtman set about parsing Mr. Vargas\u2019s answers in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn on Wednesday. How, he asked, was it possible that someone in the juror\u2019s \u201cfamily\u201d had been arrested but that none of his \u201cclose relatives\u201d had suffered the same fate?\u201cI was never close to my father,\u201d Mr. Vargas said, adding that he had been raised in a series of orphanages and boys\u2019 homes.\u201cSo you lied,\u201d Mr. Shechtman said.\u201cThat\u2019s your opinion,\u201d Mr. Vargas answered. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I did.\u201dAfter sparring like that for 20 or 30 minutes, Mr. Shechtman asked Mr. Vargas about several posts he had made on Facebook before the trial began. The posts had an anti-law-enforcement flavor: \u201cWhat\u2019s up w/the police?\u201d one asked. \u201cAre the police a legal gang?\u201d another said.\u201cDidn\u2019t you think it was important to tell the court you had these feelings?\u201d Mr. Shechtman asked, referring to yet more posts: some about revolution, others about martial law.Looking annoyed, Mr. Vargas said, \u201cIf someone does something that makes me angry, I speak out.\u201dWhile there is no universal question form for jury selection, it is standard practice in trials of police officers to ask jurors about their own and their family\u2019s interactions with the police. But lawyers \u2014 and judges \u2014 can ask those questions in their own way and in their own words. Mr. Vargas, for one, said he was simply responding to the inquiries in their most literal sense.\u201cIt is not unusual for jurors to shade their answers differently to different questions,\u201d said Roy Futterman, a jury expert at Doar, a litigation consulting firm in the city. \u201cJudges are not keen to overturn a jury\u2019s final verdict, and this judge will have to decide if this juror did something truly egregious and was trying to get on the case as a stealth juror.\u201dThe hearing is set to continue on Thursday.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Teachable Moment on the Need for Colon Cancer Screening", "Date": "2016-04-04", "News": "Jane Brody on health and aging.Although colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer, it is the second leading cause of cancer deaths, after lung cancer. Detection guidelines call for screening to begin at 50 for most people, but colon cancer is now increasing in people under 50, and everyone should be aware of the risks and early warning signs.While the circumstances that led to President Garrett\u00e2\u0080\u0099s diagnosis have not been publicly revealed, I do know that colon cancer can nearly always be prevented through detection and removal of its precursor lesions, commonly called adenomas or adenomatous polyps. I also know that it can most often be cured if one of several screening tests leads to early detection, before the cancer has spread beyond its point of origin.More than 690 organizations have joined the effort to remove barriers to screening that can include cost, transportation and resistance to what most people view as an unpleasant experience. Colonoscopy, the gold standard for detecting cancer and removing precancerous polyps, has the dubious distinction of being the least pleasant of all the available screening tests. But the other options, which involve collecting a sample of one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stool for detection of possible cancer, are no one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s favorites either.I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done both \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in fact, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had three colonoscopies, at ages 50, 60 and 70. The test itself is done under mild sedation, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never felt any pain, only slight pressure, while being scoped.It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the preparation for a colonoscopy \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the need to clean out the contents of the colon to make its lining clearly visible \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that I and many others find most taxing. The prep is not a walk in the park, but then again, neither is cancer.The fact remains that being screened for colon cancer can save your life. Since 1975, death rates from colorectal cancer have dropped significantly and screening is responsible for slightly more than half that decline, the cancer society reports. The decline in deaths has accelerated in the last decade, dropping nearly 3 percent a year. This is primarily attributed to more people getting colonoscopies at appropriate ages.For most people without a family history or symptoms, colonoscopy is generally recommended starting at age 50, then every 10 years if nothing untoward is found.One adult in 20 in this country will develop colon cancer sooner or later, 85 percent of them after age 50. Among the remaining 15 percent whose cancers develop before 50, many have a family history of cancer that suggests it may be wise to start screening at 40. (There remain a heart-rending few in whom this cancer develops at an especially early age, say, at age 20 or 30, in people who had no indication that they needed to be screened.)Screening with a traditional colonoscopy can find these growths and, at the same time, the doctor can remove them and head off a possible cancer.A newer technique called computed tomographic colonography, or virtual colonoscopy, uses a CT scan instead of a scope to pick up these lesions. It, too, requires cleaning out the colon before the scan. And if polyps are detected, a traditional colonoscopy is needed to remove them.The other tests that check the stool for signs of cancer are less invasive, safer and easier to do, but they are also less definitive and less likely to detect signs of hazardous polyps before a cancer arises in them. They involve stool samples enclosed in kits that are sent to a lab for analysis. If the test result is positive, a follow-up colonoscopy is then needed to find the reason.One, called the guaiac-based fecal occult blood test, is based on a chemical reaction that can find hidden blood in the stool. Before the test is done, certain foods and drugs must be avoided. If blood is found, it could come from a source other than a colon cancer, like ulcers, hemorrhoids or diverticulitis, so a colonoscopy would then be needed.Another option, the fecal immunological test, involves fewer pretest conditions but may require collecting stool samples from more than one bowel movement. A third, the stool DNA test, looks for telltale genetic material (mutations from a cancer or precancerous polyp) in the stool. The test currently available, Cologuard, also checks for blood in the stool and may prove to be the most effective of these noninvasive tests, Dr. Strum said.Traditional colonoscopy is unequivocally best at finding cancer and precancer, but the best screening test is one that you will do as often as is recommended. So the message here is doing something is always better than doing nothing to avoid death from colon cancer.Equally important is attending to known risk factors \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and preventives \u00e2\u0080\u0094 for colon cancer. Age is one: The prevalence of potentially dangerous polyps rises sharply after age 50, studies of tens of thousands of people have shown. However, colorectal cancer is now rising among people in their 40s, prompting Dr. Strum to suggest a thorough evaluation of any suspicious symptoms among people younger than 50.Other known risk factors are smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, obesity and a diet rich in red meat. Protective factors include eating lots of fruits and vegetables, getting regular physical exercise, using menopausal hormone-replacement therapy, and taking a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) at least twice a week for a year or longer. Drinking coffee, too, has been linked to a reduced risk \u00e2\u0080\u0094 54 percent lower among those who consume two-and-a-half cups a day or more.Most promising, Dr. Strum wrote, is daily use of a baby aspirin (81 milligrams) for 10 or more years, which also helps protect against cardiovascular disease. However, the benefit of any NSAID must be balanced against an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, he cautioned.Related:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "Millions With Leg Pain Have Peripheral Artery Disease", "Date": "2016-04-11", "News": "Jane Brody on health and aging.More than eight million older Americans have a condition that can cause leg pain when they walk even short distances. Yet half of those who have the condition don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know it and consequently don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get treated for it, putting themselves at risk for a heart attack, stroke or worse.It may seem odd that people who have serious difficulty walking normal distances would not know something is wrong and get checked out. Yet, as Dr. Kullo noted, P.A.D. is both underdiagnosed and undertreated. And the number of cases of P.A.D. is only likely to rise as the population ages, he said.\u00e2\u0080\u009cA lot of people limit their activity for other reasons, like a hip problem, back pain or breathing difficulty, and may not push themselves hard enough to provoke symptoms of P.A.D.,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. Paul W. Wennberg, a cardiologist and specialist in vascular disease at the Mayo Clinic. Or they may think their limited ability to exercise is to be expected, given their advancing years. Still others, Dr. Wennberg said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmay have only minimal disease in their legs, or they adapt their lifestyle to where they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t notice symptoms anymore.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn other words, since walking brings on pain, people typically find myriad ways to avoid doing it.But this very response \u00e2\u0080\u0094 remaining sedentary \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is counterproductive, Dr. Wennberg said, because the best treatment for P.A.D. is exercise: Walking up to the point of pain, then resting until the pain subsides, then walking again, repeating the sequence until you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve walked for 20 to 30 minutes (not counting rests) every day.With this approach, Dr. Wennberg explained, exercise tolerance gradually increases as collateral blood vessels form in the legs that can compensate for blockages in the main arteries.Just as teachers often have star pupils, Dr. Wennberg talks fondly of a man who was his star patient. When first seen, the patient, a 76-year-old Minnesotan, was afflicted with such severe peripheral artery disease that he couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t walk much beyond his backyard. Although a nonsmoker, the man had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which also limited how far he could walk. Yet he desperately wanted to be able to hike the nature trail behind his house, which motivated him to follow the doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prescription religiously: Walk until it hurts, rest, then walk some more. Repeat several times a day.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe got a treadmill to use in his house, and he walked outside whenever he could,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Wennberg recalled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn just three months, he had doubled his walking distance as measured on a treadmill in the lab, and before long he was able to walk the mile-long nature trail.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Not only did the exercise prescription reduce his leg pain, it also improved his breathing. Together, these benefits enabled him to walk the desired distance without pain or fatigue.Another of Dr. Wennberg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s patients, Donovan Merseth, 76, of Zumbrota, Minn., said he walks his two dogs four or five times a day, accumulating daily walks of three to four miles. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe more active I am, the better I feel,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Merseth said in an interview. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI walk at a moderate pace,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, calling his exercise \u00e2\u0080\u009ca senior power walk.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe suggested that doctors ask, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the most strenuous thing you do in a typical week? Do you do any routine exercise, like walking? Do you get pain when you walk?\u00e2\u0080\u009dA simple noninvasive test that can be done in any doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office, called the ankle-brachial index, or ABI, test, can reveal the likelihood of P.A.D. The test, which takes only a few minutes, compares blood pressure measured at the ankle with blood pressure measured in the arm. Lower pressure in the leg is an indication of P.A.D.The index is calculated by dividing the systolic (top number) blood pressure in the arteries near the ankles by the systolic blood pressure in the arms. A low number strongly suggests a narrowing or blockage in the arteries that supply blood to the legs.Follow-up tests, like an ultrasound exam of the arteries to the brain, may be done as well. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blockage in one area of the body, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s likely also to be in another,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Wennberg noted.Not surprisingly, the risk factors for P.A.D. closely match those for coronary heart disease: smoking (currently or formerly), diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Consider asking your doctor to do the ABI test if you are 50 or older and have any of the above risk factors, even if you haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t yet noticed a problem with walking (though insurance may not cover the cost if you lack symptoms).However, Dr. Wennberg wrote, the ABI test done during rest may miss peripheral artery disease in nearly one-third of patients; they may require an ABI test following exercise on a treadmill to reveal the problem. The blood pressure measurements must be taken within a minute of stopping the exercise.Given the same risk factors, African-Americans are more likely than Caucasians to develop P.A.D.The average age at which people develop P.A.D. is 70, Dr. Wennberg said, adding that it occurs a decade earlier in people with diabetes and even earlier in people who both smoke and have diabetes.Smoking increases the risk of developing P.A.D. fourfold, and more than 80 percent of people with the condition are current or former smokers.Related:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

Grassley of Iowa, a Republican and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, will host Judge Merrick B.

{"Headline": "The Digital Afterlife of Lost Family Photos", "Date": "2016-04-26", "News": "Supported byOn PhotographyThe photographs were Polaroids, taken between the 1970s and the 2000s. Zun Lee bought them at flea markets, at garage sales or on eBay. Most of them depicted African-Americans: people wearing stylish clothes, relaxing in the yard, celebrating birthdays. A few depicted people in prison uniforms. All the photographs had somehow been separated from their original owners and had become what Lee calls \u201corphaned Polaroids.\u201dFound photographs have long been important to artists like Lee. Photos taken by amateurs can sometimes acquire new value on account of their uniqueness, their age or simply the knowledge that they were once meaningful to a stranger. As part of a group, they can evoke a collector\u2019s sensibility or tell us something about a historical period in a way professional photographs might not. For Lee, collecting found photographs of African-\u00adAmericans \u2014 a project he called \u201cFade Resistance\u201d \u2014 had an additional and deeply personal meaning.Lee was raised in Germany by Korean parents. In his 30s, his mother told him that the man who raised him was not his biological father. But because her relationship with that man, who was black, had been fleeting, she refused to tell her son more about him. This revelation, at once momentous and limited, changed Lee\u2019s life. To make sense of his personal loss, and to explore his connectedness to black America, he took up photography. I became friends with Lee around the time he began making pictures of black fathers and their children in the Bronx and elsewhere; that project led to a book, \u201cFather Figure,\u201d for which I wrote a preface. Later, Lee began to collect the Polaroids \u2014 thousands of them \u2014 that ended up in \u201cFade Resistance.\u201dWho took these photos? Who do they depict? The basic contextual details we would usually expect from snapshots are missing here. The absence of this information is bittersweet: We are bewildered, but we are also ferried over from imagery into imagination. In Lee\u2019s case, the story of his orphaned Polaroids took a surprising turn. When he uploaded some of them to Facebook, the social network\u2019s facial-recognition technology immediately began to match them with real people. Lee was not sure who was doing the tagging. Intrigued and wary, he sent a message to one individual who was tagged in several of the pictures. There was no response. Then, several weeks later, he got a message from the same man: a curt request that he take the pictures down.Twenty-two of the pictures I bought that day featured the same woman at different stages in her life. She was sometimes alone and sometimes with family. But there she was, in picture after picture, from as far back as the late 1930s until at least 1980. She was dark-haired (was she Italian?) and had an unmistakable, toothy smile and cheeks that rose high on her face. A few of these photos had inscriptions, in pencil or pen, on the back or along the white border on the front. \u201cRock of Gibralter [sic] \u2014 Margaret, Kate & myself.\u201d \u201cLake Huntington, May 1939.\u201d I felt I was somehow rescuing these pictures from the anonymity of the pile. I named the woman Mrs. X.I didn\u2019t put my images of Mrs. X online, in part because I didn\u2019t want anyone to recognize her. I also felt a little guilty: \u201cmy\u201d images of Mrs. X? I had the sense that my possession of these pictures was not their ideal posterity. They should be in the keeping of people who knew this woman, who cared about her. (Imagine your own most precious family photos permanently in the hands of a complete stranger.) And yet, despite my doubts, I was also happy to have the pictures. Here she is in 1939 in her bathing suit, here she is with her husband (?), her son (?). Here she is abroad. We have color pictures now. Then she\u2019s noticeably older, and the husband (?) is no longer there, but there are friends (?) and relatives (?). I looked at each of the photographs through a mesh of question marks, sustained by Mrs. X\u2019s absolutely distinctive smile. From time to time, returning to the pictures, I am aware that I am touching a photograph that Mrs. X also touched. Is this woman still alive? It\u2019s possible, but I doubt it.The photos Zun Lee collected, digitally scanned and put out in public, have had a different life from the photos in my collection. He wrote back to the man who was tagged in some of them and suggested meeting. After all, he did not consider himself the owner of the photos, only their custodian. Perhaps, Lee offered, he might fly to Los Angeles and hand the photos over in person. The man said no. Lee was disappointed but sympathetic. He said he\u2019d already been thinking about how databases and tags are not neutral, how they can wind up being hostile toward communities of color. \u201cI completely understood,\u201d Lee told me. \u201cThis man was saying, \u2018We are not willing participants.\u2019 The black body is used as a commodity, as something that is surveilled. The man was telling me, \u2018No, you\u2019re not welcome, this is not art, get the hell out of our lives.\u2019 And I understood it.\u201dPeople have a right to be skeptical about the encounter between the analog experience of life and the futuristic algorithms that often prioritize what is possible over what it desirable. Already there are reports of churches scanning worshipers\u2019 faces to determine who attends regularly, the better to know whom to ask for donations. Shops match your face to a database so that they can greet you by name \u2014 or identify you as a potential shoplifter. Black people in particular, against the historical backdrop of surveillance and state hostility and corporate disregard, have a right to doubt these technologies. There was a recent report of Google\u2019s photo app automatically tagging a photo of two black people as \u201cgorillas\u201d \u2014 another instance of machines replicating the nastier prejudices of their human teachers.Lee\u2019s pleasure in the Polaroids he bought was also shadowed by questions: Why had so many families lost their things to secondhand dealers and estate sales? Behind these photos of bell-bottoms, Afros, birthday parties and interiors rich with period detail lay the invisible stories of evictions, dispossessions or separations. The Polaroids were evidence of joy, but the fate of the photographs themselves was unhappy. Lee acceded to his interlocutor\u2019s request and took the tagged photos down.In my collection, there is a picture from the late 19th or early 20th century, an image I think about as much as the entire series of Mrs. X pictures. This seated woman wears a long dark skirt, dark stockings and polished dark shoes. Her hair is a neatly parted mass of black, almost an Afro. She wears a pale jacket and is seated outside, next to a door and a brick wall. She looks off to her right. Below, not on the white border of the photograph but directly on the photograph itself, someone has written, in ink, the single word \u201cnigger.\u201dI doubt that the person responsible for this vandalism knew this woman personally. Perhaps it was written decades later. The word, after all, has been with us a long time, as has the spitefulness with which it is deployed. But whenever the defacement occurred, I feel it has something in common with both a contemporary form of aggression and a very old one. Black Americans, for most of their time in this country, were named, traded and collected against their will. They were branded \u2014 physically tagged \u2014 both to hurt and to control them. The woman in my photograph has been tagged, too, semantically. The written slur is like a brand.Lee sent me a screen shot of his Facebook page as it looked while he was uploading a batch of Polaroids. Several of the images are of men in prison. There are white rectangles framing the faces, and there is an instruction above each picture: \u201cClick Anywhere to Tag.\u201d That mild directive \u2014 an automated instruction from Facebook \u2014 suddenly seems sinister. What if these people don\u2019t wish to be tagged? What are their rights? These doubts have led Lee to focus more on an offline display of these images. I faced the more immediate conundrum of illustrating this column and decided not to show the faces of the people in my collection.American history has long struggled to believe the joys and intimacies of black American life. Social media, fortunately, makes those human realities visible to a much larger swath of the population than ever before. But there\u2019s also a paradox: To make intimacy public is often to render it less intimate. For all of us, but especially for those in communities of color, being digitally tracked does not solve the conundrums of inequality. Whatever else the machines learn, they\u2019ll have to learn about our sense of privacy too, the human necessity of leaving some things untagged and undeclared.Teju Cole is a photographer, essayist and the author of two works of fiction, \u201cOpen City\u201d and \u201cEvery Day Is for the Thief.\u201d He teaches at Bard College.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will You Sprint, Stroll or Stumble Into a Career?", "Date": "2016-04-05", "News": "Supported byAt the age of 18, G. Stanley Hall left his home in the tiny village of Ashfield, Mass., for Williams College, just 35 miles away, with a goal to \u201cdo something and be something in the world.\u201d His mother wanted him to become a minister, but the young Stanley wasn\u2019t sure about that plan. He saw a four-year degree as a chance to explore.Though Hall excelled at Williams, his parents, who were farmers, considered his undergraduate years a bit erratic. He didn\u2019t think he had the requirements for a pastor, but nonetheless enrolled in Union Theological Seminary in New York after graduation. The big city was intoxicating, and living there persuaded him to abandon his religious studies. After securing a loan, he set off for Germany to study philosophy, travel and visit the theaters, bars and dance halls of Berlin.\u201cWhat exactly are you doing over there?\u201d his father sternly asked. Hall added physiology and physics to his academic pursuits and told his parents he was thinking about getting a Ph.D. in philosophy. \u201cJust what is a Doctor of Philosophy?\u201d his mother wanted to know.His parents wanted him to come home and get a real job, and even Hall, having \u201cscarcely tried my hand in the world to know where I can do anything,\u201d wondered what was next. He was out of money and in debt, so he returned home after his parents refused to support him financially. He was 27 years old.Hall\u2019s story is similar to that of many young Americans today. They go off to college, resist pressures to choose a job-connected major, then drift after graduation, often short of money and any real plan. But here\u2019s the difference: Stanley Hall grew up in a totally different America, the one of the mid-1800s.We think this kind of lengthy takeoff is relatively new, but even in the 19th and early 20th centuries, when the economy offered fewer career choices, there were college graduates who roamed through their third decade of life. Hall was an outlier, of course, as most of his generation launched into adulthood right after high school, if they even went. But his story might serve to lessen the anxiety of today\u2019s parents about their own children\u2019s long stumble toward independence: Stanley Hall went on to great success.He eventually earned an advanced degree in psychology, taught at Antioch College, Harvard and Johns Hopkins and became president of Clark University in Massachusetts, where he developed a fascination with the period in life between childhood and adulthood. He founded the American Psychological Association and in 1904 wrote an influential book about a new life stage he called \u201cadolescence.\u201dHall described this transitional period \u2014 between ages 14 and 24 \u2014 as full of \u201cstorm and stress.\u201d But in reality, the adolescent stage in the early 1900s was much shorter than Hall imagined. Teenagers were able to get a solid full-time job right after high school, followed quickly by marriage and parenthood. It wasn\u2019t until around the middle of the last century that the job market began requiring that a college degree be added to the equation, and with the G.I. Bill allowing returning World War II veterans to go for free, enrollments boomed.That postwar era cemented in our minds an idea that remains to this day: Teenagers graduate from high school, earn a college degree, secure a job, and move out of their childhood home \u2014 all by the age of 22 or so.But by the 1960s, as Americans started spending more time in college, the trend of a relatively quick launch to adulthood was ending. Census figures show that the number of 19- to 24-year-olds living with their parents started edging up, from 30 percent in 1960, to 35 percent in 1980, to 47 percent today.The difference between the \u201cboomerang generation\u201d of the 1960s and 1970s and now is that manufacturing was still the foundation of the economy, allowing more than one pathway to solid middle-class jobs. The 1970s marked the last full decade when a large slice of the population didn\u2019t need a college degree for financial success. The recession of the early 1980s effectively killed off manufacturing, and with the next decade\u2019s technology revolution, the wage premium for attending college started to speed up, turning into a runaway train. In 1983, the wage premium \u2014 how much more a typical bachelor\u2019s degree recipient earns compared to a high school graduate \u2014 was 42 percent. Today, it surpasses 80 percent.The huge run-up in the number of undergraduate and graduate students \u2014 eight million more than in 1980, according to the National Center for Education Statistics \u2014 has led to further delays in passing the milestones of adulthood, forever changing how we view the transition from education to the work force. In the 1980s, college graduates achieved financial independence, defined as reaching the median wage, by the time they turned 26, according to Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Education and the Workforce. In 2014, they didn\u2019t hit that mark until their 30th birthday.In the 1990s, Jeffrey Jenson Arnett, a psychology professor at the University of Missouri, interviewed young people around the country and determined that his subjects felt both grown up and not quite so grown up at exactly the same time. This led Dr. Arnett to conclude that the period between 18 and 25 was a distinct stage separate from both adolescence and young adulthood. In 2000, he published a paper defining this slice of life as \u201cemerging adulthood,\u201d a phrase that immediately entered the cultural lexicon, especially for parents trying to figure out why their children were struggling to launch into adulthood.\u201cEmerging adulthood is a time of life when many different directions remain possible,\u201d Dr. Arnett wrote, \u201cwhen little about the future has been decided for certain, when the scope of independent exploration of life\u2019s possibilities is greater for most people than it will be at any other period of the life course.\u201dBy the time I caught up with Dr. Arnett, he had moved to Clark University. In the fall of 2014, 14 years after he had coined the term, I was curious whether the journey to adulthood was getting even longer.\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he said. \u201cThe changes that are happening are permanent structural changes that have only sped up all over the world.\u201d The biggest change, he said, is the move to an information economy that requires even more education and job-hopping in one\u2019s 20s.In the journey to adulthood, they are either Sprinters, Wanderers or Stragglers.Sprinters start fast right out of the gate. They pick a major early on and stick with it, enabling a progression of internships that look more and more impressive with each year. Some have the perfect job lined up on graduation; others are laserlike in their focus, moving from job to job up the career ladder. They have little or no student-loan debt, freeing them to pick job opportunities without regard to pay.But speed alone doesn\u2019t define this group. Some are slow but methodical, assembling the building blocks for a successful career by investing in their own human capital, perhaps in graduate or professional school, before hitting the job market.Lily Cua is a classic Sprinter. Well before she got her degree in finance from Georgetown University, she secured a plum position as a consultant with PricewaterhouseCoopers. The job came as so many do these days, from a summer internship. The recruiter, a Georgetown alumnus, was impressed with her Chinese minor and high grades \u2014 signals, he told her, that she was willing to take on demanding assignments. By the end of the summer Ms. Cua was offered a full-time job, 10 months before graduation. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my dream to work there,\u201d she admitted. But she knew it would provide a launching pad. \u201cI wanted to get skills I didn\u2019t have coming out of college. I wanted to work with really smart people. I wanted to be mentored by someone looking out for me.\u201dSuch job hopping is typically seen as a lack of commitment or direction \u2014 and it could be \u2014 but it can also boost chances for more satisfying and higher paying work in the decades that follow.\u201cWe are living in an increasingly complex society with many more choices for occupations,\u201d Dr. Siu said \u2014 more than anyone can reasonably explore while in college. Trying out different occupations is another reason 20-somethings need a longer runway to life\u2019s milestones.The reality, however, is that a growing number of emerging adults lack the financial flexibility to change jobs or to take low-paying positions that might be great career starters. The problem? Student loans.Mr. Busteed wasn\u2019t surprised when I told him that nearly every young person I met at the 1776 incubator was free of student debt. According to Gallup\u2019s polling data, most entrepreneurs owe less than $10,000 in student loans \u2014 debt any greater has a negative impact on the decision to start a business.In the end, fewer emerging adults willing to take a chance on their business idea makes it harder for everyone else to get a job.When I met Valerie Lapointe for coffee, she was studying for the G.R.E. Her job search had stalled, and she had decided to do what many recent college graduates do when they get stuck: go back to school for yet another degree.The master\u2019s degree has become the new bachelor\u2019s degree. In 2013, the most recent year available, about 760,000 master\u2019s degrees were awarded, up 250 percent since 1980. Nearly 30 percent of college graduates are back in school within two years. Graduate school gives structure and direction.As we sipped our coffee, Ms. Lapointe, her smile as quick as her wit, quipped about the relevance of our setting. After all, coffee shops have become emblematic of those wandering through their 20s. The Starbucks barista with a bachelor\u2019s is the underemployed stereotype.\u201cI have applied for jobs from here to kingdom come,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you are unemployed, you can apply for jobs all day.\u201d She likened her job search to dating. \u201cYou look great on paper, they interview you, but then they never call you back. You get used to the rejection.\u201dMs. Lapointe grew up in the affluent suburbs of Northern Virginia. She graduated from a top-notch high school with a 3.9 grade-point average in 2008, a year marked by a boom in the number of 18-year-olds across the country (so lots of competition to get into the college of her choice) as well as by one of the worst economic crashes in the nation\u2019s history (so lots of unemployed recent college graduates).\u201cI had no idea what I wanted to do with my life when I went to college,\u201d she said. I asked her why she hadn\u2019t taken a gap year to discover interests or explore majors at a local community college. \u201cThere was never a question in my parents\u2019 mind that I\u2019d go directly on to college, the question was just where,\u201d she said. \u201cIt had worked out for them, so why not me?\u201dI heard similar stories from many recent graduates with college-educated parents \u2014 that a four-year college was the only pathway right out of high school.Wait-listed at James Madison University, Ms. Lapointe landed at the University of Mary Washington, a public college in south-central Virginia. Unsure about a major, she filled her schedule with general-education courses her first two years. Then she took a journalism class, and she was hooked.But Mary Washington didn\u2019t have a journalism major. Ms. Lapointe found as many writing courses as she could and joined the student newspaper. She thought about transferring but was on track to finish her degree in just three years to save money.\u201cBy the time I figured it out, it was too late,\u201d she said.That described Ms. Lapointe. She took a job as a nanny while living at home. By the time she started seriously looking for a job in her field of interest a year and a half after graduation, she was already competing with the next crop of graduates. She paid to enroll in a summer program that matched her to a media internship, hoping it would lead to better employment prospects. It didn\u2019t. A video production company laid her off after three months. She then patched together a series of jobs through temp agencies.\u201cI knew it would be difficult but not this difficult,\u201d she said. Signing onto Facebook sometimes made her feel even farther behind, as friends posted the highlights of their daily lives. \u201cI honestly believed that I\u2019d have more of my life together.\u201dFinally, last fall, at 25, she began a master\u2019s program at Northwestern, with a scholarship covering half the tuition. \u201cSo now,\u201d she said, \u201clife is good, debt is mounting, and I\u2019m hoping my job prospects will be better once I finish. I do feel far more career-minded than I did as an undergrad, and therefore in a better position to take advantage of career services and internship opportunities, and to utilize the resources a university has to offer.\u201dMany young people are similarly derailed. They settle for any paying job, mostly outside their major, because of financial pressures. Some bypass meaningful internships or jobs because they find them menial or can\u2019t live on a paltry salary (or as with most internships, none at all). And some go back to school and deeper into debt. According to the University of Arizona study of the class of 2011, student debt more than tripled for those not working while in graduate school, from $22,000 to $76,000.Perhaps most critical for Wanderers is that the bulk of salary increases tend to come in the first decade of employment. Three-quarters of a man\u2019s wage growth happens in the first 10 years, according to Richard A. Settersten Jr., director of the Hallie E. Ford Center for Healthy Children and Families at Oregon State University.Lisa Kahn, an economist at Yale, found that students graduating from college in a weak economy have lower earnings even decades later. The graduating classes immediately following the 2008 recession, for instance, now earn a third less than those who left college just a few years earlier and had a better economic footing getting started. New graduates don\u2019t shop for jobs as much in a bad economy, Dr. Kahn explained, and job shopping is how they get bigger paychecks in those critical first years.The longer Wanderers drift through their 20s, the harder it becomes to catch up.On a crisp fall evening in 2014, I found myself in Portland, Ore., the city where \u201cyoung people go to retire,\u201d to steal the tag line from the satirical television show \u201cPortlandia.\u201d With its mountains, mild winters, outdoorsy reputation and streak of independence, Portland has become a magnet for Stragglers \u2014 those who spend much of their 20s looking for what they were meant to do.In the Eastside industrial district, I met up with Josh Mabry. He was about to turn 30, and sported a military buzz cut and forearms filled with tattoos. After a decade of dead-end jobs and false starts at a handful of colleges, he was finally settling into something he cared about: woodworking. Mr. Mabry always liked working with his hands. His father and grandfather were woodworkers. But he took his last woodshop class in seventh grade. Guidance counselors were pushing college.After high school, he followed a girlfriend two hours south to Eugene and enrolled in graphic design classes at Lane Community College. But he fell into the party scene and dropped out. \u201cI was drifting,\u201d he admitted.\u201cI knew that by the time I turned 30 I needed to figure something out for myself,\u201d he said. \u201cI finally have some sort of path.\u201dThe longer life expectancy for children born today means that we can chart new routes to adulthood that space out opportunities in different ways. We no longer should think of college as one physical place we go to at one time in our lives \u2014 i.e., age 18. Yet educators continue to press on families a one-size-fits-all route. It\u2019s almost impossible in our hypercompetitive culture to think differently as a parent about when a college education should happen. The result: Finding a pathway to a fulfilling career and a meaningful life has become much more difficult than it ever should be.\u2022In Dr. Settersten\u2019s critical thinking class at Oregon State University, the classroom conversation on the day of my visit wandered to a discussion of what the students, mostly seniors, wanted to do next in life. Many said they planned to go on to graduate school.Dr. Settersten asked how many of them knew their professors well enough to request a letter of recommendation for the application. Only a smattering of hands went up. He wondered aloud: Why hadn\u2019t more of them visited him during office hours, an easy way to build a one-on-one relationship with a professor who teaches hundreds of students a semester?Dr. Settersten\u2019s research focuses on what it means to become an adult today. Unlike many parents and pundits, he doesn\u2019t worry as much about the longer runway to adulthood, arguing that the timetable is more gradual and varied than it was 50 years ago. The traditional markers such as marriage and parenting are now the culmination of adulthood rather than the start of it.I asked about the somewhat clueless students in his class; doesn\u2019t he worry about them? \u201cSure,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I think of adult life, one of the hallmarks of it is that it\u2019s not predictable.\u201dThe problem is that colleges have attempted to make the four-year experience more predictable by adding a bevy of advising services and amenities so that essentially everything is done for students to ensure they graduate on time and secure a job afterward. But they also prevent students from building the resilience they will need as adults to manage risk and succeed in unpredictable careers.In college, \u201cthere are things you\u2019re taught and then there are things you learn,\u201d Dr. Settersten said. \u201cA lot of what college comes down to is not what happens in the classroom. It\u2019s about navigating life and building relationships.\u201dGraduates who linger through their early career often didn\u2019t take college seriously. They put the social scene before academics, avoiding rigorous majors and courses, according to \u201cAcademically Adrift: Limited Learning on College Campuses,\u201d a 2011 book by Richard Arum and Josipa Roksa that shows just how little students actually learn in college.What happens after they graduate? In their follow-up, \u201cAspiring Adults Adrift,\u201d published in 2014, what they reported was as distressing as the findings in their first book, but not much of a surprise. Poor academic performers were more likely than other recent graduates to be unemployed, stuck in unskilled jobs, or to have been fired or laid off. Where students went to college didn\u2019t matter two years out, the sociologists found, as much as what they did while on campus. \u201cThe most important choice students can make is whether they are on the party-social pathway through college,\u201d Dr. Arum said, \u201cor are investing sufficient attention and focus on academic pursuits.\u201dToo many students, he said, see college as a four-year vacation. Students in 1961 dedicated 24 hours a week to studying outside the classroom. By 2003, that fell to 14 hours. \u201cThere are exceptional students,\u201d Dr. Arum said. \u201cThere are just not enough of them.\u201dHe is concerned about what he calls college\u2019s vast middle. \u201cThe system is not working for large numbers of students and I very much worry about their ability to be successful in the long run.\u201dThis article is adapted from \u201cThere Is Life After College: What Parents and Students Should Know About Navigating School to Prepare for the Jobs of Tomorrow,\u201d by Jeffrey J. Selingo, to be published April 12 by William Morrow, an imprint of HarperCollins.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Vox Media Tries Something Old on Something New", "Date": "2016-04-24", "News": "Supported byVox Media, the ambitious online news start-up that runs Vox, a politics site; SB Nation, a network of sports sites; and The Verge, a site about technology, says its next new project will be reviving something old.First, the new: A new outlet, called Circuit Breaker, will begin publishing on Monday, primarily as a Facebook page, not a separate website, a first for Vox Media.Now the old: Circuit Breaker will be, in the words of The Verge\u2019s editor, Nilay Patel, a \u201cclassic gadget blog,\u201d one that publishes news and gossip about technology products at a frenetic pace.For years, starting in the early 2000s, such sites, like Engadget and Gizmodo, were irreverent in tone but deeply reverent in spirit. They were written for and by gadget fans, with an obsessive focus on televisions, game consoles and, most of all, cellphones.As smartphones became ubiquitous, however, their focus broadened. Tech publications became culture publications, and many culture sites incorporated writing about technology. While both Engadget and Gizmodo remain, they are far different than they were just a few years ago.Circuit Breaker will be edited by Paul Miller, a former employee of The Verge who is returning to the company. Mr. Miller said the new page would reach for a \u201ccore audience\u201d of hard-core gadget fans. The Verge offers some popular gadget coverage, but Mr. Miller said many of those gadget fans \u201cfeel neglected when we\u2019re talking about Netflix\u201d and technology\u2019s role in the broader culture.The page will also steer clear of covering the business of tech, leaving industry stories to The Verge or ReCode, the tech news site founded by Kara Swisher and Walt Mossberg that Vox Media acquired last year. (Some articles and reviews from The Verge, where Mr. Mossberg publishes a column, will appear on Circuit Breaker.)Instead, Mr. Miller said, he plans to focus on physical products that have yet to mature, or might never. He includes in this group virtual reality headsets, drones, home automation gear, hoverboards and offbeat projects.Circuit Breaker\u2019s stated mission is an acknowledgment of just how powerful the smartphone has become, including for publications. Not only are people spending huge amounts of time on the devices, the programs on the phones, and social media apps like Facebook in particular, wield huge influence over people\u2019s digital lives.\u201cWe started out, a few years ago, building media brands on websites, because that\u2019s where we thought the growth was, and we were right about that,\u201d said Jim Bankoff, Vox Media\u2019s chief executive. Eventually, he said, \u201cpeople started concentrating around a few specific apps\u201d \u2014 Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram and YouTube. \u201cWe invest based on where we see potential.\u201dIf Circuit Breaker is an ode to a simpler time in consumer technology, it also offers a clear audience to advertisers: people who are explicitly interested in buying things.\u201cIt\u2019s a high-demand category,\u201d Mr. Bankoff said.Vox Media will not be the first major media company to tailor a publication to a social platform. Vox, the politics site, alongside 19 other publishers, operates a channel on Snapchat, with which it shares ad revenue. BuzzFeed has invested in Facebook-centric brands, and countless news sites have dabbled with Instagram accounts and YouTube channels.But media companies are still charting their courses carefully. Advertising arrangements with platforms are in flux, and major tech companies, which operate at a different scale than most publications, make for intimidating \u2014 and unpredictable \u2014 negotiators.Circuit Breaker will also exist, in blog form, in a section on The Verge\u2019s website. But the primary focus of the editors is on Facebook. The page will be at facebook.com/circuitbreaker, and visitors will find a dense feed of videos and news updates.The editors said they do not expect people to frequently check Circuit Breaker\u2019s Facebook page for updates. Instead, readers will experience the site primarily through their Facebook news feeds, where Circuit Breaker videos, posts and broadcasts will appear alongside updates from friends, family and the countless other organizations vying for attention on the platform.\u201cWe\u2019re going to be playing the News Feed game like everyone else,\u201d said Helen Havlak, who oversees social media distribution for The Verge and will work on the new site. \u201cFrom a distribution perspective, we\u2019re probably going to be changing, like, every 48 hours.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Selling Surfers on a New Way to Ride Waves", "Date": "2016-04-27", "News": "Supported byEntrepreneurs face many obstacles in starting a new business, but the founders of Slyde Handboards face a particularly daunting one: how to create a market for a product most people have never heard of, and for a sport they know nothing about.Yet over the course of five years, Slyde Handboards has grown into a robust company through the use of creative marketing tactics that tap into a world where GoPro videos celebrate unusual sports and start-ups can harness social media \u2014 and their fans \u2014 to spread the word.The idea for Slyde was born on a beach in Durban, South Africa, where Steve Watts spent his childhood surfing and swimming. He and his friends especially liked to bodysurf the coastline known for its challenging surf, with the help of flat, wave-riding objects like flip-flops, Frisbees and even fast-food trays.When their surfboards became too worn and waterlogged to use, they broke them apart, took off the fiberglass, and shaped the foam inside into five or six different hand-held boards. These handboards allowed users to move faster and have more control in the water.By the time he was 16, Mr. Watts wanted to create his own line of bodysurfing handboards.\u201cThere was no brand associated with them back then,\u201d he said. \u201cYou had to make your own if you wanted one.\u201dAfter studying product design in London and San Francisco, Mr. Watts eventually made his way to Los Angeles. In 2010, he won the green card lottery.The same week he signed the paperwork for United States residency, he also introduced Slyde, and was soon helped by a surfing student of his, Russell Ellers. Mr. Ellers had become a close friend and lent Mr. Watts both $130,000 and his Venice Beach garage to start the company. That investment converted to equity and Mr. Ellers is now a co-founder and 30 percent owner.Slyde released its first handboard, the Wedge, in 2011, a far more sophisticated version of the boards Mr. Watts, now 39, made as a teenager from the foam inside old surfboards.The company\u2019s third co-founder, Angela Ferendo, who is now Mr. Watts\u2019s wife, joined the company in 2013. Ms. Watts had worked for two other start-ups, one a food delivery service and the other a tech company, and understands the inherent challenges in introducing a new product to a market.But at Slyde, there was the added burden of inventing a market for a product and popularizing a sport.Few people know about handboarding because it has been a niche within surfing since the early 1990s, said Sean Smith, executive director of the Surf Industry Manufacturers Association, a nonprofit trade association. And bodysurfing as a sport tends to be \u201cvery cliquish and hard-core,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cIt\u2019s considered one of the purest forms of surfing.\u201dNew products in the surfing market generally must be perceived as \u201ccool\u201d to succeed. Although they are still a very small part of that market, in the last two years Mr. Smith has noticed increasing interest in bodysurfing handboards. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing them sold in mainstream surf shops now,\u201d he said.The Wattses also wanted to distance Slyde\u2019s products from the aura of exclusivity that often surrounds surfing in order to draw in participants of varying ages and experience levels.They did not set out to appeal to just the \u201cdie-hard surfer with the long beard and the VW bus.\u201d Ms. Watts said Slyde\u2019s handboards gave customers \u201ca surfing experience no matter what skill level or age and the brand behind it makes you feel cool.\u201dThose boards sell within 10 minutes, he said. But it\u2019s the company\u2019s \u201cambassador\u201d program that has been its most effective strategy, Ms. Watts said. This special category of customer combines the idea of a brand ambassador with a loyalty rewards program. Ambassadors are customers so passionate about the company\u2019s handboards \u2014 and so active on social media \u2014 that they gain access to a special Facebook group and a 30 percent discount on boards, which range in price from $119 to $199.The ambassadors, of which there are now about 50, are considered part of the Slyde team, Ms. Watts said. \u201cWe invite them around for brainstorm sessions and they are our first focus group. They post their videos and photos on social media and send them to us too.\u201d Slyde also has an employee dedicated to managing social media and staying connected to customers.Another big break for the company came after its appearance on the television show \u201cShark Tank\u201d in mid-April. There, too, the firm faced skeptical questions about its ability to break into the mainstream surf market.During the episode, the investor Robert Herjavec stressed the difficulties faced by a similar company in which he is invested, called Hamboards. That firm, which makes longboard skateboards and street stand-up paddleboards for \u201clandsurfing,\u201d spent a lot of time trying to get its products into independent surf shops, which is one way to sell to a broader audience while still maintaining a product\u2019s edge.\u201cWe\u2019re going to be old and gray by the time we make any real money doing this,\u201d said Mr. Herjavec, and he cautioned the couple not to go too wide too soon. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to build with the right stores, you\u2019ve got to be authentic,\u201d he said.But as a result of their pitch, the celebrity investor Mark Cuban and the actor Ashton Kutcher invested a combined $200,000, with each taking an 11 percent ownership in return.Mr. Cuban said Slyde could gain exposure through Tower Paddle Boards, the stand-up paddle board company in which he is an investor. \u201cYou\u2019d walk right into a huge customer base,\u201d he told the couple on the episode. Mr. Kutcher, who is also a co-founder of the Los Angeles venture capital firms A-Grade Investments and Sound Ventures, suggested that he could build out a Facebook marketing strategy for their online retailing operations.In 2011, when Slyde\u2019s first board hit the market, revenue was $20,000 and Mr. Watts was hand-shaping each board in Mr. Ellers\u2019s Venice Beach garage.Today, it has two other full time employees, and projects 2016 revenue will be about $1 million, in large part as a result of its success on \u201cShark Tank.\u201d (Without the exposure and investment, Ms. Watts estimated revenue would be closer to $295,000.)

The effects could be felt in the capital, Quito, and into parts of Peru and Colombia.Portoviejo, the provincial capital of Manab\u00ed, and Pedernales, a resort town, appeared to have sustained the most damage, with about 370 buildings destroyed.Viviana Baquezea, 34, a florist, was driving back to her home in Portoviejo, accompanied by her parents and an employee, when the earthquake struck. They were met by a scene of destruction.\u201cIt looks like a war zone,\u201d Ms. Baquezea said by telephone from Portoviejo. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible what was happened to us \u2014 that our city is destroyed and we\u2019re experiencing such anguish and pain.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t have food or water, there are no supermarkets, and we\u2019re surviving with what we had in our homes,\u201d she added.Jos\u00e9 Vaca, a television producer for OromarTV, said the seconds in which the earth refused to stay still seemed to last forever.\u201cWe were preparing to transmit a local football game when everything started to shake and the people fled in panic,\u201d he said of a game in Portoviejo. \u201cI had to to avoid being crushed by the people. I have some scrapes. But what I see around me is really terrible, startling and very sad.\u201dThe quake had a depth of nearly 12 miles. Several aftershocks, some as strong as magnitude 5.6, followed. The earthquake\u2019s center was 16 miles southeast of Muisne, Ecuador, the United States Geological Survey said.About 4,600 members of the National Police and 10,400 members of the armed forces were mobilized as part of the emergency response. Hundreds of doctors, health professionals and rescue workers were heading toward the hardest-hit areas.The president\u2019s emergency decree gives the government expanded authority and a state of emergency in six of the country\u2019s 24 provinces. Deaths were reported in the northern provinces of Esmeraldas, Manab\u00ed and Guayas.Adriana Villac\u00eds, 40, a nurse, said she was with her husband and her 4-year-old son at a supermarket about 30 minutes from Quito when groceries began to fall to the floor.Residents outside a house destroyed by the earthquake\u00a0in Pedernales, Ecuador, on Sunday.\u00a0Hundreds of people were killed in the earthquake, one of the strongest to hit the country in decades.\u00a0\u201cThe first thing I did was protect my son and look for the exit, but a part of the roof fell, and I was frozen,\u201d she said. \u201cThank God we weren\u2019t physically harmed, but the shock caused my child to vomit.\u201dIn the Pedernales district, near the epicenter, a number of homes fell, damaging parked cars.On Avenue Mariscal Sucre in northern Quito, signposts fell, causing panic among drivers. Jorge Espinel said he had parked his car to avoid an accident.\u201cIt was terrible, such a shock,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have words for what I felt.\u201dIn Quito, where the shaking was felt for about 40 seconds and residents took to the streets in fear, the quake appeared to have knocked out electricity and cellphone coverage in several neighborhoods.The mayor of Quito, Mauricio Rodas, said there had been rockslides on roads leading to the capital and reports that the walls of houses had fallen. But he said that no fatalities or injuries had been reported in the city.Christian Rivera, a municipal official in Quito, said a group of 40 children with disabilities from the capital, who had been on an outing, were found near Pedernales and were rescued.President Correa urged people to show strength while he and the authorities monitored events.Carlos Hernandez, a representative of Save the Children International in Quito, said his organization was sending a team of disaster response specialists from Panama to Manab\u00ed and putting together supply kits to distribute there.His organization and other civil society groups met with government officials to plan their response on Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to see what they need most and where,\u201d he said.Maggy Ayala reported from Quito, and Nicholas Casey from Puerto La Cruz, Venezuela.

{"Headline": "Facebook Groups Act as Weapons Bazaars for Militias", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported byA terrorist hoping to buy an antiaircraft weapon in recent years needed to look no further than Facebook, which has been hosting sprawling online arms bazaars, offering weapons ranging from handguns and grenades to heavy machine guns and guided missiles.This week, after The New York Times provided Facebook with seven examples of suspicious groups, the company shut down six of them.Many sales are arranged after Facebook users post photographs in closed and secret groups; the posts act roughly like digital classified ads on weapons-specific boards. Among the weapons displayed have been heavy machine guns on mounts that are designed for antiaircraft roles and that can be bolted to pickup trucks, and more sophisticated and menacing systems, including guided anti-tank missiles and an early generation of shoulder-fired heat-seeking antiaircraft missiles.The report documented 97 attempts at unregulated transfers of missiles, heavy machine guns, grenade launchers, rockets and anti-mat\u00e9riel rifles, used to disable military equipment, through several Libyan Facebook groups since September 2014.Machine guns and missiles form a small fraction of the apparent arms trafficking on Facebook and other social media apps, according to Nic R. Jenzen-Jones, the director of ARES and an author of the report. Examinations by The Times of Facebook groups in Libya dedicated to arms sales showed that sellers sought customers for a much larger assortment of handguns and infantry weapons. The rifles have predominantly been Kalashnikov assault rifles, which are used by many militants in the region, and many FN FAL rifles, which are common in Libya.On Monday, The Times shared links for seven such groups with Facebook to check whether they violated the rules. By Tuesday, Facebook had taken down six of the groups. Ms. Bickert said that one Facebook group \u2014 which displayed photographs of weapons but only discussed them and expressly forbade sales \u2014 had survived the company\u2019s scrutiny.Ms. Bickert described the company\u2019s policies as evolutionary, reflecting shifts in its social media ecosystem.\u201cWhen Facebook began, there was no way to really engage in commerce on Facebook,\u201d she said. But in the past year, she noted, the company has allowed users to process payments through its Messenger service, and has added other features to aid sales. \u201cSince we were offering features like that, we thought we wanted to make clear that this is not a site that wants to facilitate the private sales of firearms.\u201dIt is not clear how extensive arms trafficking on the site has been, but the rate of new posts has been unmistakably brisk, with many groups offering several new weapons a day. Mr. Jenzen-Jones said that ARES documented 250 to 300 posts about arms sales each month on the Libya sites alone, and that sales appeared to be trending up. Over all, using data from arms-sales Facebook groups across the Middle East, he said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got about 6,000 trades documented, but it\u2019s probably much bigger than that.\u201d\u201cHandguns are disproportionately represented,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are widely sought after \u2014 primarily for self-defense and particularly to protect against carjackings \u2014 with many prospective buyers placing \u2018wanted\u2019 posts.\u201d They were also expensive, ranging from about $2,200 to more than $7,000 \u2014 a sign that demand outstrips supply.Such weapons have long been available on black markets in Iraq, with or without advertising on social media. But Facebook and other social media companies seem to provide new opportunities for sellers and buyers to find one other easily; for sellers to display items to more customers; and for customers to peruse and haggle over a larger assortment of weapons than what is available in smaller, physical markets.Items offered for sale on Facebook in Libya also included much of the other equipment sought by militias or terrorists for their operations. These included ammunition, bulletproof plates for flak jackets, rifle scopes, hand grenades, two-way tactical radios, fragmenting antipersonnel warheads for rocket-propelled grenade launchers, uniforms (including police uniforms) and forward-looking infrared cameras, used for night imaging.Ms. Bickert said that using Facebook to help sell items not considered weapons, like bulletproof plates, did not violate the company\u2019s rules. Since the same groups selling plates were also selling weapons, however, they were removed this week.Karam Shoumali contributed reporting from Turkey, and Shuaib Almosawa from Yemen.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Reddit Steps Up Anti-Harassment Measures With New Blocking Tool", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Since 2005, Reddit has been a veritable wonderland for the most extreme forms of free speech on the Internet.On this general interest message board, all it takes to make \u2014 or break \u2014 someone else\u2019s day on Reddit is a fleeting thought, a made-up screen name and a few quick keystrokes.But with the site\u2019s pseudonymity have come other byproducts. Some of Reddit\u2019s biggest detractors claim the web discussion forum is a breeding ground for trolls, a hub that helps them organize and spread like a virus across the rest of the Internet.The blocking feature will build on the concept that the less exposed to negative speech users are on Reddit, the more they will want to engage with the community. That is important for the company, based in San Francisco, which aims to spread far beyond the 243 million unique monthly visitors it currently serves and break into the mainstream consciousness, much like a Facebook or a Twitter \u2014 with a similar ability to command online advertising.The blocking tool could also serve to curtail the spread of online abuse beyond Reddit\u2019s walls. Vitriol on the site can sometimes erupt into larger memes, spilling over into social media and other avenues and creating further repercussions. That behavior is also stoked by other digital haunts that are the favorite of trolls, including sites like 4chan and 8chan.Reddit\u2019s influence goes far, said Anil Dash, a web entrepreneur who has worked on blogging platforms like Livejournal. A post on Reddit is \u201csimilar to one tweet, embedded anywhere, and how it can travel very long distances,\u201d he said.\u201cWhen you\u2019re just now addressing the easiest solutions, it doesn\u2019t speak well for what Reddit\u2019s priorities are,\u201d said Brianna Wu, head of development at Giant Spacekat, a gaming studio. Ms. Wu, who describes herself \u201ca frequent target of the kind of abuse they are trying to stop,\u201d was the recipient of many threats in 2014 because of comments she made about women in the video game industry.Reddit\u2019s creation of the blocking tool, which is available to all registered users, has not gone over well with all of its user base. When the site was founded in 2005 by Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian, college dorm mates from the University of Virginia, it took a laissez-faire approach to Internet commentary. The philosophy was to let forum members post almost anything they wanted and let the rest sort itself out.As a result, any restrictions are considered an affront to the open aspects of community dialogue. On Wednesday, five hours after announcing the blocking tool, there were more than 2,300 comments in response to the feature. Some praised the move while others criticized it.In an interview, Mr. Ohanian acknowledged that shifting the site away from some of its roots is hard. \u201cPeople, generally, do not like change,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to do what is best for Reddit over all.\u201dThe company has maintained that the number of nastier subreddits is minuscule among the tens of thousands of other subforums devoted to things like makeup, television shows or food.The idea for the blocking tool is similar to a \u201cmuting\u201d function used by Twitter, the 320 million-user social network that also faces criticism for the way it handles online abuse. When you block a user on Reddit, you will no longer see that person\u2019s responses to your posts. That person will not know about the block, a strategy aimed at keeping them from simply creating another user account.\u201cFor a very long time it was all we could do to just keep the site up,\u201d said Chris Slowe, one of Reddit\u2019s first hires and the engineer who worked on the blocking tool. Mr. Slowe said he would like to see Reddit get closer to building automated systems that detect abuse across the site, though he did not give a timeline for such technology.\u201cNow we\u2019re finally at a point where we\u2019ve been growing the team and can deal with things like fundamental product problems such as this,\u201d Mr. Slowe said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton Promotes Community Libraries as Crucial Link to Immigrants", "Date": "2016-04-13", "News": "When Hillary Clinton visited the Queens Library in Flushing a few years ago, she was amazed by the sheer number of immigrants who gathered there for help.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was packed with people from all over the world looking for information,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Clinton recalled on Wednesday morning at the Midtown Manhattan headquarters of the Service Employees International Union, where she met with immigrants and accepted the endorsement of the New York State Immigrant Action Fund, a group focused on promoting immigrant rights.  Mrs. Clinton said that community libraries were the \u00e2\u0080\u009cperfect platform\u00e2\u0080\u009d for immigrants to learn about citizenship initiatives or English classes. And so, libraries would be a critical link to the White House \u2014 if Mrs. Clinton were to occupy it, she said. She announced on Wednesday that, if elected president, she would create an Office of Immigrant Affairs to coordinate programs on the federal, state and local levels to further her agenda to promote a comprehensive overhaul of the immigration system. Mrs. Clinton said that as president, she would provide $15 million in grants to support \u00e2\u0080\u009ccommunity navigators\u00e2\u0080\u009d who would assist immigrants in pursuing legal opportunities, including seeking temporary relief from deportation. She also said she wanted to increase outreach and reduce financial barriers for those nine million people in the United States who are eligible for naturalization; only a fraction \u00e2\u0080\u0093 7 percent, she said \u00e2\u0080\u0093 currently naturalize. She proposed an increase of fee waivers for the citizenship application.   Steven Choi, the executive director of the Action Fund and its sister organization, the New York Immigration Coalition, said the fund endorsed her because of her planned policies, and also because of the longstanding relationship the groups have had with Mrs. Clinton. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe knows New York State\u00e2\u0080\u0099s immigrants,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Choi said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe know she has a strong consistent track record, that she has worked for immigrant communities and she has delivered.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Clinton sat at a round-table discussion in the union\u00e2\u0080\u0099s headquarters with immigrants of several nationalities and differing legal status. Melissa Mark-Viverito, who has made immigration overhaul a hallmark of her work as City Council speaker, and who has endorsed Mrs. Clinton, was also in attendance.   On Monday, the day before the New York primary, the Supreme Court will begin hearing oral arguments in United States v. Texas, a challenge to President Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s executive orders that, among other things, allow the undocumented immigrant parents of citizens or lawful permanent residents to stay in the country and work legally. During the roundtable on Wednesday,  Norma Flores, 51, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico, who is the mother of two United States citizens, asked Mrs. Clinton to protect immigrants like her. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will do that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Clinton said. Earlier, Mrs. Clinton said she believed that President Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s initiatives were rooted in law. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am certainly very hopeful that we will see a positive outcome from this really important decision that many millions living in our country are holding their breaths over,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she saidMrs. Clinton concluded with a familiar message for the leading Republican candidate, Donald J. Trump. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important that we also stand up against voices of hate and divisiveness, whether they are in our communities or running for president,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.She added: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have said frequently about Donald Trump \u00e2\u0080\u0093 \u00e2\u0080\u0098Basta.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Enough with the prejudice and the bluster and the bigotry and all of the appeals to fear and anxiety and anger.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Republican Consultant Cheri Jacobus Files Libel Suit Against Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-04-18", "News": "A longtime Republican consultant who has been harshly criticized by Donald J. Trump filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit on Monday accusing him and his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, of making false statements that harmed her professionally and personally.The consultant, Cheri Jacobus, accused Mr. Trump and Mr. Lewandowski of libeling her by depicting her as a disappointed job-seeker who turned on Mr. Trump after he declined to hire her.When Ms. Jacobus criticized Mr. Trump on CNN in late January and early February, Mr. Trump branded her on Twitter as \u00e2\u0080\u009ca real dummy\u00e2\u0080\u009d who had \u00e2\u0080\u009cbegged my people for a job.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Lewandowski described her in similar terms on television.But in the legal filing, Ms. Jacobus claims those accusations were false and caused \u00e2\u0080\u009cenormous damage to her career and reputation, significant emotional distress\u201d and held her up to \u201cpublic ridicule.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHope Hicks, a spokeswoman for the Trump campaign, said in a statement that the lawsuit had no merit. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is just another frivolous lawsuit and an attempt to gain notoriety at the expense of Donald Trump,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.Jay R. Butterman, a lawyer for Ms. Jacobus, acknowledged in an email that \u00e2\u0080\u009clibel suits are generally difficult to prove,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but insisted that \u00e2\u0080\u009cin this matter it is indisputable that the statements of Trump and his agents which are the subject of this lawsuit are defamatory.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cDonald Trump far exceeded the legitimate bounds of free expression in his false attacks on Ms. Jacobus,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Butterman wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe should be held accountable for his actions.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe lawsuit seeks at least $4 million in damages from Mr. Trump, Mr. Lewandowski and the Trump presidential campaign.The legal filing from Ms. Jacobus also offers a window into the early atmosphere of the Trump political operation. It details a series of interactions with the Trump operation late last spring, stating  that Jim Dornan, a Trump aide who has since left the campaign, had sought to recruit Ms. Jacobus.Mr. Lewandowski, the lawsuit says, boasted in one meeting about Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friendships with major television news personalities, including Roger Ailes and Bill O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Reilly of Fox News, and Joe Scarborough of MSNBC.In a second meeting, Ms. Jacobus claims, Mr. Lewandowski bragged about \u00e2\u0080\u009cyelling at Megyn Kelly, a well-known journalist.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cLewandowski,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the lawsuit says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthen took from his desk drawer a printed copy of an email from Ailes to Trump in which Ailes communicated to Trump that Trump should let him know what FOX could do to help.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn a statement, a Fox News spokeswoman, Irena Briganti, said any message from Mr. Ailes would have been entirely innocuous.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hardly uncommon for Roger Ailes to sign correspondence by offering a helping hand, but it would be a fanciful interpretation to equate a cordial email with providing assistance to a political candidate in the vein of editorial coverage,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Briganti said. Mr. Ailes, she added, had no recollection of ever having met Mr. Lewandowski.Ms. Jacobus also claims that Mr. Lewandowski openly discussed plans to form a \u00e2\u0080\u009csuper PAC\u00e2\u0080\u009d supporting Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign.

{"Headline": "\u2018Super PAC\u2019 Emerges to Support Donald Trump, Who Criticizes Such Groups", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "When Mr. Trump staged his own event with veterans instead of attending a Fox News debate in Iowa in January, a consultant named Eric Beach was in attendance. Mr. Beach, a veteran Republican operative from California who at the time was a supporter of Senator Rand Paul, is now overseeing fund-raising for Great America PAC.But the Great American PAC, which Mr. Beach is working for, received no such letter, according to the group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawyer, Dan Backer. A top ally of Mr. Paul, Jesse Benton, recently joined the super PAC.Mr. Beach, in an interview, said that the group is augmenting what the candidate is doing, not just through ads but also with a delegate operation to help bolster Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chances of getting the nomination. It also will focus on raising smaller donations, Mr. Beach said.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe art of the super PAC really is to drive a message and to drive a narrative and capture a movement \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it\u2019s not to try to control what the candidate\u2019s doing, and we fit that bill,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Beach, who added that the goal is to capitalize on momentum.The super PAC is a hybrid, not only promoting the candidate, but also raising small-dollar donations that it sends directly to the campaign.The group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first television ad was a positive spot. It has also asked Ben Carson and former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York to hold fund-raising events, two people briefed on the group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s activities said.

The campaign asked the group to change its name several weeks ago, which led to Great America PAC.The group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Federal Election Commission filings show it has spent more than $1 million making reservations for television ads, money that was spent on a group called Rapid Response Media. Mitchell West, of Kantar Media/CMAG, said his organization had seen no sign of its ad spending.Mr. Benton said the super PAC buys advertising time from DirectTV and the Dish Network, and said it does not show up on ad reservations.Another Kantar official, Elizabeth Wilner, said such advertising purchases are relatively new, since DirectTV and Dish only formed a partnership in 2014.Such an approach to advertising \u00e2\u0080\u009ccertainly has its uses and it certainly has its limits,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd it is an effective tool, but it is not going to be replacing broadcast TV advertising anytime soon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Either way, she said, that advertising would show up in reservations tracked by her company. On Wednesday afternoon, Kantar Media/CMAG picked up evidence of a national satellite reservation, at roughly $150,000 for the time being, but it was not an \u00e2\u0080\u009caddressable\u00e2\u0080\u009d buy, meaning it was not targeted toward any specific market or household; a national satellite buy of this nature is unusual.  \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "How a Cryptic Message, \u2018Interested in Data?,\u2019 Led to the Panama Papers", "Date": "2016-04-05", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 The leak of millions of private financial documents linking scores of the world\u2019s rich and powerful to a secretive Panamanian law firm peddling in shell companies and offshore bank accounts began more than a year ago with a cryptic message to a German newspaper from an anonymous whistle-blower.\u201cHello, this is John Doe,\u201d the source wrote to the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, a Munich-based newspaper that had worked on several investigations into tax evasion and money-laundering scandals. \u201cInterested in data?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re very interested,\u201d replied Bastian Obermayer, a veteran of several investigations into financial scandals.In the months that followed, the confidential source fed S\u00fcddeutsche\u2019s reporters a steady stream of emails, scanned letters, photographs and client data ripped from the servers of Mossack Fonseca, a Panama City law firm that has been dogged for decades by investigations into its suspected connections to money laundering. It was a trove that ultimately added up to 11.5 million individual files equivalent to 2.6 terabytes of data.The German reporters worked for more than two months verifying that the documents were genuine and trying to unravel the complex web of secret transactions. \u201cIt became an addiction,\u201d Mr. Obermayer\u2019s colleague, Frederik Obermaier, wrote in an emailed response to questions. \u201cWe often messaged each other at crazy times, like 2 a.m. or 4 a.m. about the newest findings.\u201dBut the sheer volume of data contained in the initial batch soon overwhelmed the German newspaper\u2019s five-person investigations team. The paper turned for help to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in Washington, D.C., which has coordinated several previous global projects on financial data leaks.The ICIJ did not approach to The New York Times to participate. \u201cThis is an important subject, which we have written about ourselves, and continue to follow,\u201d said Matt Purdy, a deputy executive editor at The Times. The leaked documents provide even more information, he added, and the work is to be applauded.The media partners dissected the mountain of data that the S\u00fcddeutsche\u2019s journalists received in several batches, each of which were forwarded to a secure ICIJ server. The project was code-named Prometheus, after the Titan from Greek mythology who stole the secret of fire from the gods.Luke Harding of The Guardian, a former Moscow correspondent and a veteran of several international collaborations, including WikiLeaks in 2010 and the Edward Snowden leaks in 2013, said the constant stream of new material meant that reporters were regularly relying on each other to help them keep track of new details.With such a large number of people trolling through the same database, the partners needed to agree early on with a common strategy for collaboration and for parsing out the research, as well as a joint promise to hold off on publishing until everyone was ready. The partners held a series of secret meetings, some of which involved more than 100 people. The first took place at a rented room of the National Press Club in Washington in June, followed by others in Munich, London and Lillehammer, Norway.\u201cThe danger was always that if something happened in the world and the reporters in that country would get terribly excited and want to publish right away,\u201d Gerard Ryle, the director of ICIJ, said.About a dozen staffers at ICIJ, plus freelancers, devoted themselves entirely to the project, building the tools used by its partners while also preparing a dozen or so of its own stories on the leak. Mr. Ryle and his deputy, Marina Walker Guevara, were in near-constant communication with what had become a sprawling team.\u201cThis was not a story where the documents were the whole story,\u201d Mr. Ryle said. \u201cYou had to work for it, you had to go outside of the documents. You could see a window, but you had go out and look.\u201dThe ICIJ made a number of powerful research tools available to the consortium that the group had developed for previous leak investigations. Those included a secure, Facebook-type forum where reporters could post the fruits of their research, as well as database search program called \u201cBlacklight\u201d that allowed the teams to hunt for specific names, countries or sources.While the original documents were written in 25 different languages, most of the communication on the forum took place in English, with reporters actively sharing interesting tidbits with the relevant specialized teams. Each news organization took their own precautions, restricting access to the secure computers that were used to connect to the ICIJ\u2019s servers and ensuring that these were not accessible through their newsrooms\u2019 regular networks.Once specific names were found in the database, reporters dug deeper for any clues that might connect those individuals with a shell company, a bank account, or an ever-widening cast of characters. Working in concert with a team of reporters out of The Guardian\u2019s safe room, Mr. Harding uncovered a web of more than 100 complex international transactions that revolved around an offshore firm linked to a musician named Sergei Roldugin, who is one of Mr. Putin\u2019s closest friends.\u201cWe knew there was a link to Putin\u2019s buddy,\u201d Mr. Harding said. \u201cWe knew money was being sent offshore from Russian state banks and being recycled back into Russia\u201d through the offshore company.Late last year, he said, the teams ultimately managed to establish a connection between that firm and another that owned an upscale ski resort near St. Petersburg that is a favorite of Mr. Putin. Further reporting eventually revealed that the same resort was the venue for the secret 2013 wedding of Mr. Putin\u2019s daughter Yekaterina news of which only surfaced last year.\u201cIn the Panama Papers, there was no Swiss bank account\u201d that could provide a clear money trail, Mr. Harding said. \u201cBut in Russia, where your daughter gets married says a lot about what places you hold dear.\u201dOther news organizations used the Mossack Fonseca documents to expose the offshore accounts of political figures in countries like France, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, as well as several international film stars and sports luminaries.\u201cMany rich and powerful people who have accumulated a lot of wealth must be having a spasm of panic about now,\u201d Mr. Harding said. \u201cThey are realizing that actually their banking secrets are not safe and email is not a private medium.\u201d\u201cI think we are entering a new golden age for investigative journalism,\u201d he said.Nicholas Fandos contributed reporting from Washington, and Ravi Somaiya from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "500 Migrants May Have Died in Sinking of Boat in Mediterranean, U.N. Says", "Date": "2016-04-20", "News": "Supported byThe agency based its findings on interviews with 41 survivors of the shipwreck, although it was not able to verify the episode independently. The migrants \u2014 23 Somalis, 11 Ethiopians, six Egyptians and a Sudanese \u2014 were picked up by a merchant ship near Greece on April 16 after days of drifting at sea. They were transferred to a migrant camp in Kalamata, a city on the Greek mainland.Their stories helped lift a cloud of confusion about the episode ever since rumors of the sinking emerged over the weekend. But they did not resolve the questions of where the ship went down or what the ultimate death toll may be. No national coast guards have reported finding the boat.And while there is no indication that Syrians and others who had been trying to reach Greece are now employing different routes, it is clear that Africans and others remain willing to risk everything to flee repression, poverty and war.According to the survivors in Kalamata, a similar situation unfolded late last week, although the exact date was not clear, said William Spindler, a spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Smugglers had arranged for a so-called mother ship to leave the Libyan coast and head toward Italy, loaded with \u201chundreds of people in terribly overcrowded conditions.\u201dSoon afterward, a second boat about 30 yards long set off from near Tobruk, Libya, with between 100 and 200 people aboard. After several hours, it neared the larger ship, which was waiting somewhere off shore.The smugglers began unloading migrants from the smaller boat onto the larger ship, the survivors told United Nations workers. As people boarded the big boat, it began to list. Then it capsized, spilling passengers into the sea, where most of them drowned amid a panicked frenzy. The survivors included people who had not yet left the smaller vessel, and a handful who managed to swim to it as the larger ship went down.\u201cI could see the bigger boat sinking,\u201d Liban Qadar Jama, a native of Somaliland, was quoted as telling the Voice of America\u2019s Somali Service this week. \u201cWe ran with the small boat we were in, as some migrants from the sunk boat desperately swam toward us. We could only save four of them,\u201d he told the V.O.A.In a statement, the refugee agency called for \u201cincreased regular pathways for the admission of refugees and asylum seekers to Europe\u201d to \u201creduce the demand for people-smuggling and dangerous irregular sea journeys.\u201dReports of the sinking emerged over the weekend on Facebook and social media from Somalia. Somalia\u2019s ambassador to Egypt then told BBC Arabic, based on the social media reports, that more than 400 migrants were thought to have drowned.Yet as the stories began to circulate, no one seemed to be able to confirm what had happened, and conflicting narratives have emerged about whether the mass sinking had occurred at all. Social media posts referred to migrant boats running from Egypt to Italy as being caught up in the disaster, although the United Nations said survivors did not confirm that in their accounts.The Somali government issued a statement on Monday stating that 200 to 300 Somalis, including numerous teenagers, appeared to have drowned. But the Greek Coast Guard and the Italian and Maltese rescue authorities denied knowledge of the episode.The International Organization for Migration said on Monday that it could not confirm any news of any deaths or shipwrecks, and the Egyptian Coast Guard and Interior Ministry, which is in charge of the police, said they had heard the news from the media and had no knowledge of any boats leaving Alexandria recently.\u201cThere is so much pressure. You have a boat rescuing people in Libya, a boat arriving elsewhere and another sinking in Greece,\u201d said Muhammad Al Kashef, an Egyptian activist working with refugees and migrants in Alexandria. \u201cIt just makes it very hard to document things.\u201dIn fact, after nearly 13 hours of calls to Somali activists and community leaders in and out of Egypt, Mr. Kashef said what he was able to ascertain was only that \u201can unspecified number of people have drowned somewhere near Greece having left from Egypt\u201d Monday morning.\u201cThey told me they received calls from the survivors of Monday\u2019s shipwreck in Greece saying their relatives died,\u201d he added.As the rumors spread, European officials rushed to make statements. President Sergio Mattarella of Italy said in Rome on Monday that Europe was looking at \u201cyet another tragedy in the Mediterranean in which, it seems, several hundred people have died.\u201dJim Yardley contributed reporting from Rome, and Nour Youssef and Declan Walsh from Egypt.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cloud Services Show Their Value in Earnings Reports", "Date": "2016-04-29", "News": "Supported byBitsThe star of the show was Amazon Web Services, or AWS, that cloud business. Amazon breaks out that sector from the rest of its business, and it makes for impressive reading: Operating income as a percentage of sales for Amazon\u2019s retail business was 3 percent; for AWS it was 24 percent.AWS is still a relatively small part of the company\u2019s total business, but that outsize profitability is reshaping Amazon. Over all, the company\u2019s operating income is 3.6 percent of revenue, but that is up from 1.1 percent a year ago. A big reason is that AWS has doubled its profitability.Cloud computing makes a lot of money in part by automating things: A large data center, supplying potentially thousands of customers, may be run by just a half-dozen people. The people engineering these systems have become very clever about running them efficiently too, devising special semiconductors and software.Google and Facebook are also cloud-based companies, though for now they get most of their money from advertising.As we near the end of the tech earnings season, it is useful to look at net income earned per employee at the company. Microsoft had profits of about $32,200 per person in the quarter, a healthy performance considering how many employees it still has in older businesses. It came in just ahead of Goldman Sachs, on a profit per employee basis.There are two lessons from that: If you do sell retail products, it helps to sell highly profitable fetish objects, like iPhones \u2014 which, not incidentally, have a lot of value because of the cloud-based apps running on them.And if you are selling bargain retail, it\u2019s a very good idea to be in the cloud computing business, too.Advertisement"}

At the bottom of a sweeping grand staircase, a four-piece band performed while couples waltzed.What began as a word-of-mouth soir\u00e9e among the city\u2019s elite influencers has evolved into seasonal theme parties that combine the mystique of \u201cEyes Wide Shut\u201d with the energy of all-night raves and the theatrics of \u201cSleep No More.\u201dOver two weekends in January, 2,800 attendees from as far away as Australia and the United States paid 61.50 euros (around $70) to dress like Venetian noblesse, sip Champagne and dance like Casanova until 2 a.m.\u201cWe had to walk for 30 minutes with chairs on our backs,\u201d Mr. Jubert said. \u201cIt was really commando, and we weren\u2019t discreet at all. It was stupid, but it was our first.\u201d (Stupid, because the police came and everyone had to hide, which, of course, contributed to the party\u2019s hype.)Turns out, Parisians were looking for something beyond sipping Bordeaux on a terrace or waiting in line at the nightclub Silencio. \u201cYou\u2019re diving into another world or another universe,\u201d said Vincent de la Morandi\u00e8re, 40, a lawyer in Paris who has attended four of these events. \u201cIt\u2019s a smart way to party. A pub or a disco is very boring, and so is going to a show where you stay in your seat.\u201dAt We Are the Oracle parties, he added, \u201cYou are the show.\u201dThe next party had a Cosa Nostra theme and took place at an abandoned farmhouse in the 11th Arrondissement. This time, town hall came knocking, but instead of shutting it down, town officials were eager to collaborate, offering Mr. Jubert after-hours access to city museums, swimming pools and other locations.Our goal \u201cis to have an interesting offer in night life, not just restaurants and clubs, but atypical night life,\u201d said Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Hocquart, a special counselor for the Town Hall of Paris. \u201cIt will make Paris more attractive to Parisians, but also abroad. This is why we support WATO.\u201dAs the parties\u2019 reputation grew, so did the pressure to raise the level of extravagance. \u201cVenise Sous Paris,\u201d for example, took a year to plan and cost more than a million euros to produce.That party was supposed to take place at the Richard Lenoir vaults, the water-filled tunnels under the Place de la Bastille between the fourth and 12th Arrondissements. But three weeks after it was announced last October, the city was struck by terrorism. The police thought that the canals were too dangerous, so Mr. Jubert looked for a new setting.\u201cCanceling was an awful option,\u201d Mr. Jubert said. \u201cWe needed a venue that was attractive, exclusive and never used. Somewhere we could maintain our theatrical plans.\u201dAfter an extended search, his group settled on a house that once belonged to Calouste Gulbenkian, a British businessman who died in 1955.

{"Headline": "Radicalization of a Promising Student Turned Bomb Maker in Brussels", "Date": "2016-04-08", "News": "Supported byBRUSSELS \u2014 He attended Catholic school and studied electrical engineering. His immigrant family valued education and discipline. His brother carries the Belgian flag as a national martial arts champion.But none of that stopped Najim Laachraoui from being drawn to the Islamic State, or from turning the technical skills that could have provided a bright future to building the bombs that, the authorities suspect, were used in the recent attacks in Paris and Brussels.Mr. Laachraoui wheeled his handiwork into Brussels Airport on March 22 and, at age 24, blew himself up along with 15 bystanders, the authorities concluded after finding his DNA. Another attacker exploded a bomb nearby, and a third man detonated explosives on a subway, killing 17. The authorities suspect that bomb had also been made by Mr. Laachraoui.His journey from the Brussels neighborhood of Schaerbeek, where he grew up, to Syria \u2014 and back, as a changed and deadly man \u2014 is a trajectory decidedly different from that of many of his cohort, who were possessed of scant prospects and long rap sheets.In the ruthless pecking order of the Islamic State, many of the others amounted to cannon fodder. But Mr. Laachraoui was no doubt a prized recruit: an educated European who radicalized all but invisibly, not in prison, but while in the classrooms of good schools and university study groups.One former university acquaintance posted on Facebook a photograph of Mr. Laachraoui with seven other students in his electrical engineering class who had built a radio together. Mr. Laachraoui is dressed in Western clothes and stands in the back row, a sober look on his face.Why the bomb maker would himself become a suicide bomber remains one of the essential mysteries surrounding him and, much like his radicalization, defies simple explanation.In such cases, experts say, the environmental and circumstantial components can be pieced together. But the personal and psychological ones remain obscure.One practical factor, experts speculate, is a frightening one: that Mr. Laachraoui was not the only Islamic State bomb maker in Europe, and perhaps not even the only one in Belgium. It is quite possible he learned his bomb-making skills from someone more experienced who has yet to be discovered.The French and Belgian news media have reported that a man believed to be a Palestinian member of the Islamic State who has extensive bomb-making experience entered Europe shortly before the Nov. 13 attacks in Paris.While the Belgian authorities have not publicly confirmed that report, it seems unlikely that the Islamic State would allow its sole bomb maker in French-speaking Europe to be killed unless it had a backup plan.Those who knew Mr. Laachraoui in high school say his latent radicalization was hardly evident, though in retrospect perhaps there were some signs of alienation from his adopted Western culture.Mr. Laachraoui was born on May 18, 1991, in Ajdir, Morocco, but he grew up in Belgium, according to court papers. By the time he was a young man, he was clearly grappling with what kind of Muslim he wanted to be.\u201cWe are faced with a person who was in search of his Islam,\u201d said Bruno Derbaix, who taught a religion class at the Institut de la Sainte-Famille, where Mr. Laachraoui studied during high school.At least two of the attackers are believed to have had roles in both plots.In Belgium, it is not uncommon for even Muslim families to send their children to Catholic schools, which supplement the state system, and where the quality of the education and a sometimes greater comfort with religion appeal to them.In his religion class, an 18-year-old Najim Laachraoui wrote a paper on how Islam viewed slavery, a practice that the extremist Islamic State defends, particularly when it comes to non-Muslims. He wrote another on stoning, the Shariah punishment for adultery.At the time, Mr. Laachraoui struck a defensive tone, hoping that Islam would not be judged harshly for such practices.\u201cIslam did not abolish slavery directly and clearly,\u201d he wrote. Yet he emphasized that his hope was for \u201ceach person to gain his true freedom, and be sensitive to those who do not have freedom or from whom it has been taken away.\u201dBy the time of the attacks in Brussels, he had long since shed that sense of moderation. His search for his Islam, instead of enlarging his vision, led him to think more and more narrowly, Mr. Derbaix said.By Mr. Laachraoui\u2019s last year of high school, his teacher recalled, he had adopted the dress favored by Salafist Muslims, rolling his pants to above his ankle, growing a goatee and refusing to shake hands with women. He is not known to have ever had a girlfriend.\u201cOne of his Islams was purist,\u201d Mr. Derbaix said. \u201cThere are many people who practice a purist Islam and who are perfectly content in the West.\u201d\u201cBut in Najim\u2019s case,\u201d he added, \u201cthis was an Islam that had the tendency to say, \u2018Watch out, things are not going so well between Islam and the West,\u2019 so I believe he was on a trajectory where he felt less and less good.\u201dMore than 1,200 people outside of Iraq and Syria have been killed in attacks inspired or coordinated by the Islamic State.His embrace of extremism contrasted with other members of his family, who did not want to speak with reporters.The brother closest to him in age, Mourad, 20, who is also a practicing Muslim, has become one of Belgium\u2019s top taekwondo competitors.At a news conference after his brother\u2019s death, Mourad Laachraoui said that carrying the Belgium flag at international matches was \u201csomething important to me, it is what I have fought for.\u201dHis brother Najim, on the other hand, seemed to have felt increasingly like an outsider, someone who would always be scrabbling to get ahead in a place where unemployment for Muslim youths runs as high as 40 percent in neighborhoods like Schaerbeek.After graduating high school with good grades, especially in math and physics, Najim Laachraoui enrolled at the Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles. There, he was more of a minority, since relatively few Muslims make it to university, said Mr. Derbaix, his former religion teacher.He left after just a year. He then enrolled in another school, according to his former teacher, but dropped out of that as well.To feel apart, even isolated, is not uncommon for a Muslim from Schaerbeek, the third-poorest commune in Belgium and one with a long history of racism.More than Molenbeek, where many of the Paris and Brussels attackers lived, Schaerbeek is a mixed community with a sizable number of native Caucasian Belgians as well as Muslims from Turkey and Morocco.Yet despite its heterogeneity, the groups still live in somewhat segregated communities.Mustapha Chairi, a Schaerbeek native and now the head of the Collective Against Islamophobia in Belgium, remembers how when he was a boy, the mayor, Roger Nols, made no bones about his loathing for immigrants from North Africa.In at least one election year, 1986, he donned ethnic Moroccan clothes, mounted a camel and rode to the central square to declare, \u201cIn 20 years all of Schaerbeek will look like this unless you vote for me,\u201d Mr. Chairi recalled.He stayed in office for 19 years.As a Moroccan son from a working-class family, Mr. Chairi said, \u201cI never went to the street with the grand houses\u201d of the rich, nor even to the streets occupied by less wealthy Caucasian Belgians.This striated social context was where Mr. Laachraoui grew up, deeply conscious of two worlds, separate yet side by side.In all, he seems to have recruited more than 50 young men \u2014 the numbers have come out in two separate trials, in which he was charged with organizing and financing a recruitment network that funneled jihadists to Syria. He is currently in prison in Belgium after being convicted in the first trial.Some of his followers were young petty criminals whom he encouraged to rob people in order to raise money for their trips to Syria. But others were intelligent young men with prospects.One of them was Najim Laachraoui, according to court documents in one of Mr. Zerkani\u2019s trials.By 2013, his parents moved to a new neighborhood of Schaerbeek where there were few Muslims. Whether one reason they did so was because they worried that the eldest of their five children was growing increasingly radical and they wanted to pull him out of Mr. Zerkani\u2019s orbit is not clear.In any case, it was too late.During the move, Najim disappeared, Mourad Laachraoui, the taekwondo champion, said at his brief news conference, in which he begged reporters to leave his family alone.The family learned of his departure from a phone call. Mourad said he never spoke to his brother again and had not known where he was until after his death.\u201cI could not find him,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I had found him, I would have tried to get him back to reason with him.\u201dMr. Laachraoui returned to Europe from Syria in September using a false passport with the name Soufiane Kayal and traveling with Salah Abdeslam, who is now the only surviving Paris attacker.After Mr. Laachraoui arrived back in Belgium, investigators say, he was at least one of the people involved in making explosives for the suicide vests worn by the Paris attackers. His DNA was found on several of the suicide vests used by the Paris attackers as well as in the house in Schaerbeek, which was used to make the explosives and vests, according to a statement from the Brussels prosecutor\u2019s office.Mr. Abdeslam was captured just days before the Brussels bombings, for which Mr. Laachraoui is also believed to have prepared the explosives, as he shuttled between houses in and around Brussels. He was among the three men picked up by a taxi driver on the morning of the Brussels attacks from a house in Schaerbeek where the police later found more than 30 pounds of explosives.Why death became more important to him than the \u201cfreedom\u201d that he had told his high school teacher he hoped everyone could enjoy is impossible to guess.In one of their last conversations before graduation, Mr. Laachraoui told his teacher that he believed Islam was superior to the Western model.\u201cI said that one day his idealism would be put to the test and that he must pay attention not to set himself on a path of pride and anger,\u201d Mr. Derbaix recalled. \u201cWith his great smile, he said to me, \u2018Don\u2019t worry.\u2019 \u201dLilia Blaise contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Previously, only one-to-one text messages were fully encrypted.\u201cFortunately, end-to-end encryption protects us from these vulnerabilities,\u201d the company said.The government has faced similar issues with companies like Telegram, Signal and Wickr Me, messaging services that also offer encrypted communications.The debate over access to digital data erupted in February when a federal court in California ordered Apple to help crack open an iPhone used by a gunman in the San Bernardino, Calif., rampage last year. Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, resisted the order, saying that the company needed to protect individuals\u2019 privacy. Law enforcement officials, including the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, have criticized encryption as a hindrance to investigations, including in terrorism cases.End-to-end encryption for WhatsApp is of particular concern to the F.B.I., considering the service\u2019s huge subscriber base and large international footprint. With increasing amounts of communications now sent across messaging services, encrypted texts, video, photos and the like may end up being more problematic for law enforcement than locked devices. The encryption on WhatsApp will be turned on by default, so users will not be required to enable it themselves.In the United States, the Justice Department has been discussing how to proceed in a continuing criminal investigation in which a federal judge approved a wiretap, but investigators were stymied by WhatsApp\u2019s encryption.Advertisement"}

He had, however, been on the defensive over the issue since Monday, when his office initially described the question of his investments as a \u201cprivate matter.\u201dThe Panama Papers were also embarrassing for Mr. Cameron because they identified the British Virgin Islands, an overseas territory of Britain, as a major center of offshore activity.

But how they responded afterward suggests that one of them (Shaw) comprehends the ramifications of what he did, and the other (Schilling) does not.Shaw, a Chicago Blackhawks forward, was suspended for Game 5 of his team\u2019s playoff series against St. Louis on Thursday night for shouting an anti-gay slur after being sent to the penalty box during Tuesday\u2019s game.\u201cI get it,\u201d he said after being disciplined by the N.H.L. \u201cIt\u2019s 2016 now. It\u2019s time that everyone is treated equally.\u201dSchilling did not choose the road to contrition after he shared a post on Facebook that was an apparent response to the North Carolina law that bars transgender people from using bathrooms and locker rooms that do not correspond with their birth genders. On his blog, he snarled at \u201call of you out there who are just dying to be offended so you can create some sort of faux cause to rally behind.\u201dWhen he shared the message on social media earlier this week, he did not seem to grasp that he had implicitly endorsed it, especially after he added a comment about which public restrooms are appropriate for men and which are not. He is a public figure with a well-developed online profile as a political conservative and Second Amendment supporter who, by the way, was a terrific pitcher over a 20-season career. His propensity for living on the third rail of social media was at odds with ESPN\u2019s internal policy that cautions its workers to be prudent.But by Wednesday, ESPN had had enough of him and fired him from his job as an analyst on \u201cMonday Night Baseball.\u201d He had been sent there from his previous, more prestigious position on Sunday night games, for retweeting a message last summer about extreme Muslims and Nazis, which earned him a monthlong suspension.In firing him, ESPN shed itself of a nuisance who did not, or could not, follow corporate policy and could not grasp that passing around an anti-transgender message digitally might affect people who are finding their way to new gender identities. Crass words and visuals hurt.\u201cIt\u2019s not just athletic language, but in the continued images we see from Hollywood,\u201d said Cyd Zeigler, the co-founder of Outsports.com, a website focused on the intersection of sports and issues for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. \u201cThe openly gay characters singing on \u2018Glee,\u2019 and in \u2018The Real O\u2019Neals,\u2019 the one gay kid who doesn\u2019t know what a basketball is. Hollywood pushes those images as stereotypes so \u2014 big shocker \u2014 our youth coaches use anti-gay language to motivate kids.\u201dLeagues have been disciplining players for using anti-gay slurs that not too long ago were acceptable language. In 2011, Kobe Bryant was fined $100,000 for using a familiar slur against a referee. Rajon Rondo got a one-game suspension for directing the same word at a referee who subsequently outed himself.In a most peculiar manifestation of the use of the slur, Toronto Blue Jays shortstop Yunel Escobar took the field with the word written in Spanish in his eyeblack. His explanation underscored how widespread the slur had become: It was now part of everyday clubhouse chatter. \u201cThat\u2019s a word used often within teams. It\u2019s a word without meaning, the way we use it.\u201dBut, of course, the language of bias is as hurtful as it is unnecessary.So for Jamie Neal, a transgender sports blogger in Las Vegas, the punishments of Schilling and Shaw made for a satisfying Wednesday.\u201cI was proud of ESPN,\u201d she told me by telephone Thursday. \u201cI\u2019ve watched ESPN since I was a kid.

{"Headline": "Texting and Driving? Watch Out for the Textalyzer", "Date": "2016-04-27", "News": "Supported byThat is partly because people are driving more, but Mark Rosekind, the chief of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said distracted driving was \u201conly increasing, unfortunately.\u201dSo to try to change a distinctly modern behavior, legislators and public health experts are reaching back to an old strategy: They want to treat distracted driving like drunken driving.The most provocative idea, from lawmakers in New York, is to give police officers a new device that is the digital equivalent of the Breathalyzer \u2014 a roadside test called the Textalyzer.It would work like this: An officer arriving at the scene of a crash could ask for the phones of any drivers involved and use the Textalyzer to tap into the operating system to check for recent activity.The technology could determine whether a driver had used the phone to text, email or do anything else that is forbidden under New York\u2019s hands-free driving laws, which prohibit drivers from holding phones to their ear. Failure to hand over a phone could lead to the suspension of a driver\u2019s license, similar to the consequences for refusing a Breathalyzer.\u201cWe need something on the books where people\u2019s behavior can change,\u201d said Mr. Ortiz, who pushed for the state\u2019s 2001 ban on hand-held devices by drivers. If the Textalyzer bill becomes law, he said, \u201cpeople are going to be more afraid to put their hands on the cellphone.\u201dIf it were to pass in New York, the first state to propose such an idea, it could well spread in the same way that the hands-free rules did after New York adopted them.Ms. Lightner said the intensifying efforts around distracted driving \u201care the equivalent of the early \u201980s\u201d in drunken driving, when pressure led to tougher laws and campaigns emphasizing corporate responsibility.Distracted driving \u201cis not being treated as seriously as drunk driving, and it needs to be,\u201d she said.\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous, devastating, crippling, and it\u2019s a killer, and still socially acceptable,\u201d she added.Jay Winsten, an associate dean and the director of the Center for Health Communication at Harvard\u2019s School of Public Health, said, \u201cWe\u2019re losing the battle against distracted driving.\u201dDr. Winsten is developing a distracted-driving campaign based on designated-driver efforts that were ultimately backed by major television networks and promoted by presidents, sports leagues and corporations.He said the new campaign would urge drivers to be more attentive, rather than scold them for multitasking, and would encourage parents to set a better example for their children.The campaign, though still in development, has already garnered support from YouTube, which has agreed to recruit stars on the website to create original content involving the message. Dr. Winsten said he had also been in talks with AT&T, Nascar, a major automaker and potential Hollywood partners.Dr. Winsten said the new campaign could be a kind of carrot to encourage better behavior by drivers, but he added that a stick was also needed.While the Textalyzer raises potential privacy concerns, it might help enforce texting bans that have so far proved ineffective, he said.\u201cRight now, we have a reed, not a stick,\u201d Dr. Winsten said, adding that the Textalyzer would \u201cmake enforcement that much more credible.\u201dNow, the police can obtain a warrant for cellphone records, but the process takes time and resources, limiting the likelihood of investigation, Mr. Ortiz said. But those protections are there for good reason, according to privacy advocates, who oppose the New York bill.\u201cIt really invites police to seize phones without justification or warrant,\u201d said Donna Lieberman, the executive director of the New York chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union.But the bill\u2019s authors say they have based the Textalyzer concept on the same \u201cimplied consent\u201d legal theory that allows the police to use the Breathalyzer: When drivers obtain a license, they are consenting in advance to a Breathalyzer, or else they will risk the suspension of their license.Matt Slater, the chief of staff for State Senator Terrence Murphy of New York, a Republican and a sponsor of the bill, said the constitutional concerns could and should be solved. \u201cIt\u2019s monumental if we can get this done,\u201d he said.Mr. Slater said he hoped it could happen this session, which ends in June, but, he added, it may take several tries and may require broader public support.\u201cWe\u2019re facing the same hurdles we faced with drunk driving,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make sure safety and civil liberties are equally protected.\u201dFourteen states prohibit the use of hand-held devices by drivers, and 46 ban texting, with penalties ranging from a $25 fine in South Carolina to $200 fines elsewhere, and even points assessed against the driver\u2019s license.A handful of states have strengthened their original bans, including New York, which in 2014 adopted tougher sanctions that include a 120-day suspension of a permit or a license suspension for drivers under 21, while a second offense calls for a full-year suspension.Deborah Hersman, the president of the nonprofit National Safety Council and a former chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board, said she liked the Textalyzer idea because it would give the police an important tool and would help gather statistics on the number of crashes caused by distraction.She said the Textalyzer-Breathalyzer comparison was apt because looking at and using a phone can be as dangerous as driving drunk.\u201cWhy are we making a distinction between a substance you consume and one that consumes you?\u201d Ms. Hersman said.The Textalyzer legislation has been called Evan\u2019s Law for Evan Lieberman, who was asleep in the back of a car on June 16, 2011, when the vehicle, driven by a friend, lost control.Mr. Lieberman, 19, died from his injuries, and his father, Ben Lieberman, spent months trying to gain access to phone records, which ultimately showed that the driver had been texting.Ben Lieberman became an advocate for driving safety, and in December, looking to develop the Textalyzer concept, he approached the mobile forensics company Cellebrite, which was involved in helping the government find a way into a locked iPhone, and which works with police departments around the country.Jim Grady, the chief executive of Cellebrite U.S.A., said that the Textalyzer software had not been fully built because it was not clear what a final law might require, but that it would not be too technologically challenging.\u201cI hope it will have the same effect as the Breathalyzer,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Virtual Reality Check: Rating the HTC Vive and the Oculus Rift", "Date": "2016-04-05", "News": "Supported byTech FixSimilar to the Rift, the Vive \u2014 a joint development by the Taiwanese manufacturer HTC and the video game distribution company Valve \u2014 is a virtual reality headset that connects to a powerful computer.There are plenty of other differences, too. Here\u2019s how the Vive compares with the Rift.The Vive system includes a pair of motion controllers for interacting with objects in virtual reality and a camera embedded in the front of the headset that lets you peek into the real world. It also includes earbuds for sound and two base stations for detecting motion. The computer must be bought separately.In contrast, the Rift includes a Microsoft Xbox game controller and a remote control; the company delayed the release of its motion controllers until later this year. For sound, the Rift\u2019s headset has headphones built into the sides. An external camera is used to detect your body. A computer can be bought as part of a bundle or separately.HTC recommends a computer with a powerful graphics card, like Nvidia\u2019s GTX 970 or AMD\u2019s R9 290. It also recommends a powerful processor, such as Intel\u2019s i5-4590 or AMD\u2019s FX 8350. You will also need four gigabytes of RAM and two display ports.For the Rift, Oculus recommends a similar setup: a computer with the same Nvidia or AMD graphics card and Intel processor. It requires eight gigabytes of RAM and four USB ports.The Rift was released with about 30 games and a few apps. HTC said the Vive was released with about 50 games. The companies will regularly update their libraries with new apps and games.The main advantage of the HTC Vive headset is that it comes with motion controllers, which let you effectively reach out and grab objects in virtual reality. This kind of interaction feels much more natural for virtual reality than the game controller included with the Rift.Also, the Vive\u2019s motion-sensing base stations capture richer movements, enabling people to walk around in a larger space or crouch and grab something while using virtual reality; the Rift\u2019s camera can detect movements, too, but the Rift was primarily designed to be used while standing or sitting.Another benefit of the Vive is that the headset fits better. With the Rift, I could always see a small gap in the space beneath the nose. The Vive headset completely blocks the outside world. HTC also includes a piece of foam that can be inserted into the Vive for a better fit for a narrower face.But a major downside of the Vive is the setup, which is more demanding than the Rift\u2019s. HTC recommends that you drill mounts into the ceiling to install the motion-sensing base stations to ensure that the sensors have a clear line of sight with the headset and your body. In other words, to take full advantage of the Vive, you probably need to dedicate a room to virtual reality; to use the Rift, you can get away with clearing out a bit of standing space.The other obvious downside of the Vive is the higher cost. With a computer and accessories included in the total price, the Vive will cost roughly $300 more than the Rift. Then again, if you are willing to spend more than $1,000 for virtual reality, that extra $300 might not matter much.This is Year 1 of powerful and capable virtual reality systems coming to the mainstream. Over time, the content that will become available for these devices will define their worth. There isn\u2019t much to do with either system yet, and consumers would be wise to wait to see if any killer virtual reality apps or games emerge for the systems.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified the game shown.

Garland to the Supreme Court has been shored up by two Republican senators revoking their support for holding confirmation hearings.Their moves highlight the immense pressure that Republican leaders are placing on senators as they try to build unified opposition to President Obama\u2019s choice to replace Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February.As the White House heralds the growing number of Republicans agreeing to meet with Judge Garland, Senators Jerry Moran of Kansas and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska have reversed themselves and say they now back the decision made by Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, not to hold hearings.\u201cSenator Moran called Senator Grassley to discuss his position,\u201d said a statement released by Mr. Moran\u2019s office on Friday. \u201cAs Senator Moran has said, he is opposed to President Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee. He has examined Judge Garland\u2019s record and didn\u2019t need hearings to conclude that the nominee\u2019s judicial philosophy, disregard for Second Amendment rights and sympathy for federal government bureaucracy make Garland unacceptable to serve on the Supreme Court.\u201dMr. Moran\u2019s announcement, first reported by National Review, came a week after he said the Senate should move forward with the nomination process, including holding hearings and meeting with Judge Garland.\u201cAs I have said since the vacancy was created, I believe I have a duty to ask tough questions and demand answers,\u201d he said in a statement on March 25. \u201cI am certain a thorough investigation would expose Judge Garland\u2019s record and judicial philosophy, and disqualify him in the eyes of Kansans and Americans.\u201dSimilarly, a spokeswoman for Ms. Murkowski, Karina Petersen, said the Alaska senator also no longer supported holding hearings, though she will meet with Judge Garland to discuss cases that are important to her state.\u201cSenator Murkowski respects the decision of the chair and members of the Judiciary Committee not to hold hearings on the nominee,\u201d Ms. Petersen wrote in an email.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Revamped Metropolitan Home Sets Its Sights on Millennials", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported byNotedIt was the shelter magazine that asked Tom Wolfe and Alice Waters to design rooms for a show house, photographed an openly gay couple at home years before it was standard practice and covered the Milan Furniture Fair with the seriousness National Review brings to politics.\u201cAmong the shelter magazines of the time, it was considered a little bit of a rebel,\u201d said Newell Turner, the editorial director of the Hearst Design Group, which publishes three shelter magazines, including Elle D\u00e9cor.He was speaking about Metropolitan Home, where he began his career in the mid-\u201980s. Like many people, Mr. Turner was sad to see the longstanding and influential title closed by its parent company in 2009.The issue, which will be sent to select Hearst subscribers and be sold on newsstands in 14 cities, is a test. If advertisers and readers respond favorably, Metropolitan Home could be brought back permanently, perhaps as a quarterly.Mr. Turner is hoping for a return to glory.\u201cIt still had a very passionate following up to the end,\u201d he said, adding that in the same way the original magazine spoke to upwardly mobile baby boomers, the revamped version is targeting \u201cfirst-wave millennials who are finally starting to think about home.\u201dFeatures include an article on the Los Angeles home of Facebook\u2019s 95th employee, an essay on the app-ification of modern life and a series of mini-profiles on artists, chefs and other movers and shakers in cities across the country.The pilot issue, Mr. Turner said, was modeled on the kind of lushly produced indie magazines that have small, passionate, clearly defined audiences.Former readers and fans of Metropolitan Home, many of whom are older than the new target demographic, are nevertheless excited about its return.Now 39, Mr. Call remembers reading Metropolitan Home as a boy growing up in a small town outside Seattle. He would study intently the work of the designer Vicente Wolf and columns like \u201cHigh Low,\u201d a regular feature pairing expensive furniture with cheaper, similar options that has since become a standard of every shelter mag.\u201cI felt I was metropolitan in the little town I was growing up in because I was reading Metropolitan Home,\u201d Mr. Call said.It\u2019s striking how wide a net the magazine cast in its \u201980s and early-\u201990s heyday, and how forward-thinking it was. In one issue, the restaurant critic Ruth Reichl might have a dispatch on what America\u2019s hottest chefs were cooking for \u201986; in another, readers would find a profile of the artist David Hockney and a travel article about a $40-a-night Italian guest villa (if only prices remained stuck in time).\u201cThough a lawyer by training, my passion was always design,\u201d Mr. Carter wrote in an email. \u201cMetropolitan Home\u2019s belief and support turned this passion into a career. It quite literally changed my life.\u201dDorothy Kalins was the magazine\u2019s editor until 1992, and Mr. Turner\u2019s boss. She described Metropolitan Home as \u201cthe bible of the baby boom\u201d and said its name suggested a mind-set, not a geographic location or a penchant for downtown lofts (though there were those).\u201cWe were writing about these new homeowners who weren\u2019t going to live like their parents lived,\u201d said Ms. Kalins, who went on to be editor in chief of Saveur. \u201cThey were interested in travel, social issues, how design informed their lives and made it.\u201dThe same may be said for the millennials who will be reading Hearst\u2019s revamped version. Though hampered by the financial collapse and the high cost of living in urban areas these days, the 20- and early-30-somethings may finally be at a place where they are ready and financially able to start nesting.

{"Headline": "Twitter Gains Rights to Stream Thursday N.F.L. Games", "Date": "2016-04-05", "News": "Supported byLeave it to the N.F.L. to sell the same product three times.A decade ago, the league began showing Thursday night games on its fledgling NFL Network. Then CBS, and later NBC, agreed to pay the league hundreds of millions of dollars a year for the right to broadcast some of those games as well.The games shown on Twitter will be the CBS or NBC broadcasts, depending on which network is showing the game, and will include pre- and postgame highlights only available on Twitter. Twitter and the N.F.L. have not announced how the games will look on individual feeds.The partnership speaks volumes about the power of the country\u2019s most powerful sports league, which wants to expand its footprint overseas and reach younger consumers who may never pay for a cable or satellite package, or even own a television.It also illuminates the sharp-elbowed race to survive in Silicon Valley, where Twitter and other technology companies like Facebook, Amazon and Netflix are rushing to find ways to offer consumers must-see content everywhere and at any time. By joining a sports behemoth that garners the highest ratings in television, Twitter hopes to pump air back into its sagging fortunes.\u201cThey need to give people more reasons to come back to Twitter to get their info-of-the-day fix,\u201d said Eric Jackson, managing director of SpringOwl Asset Management and a close watcher of the company. \u201cIf these N.F.L. games go well, they can expand into other types of content and give users more reasons to spend more time on Twitter properties each day.\u201dMajor League Baseball, the N.B.A. and other sports leagues already stream national packages of games for $100 or more a season. But they, like the N.F.L., will be watching to see how fans consume games on their smartphones and tablets and whether the alliance with Twitter can generate profits.Even as the nation\u2019s largest sports league with $13 billion in annual revenue, the N.F.L. is trying to anticipate shifts in the media landscape. For decades, the league has relied on a tested model: Collect billions of dollars from television networks that broadcast games for free over the air, or from cable and satellite networks.Most of the league\u2019s television agreements with these networks expire in the next five years, so the N.F.L. wants to find new ways to market its games for the next generation of fans.\u201cThere are huge swaths of young people who never watch broadcast television,\u201d said Ed Desser, a sports media consultant. The streaming experiment \u201callows them to plan ahead.\u201dFor now, along with appearing on Twitter\u2019s mobile and desktop apps, the company said it will show games on video game consoles that use Twitter apps, such as Microsoft\u2019s Xbox.At the N.F.L.\u2019s annual meeting last month, league executives told team owners and executives that the biggest opportunities for new revenue would come from digital and international businesses. Selling the streaming rights to live games to Twitter appears to fill both of those categories, without upsetting CBS, NBC and other networks that pay dearly for media rights.To assuage them, Twitter will show the networks\u2019 ads. But to make money it will sell ads for the time normally reserved for local spots. This let Twitter pay less than it might have otherwise, and it will allow NBC and CBS to reach more viewers.\u201cThe attraction wasn\u2019t just revenue, it was a reach decision,\u201d said Joe Lockhart, a league spokesman. Other bidders, he added, had offered more money than Twitter.By signing a one-year deal with Twitter, the N.F.L. will retain the flexibility to look elsewhere for the long run.Roger Goodell, the N.F.L.\u2019s commissioner, announced the deal, appropriately enough, on his Twitter feed, his first Tweet in 19 months.The league might have had a receptive ear at Twitter. The company\u2019s chief financial officer, Anthony Noto, held the same position at the N.F.L. from February 2008 to October 2010.The move is a significant strategic shift for Twitter, which last month celebrated its 10th anniversary. While Twitter has grown to hundreds of millions of regular users, for years the company has been on a quest to boost its slowing growth by making significant changes to the product and by spending millions in marketing campaigns.So far, little has helped. Twitter user growth was flat at the end of 2015, compared to the third quarter of the year, at 320 million monthly visitors.\u201cWe wanted to focus on what we do best,\u201d Noto said, explaining the sports push. For Twitter, he added, that focus was \u201clive\u201d content.The league experimented with live-streaming last season when Yahoo paid about $20 million for the rights to show a Buffalo Bills-Jacksonville Jaguars game played in London in October. In a sop to its broadcast partners and fans, the Bills-Jaguars game was still shown on television in the Buffalo and Jacksonville markets.But streaming games free to the more than 180 countries where Twitter is available might attract fans in places where the N.F.L. does not have major broadcast partners.But according to one mathematical conversion that Yahoo disputes, the 15.2 million unique users for the Bills-Jaguars game amounts to the television equivalent of 2.36 million average viewers, about 1.6 million of whom were in the United States.Still, Twitter hopes that the magnetism of the N.F.L. provides them with a sorely needed boost.\u201cThis to me is much more about publicity and marketing for Twitter than selling ads,\u201d said Richard Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG Research.Advertisement"}

Trump\u2019s campaign \u2014 who is a loyalist to Corey Lewandowski, the embattled campaign manager \u2014 resigned in a letter to Mr. Trump on Monday afternoon.\u201cI want to express my deepest gratitude for the opportunity to serve you and your campaign over the past 7 months,\u201d Stuart Jolly, the director, wrote in his resignation letter. \u201cThe journey has been extraordinary and many experiences on this journey will never be forgotten.\u201d Mr. Jolly, a retired Army lieutenant colonel, was especially loyal to Mr. Lewandowski, whom he had worked with previously at Americans For Prosperity, the free enterprise advocacy group associated with  the billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch. \u201cThe friendships I have made through your campaign will last a lifetime; my hope is that ours will as well,\u201d he wrote, calling Mr. Lewandowski \u201cone of my best friends\u201d and offering his availability in the future \u201cif you ever need me for any reason.\u201d But the resignation was seen as a sign of distress among those loyal to Mr. Lewandowski about recent changes in the campaign  that have curtailed his influence after a string of losses in states like Wisconsin and at state conventions to select delegates. Mr. Jolly, whose first national campaign experience came this cycle under Mr. Trump and who was deployed to help the campaign in New Hampshire primary after a disappointing second-place finish in Iowa, also reminisced about Mr. Trump\u2019s early victories, which helped transform the Manhattan businessman from something of a political joke into a serious contender. \u201cThe primary wins in New Hampshire & South Carolina were magical and I will never forget them,\u201d Mr. Jolly wrote. \u201cThe other 20 wins were nice, but nothing beats those first two victories. Victory has no substitute!\u201d\u201cI will never forget your encouragement and loyalty,\u201d Mr. Jolly added, before offering Mr. Trump some final advice \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to continue to listen to those who had helped propel him to victory.Aides to Mr. Trump did not respond to requests for comment. The comments in the letter about Mr. Lewandowski\u2019s successes came on the heels of a senior staff meeting on Saturday, during which it was made clear that Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump\u2019s new senior adviser, was largely steering the ship, according to people briefed on the meeting. Mr. Manafort introduced a new lawyer on the team, William McGinley, who has dealt in the past with delegate battles. Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, joined the meeting for part of it, and Ed Brookover, who had been serving as the liaison to the Republican National Committee, also attended. Other attendees were Mr. Lewandowski and his deputy, Michael Glassner, as well as Rick Reed, who films the campaign\u2019s ads.  Mr. Manafort laid out a plan for the coming weeks, one with tighter messaging and a broadened communications staff, which could increase as soon as this week, according to those briefed on the meeting. Midway through the meeting, Mr. Glassner gave what was described as a defense of the work that had come before the new arrivals, pointing out that the old team had won more than 20 states. Mr. Manafort last week hired Rick Wiley, a former party committee political director, as the campaign\u2019s national political director. He was said to have been recruited by Mr. Lewandowski, but now reports to Mr. Manafort.

Trump. And last week, Mr. Trump shared the video with the millions of people who follow him on Twitter and Facebook as he tries to secure the Republican nomination for president.The video linked on Twitter was taken down within hours for copyright reasons, and other copies subsequently vanished from the Internet. But that the video migrated from Reddit to Mr. Trump\u2019s official accounts shows not only the candidate\u2019s unfiltered promotional strategy, but also the disparate ways in which his many supporters take up his cause online \u2014 and the ease with which Mr. Trump incorporates their narratives into his own.\u201cIn Trump\u2019s case, none of that support is being developed,\u201d Mr. Sifry said.

On Reddit at least, that elation has turned into real support. In between meme photos and lengthy threads of mockery, users also post calls to action that offer tangible benefits to Mr. Trump. They remind one another of voter registration deadlines and share rhetorical strategies for dealing with opponents. The group maintains a delegate counter, links to pro-Trump videos and articles, and provides materials instructing new visitors on how to help with the campaign.Recently, the group has focused on holding question-and-answer sessions \u2014 known on Reddit as AMAs, for Ask Me Anything \u2014 with figures including the conservative commentator Ann Coulter, the immigration activist Roy Beck and Helmut Norpoth, a political-science professor at Stony Brook University whose election model is favorable to Mr. Trump. (Mr. Norpoth, who did not express support for any candidate, said in an interview that he had been invited to participate by a student, but was unaware that he was speaking to a Donald Trump group. \u201cIt took me a little bit to find my bearings,\u201d he said.)A session with the creator of the cartoon Dilbert, Scott Adams, who has predicted victory for Mr. Trump, is on the schedule.The group is governed by anonymous volunteer moderators, who impose rules that include \u201cDon\u2019t post people planning to assassinate Trump\u201d and \u201cNew Centipedes must assimilate.\u201d Enforcement is harsh, said another moderator, who identified himself as a 23-year-old law student and who posted under the name \u201cciswhitemaelstrom.\u201d\u201cWhat I\u2019m interested in is letting Donald Trump supporters speak among themselves,\u201d he said in a phone interview, speaking on the condition that he not be named because of the potential for retribution. \u201cThat will help them consolidate a stronger position.\u201dTheir messages do rise, perhaps surprisingly, up the chain into the mainstream.

Those who have landed on your cutting-room floor can learn of the shunning in any number of ways. That\u2019s why the subtler function of muting someone, offered by Facebook and Twitter, is popular: Mutees have no way of knowing they\u2019ve been tuned out. The posters keep posting and posting, having no idea that they are trees falling in the forest without anyone there to hear the thud.Can you believe that grown-ups with, presumably, all the worries, stresses and responsibilities of adult life could allow themselves to be bothered for even one second by the notion that someone (most likely a virtual stranger, if not a literal one) would opt to avoid their tweets?People are so ridiculous.Peter and I have socialized in large groups and are digitally friendly, though not necessarily in-real-life friends.

{"Headline": "Twitter Narrows Loss, Adds Users and Misses Revenue Forecast", "Date": "2016-04-26", "News": "Supported byFor all the issues that Twitter has grappled with over the last few years \u2014 the slowdown in user growth, a revolving door of executives and confusion over how to use the social media service \u2014 it has had one constant pillar of strength: a bulletproof advertising business.Now add that business to Twitter\u2019s growing list of problems.The numbers punctuated an earnings report that showed the depth of Twitter\u2019s challenges. The number of people joining the service continues to be modest, even after a battery of experiments by the company to lure new users. And Twitter remains unprofitable, reporting a first-quarter net loss of $80 million, or 12 cents a diluted share, though that was narrower than the $162 million loss from a year earlier.Yet over the last year, Twitter\u2019s stock has plunged about 65 percent. After the earnings report on Tuesday, investors sent the company\u2019s shares down more than 12 percent in extended trading.\u201cBrand advertisers have been Twitter\u2019s bread and butter for years,\u201d said Debra Aho Williamson, an analyst for eMarketer, an industry research firm. \u201cTo hear the company say that it\u2019s struggling to increase revenue from these types of companies is a concern.\u201dOther Twitter executives did not shy away from the company\u2019s first-quarter sales performance. For the last five or six years, Twitter\u2019s ad business has been a huge driver for the company: Growth rates regularly exceed 60 percent. For the first quarter, sales were up 36 percent from a year earlier; they were estimated to rise as little as 17 percent in the second quarter.Adam Bain, Twitter\u2019s chief operating officer, said that video advertising was strong for the first quarter, but added that the results were hurt because advertisers did not spend as much on older advertising products, like promoted tweets, as the company anticipated. He said that negative press reports about Twitter were not having an effect on advertisers.\u201cLet\u2019s be perfectly clear on the reason \u2014 demand was weaker than we thought,\u201d Anthony Noto, Twitter\u2019s chief financial officer, said in an interview, referring to the company\u2019s revenue. He added that the market for Twitter\u2019s older advertising products was still sizable, though that could be threatened if the weak demand continued.Twitter faces tough advertising competition from other social media companies like Facebook, which is expected to capture more than 31 percent of advertiser digital spending in the United States this year, according to data from eMarketer. Other companies, like Snapchat, also compete with Twitter for ads.Twitter\u2019s user growth, which has been the company\u2019s prime area of concern since its 2013 initial public offering, improved in the first quarter \u2014 though the growth remained modest. The company said it had an average of 310 million monthly users in the first three months of the year, up from 305 million users in the last three months of 2015.The 310 million monthly visitors is more than some analysts had expected, a boost that the company attributed to seasonal additions and an increase in marketing.But those figures come with a caveat. Most of that growth came from outside the United States and from markets that were less mature and, therefore, less financially lucrative for Twitter.\u201cThe domestic number \u2014 the one that everyone cares about \u2014 it\u2019s not growing,\u201d said Rich Greenfield, a media and technology analyst at BTIG Research, an industry firm. \u201cThey\u2019ve just literally banged into a wall.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is Staying In the New Going Out?", "Date": "2016-04-12", "News": "Supported bySign of the TimesI first noticed it at work. On Monday mornings a deathless ritual unfolds in offices across the land: the posing of the question, \u201cHow was your weekend?\u201d A few years ago, my coworkers and I exchanged happy highlight reels of ambitious urban activities before cracking open our laptops and pouring ourselves a tall, refreshing glass of work. One of us went to an off-Broadway play. One of us went to a Beyonc\u00e9 concert. One of us went on a date. We had fun!These days, we respond to the question with a look of puzzled amnesia. Did we do anything? \u201cNot really,\u201d we say. \u201cIt was pretty uneventful.\u201d We furrow our brows trying to remember key events, but nothing comes to mind. It\u2019s as though the last two days have elapsed in a narcotized, undifferentiated blur. A leisure-time blackout. We still have fun \u2014 probably? \u2014 we just have no clue how it happened.Unlike Willa Cather\u2019s hardy immigrants, however, my self-imposed confinement involves millions of megabytes worth of pirated TV (if law enforcement is reading this, I\u2019m just kidding) and a hamburger delivered with two clicks. Sometimes I enjoy these things with a boyfriend; sometimes I enjoy them with friends. Alone, I can always socialize from my cubbyhole \u2014 on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, Tinder, Snapchat. All of these platforms have a way of bringing out the worst in people, it\u2019s true, but then, so do bars at 2 a.m.Every generation\u2019s fear is that the next generation has found better ways to avoid the risks of being a human. Baby boomers, for one, deem it pathetic that younger people refuse to ask each other out on the phone and do it by text instead; Gen Xers think Millennials are losers for resorting to Tinder instead of spotting a comely stranger and buying that person a beer. This scorn is both deserved and fruitless. In 20 years, texting will look audacious compared to whatever ultra-mediated quasi-contact young people are making.Let\u2019s strip away the censure, for a moment, by analogizing the trend to personal wealth management. If we define \u201ccapital\u201d in this metaphor as a mixture of our time and emotional stasis, then staying in is the ultimate conservative investment. It\u2019s like pouring your money into a savings account: You\u2019ll grow marginally; you\u2019ll stay safe; your expectations will be met and never exceeded. The worst-case scenario is that your delivery fries are soggy and your premium cable TV episode is a B+ instead of an A. You can always pull the ripcord on your show and go to bed early. A failed night means that you got a good night\u2019s sleep. That\u2019s still a win. A modest win, but a win.Going out, on the other hand, is closer to prospecting. The upside is huge: You could have a life-altering adventure, meet your soul mate, find your new best friend. The potential downside is equally monumental. You could run into an ex, lose your wallet, suffer a grope, be rejected. The scope of experience at a party or a bar is, as the hedge funders might put it, high beta. We do it for the possibility of encountering the spectacular. This rarely happens.There are opportunity costs associated with chronic staying in, too. A year\u2019s worth of weekends spent at home is a bit like never moving out of your parents\u2019 house: At some point you have to leave the nest. Leaving the nest, even just to get outside, is how we grow, challenge ourselves and discover things that have not been tailored to our relevant interests by an algorithm. As with Keynes\u2019s paradox of thrift, the indisputable smart play for the individual is to spend nights and weekends snuggled under the duvet with an iPhone. But what\u2019s the point of living in a city if you treat it like a suburb?So yes, we know what we\u2019re losing when we hibernate. For proof, observe that nesting remains indefensible as an excuse; if someone invites you out, you can\u2019t refuse by telling them that you\u2019ve got \u201cplans to stay in,\u201d because a plan to stay in still counts as no plan at all. We burrow with a slight wince, in a blanket of mild contrition. But, oh, what a cozy blanket.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Social Media, Where Sports Fans Congregate and Misogyny Runs Amok", "Date": "2016-04-28", "News": "Supported bySports of The TimesThe hatred that arrives rapid-fire into their social media accounts is so personal and acidic that it could sear through even the thickest skin.Messages from men who said they wanted them dead. Or raped. Or beaten by their boyfriends.So Julie DiCaro and Sarah Spain \u2014 these two friends and Chicago-based sports journalists who receive these notes on nearly a daily basis \u2014 decided to address it publicly. They agreed to be featured in a video highlighting some of the meanest, cruelest messages they\u2019ve received on Twitter.When I watched the video, which spread at light speed across the Internet, I wasn\u2019t shocked, or even surprised. Female sportswriters get these notes, in many forums: Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, email.Within our small sorority, we female sports journalists don\u2019t talk about these written assaults much. We all know that they exist and that they\u2019ll just keep coming, as if it\u2019s part of the job description.\u201cMen get mean comments, too, but I think the context of it is quite different for women,\u201d Spain said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just, like, \u2018You\u2019re an idiot, and I\u2019m mad at you for your opinion.\u2019 It\u2019s: \u2018I hate you because you are in a space that I don\u2019t want you in. I come to sports to get away from women. Why don\u2019t you take your top off and just make me lunch?\u2019 \u201dIt used to take at least a few days for disturbed readers to get their cruel points across \u2014 that slap in the face via snail mail.When I first became a sportswriter, nearly two decades ago, a reader sent me a letter, with no return address on the envelope, week after week. On a single white sheet of paper, the reader pasted a photo of me that ran with my newspaper column. Below that were comments about my face, hairstyle and figure and how, as a woman, I should be cooking and having babies instead of invading men\u2019s territory to write about sports. How I needed to quit my job and get out of town. Or else.Creepy. But I just filed the letters away, kept my head down and moved on.I had heard the stories of the women who came before me and what they had to go through to cover sports. Journalists like Lisa Olson, who had been with The Boston Herald. In 1990, she said she had been harassed in the locker room while covering the New England Patriots. What followed her accusations was brutal: Death threats. Slashed tires. Naked blow-up \u201cLisa\u201d dolls tossed around the stands at games. Her apartment was burglarized. In the end, she had to move to Australia to get away from the abuse.So the notes I received from creepy readers didn\u2019t seem so bad at all. This, I thought, was the deal for women in sports. I had been an athlete. You had to be tough to make it. I could take it.Men got mean notes, too, I was told. But as far as I can tell, none of the notes my male colleagues have ever received are laced with sexual connotations.I\u2019m pretty sure that any man who wrote about the rape accusations against the former Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston didn\u2019t receive reader emails saying he would be raped because of his opinion, as I did. He probably didn\u2019t get an email from a man who said he wanted to line him and other men like him against a wall so he could shoot them all in the head.Emails like that arrived in my work inbox one morning. It was Christmas.Can\u2019t I just ignore all of it? That\u2019s not easy to do now that news organizations expect reporters to build a presence on social media and engage with readers. Especially on Twitter. In the sports community, Twitter is the social hub of choice for athletes, fans and journalists \u2014 a giant water cooler in the cloud where people share opinions and ideas.It can be a great place to network. It can also be a hostile place. Harassers can hide in anonymity and strike in a millisecond.DiCaro, a former family law and criminal lawyer, said a man once sent her avalanches of troublesome messages on social media, for hours a day, as he stalked her. Another man, after DiCaro began writing about the rape accusations against Chicago Blackhawks forward Patrick Kane, sent DiCaro a series of tweets, talking about her being killed and raped. He said she would be in trouble the next time he was in Chicago.DiCaro said she never went to the police because she had been told there was nothing that law enforcement could do to stop the messages.\u201cYou just can\u2019t get away from being harassed,\u201d DiCaro said. \u201cBack in the day, there just wasn\u2019t as much volume of these messages as there is on Twitter.\u201dDiCaro said she recorded the video of the mean tweets with the hope that it would change some people\u2019s minds about harassing others on social media. She has two teenage sons, and she wants them and the younger generation to know what\u2019s acceptable \u2014 and what\u2019s not.How does this abuse end? DiCaro said there needed to be more diversity in sports media. She lamented that sports was still a man\u2019s world, and would be at least for the near future, leaving the few women in it as targets for some men who don\u2019t want them in their boys\u2019 club.\u201cIt\u2019s sort of like separating a weak antelope from the pack,\u201d she said. \u201cI think guys recognize that.\u201dDiCaro and Spain say 90 percent of the response on Twitter to their video has been positive. But the remaining 10 percent, the sad and sorry 10 percent, didn\u2019t get the point.One person on Twitter told Spain, \u201cplease kill yourself I will provide the bleach.\u201dSo much hate. And for what?Because of an editing error, the Sports of The Times column last Friday, about social-media abuse faced by female sports journalists, misidentified the publication for which Julie DiCaro is a reporter. It is The Cauldron \u2014 not Sports Illustrated, a partner of The Cauldron.Email: juliet@nytimes.com Advertisement"}

Ms. Warner, 17, had been declared brain-dead on Sunday at NYU Langone Medical Center, where she had been transferred from Coney Island Hospital after being attacked, the police and the Brooklyn district attorney\u2019s office said.\u201cThey ain\u2019t have to take my baby like that,\u201d Ms. Warner\u2019s mother, Niece Warner, 44, said as she stood smoking a cigarette inside the apartment where she lives with her husband and their children, who now number five.Sabrina Agard-Forde, 18, was arrested and charged with felony and misdemeanor assault after the attack, the Brooklyn district attorney\u2019s office said. But a grand jury will consider more serious charges against her after the medical examiner determines the cause of Ms. Warner\u2019s death, prosecutors said.Ms. Agard-Forde, of Brownsville, Brooklyn, was released on bail after her arraignment on Sunday and ordered to return to court on Friday. Her lawyer, Robert Heilbrun, said he expected her name to be cleared.\u201cThe case is a tragedy,\u201d Mr. Heilbrun said. \u201cMy client has never been in trouble, never been arrested. She\u2019s graduating from Brooklyn Bridge high school in the spring.

Ms. Warner, who had been inside the store, walked out and confronted the girls in an effort to protect her brother, and the argument escalated to a fight, Ms. Johnson said.Ms. Warner\u2019s parents had kept her on life support after the attack to allow relatives from out of town to come bid her farewell, Ms. Johnson said. The family has set up a GoFundMe page to raise money for Ms. Warner\u2019s funeral and burial expenses.Ms. Warner, whom friends and relatives called Mammas, was a sophomore at the William E.

The recent wage discrimination complaint filed by the United States women\u2019s soccer team exposed the harsh reality of female players\u2019 paychecks compared with their male counterparts. What is particularly infuriating is that male and female tennis players play alongside one another.The sports industry can take a page from tech on addressing wage-gap issues. Though the data is still ambiguous on the industry at large, the latest findings are encouraging. Most recently, Facebook and Microsoft confirmed that men and women at their companies were earning the same.

Varying AffordabilityTo the Sports Editor:Re \u201cAt Augusta and Wimbledon, Similar Auras of Tradition,\u201d April 10: Augusta and Wimbledon may have common ground for competitors and insiders, but they are very different events in their accessibility to the general public. Wimbledon makes affordable tickets available to the public through a pre-event lottery and the daily queue, and allows early-departing spectators to donate their tickets to charity for resale at a discount. I\u2019ve gained entry through all these methods.On the other hand, Augusta provides no affordable access for the general public, even those willing to make extra effort to attend. I have family who live in the Augusta area who have never been able to attend the tournament. Spending more than $1,000 to buy a single-day ticket through a broker is not an option for most people. The two events could not be more different in their respect for fans wishing to attend.JEFF CARPENTER, Mamaroneck, N.Y.Acknowledging MantleTo the Sports Editor:Re \u201cNourished by Legend, If Not Yet Prosperity,\u201d April 11: While it is sad to read of the economic troubles of the town where Mickey Mantle attended high school, at least Commerce, Okla., acknowledges Mantle\u2019s connection to its town.Some years ago I made a pilgrimage to Spavinaw, Okla., where Mantle was born and raised. Stopping for a cup of coffee, I asked the two young men behind the counter if Spavinaw was the place where the Mick was born. Neither of them had heard of Mantle, much less anything about his birthplace. Economic woes notwithstanding, at least Commerce strives to keep its favorite son\u2019s legend alive.BARRY L.

This was the second game that Jackie Robinson played in Philadelphia. As we went to our seats, I was struck by the fact that the stands were full. The Phillies were a terrible team and rarely attracted crowds of greater than 5,000.Many of the fans were black. When the Dodgers scored, a man sitting next to me cheered. I asked why he was cheering for the visiting team. \u201cSon, Brooklyn is now our team,\u201d he said.

The ad also says that the company laid off workers last year, while its chief executive donated $500,000 to an outside group supporting Mr. Kasich.The Cruz campaign has sent mailers attacking Mr. Kasich over Ohio\u2019s spending during his time as governor, as well as his record on guns and the military when he served in Congress.\u201cDespite having no pathway to the nomination, Kasich insists on continuing his quixotic auditioning tour to become Donald Trump\u2019s vice president,\u201d Catherine Frazier, a spokeswoman for Mr. Cruz, said on Sunday. \u201cSo far his greatest strength has been anonymity \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we\u2019re simply shining some light on his record.\u201d\u00e2\u0080\u009cTed Cruz is recycling failed Democrat attacks in a desperate effort to smear Governor Kasich,\u00e2\u0080\u009d John Weaver, Mr. Kasich\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief strategist, said in response to the TV ad. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt didn\u2019t work for dishonest Ohio Democrats in 2014 and won\u2019t work for deceptive Ted Cruz now.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Cruz and Mr. Kasich have scarcely tangled with each other during the Republican primary, in large measure because they tend to appeal to different swaths of the Republican electorate.

{"Headline": "How to Fix Politics", "Date": "2016-04-12", "News": "Supported byIn the middle of this depressing presidential campaign I sometimes wonder, How could we make our politics better?It\u2019s possible to imagine an elite solution. The next president could get together with the leaders of both parties in Congress and say: \u201cWe\u2019re going to change the way we do business in Washington. We\u2019re going to deliberate and negotiate. We\u2019ll disagree and wrangle, but we will not treat this as good-versus-evil blood sport.\u201d That kind of leadership might trickle down.But it\u2019s increasingly clear that the roots of political dysfunction lie deep in society. If there\u2019s truly going to be improvement, there has to be improvement in the social context politics is embedded in.In healthy societies, people live their lives within a galaxy of warm places. They are members of a family, neighborhood, school, civic organization, hobby group, company, faith, regional culture, nation, continent and world. Each layer of life is nestled in the others to form a varied but coherent whole.But starting just after World War II, America\u2019s community/membership mind-set gave way to an individualistic/autonomy mind-set. The idea was that individuals should be liberated to live as they chose, so long as they didn\u2019t interfere with the rights of others.By 1981, the pollster Daniel Yankelovich noticed the effects: \u201cThroughout most of this century Americans believed that self-denial made sense, sacrificing made sense, obeying the rules made sense, subordinating oneself to the institution made sense. But now doubts have set in, and Americans now believe that the old giving/getting compact needlessly restricts the individual while advancing the power of large institutions \u2026 who use the power to enhance their own interests at the expense of the public.\u201dThe individualist turn had great effects but also accumulating downsides. By 2005, 47 percent of Americans reported that they knew none or just a few of their neighbors by name. There\u2019s been a sharp rise in the number of people who report that they have no close friends to confide in.But Americans spend less time with middle-ring township relationships \u2014 the PTA, the neighborhood watch.Middle-ring relationships, Dunkelman argues, help people become skilled at deliberation. The guy sitting next to you at the volunteer fire company may have political opinions you find abhorrent, but you still have to get stuff done with him, week after week.Middle-ring relationships also diversify the sources of identity. You might be an O\u2019Rourke, an Irish Catholic and a professor, but you are also a citizen, importantly of the Montrose neighborhood in Houston.With middle-ring memberships deteriorating, Americans have become worse at public deliberation. People find it easier to ignore inconvenient viewpoints and facts. Partisanship becomes a preconscious lens through which people see the world.They report being optimistic or pessimistic depending on whether their team is in power. They become unrealistic. Trump voters don\u2019t seem to realize how unelectable their man is because they hang out with people like themselves.We\u2019re good at bonding with people like ourselves but worse at bridging with people unlike ourselves. (Have you noticed that most people who call themselves \u201cconnectors\u201d are actually excluders because they create groups restricted to people with similar status levels?)With fewer sources of ethnic and local identity, people ask politics to fill the void. Being a Democrat or a Republican becomes their ethnicity. People put politics at the center of their psychological, emotional and even spiritual life.This is asking too much of politics. Once politics becomes your ethnic and moral identity, it becomes impossible to compromise, because compromise becomes dishonor. If you put politics at the center of identity, you end up asking the state to eclipse every social authority but itself. Presidential campaigns become these gargantuan two-year national rituals that swallow everything else in national life.If we\u2019re going to salvage our politics, we probably have to shrink politics, and nurture the thick local membership web that politics rests within. We probably have to scale back the culture of autonomy that was appropriate for the 1960s but that has since gone too far.If we make this cultural shift, we may even end up happier. For there is a paradox to longing. If each of us fulfill all of our discrete individual desires, we end up with a society that is not what we want at all.The highest level of Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs, self-actualization, is actually connected to the lowest level, group survival. People experience their highest joy in helping their neighbors make it through the day.Advertisement"}

Al Sharpton.He listed his usual litany of complaints with the political system and the influence of Wall Street, but he tried to root that message more distinctly in race, weaving quotes from the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. into his remarks.\u00e2\u0080\u009cDr. King recognized it is criminal to have people working on a full-time basis, in a full-time job, getting part-time income,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat was the 1960s.

Each time Mr. Key, as the anger translator, began a new manic tirade, the president burst out laughing. Already dressed in his tuxedo for the evening, he glanced toward us, his staff, huddled in a corner of the room.\u201cI\u2019ve got to hold it together,\u201d Mr. Obama said. He said it again backstage a few hours later, this time using a comedy term for laughing in the middle of a scene. \u201cI have to make sure I don\u2019t break.\u201dPart of what makes any presidential joke funny is the fact that the president is telling a joke. But this president has a talent for comedy \u2014 an impressive sense of timing and audience. His administration combined that talent with an understanding of a changing media landscape and the emergence of viral videos. Jokes became a real tool to move his agenda forward.There are some topics no president, even a genuinely funny one, can joke about. National security is off limits. So are all but the gentlest mentions of the first family. Then there was the meeting in 2013 when, sitting on the surprisingly comfortable brown couches in the Oval Office, Mr. Obama\u2019s speechwriters suggested he talk about Republican senators in the style of Alicia Silverstone\u2019s character from \u201cClueless.\u201d Something like: \u201cSo then Mitch was talking with John who was talking with Lindsey who said that Rand and Ted were, like, talking?\u201d\u201cThis might be funny \u2026 if a professional comedian did it,\u201d the president said. We moved on.Another joke he rejected involved the District of Columbia decriminalizing marijuana, a Rand Paul filibuster and a congressional debate on \u201cwhether or not the Taco Bell is still open.\u201d He let us pitch him on it, but in the end it proved too clunky and complicated.On Saturday night, the president will deliver his final correspondents\u2019 dinner monologue. For weeks, writers in and outside the White House have submitted hundreds of jokes, and only a handful of my former colleagues know which 35 or 40 will make the final cut. A safe bet, however, is that at least a few of the president\u2019s one-liners will look back on the last eight years. He\u2019ll have plenty of material to work with \u2014 an economic recovery, Obamacare, rescuing the auto industry. It\u2019s unlikely \u201cstarring in viral videos\u201d will be high on the legacy list.But I do think that presidential comedy has played a role in this chapter in American history. The bully pulpit has splintered. It\u2019s become harder than ever to get people\u2019s attention. And the White House has recognized what class clowns have known all along. Being funny helps.David Litt, a former White House speechwriter, is the head writer and producer for Funny or Die DC.

He also said the party needed to focus on a \u00e2\u0080\u009c50-state strategy\u00e2\u0080\u009d to win local elections and bring in new members.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe problem we are having now is not, in my view, that the Republicans are winning elections,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe problem is that the Democrats are losing elections. In November of 2014, the midterm elections, 63 percent of the American people did not vote; 80 percent of young people and low-income people did not vote.

{"Headline": "Why Is Productivity So Weak? Three Theories", "Date": "2016-04-28", "News": "Supported byEconomic MysteryMore than 151 million Americans count themselves employed, a number that has risen sharply in the last few years. The question is this: What are they doing all day?Productivity is one of the most important yet least understood areas of economics. Over long periods, it is the only pathway toward higher levels of prosperity; the reason an American worker makes much more today than a century ago is that each hour of labor produces much more in goods and services. Put bluntly, if the kind of productivity growth implied by the new data published Thursday were to persist indefinitely, your grandchildren would be no richer than you.But it is also really hard to measure, particularly for service firms. (How productive were employees at Facebook, or your local bank, last quarter? Have fun trying to figure it out.)That is a long way of saying we don\u2019t know for sure what is going on right now, or how long it will last. But the possible answers range from utterly depressing to downright optimistic.The productivity slowdown is real, and it\u2019s not going away. Earlier waves of innovation in technology (a computer on every office worker\u2019s desk, for example) and management strategies (like outsourcing noncore functions) have been fully put into place across corporate America, and so are no longer increasing productivity.Add to that a slowdown in capital spending by businesses since the 2008 recession, which means workers aren\u2019t getting better equipment or software that might help them do their jobs more efficiently. Moreover, if you believe the theory mentioned above about low-productivity workers being more likely to lose their jobs during the recession, the people returning to the labor force now may be less effective at boosting economic output for each hour they put in.In the depressing scenario, Americans\u2019 standards of living are just going to grow more slowly in the future, and there\u2019s not much we can do about it. Fortunately, this isn\u2019t the only possible one.Maybe we just aren\u2019t counting things right \u2014 or, to use the economists\u2019 preferred term, there is measurement error.After all, entire industries are being transformed in ways hard to account for in data on gross domestic product, particularly in technology and services. Having a high-powered computer in our pockets and social networks that let us stay in touch with friends may make us better off than the narrow math of gross domestic product \u2014 which counts only what we pay for \u2014 would suggest.Still, it\u2019s not clear why these nonmarket gains in quality of life would be so different now than they were in earlier generations when, for example, videocassette recorders became widespread or the air became cleaner thanks to environmental regulation.Their conclusion, after examining tech and other measurement issues, is that it isn\u2019t. That said, the tools that statistics-keepers use to measure the economy are never perfect, so there could be problems not yet understood that are creating a false impression of a productivity drought.Think about a business that is investing for the future. It hires a bunch of people and opens new offices and builds new factories. But while it is doing all that stuff, its actual productivity is quite low. It has a lot of people working a lot of hours, but very low economic output until its operations are fully up to speed.Maybe, just maybe, that is happening with the United States economy writ large. Businesses are adding workers in preparation for the future, but it will take time for their investments to pay off in terms of gross domestic product.There\u2019s a recent precedent for that pattern. In the late 1990s, the stock market was booming and companies were making huge investments in staff, equipment and information technology. But reported productivity growth was actually below the long-term trend \u2014 only about 1.7 percent a year from 1993 to 1998, for example. Then it began soaring in the years that followed, particularly in the early 2000s.But here\u2019s one piece of evidence that the pattern of the 1990s is not what is afoot today: Business investment spending on equipment, intellectual property and structures is low relative to the size of the economy. You\u2019d expect those numbers to be higher if this was just a productivity lull as the economy waits for big investments in the future to pay off.Still, there could be enough going on below the surface of those overall numbers that the optimistic case remains plausible. To use one example, engineers at several companies are hard at work trying to perfect driverless cars. At present, they are a sap on productivity \u2014 they put in many thousands of hours of work with no economic output to show for it. But if successful, their work could radically increase the nation\u2019s productivity in the decades ahead.Apply the same across a wide range of fields \u2014 industrial goods, pharmaceuticals and medicine, financial technology firms \u2014 and optimism becomes more plausible. That\u2019s the scenario we should all hope is occurring: Slow productivity growth now is just a down payment on a much brighter future.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "F.B.I. Director Suggests Bill for iPhone Hacking Topped $1.3 Million", "Date": "2016-04-21", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The director of the F.B.I. suggested Thursday that his agency paid at least $1.3 million to an undisclosed group to help hack into the encrypted iPhone used by an attacker in the mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif.At a conference on global security in London, a moderator asked James B. Comey Jr., the F.B.I. chief, how much bureau officials had to pay the undisclosed outside group to demonstrate how to bypass the phone\u2019s encryption.\u201cA lot,\u201d Mr. Comey said, as audience members at the Aspen Institute event laughed.He continued: \u201cLet\u2019s see, more than I will make in the remainder of this job, which is seven years and four months, for sure.\u201dThe F.B.I. had been unwilling to say anything at all until Thursday about how much it paid for what has become one of the world\u2019s most publicized hacking jobs, so Mr. Comey\u2019s cryptic comments about his own wages and the bounty quickly sent listeners scurrying in search of their calculators.The F.B.I. director makes about $185,100 a year \u2014 so Mr. Comey stands to earn at least $1.35 million at that base rate of pay for the remainder of his 10-year term.The F.B.I. declined to confirm or deny Thursday whether the bureau had in fact paid at least $1.3 million for the hacking, and it declined to elaborate on Mr. Comey\u2019s suggestive remarks.But that price tag, if confirmed, appears in line with what other companies have offered for identifying iOS vulnerabilities.Zerodium, a security firm in Washington that collects and then sells such bugs, said last fall that it would pay $1 million for weaknesses in Apple\u2019s iOS 9 operating system. Hackers eventually claimed that bounty. The iPhone used by the San Bernardino gunman ran iOS 9.\u201cA number of factors go into pricing these bounties,\u201d said Alex Rice, the co-founder of the security start-up HackerOne CTO, who also started Facebook\u2019s bug bounty program. Mr. Rice said that the highest premiums were paid when the buyer didn\u2019t intend to disclose the flaw to a party that could fix it.\u201cThe cost of keeping a flaw secret is high,\u201d Mr. Rice said. He added that buyers like Zerodium\u2019s customers and the government might not work to fix problems.When companies run bug bounty programs, they may pay about $100,000 to hackers that show them system vulnerabilities that must be fixed. \u201cWhen you sell at a high price, you have to be O.K. with the possibility that the person you sold the flaw to could do something bad with it,\u201d Mr. Rice said.While Mr. Comey\u2019s remarks appeared to address the lingering mystery of how much the F.B.I. paid to get into the San Bernardino phone, he said nothing that would indicate the actual identity of the outside group behind the hacking. Some media reports have named an Israeli software company that might have helped the F.B.I., but numerous law enforcement officials have said that company was not involved.After an intense courtroom fight in Southern California, the F.B.I. disclosed three weeks ago that it had managed to get access to the data inside an iPhone 5c used by Syed Farook, one of the attackers in the San Bernardino rampage, which killed 14 people, by paying the outside group.The Justice Department had gone to court to try to force Apple to develop a new operating system to allow access into the encrypted phone, setting off an intense national debate about privacy versus national security. But it withdrew its case after the outside party came to the F.B.I. and demonstrated a way around the phone\u2019s internal defenses, which would have destroyed the data inside after 10 failed password attempts and would have meant longer and longer intervals in between guesses.With those mechanisms disabled, the F.B.I. was able to use what is called a brute force attack \u2014 using computers to guess vast numbers of password combinations at once \u2014 in order to get inside the phone.But the Justice Department is still trying to force Apple in court to help unlock encrypted phones in Brooklyn, Boston and elsewhere.Because of an editing error, the homepage and mobile headlines on an earlier version of this article incorrectly reported the estimated cost of the iPhone hacking. It was $1.3 million, not $1.3 billion. An earlier version also misstated the focus of a conference in London, where James B. Comey Jr., the F.B.I. chief, was asked how much bureau officials had to pay the undisclosed outside group to demonstrate how to bypass the phone\u2019s encryption. It was a global security conference, not a technology conference.Eric Lichtblau reported from Washington and Katie Benner from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

His family had asked him to stop, fearful that the posts would make him a target, and for about four months, ending in January, he had complied, said Gulam Rabbi Chowdhury, a childhood friend.\u201cTo tell the truth, he was always a little detached from his family; he had trouble with them because of his views on religion,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was very outspoken.

In one post, he used a proverb to criticize the government\u2019s approach to rising militancy, likening it to raising a baby snake by feeding it milk and bananas. Asked for his religious views, Mr. Uddin wrote, \u201cI have no religion.\u201dIn August, he responded publicly to what appeared to be threats, saying: \u201cNo one is forcing you to read or look at what I write. So why this violence, this murdering?\u201d Then he abruptly ceased his prolific postings, explaining his decision with a grim verse: \u201cI won\u2019t write anymore. I won\u2019t stay here anymore. Your hell can stay your own.

{"Headline": "An App That Pushes Aside the Art World Curtain", "Date": "2016-04-08", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 The process of buying and selling art, particularly contemporary works, has a reputation for opacity, but a new mobile app that promises to instantly provide price data could contribute to the opening up of the market.The user takes a photo of an artwork with a mobile device. Within seconds, Magnus provides the name of the artist, gallery price, past dealer and auction prices of other works, and the artist\u2019s exhibition history. The image can be shared via text, email, Instagram, Facebook and other social media, and saved in the user\u2019s digital collection.\u201cIf you want to buy a product, you need to know the price and make comparisons,\u201d Mr. Resch said. \u201cThere is virtually no data on gallery prices, and if you want information on the auction market, you have to pay for it.\u201d\u201cIt isn\u2019t an app built for billionaires, but for everyone interested in art,\u201d Mr. Resch said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a selling platform. Our aim is to provide access to the art market and democratize it and hopefully enlarge it.\u201dMr. Resch said prices given by a gallery had to be corroborated by other trusted users before being added to the database. The app also includes an interactive map with information on gallery openings and shows, as well as museum exhibitions.To see whether Magnus works as advertised, Lisa Schiff, a New York art adviser, took a smartphone loaded with the app to the Matthew Marks and Marianne Boesky galleries in Chelsea this week.Mr. Marks was exhibiting vintage photographs by Ellsworth Kelly, Ms. Boesky new paintings by the Johannesburg artist Serge Alain Nitegeka, neither of which could be regarded as \u201cmainstream\u201d shows. Ms. Schiff said the app recognized and supplied current gallery prices and historic market data for all but one of the works she photographed (people often take photographs of artworks with phones in commercial galleries, and the practice is generally permitted, provided the image is for personal use.)Ms. Schiff, who has been an adviser for 15 years and who does not know Mr. Resch, described the app as a \u201cgame changer,\u201d though she noted she could not find any data on private resales by dealers.What collectors at every level most want, she said, is to be empowered and to have transparency.\u201cThis app opens up information to the world,\u201d she added. \u201cMore people will feel comfortable visiting galleries with this in front of them. It\u2019s also going to affect sales at art fairs. You won\u2019t have to wait around to talk to the dealer.\u201dWhat about his latest primary market sales? Gagosian, as a rule, does not divulge prices to the media, but the Magnus app tells us that Mr. Bradley\u2019s eight-foot-wide geometric abstract \u201cCanton Rose\u201d sold at the show for $850,000. Ms. Schiff said she was quoted the same price by Gagosian.But others are skeptical that this kind of technology will have a positive effect on the art world.\u201cWhat concerns me most is that it will mean a lot more people will look at art solely through the lens of value,\u201d said Glenn Scott Wright, a co-director of the Victoria Miro gallery in London. \u201cThey\u2019ll take a picture, and within three seconds they\u2019ll think they know the resale price of the work.\u201dMr. Scott Wright said that primary market prices could change, even during an exhibition, and that secondary market valuations were \u201cincredibly nuanced,\u201d with much depending on the quality, condition, date and provenance of the work.\u201cAn app isn\u2019t a substitute for human expertise,\u201d he added.Victoria Miro\u2019s gallery in Mayfair opened a show on Friday of new paintings by the Danish artist John Korner that subtly allude to of-the-moment themes like income inequality and population displacement.Two days before the opening, Magnus indicated that the show was on its radar, but that gallery prices were not available. Mr. Scott Wright said that paintings would be priced between 10,000 pounds and 35,000 pounds, about $14,000 to $49,000.The consequences, unintended or otherwise, of Magnus could give the art world plenty to think about. A lot depends on whether the app can gather a critical mass of crowd-sourced gallery prices.Though most transactions are still completed through traditional retail channels, the influence of digital technology on the process has been undeniably transformative. Sales are now routinely predicated on high-resolution images sent by email or text, or shown on an iPad. Artists\u2019 reputations are made on Instagram.Will Magnus be the art trade\u2019s next leap into the light?Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misspelled in one instance the name of the gallery that is showing work by the Danish artist John Korner.

Instead of rivers, hills, and towns, the pieces of the territory are facts.\u201cTo call something a map is not to say anything about how good it is,\u201d Dr. Godfrey-Smith added. \u201cThere are fantastically good maps where there\u2019s not a shred of doubt about their accuracy. And there are maps that are speculative.\u201dTo judge a map\u2019s quality, we can see how well it guides us through its territory. In a similar way, scientists test out new theories against evidence. Just as many maps have proven to be unreliable, many theories have been cast aside.But other theories have become the foundation of modern science, such as the theory of evolution, the general theory of relativity, the theory of plate tectonics, the theory that the sun is at the center of the solar system, and the germ theory of disease.\u201cTo the best of our ability, we\u2019ve tested them, and they\u2019ve held up,\u201d said Dr. Miller. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why we\u2019ve held on to these things.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fight to Impeach Brazil\u2019s Leader Tears at Fabric of Daily Life", "Date": "2016-04-15", "News": "Supported byBRAS\u00cdLIA \u2014 The wall, nearly a mile of corrugated metal, plunges down the center of the majestic lawn that faces Brazil\u2019s National Congress, the modernist icon designed by Oscar Niemeyer.It was hastily erected in recent days, and is meant to separate the hundreds of thousands of protesters expected to descend on Bras\u00edlia, the Brazilian capital, this weekend as members of Congress vote on whether to begin impeachment proceedings against President Dilma Rousseff.The left side of the wall, facing Congress, is reserved for supporters of the left-leaning Ms. Rousseff, the right for people demanding her ouster.\u201cIt\u2019s not pretty, but the wall is necessary to keep the two sides from tearing each other apart,\u201d a 21-year-old police officer in head-to-toe riot gear said as she stood in the searing sun on Friday afternoon. \u201cWhen these protesters come together, they behave like soccer hooligans.\u201dBrazilian politics is a blood sport in the best of times, but the battle over Ms. Rousseff\u2019s impeachment is inflaming passions as never before, cleaving families, turning friends into enemies and transforming children into unwitting surrogates for the warring sides. Social media has been flooded with venom, and those who claim to be neutral often find themselves accused of treachery.On the streets of Brazilian cities, political rallies organized by one side or the other have been devolving into shouting matches or worse, including a brawl last month in S\u00e3o Paulo that left a former city councilor with a bloody lip.\u201cI don\u2019t think this will turn into a civil war because you\u2019d have to be stupid to fight for these politicians, but people are very stressed right now,\u201d said Rafael Alcadipani da Silveira, 39, a professor of organizational studies at Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Get\u00falio Vargas, one of the country\u2019s top universities. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen things this bad.\u201dPolitical passions have turned ordinary sartorial decisions into perceived acts of provocation. Lauana de Lima Oliveira, 22, a saleswoman from S\u00e3o Paulo, recalled a recent day when she decided to go to work in a red tank top. Red is the color associated with Ms. Rousseff\u2019s Workers\u2019 Party.As she rode in a crowded subway car, several passengers began to elbow her while hissing \u201cpetralha,\u201d a pejorative for party stalwarts. Ms. de Lima Oliveira, who said she was agnostic on the impeachment drive, was stunned.\u201cPeople have become like horses that wear blinders so they can\u2019t see anything on either side of them,\u201d she said. \u201cRed happens to be my favorite color, and I\u2019m not going to stop wearing it.\u201dIn the southern city of Porto Alegre, Ariane Leit\u00e3o, a surrogate councilwoman with the Workers\u2019 Party, filed a formal complaint against her longtime pediatrician who, citing Ms. Leit\u00e3o\u2019s party affiliation, abruptly cut off ties. \u201cGiven all that has happened,\u201d the doctor wrote to her, according to the newspaper Folha de S. Paulo. \u201cI am not in the position to treat your son.\u201dMost alarming, experts say, is the extent to which the political maelstrom has affected those too young to vote. Last month, students at a private school in S\u00e3o Paulo reportedly terrorized a 9-year-old boy after he showed up to class wearing a red shirt emblazoned with the Swiss flag \u2014 a gesture of neutrality, according to his father, who discussed the episode on Facebook in a posting shared more than 4,500 times.School officials say many children have been parroting the caustic expressions they hear at home, and teachers at one school in S\u00e3o Paulo were alarmed when a child drew a picture of Ms. Rousseff hanging by a noose.Ilana Katz, a psychoanalyst who works with children, said she was worried that many young people were learning intolerance from their parents, and that it is acceptable to express disagreements through aggression. \u201cIt\u2019s this idea that there is only one way to live, and that those who live differently need to be eliminated,\u201d she said. \u201cWe should be teaching the opposite of that.\u201dFor grown-ups, the fallout has been even more pronounced. Among urban professionals, it\u2019s common to hear stories about relationships that have been shattered by the mounting political warfare.F\u00e1tima Nobre, 57, an advertising executive, said a neighbor threw her out of his apartment during lunch a few weeks ago when she expressed support for Ms. Rousseff\u2019s impeachment. \u201cIt was as if he was channeling Dilma\u2019s spirit, like he had turned into the devil,\u201d she said, referring to the president by her first name. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be friends with a person like that.\u201dThe most searing rancor often finds expression on Facebook, where Brazilians\u2019 postings about pets and food have been almost entirely supplanted by political shouting matches.Andressa Umeki, 34, a journalist, said a verbal imbroglio on Facebook ended her relationship with a cousin who used to shower her with words of affection. After Ms. Umeki publicly cast her lot with the opposition seeking impeachment, the cousin unfriended her. \u201cWe used to speak by phone but not anymore,\u201d she added.Alarmed by the surge in social strife, some Brazilians have taken a hard line on political chatter. Tarciano Andr\u00e9 Barbosa, 40, a tech analyst in S\u00e3o Paulo, said he had to warn his father-in-law about cracking political jokes during his daughter\u2019s recent birthday party.\u201cYou see people on TV in the Middle East throwing bombs at one another, and here we are fighting, too, though in a different way,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople have become so extremist. It\u2019s absurd, and in the end this will pass, but relationships can\u2019t be lost over ignorance.\u201dThough it sometimes feels as if all of Brazilian society is consumed by the machinations taking place in Bras\u00edlia, those who study the growing polarization say much of the fury is confined to older, middle-class professionals.Pablo Ortellado, a professor at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo who studies protest movements in Brazil, said a recent survey he conducted showed that working-class Brazilians and people under 35 had largely stayed away from the political rallies that were roiling many cities. \u201cEven I was surprised by the results because it sometimes seems that these protests are affecting all of society,\u201d he said.His hypothesis? Because educated, older Brazilians came of age when the Workers\u2019 Party was battling the dictatorship that ruled Brazil until the mid-1980s, they are more invested in the outcome of the current political struggle.\u201cEither they are still enthusiastic for the party or they feel betrayed by the party or they never liked it,\u201d Mr. Ortellado said, adding that he felt optimistic that younger Brazilians would one day be less dogmatic about party politics. \u201cIt points to a future, perhaps 10 years from now, when we can work out our political differences in another way.\u201dEven at the wall that cleaves the national mall, such levelheaded pragmatism was not hard to find. On Friday afternoon, two colleagues from the Ministry of Health spent their lunch break taking photos of each other amid a phalanx of riot police. The men, Leonardo Ferreira de Almeida, 28, and Wanderson Gontijo, 38, are on opposite sides in the impeachment debate \u2014 and acknowledged spending way too much time at work talking politics \u2014 but they said their discussions rarely turned venomous.\u201cThe way I see it, democracy is an opportunity to have different opinions but to not be blind to the weaknesses of your argument,\u201d said Mr. Almeida, a social policy analyst at the ministry.Mr. Gontijo, a technology specialist, nodded in agreement and then looked at the wall, which was already festooned with posters comparing it to the Berlin Wall. \u201cThis is a shame because it doesn\u2019t represent democracy,\u201d he said.With that, the men threw their arms around each other, smiled broadly and posed for one more photograph.Paula Moura contributed reporting from Bras\u00edlia and S\u00e3o Paulo.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Swim. Bike. Cheat?", "Date": "2016-04-08", "News": "Supported bySQUAMISH, British Columbia \u2014 The race was tough and the conditions dreadful \u2014 2.4 miles of swimming, 112 miles of cycling and 26.2 miles of running, mostly in freezing rain \u2014 but Susanne Davis crossed the Ironman Canada finish line last July certain that she had won her category, women age 40-44.Davis, who comes from Carlsbad, Calif., and is one of the top triathletes in her age group in the world, had been first out of the water and first off her bike \u2014 she was sure of it. Spectators using a mobile phone race app that shows competitors\u2019 relative positions called out encouragement, telling her she was ahead by a comfortable 10 minutes. As she ran, Davis looked out for rivals, asking the age of every woman she passed or who passed her, and encountered none from her age group.Yet there she was, accepting the medal for second place at the awards ceremony the next day, five minutes behind a Canadian triathlete named Julie Miller who seemed to have materialized from nowhere and somehow won the race.Miller, a mother of two young daughters, is a mental health counselor specializing in body-image disorders here in Squamish. She is also a serious triathlete with a long record of success. Before last year\u2019s race, in Whistler, she had also won her division in the 2013 Ironman Canada, the 2014 Vancouver Triathlon and the 2014 Long Course World Championships in Weihai, China, where she competed for Canada and where her win briefly made her the world champion for her age group.Davis knew none of that. All she knew was that in more than three hours of hyperconscious running, she had not seen Miller once.The winners were announced: Julie Miller first, Susanne Davis second. \u201cShe didn\u2019t come down and shake our hands,\u201d Davis said, referring to Miller. \u201cIn my entire 20 years of racing, I\u2019ve never had that happen. That\u2019s when I looked at her and said: \u2018Gosh, I didn\u2019t see you. Where did you pass me?\u2019\u00a0\u201dMiller replied that she had been easily recognizable in her bright green socks and then all but ran off the awards stage, Davis said, telling Davis that she would see her at the world championships in Kona, Hawaii.Davis compared notes with the third- and fourth-place finishers. They, too, were mystified. They had not seen Miller on the course, either.This odd series of events eventually touched off an extraordinary feat of forensic detective work by a group of athletes who were convinced that Miller had committed what they consider the triathlon\u2019s worst possible transgression. They believed she had deliberately cut the course and then lied about it.Dissatisfied with the response of race officials, they methodically gathered evidence from the minutiae of her record: official race photographs, timing data, photographs from spectators along the routes, the accounts of other competitors and volunteers who saw, or did not see, Miller at various points. Much of it suggested that Miller simply could not have completed some segments of the race in the times she claimed, and all of it raised grave questions about the integrity of her results at Whistler and other races.Three weeks after winning Ironman Canada, Miller was disqualified from the race, her time erased, her first-place finish voided. Soon after, she was disqualified from two previous races that she had won. Officials are investigating her 2014 victory in China. Triathlon Canada has barred her from competing for the next two years, citing \u201crepeated rule violations,\u201d while Ironman has barred her indefinitely from its competitions.\u201cWe can\u2019t prove what happened on the course in Ironman Canada in 2015, or what her intent was,\u201d the regional director for Ironman, Keats McGonigal, said in an interview. \u201cPeople can make their own judgments and decisions. But what we can prove is that it would have been impossible for her to be at specific points at specific times and still get to the finish line when she did.\u201dMiller denies it all, in the most emphatic tones. She says that she is the victim of a smear campaign by envious, spiteful athletes who cannot cope with her success and high profile and that the only thing she did wrong, besides winning too often, was to lose her timing chip in a couple of races.\u201cI did not cheat in the Whistler Ironman competition,\u201d she said in an email, \u201cnor would I ever cheat or have I ever cheated in any competition.\u201dA Worse OffenseThere are a lot of ways to cheat in sports, of course, and the most notorious is probably doping, the methods of which become ever more subtle and complex even as officials devise ever more sophisticated ways to spot them. But runners and long-distance competitors \u2014 marathoners, cyclists, triathletes \u2014 reserve a special circle of contempt, and feel a special sort of outrage, for athletes who deliberately cut courses, covering only part of the distance while claiming they covered it all.\u201cMy readers think that doping is reprehensible, but that cutting the course is worse, almost incomprehensible,\u201d said Dan Empfield, a triathlete who runs Slowtwitch, a company whose website includes an influential web forum for triathletes. \u201cAt least if you dope, you\u2019re still trying to win the race by actually completing it.\u201dFor weeks last fall, Miller\u2019s case was topic No. 1 on the Slowtwitch forum. At times the conversation became so vicious and angry that Empfield took down posts and instructed contributors not to make personal attacks.\u201cThey\u2019re emotionally and financially invested in this sport,\u201d Empfield said of triathletes. \u201cWhen someone cuts a course, they feel highly violated. From their point of view, it\u2019s tearing at the fabric of trust required to have a sport at all.\u201dHe, too, has always claimed that he finished all the courses fairly.Whatever the circumstances, such accounts inevitably leave many questions unanswered. What motivates athletes who seem to cheat systemically, with forethought and planning, rather than, say, indulging in one-off opportunistic lapses? How can they justify it to themselves? And how, exactly, did they pull it off?\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really make any sense,\u201d said Claire Young, of Kelowna, British Columbia, who, after Miller was ultimately disqualified, took second place in Ironman Canada. \u201cMost of us are essentially racing against ourselves. There\u2019s no money and no glory. It\u2019s just a hobby, and if you cheat, who are you cheating? You\u2019re only cheating yourself.\u201dThe difference between cheating in 1980 and cheating today is that it\u2019s much harder to get away with now. What trips up contemporary cheaters, Empfield said, is their false assumption that the only thing they have to worry about is their timing chip, the device they wear that records their time at various points along a course.But the use of additional technology \u2014 especially the ubiquitous course photos taken by spectators and professional photographers, which provide a wealth of information about athletes\u2019 positions and times throughout a race \u2014 makes it difficult for people to cover their tracks after the fact.\u201cWhat these people don\u2019t understand is that the photos contain so much data \u2014 they don\u2019t know that this exists,\u201d Empfield said of cheaters. \u201cThey think that if they hide in the bushes and re-emerge or take the chip off or whatever, they\u2019re in the clear. But the problem is that people can now forensically recreate your race.\u201dA Serious AthleteWhile Miller\u2019s case brings to mind that of Ruiz, hers is harder to understand and, in a way, more unsettling.Ruiz was unknown in the marathon world, possibly troubled and motivated by reasons that remain obscure. She apparently made no real effort to run the race she claimed to have won, other than spontaneously emerging toward the end of the course to cross the finish line first. But Miller is a serious athlete with many years of competing behind her, and a long and, until now, distinguished record of turning in competitive and even winning times, not just in triathlons but also in mountain bike races and other events.\u201cIf she\u2019s really guilty of these acts, she was especially good at this, because she was doing it for years,\u201d Empfield said.Here in Squamish, a city whose spectacular natural beauty makes it a mecca for athletes and whose small size ensures that people know one another\u2019s business, Miller is considered an outgoing, upbeat person and a passionate sportswoman who has made competing central to her life.Something did not seem right when Julie Miller won her age group in an ironman triathlon. Some competitors set out to prove she cheated.Miller has never been a professional triathlete, and at the time of Ironman Canada last summer, she wasn\u2019t particularly well known in the greater triathlon world. But with her many responsibilities \u2014 she also runs a company that helps new parents deal with babies\u2019 sleep problems \u2014 Miller had established herself as a minor celebrity in town, an inspirational, warm, sympathetic woman who could apparently handle it all: work, motherhood, training and high-level sports competition.\u201cThere was a crowd of girls who almost hero-worshiped her,\u201d said Sheena Harris, a triathlete in Squamish. \u201cShe had a full-time job, ran her own business, trained full time \u2014 she was always killing it.\u201dEmotions here are still so raw on the subject of Miller that many people interviewed \u2014 other athletes, race volunteers and spectators, social acquaintances \u2014 declined to allow their names to be used in this article. Some said they were afraid of running into Miller in town; others said that Miller had responded to criticism so aggressively that they were leery of being bad-mouthed or even sued if they raised questions about her conduct. Even people who feel sympathetic toward her said they did not want to be seen speaking publicly about a subject so fraught.\u201cAs a person, she\u2019s really great \u2014 she\u2019s a really nice person,\u201d said a cyclist who knows her from their informal cycling training group, 100 or so people who ride together once a week. \u201cShe\u2019s a strong rider, a little firecracker, and she was really positive and got a lot of people interested in the sport.\u201dThe friend said that when the revelations came out, they divided the community as people debated whether something so grave could possibly be true. A lot of people turned against Miller, he said, gossiping and using the opportunity \u201cto crucify her, to spread a lot of information about her, whether true or not, that was harmful and hurtful.\u201dSince last fall, Miller has not gone riding with the other bikers in the group, he said, leaving them mystified about what exactly she did, confused about her state of mind and deeply frustrated. She has, he said, never offered a plausible explanation of what happened.A Missing Timing ChipQuestions swirled around Miller\u2019s performance as soon as she crossed the finish line at Ironman Canada, on July 26, 2015. The race was held in Whistler, a site of the 2010 Winter Olympics just north of Squamish. The day had begun with heavy, freezing rain, and many athletes had dropped out, defeated by the conditions.But Miller stayed, finishing in 10 hours 49 minutes 3 seconds, a time recorded manually by an official positioned at the finish line and confirmed by photographs and video images of her crossing it.There was a problem, though: She was missing her timing chip.Ironman athletes are required to wear timing chips, affixed to Velcro straps they usually wrap around their ankles. The chips are recognized electronically at timing mats positioned along the course, recording an athlete\u2019s time at those points (the interim times are known as splits). Although the Velcro straps sometimes come off, it is practically unheard of for the chip to become dislodged from the strap.But Miller\u2019s somehow did.Miller said that the chip had come off as she changed her clothes during the bike-to-run transition, when, apparently, she took off the Velcro strap and then put it back on over her socks. Race records show that, indeed, her chip had recorded a time of 7:17:50 at the end of the bike ride, before going silent.According to Ironman rules, no chip means no time. Miller was on the verge of being disqualified.\u201cShe said, \u2018Are you talking about Julie Miller?\u2019\u00a0\u201d James Young said in an interview. \u201c\u2018I\u2019m from the same town as her, and there\u2019s no way she won that race.\u2019\u201dLater that night, the official results, posted online, showed that Miller had been disqualified. Word got out that she had had some kind of issue with her timing chip. \u201cIt didn\u2019t even cross our minds that there might be foul play,\u201d James Young said.But athletes can plead for reinstatement under special circumstances. That\u2019s what Miller did the next morning, hours before the official awards ceremony. In a confrontation with McGonigal, the Ironman regional director, she argued that losing her chip had been an unfortunate accident that should not disqualify her from the race. He believed her, he said in an interview, because she seemed so sympathetic, and because parts of her story checked out.For one thing, he said, volunteers at aid stations along the course confirmed Miller\u2019s claim that she had mentioned the missing chip to them when she ran by. In addition, when he examined her winning times in two previous races \u2014 Ironman Canada in 2013, and the 2014 long-course world championships in China \u2014 he found them to be consistent with her 2015 finish.\u201cBased on previous results, could this athlete have completed the course in 10 hours 49 minutes?\u201d McGonigal said he asked himself. He concluded that she could.\u201cSo based on all of that, I made the decision to insert her in the results,\u201d he said. That meant she had won her age group and, more important, had qualified for the world championships in Kona.The awards ceremony took place at Whistler\u2019s Olympic Plaza, and three women \u2014 Susanne Davis, Claire Young and Marla Zucht \u2014 arrived believing that they had taken the first three spots in their division. No one had told them that Miller had successfully argued her way back into first place.The winners were announced, in reverse order. \u201cFifth place, fourth place,\u201d James Young recalled, \u201cand then they say, \u2018Third place, Claire Young; second place, Susanne Davis; first place ... Julie Miller.\u2019\u00a0\u201dPuzzled, Young, Davis, and Zucht accepted their awards. \u201cJulie didn\u2019t say anything or shake anyone\u2019s hand \u2014 she literally ran off the stage,\u201d James Young said. That\u2019s when Davis confronted her. \u201cSusanne grabbed her shoulder and said: \u2018Where did you pass me? I was looking for everyone in the age group and I would have seen you.\u2019\u201cFor a triathlete to say that to another triathlete is a very serious thing,\u201d he continued, \u201cand it\u2019s what made me think that there\u2019s more to this than meets the eye.\u201dExamining PhotographsIndeed, few people who had been paying close attention seemed to think that Miller had legitimately won the race the day before. As they replayed the race in their minds, they found things that did not add up. Some spectators and volunteers said in interviews, for instance, they had seen Miller running slowly, outpaced by speedier runners, near the start of the marathon, and wondered how she could have made up for all that lost time.The marathon course covers varied terrain \u2014 woods, a beach, a residential neighborhood \u2014 and comprises two distinct parts: a loop and then an out-and-back section in which athletes retrace their steps. Each athlete runs the whole thing twice. Some spectators who said they were specifically looking for Squamish athletes to cheer on said that in places where they would have expected to see Miller several times, they had seen her just once.A few days later, people connected to the race began receiving emails from an anonymous sender identified as \u201cHonest Athlete.\u201d The messages cast doubt on Miller\u2019s performance and cited evidence that seemed to suggest something was awry. Other athletes, including James Young, began to investigate further, digging deep into the record.Among other things, Young studied the images taken by cameras positioned along the course and posted on race websites. They proved to be invaluable, because they showed where various athletes were in relation to one another at particular times in the race.He found startling anomalies.One series of photographs Young found had been taken at a timing mat that athletes crossed on the first lap of the marathon, about the 1.4-mile mark, and again on the second lap, at the 13.8-mile mark.The photos showed that Miller and four other athletes, all men, had reached the spot about the same time, between 8:43:33 and 8:44:07 into the race.Timing chip records show that two of the men were on the first lap of the marathon and the other two were already running their second lap, having completed the swim and the bike portions much more quickly and started the marathon sooner. But what about Miller? Was she crossing that point in the marathon course for the first or second time? In other words, was she 1.4 miles or 13.8 miles into the course?Miller\u2019s last official time, recorded when she was still wearing her timing chip, showed that she finished the bike portion 7:17:50 into the race. Allowing her additional time to change into her running gear, Miller, then, had reached the spot where the photos were taken about 1 hour 27 minutes into her run. If she had run 1.4 miles in that time, it would have been at an absurdly slow pace, slower than a casual stroll. If she had run 13.8 miles, it would have been at a prohibitively swift pace, faster even than most professional men. (The overall race winner, Viktor Zyemtsev, ran the same distance in 1:30:13, the fastest recorded run split that day.)\u201cIt\u2019s a ridiculous, beyond-male-professional, world-class, winning-the-world-championship pace,\u201d James Young said.Suspicious RecollectionsIn interviews, competitors and volunteers said that as they looked back on other races, they recalled things that had made them suspicious of Miller\u2019s performances. But they had never said anything, they explained, because they had not wanted to make such a grave accusation against a fellow athlete.An aid-station volunteer from Squamish who was cheering on local athletes in the 2013 Ironman Canada race, for instance, said that based on her position and the number of times she saw Miller, it looked as if Miller had failed to complete all the laps. She thought she might be mistaken. But it happened again in 2015 \u2014 she saw Miller just once, when she would have expected to see her twice.\u201cI thought, twice in a row?\u201d the volunteer said. She submitted a report to Ironman officials.Back in Squamish, Sheena Harris, who had raced against Miller before and had occasionally been with her in groups that trained together, was also having serious doubts.Miller had beaten Harris in the Ironman in 2013 under what at the time seemed dubious circumstances. Miller had apparently started one of the out-and-back sections of the course ahead of Harris, but Harris, who knew she was gaining on Miller because of what spectators told her, had not seen her anywhere.\u201cIt was just a feeling; I had no proof,\u201d Harris said. \u201c\u2018I went to my coach and she said, \u2018Sheena, zip it.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAs a spectator in the 2015 race, Harris had looked out for Miller and other Squamish athletes, and she, too, suspected that Miller had not completed all the laps. She saw the other runners when she would have expected to see them, but she did not see Miller. \u201cNothing added up,\u201d she said.Angry that Miller\u2019s win had denied another athlete a spot at the world championships in Kona, Harris was one of the athletes who contacted race officials and told them of their suspicions.\u201cI wanted to know how they could give someone a first spot in Kona who should have been disqualified,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about fairness in the sport, and there was no way for me to say nothing. I knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that she had cheated.\u201dAngry EmailsIronman officials say they were not aware of the other athletes\u2019 concerns until early August, when McGonigal, the Ironman official, received a flurry of angry emails \u2014 some anonymous and some not \u2014 urging him to reconsider the results.\u201cI\u2019ve gone through similar procedures in dozens of races in the last six or seven years,\u201d McGonigal said, referring to situations in which athletes protested their disqualifications. \u201cBut I\u2019ve never seen anything like what we\u2019re dealing with here.\u201dThe photographic evidence of Miller\u2019s times and positions along the course troubled him. But what he found even more damning, in a way, was the question of what had become of Miller\u2019s timing chip. Photographs showed, he said, that when she set out on her run, she was still wearing the Velcro strap \u2014 only without the chip attached to it.\u201cThat\u2019s what gave me pause,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause in all my history, I\u2019ve heard of timing straps falling off, but I\u2019ve never seen a chip come off a strap while the strap stays on.\u201dHe decided to test for himself. \u201cI tried to personally manipulate multiple timing straps to see what it would take to get a chip to fall off accidentally,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not an accidental act. To get a chip to come off the strap, you\u2019re literally having to pull the chip off. It\u2019s a physical act that requires some force with both hands.\u201dIn various statements to news organizations, Miller has said she has no idea what happened to the chip.\u201cI wish I knew what happened to my timing chip during the Ironman event so there would be a reliable record of my race activity,\u201d she told The Vancouver Sun in November.Disqualifying an athlete is not done lightly, Ironman officials said, and they said they had given Miller ample opportunity to defend herself.\u201cEven then, we gave her the benefit of the doubt,\u201d McGonigal said. \u201cWe said, if you can explain yourself, if you can prove that you completed the entire course, we\u2019ll go about our merry way and keep the results and you can race in the world championships.\u201dThe head referee for Ironman, Jimmy Riccitello, sent Miller an email on Aug. 10 formally notifying her that she was facing disqualification. He also spoke to her by telephone, he said, to tell her \u201cthat our data indicated that she didn\u2019t complete the entire course.\u201dFrom photographs, Riccitello saw that in previous races, Miller had apparently often worn a Garmin GPS sports watch, which could have provided data to back up her story. \u201cI asked her for proof \u2014 GPS evidence, or anything,\u201d Riccitello said. \u201cBut she said she didn\u2019t have the GPS data.\u201dMiller asked Ironman officials for more time to gather evidence, Riccitello said, and she was given 96 hours. But she never produced anything beyond asserting that she had not cheated. She was disqualified for good. She was also disqualified from two previous races: Ironman Canada 2013, which officials said she had not completed (and where she said she also lost her chip), and the 2014 Vancouver Triathlon.In the 2014 race, an analysis of her performance showed widely divergent times on the four loops of the bike course, suggesting that she had completed some segments of the course in virtually impossible times \u2014 faster than the fastest male professionals in the race, officials said.Ironman barred Miller indefinitely from its races, citing repeated rule violations \u2014 the harshest penalty given to a competitor in memory. (In recent years, two other athletes have been given two-year suspensions for cutting courses, officials said.) In November, Triathlon Canada announced that Miller would be barred from its races, too, for two years, for \u201cmultiple breaches\u201d of its rules. It also barred her from competing for Team Canada outside the country, and stripped her of an award she had previously won, the Triathlon Canada Award of Excellence.Meanwhile, the International Triathlon Union opened an investigation into the gold medal Miller won in Weihai, China, in 2014.In Squamish, Miller\u2019s coach, Bjoern Ossenbrink, dropped her as a client, saying that perhaps he had been remiss in relying on her word \u2014 and not on independent data \u2014 to monitor her times during training sessions.\u201cI don\u2019t know what it takes for a person to do something like this,\u201d he said on the Slowtwitch forum, in a statement that was later taken down. \u201cI\u2019m not out there to question every race result athletes produce.\u201dPublicity about the case resonated in Squamish, too, and not just among triathletes. Cyclists remembered that Miller had won her age group in 2014 and 2015 in the Test of Metal, a 41.6-mile mountain bike race through steep terrain. In 2015, Miller completed the course in 3:20:33 \u2014 a surprise to some of the men who trained with her, and to some of the competitors who turned in similar times to hers but said they had not seen her along parts of the course.\u201cShe\u2019s fairly strong but not able to handle complex terrain,\u201d said Dwayne Kress, a member of the training group that rides together weekly. \u201cWhen I saw the results from Julie Miller, they did not match up with her performances on the group rides. There was no consistency there.\u201dCyclists do not wear timing chips in the Test of Metal; they affix numbers to the front of their bikes. Miller\u2019s somehow became detached from her bike in the 2015 race, the only such incident among more than 800 competitors.Cliff Miller, the founder and chief executive of Test of Metal, said that multiple questions had been raised about Miller\u2019s performance, but that she had not been disqualified.\u201cIt\u2019s entirely volunteer-run, and we don\u2019t have a sophisticated timing system or photographers along the course,\u201d Cliff Miller said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any way to even attempt to go back and ascertain whether or not she cheated.\u201dMaintaining InnocenceMiller has continued to stick to her position, even when confronted with the evidence to the contrary: the analyses of her performances, the official disqualifications, the sanctions.After Triathlon Canada suspended her, she accused the group of relying on \u201canecdotal and inaccurate information\u201d and said she had not been given enough time to present evidence of her innocence.Tim Wilson, the group\u2019s chief executive, said that Miller had failed to respond when given the chance to appeal her suspension. \u201cShe chose not to,\u201d he said.\u201cAfter achieving a goal I had set for myself years ago, for reasons I will never know, a hateful and false rumor was started by another woman that dampened my celebration,\u201d Miller said on Facebook. \u201cUltimately, I and others close to me know my integrity, and that is what matters to me.\u201dThe post was eventually taken down, and Miller closed her Facebook account, reopening a new one under another name.In several email exchanges, on the telephone, and in a brief conversation at the front door of her house in Squamish, Miller declined to be interviewed for this article, saying that she would derive no benefit from trying to explain how she completed the races in the times she claimed. Her critics would find a way to rebut her story no matter what, she said. At one point she promised to provide evidence that she had completed one of the suspect races, but she never followed through with the complete information.In every exchange, she portrayed herself as an innocent victim who had just wanted to train and compete.\u201cI do know for certain in my heart \u2014 and people who know me know this, too \u2014 that I would never, ever knowingly do anything to disrespect or disparage my fellow competitors, the race organizers and volunteers, myself, my friends or \u2014 most importantly to me \u2014 my children, husband and family,\u201d she said in a written statement she provided for publication. \u201cWe are moving on with our lives, I continue to train and compete and I wish everyone the joy that family and sport bring to me.\u201dMiller\u2019s aggressive defense and her failure to provide a full account have left many athletes in the triathlon community angry and frustrated. They compare the situation to the Lance Armstrong case, when Armstrong denied doping, fighting belligerently against his accusers, even when it was clear he was guilty.People who believe Miller cheated have their theories about how she did it, and most include missing at least one section, if not an entire lap, of the two-lap marathon in the 2013 and 2015 Ironman races. But without an explanation from Miller \u2014 either evidence of how she completed the courses fairly, or an admission of guilt and perhaps even an apology \u2014 they will never have a definitive answer.\u201cI\u2019d really like to hear how she did it,\u201d Sheena Harris said. \u201cI\u2019d read that story.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misspelled the given name of the fifth-place finisher of the 2015 Ironman Canada. She is Deirdre Hassett, not Dierdre.Advertisement"}

I asked three of these professionals to describe their work and share their unique perspective on what students need in order to succeed.\u00e2\u0080\u009cToday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s school counselors have master\u2019s degrees. We use evidence-based practices and maintain data to ensure accountability; we work with teachers, parents and other community members to support our students,\u00e2\u0080\u009d wrote Ms. Fagell.School counselors manage many roles, but the one role they do not own is that of disciplinarian. Students need to be able to confide in counselors without worry that they will be punished, Ms. Fagell explained. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe divide between administration and counseling is incredibly important to understand and maintain if students are going to trust us to act in their best interests.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThose best interests, Brian Turcotte, a social worker and school counselor in Barrington, Ill., wrote in an email, are not always the same as the goals parents have for their children. When I asked Mr. Turcotte for his best school counselor advice to parents, he wrote,We cannot make our kids live the life we wish we had lived. Parents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 aspirations and dreams for their children may not be the aspirations or dreams children have for themselves. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fine to try to encourage or inspire children to consider a future beyond what they see for themselves, but ultimately, every person needs to be in charge of his or her own life.Ms. Wickham Hurst said she left classroom teaching to become a school counselor because she felt she had an opportunity to multiply her influence for her students. She is black and said she thought she had particular impact among minority students. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOften, when a kid arrives in my office sad or angry about how he is being treated, my job is to give him back his humanity. I tell him that what he is feeling is normal,\u201d and that he may be being treated differently than his white classmates. \u201cI listen, help him manage his emotions and teach him how to move through the world we live in today, even when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not fair.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have to forgive children when they get in trouble,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe most powerful relationships I have with kids develop when I forgive them, and validate their feelings. Kids need the respect and the space to be human.\u00e2\u0080\u009dFinally, Ms. Fagell emphasized the role school counselors play in teaching \u00e2\u0080\u009csoft skills,\u00e2\u0080\u009d like negotiation, compromise and planning. \u201cSchool counselors care deeply about educating children to be whole, happy people with the social-emotional skills needed to navigate life. It\u2019s not enough to be good at math or history. Students need to be problem solvers and innovators. They need to be able to work in teams, to manage change, to take risks and to lead.\u201dChildren learn these skills best when teachers, counselors and parents work cooperatively. Ms. Fagell concluded her email to me with this very sentiment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen parents openly share their child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stories and struggles, counselors can be effective advocates, helping build teachers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 empathy and desire to engage in problem solving with the student and her family.\u00e2\u0080\u009dSchool counselors may be overburdened and misunderstood, but for most, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nowhere else they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d rather be.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThese are my people, my tribe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Wickham Hurst said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI get to work in the magic that is middle school.\u00e2\u0080\u009dRelated:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "Racially Charged Joke by Hillary Clinton and Bill de Blasio Leaves Some Cringing", "Date": "2016-04-11", "News": "A racially charged joke between Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York and Hillary Clinton at the Inner Circle dinner caused a storm of controversy.It happened on Saturday night when Mrs. Clinton made a surprise visit to the Inner Circle dinner, an annual black-tie event that brings together the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s press corps, lobbyists and lawmakers. She strode onstage with Mr. de Blasio and Leslie Odom Jr., the actor who plays Aaron Burr in the hit musical \u00e2\u0080\u009cHamilton.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cThanks for the endorsement, Bill,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Clinton said to Mr. de Blasio, a former aide to Mrs. Clinton when she was a senator from New York who nonetheless dallied in supporting her. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTook you long enough.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cSorry, Hillary,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. de Blasio said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was running on C.P. time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a reference to the stereotype \u00e2\u0080\u009cColored People Time,\u201d which drew some cringes from the audience.Mr. Odom, who is black and appeared to be in on the joke, interrupted: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not \u2014 I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like jokes like that, Bill.\u201dMrs. Clinton jumped in.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cCautious politician time. I\u2019ve been there,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. The joke quickly made its way around social media as both Mrs. Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders work to woo black voters ahead of the April 19 primary in New York. Both Mr. de Blasio and Mrs. Clinton have a reputation for running late, but the expression struck some as inappropriate.Speaking on CNN on Monday evening, Mr. de Blasio said that the exchange was part of a scripted event and that all parties were in on the joke, with  \u201ccautious politician\u201d being the intended punchline.\u201cI think people are missing the point here,\u201d he said.Mrs. Clinton has overwhelmingly won the support of black voters and will be counting on them again next week in New York.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Google\u2019s Calendar Now Finds Spare Time and Fills It Up", "Date": "2016-04-13", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Online technology\u2019s urgent emails, calendar updates and videoconferences may propel business, but the system at times seems to suck energy from our personal lives.The answer, according to Google, is more technology.On Wednesday, the company is introducing new features to its popular calendar that will enable people to program in their aspirations for times when they don\u2019t have work or meetings scheduled.Google\u2019s algorithms will then seek appropriate gaps in a schedule in which stuff like exercise or discussing life with one\u2019s spouse might be appropriate. While this means putting more of ourselves inside the machine, Google argues that its method is more efficient.The product, called Goals, works like this: Inside the online calendar, people choose from a menu of goals like \u201cexercise,\u201d \u201cme time\u201d or \u201cskill building.\u201d The software then asks for some specifics, like how often a person wants to run, for what duration and typically when in the day.It then scours the white spaces in a calendar for possible times and maps out a schedule, filling those times with the desired aspiration. Afterward, the goal can be marked completed or not, which helps the algorithm work out a better schedule over time.Along with Goals, Google is introducing a calendar feature that enables two people in the same company to find mutually convenient meeting times, by enabling a software \u201cagent\u201d to scour both datebooks and pick an optimal time.Not coincidentally, Google\u2019s calendar features are something of a riposte to competitors like Apple, Microsoft and Facebook, which have been getting into the life management business.Presumably, friends\u2019 encouragement programs people to stay with a goal. Artificial intelligence, or A.I., software that behaves socially aims to do the same.Sherry Turkle, who studies the social effects of technology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the Google calendar software appeared to be a promising alternative to the more seemingly \u201chuman\u201d software agents, which she worries can diminish authentic human interactions.\u201cToo often we\u2019re cheap dates that fall for programs that pretend to know us, or ask about our emotional states,\u201d Ms. Turkle said. \u201cThis is harnessing the calendar to make an aspiration real. Of all the applications of a computer dialogue that have been thrown at me lately, this seems good.\u201dMr. Ariely is a professor of psychology and behavioral economics at Duke University and the author of \u201cPredictably Irrational,\u201d a book about why people do things like overpaying and procrastinating. Last year Google bought Timeful, a scheduling company where he worked.Google, which is increasingly trying to move from Internet search and advertising company to a more general provider of A.I.-type software, says its technology already sorts email into high- and low-priority items and weeds out the junk. Unfortunately, this appears to have freed up time to send more work email.\u201cEmail shows up and says, \u2018Answer me!\u2019\u201d Mr. Ariely said. \u201cUnfortunately, time for thinking does not do that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rudolph Giuliani to Vote for, but Not Endorse, Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-04-07", "News": "In an interview, Mr. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York who has been uncharacteristically quiet in the last week about the Republican primary, said that he was planning to vote for Mr. Trump in the state\u2019s primary on April 19, over Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio. \u201cHe\u2019s my friend, and I think of the candidates, of the choices that I have, he\u2019s the best choice for president,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said. \u201cHe\u2019s a better choice than Cruz and a more realistic choice than Kasich.\u201d Mr. Giuliani, who will be a delegate from Manhattan at the Republican National Convention, said he would have more sway on the floor as someone who had not endorsed anyone.  But he spoke out as speculation swirled about why he had been absent in the lead-up to the primary in his home state. Mr. Giuliani said he had been traveling, but that on several \u2014 not all \u2014 areas of policy, he agreed with Mr. Trump. He acknowledged that he did not care for Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter post about Mr. Cruz\u2019s wife, Heidi, which featured an unflattering picture of her. \u201cI didn\u2019t like that,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said. He also said he did not like the use of a photo of Mr. Trump\u2019s wife, Melania, by a \u201csuper PAC\u201d that is working to defeat him. \u201cHe\u2019s a first-time candidate \u2014 you\u2019re going to have some of these mistakes,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said. \u201cThe man that I know is not the man you see on television. He\u2019s a gentleman, he\u2019s a good father.\u201d He added that there was never a plan to meet with Mr. Cruz, despite a report that such a sit-down was in the offing. Mr. Trump, who had hoped for weeks for a formal endorsement from his friend of three decades, called Mr. Giuliani after his interview with The Times. The former mayor explained his logic in why he was not making a formal endorsement, according to a person briefed on the call, who was not authorized to speak publicly about it. In the Times interview, Mr. Giuliani said that he doesn\u2019t agree with either Mr. Trump or Mr. Cruz on mass deportations, and said he has his own plan for immigration reform that he has carried around in his briefcase for several years. But he said he agreed with Mr. Trump in other areas, and compared it to the situation with President Ronald Reagan, under whom he served at the Justice Department. He agreed with Mr. Reagan the majority of the time, but not all of it, Mr. Giuliani said.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Public Editor No. 5 Is Yesterday\u2019s News", "Date": "2016-04-16", "News": "Supported byThe Public Editor\u201cFASTEN your seatbelts,\u201d goes the line from \u201cAll About Eve,\u201d accompanied by a flash of those famous Bette Davis eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a bumpy night.\u201dFirst, some background: During my tenure, journalism at The Times, and everywhere, continued to change radically. The corporate way to describe it is to say the business is being \u201creinvented.\u201d Down in the trenches, it\u2019s seen more plainly: as turmoil, a struggle for survival and for its very soul.When I arrived at The Times in the summer of 2012, the place seemed like a newspaper. Although it was much bigger than The Buffalo News, which I edited for more than a decade, its routines and values seemed familiar. There was a \u201cPage 1\u201d meeting and an emphasis on print deadlines.These days, though, The Times seems like a digital media company that happens to put out a newspaper. Over the past four years, it has been scrambling to find a sustainable business model to support its journalistic ambitions, including a newsroom staff of more than 1,300. It\u2019s trying new things and, as some of them inevitably fail, it\u2019s moving on to try others.The old business model, based on print advertising and print subscriptions, is broken. A new one \u2014 based on digital subscriptions, new advertising forms, and partnerships with other businesses and media platforms \u2014 is in the works. There are hopeful signs, high ambitions and lofty plans, but certainly no guarantee of success.All of this brings complications that have sometimes troubled the readers whose interests I advocated. Lines that were once clearly defined are more likely to be blurred.Other readers found it troubling, too. And I\u2019ve since been able to determine that there was no editorial control ceded \u2014 The Times never allows that \u2014 nor did the play promoters see the article before it ran, another no-no. It still wasn\u2019t the best idea I\u2019ve ever seen. And it\u2019s the kind of unfamiliar practice that raises legitimate questions and requires caution, as does so-called native advertising, where ads look a lot like news.So here are some recommendations, which reflect my hopes for this great news company and are based on what I\u2019ve heard from readers:\u2014 Maintain editorial control. As partnerships, especially with Facebook, the social media behemoth, become nearly impossible to resist, The Times shouldn\u2019t let business-driven approaches determine what readers get to see. In dealing with Facebook and other platforms and potential partners whose businesses revolve around algorithms, it\u2019s critical that the paper makes sure the news that readers see is driven by the judgment of editors concerned about journalism, not business-driven formulas that may only reinforce prejudices. This is one of the big questions for the immediate future, one that must be grappled with.\u2014 Remember that speed kills. As The Times tries to gain as much digital readership as possible, it needs to keep in mind that accuracy and fairness are paramount. That seems obvious, but in the competitive moment of publication, it isn\u2019t always easy to remember. Slow it down a little, for credibility\u2019s sake.\u2014 Keep clickbait at bay. In the push for digital traffic, The Times is now publishing articles it never would have touched before in order to stay a part of a conversation that\u2019s taking place on social media and read on smartphones. That doesn\u2019t make such articles inherently bad, but the trick is to maintain its values here.\u2014 Keep accountability and watchdog journalism front and center. Dean Baquet\u2019s Times is one that emphasizes investigative work. That should always be a top priority, and nothing should be allowed to weaken it.\u2014 Don\u2019t underestimate the importance of line editing and copy editing. As The Times tries to control costs, and trim its work force, this work shouldn\u2019t be allowed to suffer. It may seem invisible, but it matters enormously.\u2014 Remember the mission of standing up for society\u2019s underdogs. The Times can be elitist in some respects \u2014 $10 million apartment, anyone? Cover the rich, yes, but balance that with deep, abiding attention to society\u2019s have-nots.Of course, challenges on these issues tend to arise in the moment, not in theory. A story may be published before it\u2019s ready; a desire for digital traffic may seem more important than some lofty sense of mission.That\u2019s where a strong public editor can be useful, putting a spotlight on tough issues as they arise. The selection of Public Editor No. 6 is well underway. The office will be staffed in the interim by my able assistant, Evan Gershkovich, who will stay in close touch with the Times standards editors, particularly on issues concerning journalistic integrity \u2014 the core concern of the public editor\u2019s job.Readers, I am sure, will help to keep The Times on its toes in the near future and beyond.

{"Headline": "Down to Lunch Founders Pursue Less-Traveled Path to App Success", "Date": "2016-04-20", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Nikil Viswanathan and Joseph Lau have built the hottest new social app in America. Now the young men have to keep it from getting crushed by an anonymous slander campaign, overwhelmed servers and their urge to personally respond to thousands of messages from users.Mr. Viswanathan, a mile-a-minute talker, and Mr. Lau, who is more laid-back, meet one fundamental requirement for success: a stubborn belief that they have a great idea. Mr. Viswanathan worked on five previous services that tried to connect people, three of them with Mr. Lau, but Down to Lunch was the first to catch on.The San Francisco start-up has needed little capital so far, and the founders have turned away dozens of potential investors. However, the men, both Stanford alumni, have not been shy about seeking advice from their array of Silicon Valley connections, including senior tech executives, venture capitalists and other company founders.As thousands of app developers have discovered, attention spans are short, especially among the college and high school students that Down to Lunch is targeting. Dozens of competitors are vying to help people organize spontaneous gatherings, including Hangster, Shortnotice, Down to Hang and a Google app called Who\u2019s Down.And a lot of things can go wrong on the road to becoming the next Snapchat.Down to Lunch\u2019s servers went down last week after hitting limits imposed by their cloud computing provider, forcing the start-up to devise a work-around. A human error derailed sign-ups for six hours on Monday.In addition to typical start-up problems \u2014 lack of sleep, inadequate staffing, technical malfunctions \u2014 Mr. Viswanathan and Mr. Lau have also been battling an anonymous social media campaign claiming that Down to Lunch is used for sex trafficking.The assertions, some describing encounters with suspicious strangers, are dubious. Down to Lunch is designed to allow communications only between people who know each other and have each other\u2019s phone number.Kirsta Melton, who heads the human trafficking division of the Texas attorney general\u2019s office, said that she looked into the app and found no evidence supporting the allegations.\u201cUnless you have random strangers in your address book or someone stole your phone, it\u2019s unlikely that this app could be used for human trafficking,\u201d she said.It\u2019s not clear who is behind the smear campaign, although Mr. Viswanathan and Mr. Lau believe it might be a competitor. They traced the accusations back to several Twitter accounts. Twitter temporarily suspended one account and appears to have blocked offending tweets from others. Apple and Google have also removed app-store reviews that mention the trafficking allegations.But that has not stopped worried users from contacting Mr. Viswanathan or Mr. Lau or simply deleting the app. Mr. Viswanathan said one school administrator even called him about it.Despite the damage the trafficking accusations have caused, there is no question that Down to Lunch has struck a chord with young people. After the app appeared on the University of Notre Dame\u2019s campus, for example, 15 percent of the student body downloaded it within 12 hours, Mr. Viswanathan said.Aakash Malhotra, a freshman at the University of Georgia who downloaded the app last September, said it helped him build friendships on campus. \u201cWe have enough apps on our phone that give us information or entertain us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019d rather have an app to help us connect in person.\u201dUntil February, Mr. Viswanathan and Mr. Lau were the only employees. The six-person company still operates from the loft-style apartment that the founders share in San Francisco\u2019s South of Market neighborhood.Whiteboards cover one wall, laying out the top tasks for the day and week. Mash notes from fans are posted as inspiration. Leaky takeout containers have colonized the kitchen, and Mr. Lau often stashes McDonald\u2019s breakfast burritos in the refrigerator to fuel marathon coding sessions.Mr. Viswanathan, 28, interned at Microsoft, Google and Facebook, where he sat right outside the glass-walled office of Mark Zuckerberg, the co-founder and chief executive, and occasionally played chess with him.Mr. Lau, 26, was an engineering intern at LinkedIn. When the job wound down, LinkedIn\u2019s chairman and co-founder, Reid Hoffman, personally implored him to stay. Mr. Lau declined and later went to Pinterest.While the pair has not been shy about tapping their networks for help, they have eschewed most of the usual marketing tactics for a start-up.And in an industry where an investment from a top venture capitalist confers immediate credibility, \u201cthey\u2019ve been pushing everyone away, even the who\u2019s who of investing,\u201d said Cameron Teitelman, the chief executive of StartX, a nonprofit for Stanford entrepreneurs that has helped the company.Mr. Lau explained, \u201cIf we take time out to raise money, that\u2019s time we\u2019re not working on the product. That\u2019s time that users can\u2019t talk to us. That\u2019s time that we\u2019re not keeping servers up.\u201dThe founders and their small team have instead focused on improving the app. When they have a new version to test, they drive across the Bay Bridge to the University of California, Berkeley, to get feedback from students.They try to respond personally to the thousands of messages they get from users every week. At one point, Mr. Viswanathan was getting so many texts that his iPhone\u2019s messaging app froze. The problem stumped even Apple\u2019s V.I.P. support team, which got involved after Mr. Viswanathan emailed Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, for help.The founders are also wrestling with a question faced by developers everywhere: How hard do you push your users to recruit friends to download your app?Last week, they added a button that allowed people to invite all of their contacts with one click. But many people consider such requests to be spam, and Twitter was already filled with complaints from people who received unwanted Down to Lunch invitations.After a couple of days, the pair decided to disable the mass-invitation feature.Although their lives are stressful, the founders say they are having a blast.\u201cWe know we can build something that improves the lives for every single person on the planet,\u201d Mr. Viswanathan said. \u201cIt sounds kind of crazy, but we\u2019re going to do it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Long Career in Military\u2019s Elite Spirals Into a Killing and a Suicide", "Date": "2016-04-15", "News": "Supported byAfter two decades in the Army Special Forces, several deployments overseas and a stint in the F.B.I., Steven Bellino switched to the Air Force to become an elite pararescue lifesaver trained to jump from planes and save aircrews behind enemy lines. The motto of the rescuers is, \u201cThat others may live.\u201dBut last week, just a few months into training, Sergeant Bellino, facing court-martial for being absent without leave, walked into his squadron\u2019s headquarters at Joint Base San Antonio, in Texas, with two pistols and gunned down his commander, Lt. Col. William Schroeder, according to a Department of Defense spokeswoman, who said the sergeant then killed himself.The killing sent shock waves through the normally quiet base, where comrades gathered this week to memorialize a beloved fallen commander who also had a long and decorated Special Operations career. The deaths left them questioning how the lives of two men who had withstood years of war could end in a placid office on the first floor of a training school.The spiral into violence appears to have begun when Air Force trainers said Sergeant Bellino, 41, failed a critical physical endurance swim test, dashing his hopes of becoming a pararescue specialist and ending his long military career. He soon left his base without permission and was facing punishment and dismissal from the Air Force.\u201cA lot of Special Forces guys, their identity is totally wrapped up in their work,\u201d said a Special Forces soldier who served with Sergeant Bellino. \u201cYou take that away, and they are shattered.\u201dThe soldier and three others who served with him discussed Sergeant Bellino on the condition that they not be identified because the killing is under investigation and they said the military ordered them not to speak about it. The Pentagon did not release routine records of Sergeant Bellino\u2019s service, saying they were not readily available. A number of family members declined to be interviewed.Sergeant Bellino devoted his life to being what friends and colleagues called a warrior. He joined the Army in 1992 after graduating from high school in Parma Heights, Ohio, and was soon selected for the elite Special Forces, according to Daniel Conway, a lawyer who represented him in the court-martial proceedings. As part of his training, he went through grueling combat courses and learned Arabic and Spanish. In 1999, his lawyer said, he deployed on a peacekeeping mission to Kosovo.In 2002, Sergeant Bellino moved to an Army National Guard Special Forces group in Ohio. He stayed in the National Guard until 2015, reaching a rank of sergeant first class. His Special Forces company deployed at least four times during that period \u2014 more than any other unit in the Ohio Army National Guard, according to a 2008 local news report \u2014 going to Iraq, Afghanistan and Kuwait. During those deployments, at least one soldier in his company was killed and teams saw what one Special Forces soldier who served in the company called \u201ca lot of horrible stuff.\u201dSoldiers described Sergeant Bellino as accomplished, intelligent and even-tempered but socially awkward, and said he built his life around his service.Another man who served with Sergeant Bellino and became a close friend said he had little outside the military. \u201cGuys like Steve have been warriors so long, they are almost addicted to being deployed,\u201d said a man who served with Sergeant Bellino and became a close friend. \u201cThey come back to the United States and there is no place for them,\u201d he said. \u201cMy heart hurts for everyone involved.\u201dWhile not deployed, Sergeant Bellino worked overseas as a private security contractor, his lawyer said, doing what were effectively civilian deployments. Soldiers said those deployments were in Iraq. In his free time he studied combat tactics like knife fighting and door breaching, the longtime friend said. He never drank or smoked and was extremely fit.Sergeant Bellino had no children and never married. His only company at home was a single, sprawling house plant, which was all his lifestyle would allow, his friend said, but it had its own room and he lavished it with attention. A Facebook page with Sergeant Bellino\u2019s name, linked to his family members, was bare except for endorsements of a few Ohio restaurants and the author Ayn Rand.A woman who answered the phone at a house belonging to his twin brother, declined to identify herself, but said, \u201cWe\u2019re heartbroken, he was such a loving son and brother and uncle.\u201dIn 2011, Sergeant Bellino became an F.B.I. special agent, which his friend said was a lifelong goal, but Mr. Bellino told his friend he found himself stuck in an office doing paperwork. He resigned after two years, the F.B.I. said. After leaving, he wanted to go back to the Special Forces full time, but could not find a slot, his lawyer said. Instead he went to the Air Force, which brought him in as a technical sergeant \u2014 a rank similar to the one he held in the National Guard.On June 30, he showed up at the 342nd Training Squadron at Lackland Air Force Base on Joint Base San Antonio to start the demanding pararescue program. In August, an Air Force trainer said Sergeant Bellino failed part of a physical endurance test in which he had to swim the length of a pool underwater, according to Mr. Conway, and became angry because he felt he was being treated unfairly and forced out of the program.The Air Force declined to comment, citing the continuing investigation.Facing dismissal, Sergeant Bellino left the base without permission for 10 days, returning to his family in Ohio, his lawyer said. When the sergeant disappeared, Mr. Conway added, the Air Force asked other airmen if he was suicidal.The Air Force called Sergeant Bellino in Ohio and persuaded him to return. When he did, the Air Force charged him with being AWOL. He was scheduled to face court-martial on April 27.The Air Force did a mental health exam in December as part of the court-martial process, and found Sergeant Bellino fit for trial. An Air Force defense lawyer who was initially assigned to him by the military requested a second, independent examination, but the Air Force denied the request, Mr. Conway said. Mr. Conway declined to describe the findings of the exam.A week before the shooting, Sergeant Bellino agreed to an administrative discharge in lieu of court-martial \u2014 a deal military prosecutors commonly strike with AWOL troops.Colonel Schroeder, 39, was himself a decorated Special Operations officer, having served in Iraq and Afghanistan and been awarded a Bronze Star and a number of awards for meritorious service.He oversaw training of all battlefield airmen \u2014 elite troops, including pararescuers, who work on the ground in hostile areas. A former Eagle Scout and avid ultramarathon runner, he was married and had two young sons.When Colonel Schroeder tried to stop the gunman, he was shot in the arms and head. Sergeant Bellino then killed himself, according to a military spokesman.Chief Master Sgt. Matthew Nugent, one of the squadron\u2019s senior enlisted airmen, said in a Facebook post that Colonel Schroeder was killed by a disgruntled sergeant facing a disciplinary hearing.He added: \u201cKnow that Bill went out swinging. He selflessly gave his life to protect our 1Sgt and countless others who were in the building.\u201d\u201cI worked closely with Lt Col Schroeder; and my wife Vanessa and I knew his family,\u201d General Edwards said. \u201cHe was an amazing Airman, father and husband. Our focus at this time is to take care of Lt Col Schroeder\u2019s family who is here in the local area. He leaves behind a wife and two small children \u2014 we will care for and comfort them as best we can. We will also take care of the family members and friends who are grieving the loss of TSgt Bellino.\u201dDavid Montgomery contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "Matthew Connors spent much of 2012 in Lower Manhattan making portraits of the protesters in the Occupy Wall Street movement. But a chance encounter during the course of that project made him do a 180-degree turn after meeting some Egyptian activists who had participated in a different uprising: the Jan. 25 revolution that led to the ousting of President Hosni Mubarak. They convinced Mr. Connors that there was a more important struggle worth covering.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI really just wanted to insert myself into the city and into that current of history and try to understand it from the ground up, as best I could,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Connors said.He traveled to Cairo in early 2013, arriving a few weeks before the second anniversary of the Jan. 25 revolution, when tension and discontent were still palpable despite the recent regime change. Over the next several months, Mr. Connors witnessed continual unrest stirred by the Tamarod protest movement opposing Mr. Mubarak\u00e2\u0080\u0099s successor as president, Mohamed Morsi, who himself was removed from power in July 2013.Mr. Connors said he did not have a calculated strategy going in. So he began making portraits of citizens and revolutionaries, just as he had done in New York\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Zuccotti Park, which proved an effective means of connecting with, and earning the trust of, skeptical Egyptians. As Mr. Connors grew more familiar with Cairo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rhythms, he began visualizing the city as a giant studio for social change. In addition to depicting the human faces of revolution, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFire in Cairo\u00e2\u0080\u009d features scenes and elements directly related to the upheaval, including barricades on the street, layers of spray paint, clouds of tear gas, blazing fires, a collage of laser beams, and other striking images, including a blood-splattered wheel and helicopters that appear to be flying upside down.\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor me the complexity of the situation and my relationship to it invited more of a metaphorical explanation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Connors said.  It wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t his intention to capture the dynamism of events, or even to create newsworthy images. Instead, he sought different ways of rendering the events that were unfolding by finding the visual and atmospheric residue of the continuing resistance. The photographs vary in size, decreasing or increasing depending on which direction the reader pages through the book, with the faces of his portrait subjects becoming increasingly shrouded to reflect the escalating conflict.   \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe ground felt like it was continually shifting between competing forces of the revolution,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Connors said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat largely led to the kind of images, and the kind of book I sought to make. So I wanted the book itself and the format \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the layout, the sequence \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to all echo that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cFire in Cairo\u00e2\u0080\u009d reflects Mr. Connors\u2019s tumultuous, disordered and very subjective experience in Egypt, meant to illustrate his concerns about revolution, and the documentation of a revolution.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat I was hoping to do with my images was generate some sort of emotional identification that could be a key to future political participation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.

{"Headline": "Theranos\u2019s Fate Rests With a Founder Who Answers Only to Herself", "Date": "2016-04-24", "News": "Supported byIt\u2019s all up to Elizabeth Holmes.Just last year, Theranos was a Silicon Valley favorite with a $9 billion valuation. Now, depending on the outcome of the investigations, including the threat of crippling sanctions by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the company could be forced out of business and Ms. Holmes could lose her position as chief executive.The troubles have led to a cascade of questions about what changes Theranos might make to rebuild its reputation and business prospects. Some have even said that Ms. Holmes should step aside.After more than six months of intense questions, though, changes have been limited. And whatever future moves the company makes are up to Ms. Holmes. She \u2014 not the investors, and not even the board \u2014 controls the switches.Ms. Holmes, a 32-year-old Stanford University dropout, owns a majority interest in Theranos, a privately held company she founded in 2003. She is also the company\u2019s chairwoman and chief executive. What she wants done at her company, she can demand.Ms. Holmes declined to be interviewed. But in an extended interview, David Boies, a heavyweight lawyer who is one of three outside directors on the Theranos board, hinted that some management changes may be coming soon.\u201cThe board is right now in the process, and Elizabeth Holmes is in the process, of adding significant talent to the company,\u201d he said.But an adviser to the company, Richard Kovacevich, a former chief executive at Wells Fargo, acknowledged the limited role played by anyone other than Ms. Holmes. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have to answer anything she doesn\u2019t want to,\u201d he said.The situation at Theranos offers a stark reminder of the perils of investing in Silicon Valley, where it is common for founders to control a company, leaving boards with little real power, including over who should be chief executive.The examples are legion, including huge success stories like Google and Facebook. The upside for venture capitalists is that betting on an individual and getting in early can lead to riches. But if trouble brews, it is nearly impossible for a board or anyone but the founder to make any changes \u2014 a risk that, for now at least, investors remain willing to make.\u201cFor every Theranos, there\u2019s a Facebook,\u201d said Bryan Roberts, a partner at Venrock, a leading venture capital firm.Even in a case like Zenefits, where its founder, Parker Conrad, stepped down as chief executive in February after regulatory problems emerged, the decision to resign was ultimately his.Theranos\u2019s board, which in its early years included some of its large investors, was later composed of an array of diplomatic, military and political leaders, including former Secretaries of State George Shultz and Henry Kissinger and former Senator Bill Frist. Last year, the company divided the directors into advisers and an actual governing board, which includes Mr. Boies, whose law firm represents Theranos.While critics have pointed to the board\u2019s lack of industry expertise and the advanced age of some advisers, Mr. Boies defended it as \u201cextraordinarily qualified.\u201dBut legal experts say that while the directors are responsible for representing the interests of all investors, Ms. Holmes does not have to listen. A founder with controlling interest can replace the board, so directors are ultimately left with the choice of being fired or resigning if they strongly disagree with the executive.Supervoting shares, another common practice among start-ups, grant founders like Ms. Holmes even more power.\u201cYou\u2019re practically a paper tiger and have fiduciary responsibility,\u201d said Charles Elson, a corporate governance expert at the University of Delaware.Mr. Boies says Ms. Holmes has the board\u2019s backing. \u201cI think the board has complete confidence in Elizabeth Holmes as a founder of the company, as a scientist and as an administrator,\u201d he said.The board is represented by an independent law firm, Mr. Boies said, which is answering queries from the United States attorney\u2019s office in San Francisco and the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as conducting an independent investigation into whether Theranos made proper disclosures to investors. No formal accusations have been made.While Theranos is privately held, its investors still have protections, said Joseph Grundfest, a law professor at Stanford. \u201cThe federal securities laws have very strict anti-fraud provisions, and they apply to sophisticated investors, not just unsophisticated ones.\u201dBut Mr. Kovacevich, who is also an investor, emphasized that Theranos was not a publicly held company with the same responsibilities and that the shareholders understood this.\u201cNot only is this a private company, but it has also been stated to the world, to the board and stockholders, that she has no intentions of ever going public,\u201d he said of Ms. Holmes. \u201cThe intention, and a strong intention, is that this company is going to be private forever.\u201dThe Medicare investigation is the most pressing threat, and Mr. Boies is largely mum about what Theranos is planning and how the board is reacting. Theranos has been the subject of scathing coverage in The Wall Street Journal, which has relentlessly questioned the reliability and safety of its blood tests, and it is under intense regulatory scrutiny. \u201cThe exact focus of what needs to be done keeps changing,\u201d Mr. Boies said.The lab and its procedures have been overhauled, Mr. Boies said. Ms. Holmes has hired new management to run the lab, and because the people who ran it previously did not report directly to her, he said he hoped the agency would not take punitive action against her. The company\u2019s other lab, in Arizona, which performs more traditional tests, continues to draw customers, he noted.But Theranos still faces extraordinary skepticism about whether its main technology works, especially given its history of secretiveness, and Mr. Boies said Theranos was taking steps to address the doubts. He pointed to plans to finally publish its results in peer-reviewed journals and the addition of some well-respected individuals to its scientific advisory board. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to reveal much more about the proprietary technology than is desirable,\u201d given the risk of companies\u2019 and countries\u2019 copying what Theranos does, Mr. Boies said.The company\u2019s intellectual property is essentially its main asset, and if the technology works, some observers say, the company could remain a viable business. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re beyond salvage, beyond redemption,\u201d said Lakshman Ramamurthy, an industry consultant with extensive regulatory experience.But while he did not rule out a sale, Mr. Boies dismissed the idea of handing Theranos over to the highest bidder. \u201cThis technology is not going to be sold to somebody who wants to just make more profits from it and charge what is charged today,\u201d he said.And, as Mr. Kovacevich emphasized, Ms. Holmes will ultimately determine what happens next. \u201cYou have to ask Ms. Holmes what the steps are,\u201d he said.Katie Benner contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Criticizing Israel, Bernie Sanders Highlights Split Among Jewish Democrats", "Date": "2016-04-15", "News": "Supported byIt was the sort of question \u2014 Does Israel have a right to defend itself as it sees fit? \u2014 that had often caused candidates, especially those with designs on winning a primary in New York, to produce paeans to the strength of the Israeli-American relationship and a stream of pro-Israel orthodoxy.But Senator Bernie Sanders dug in.Mr. Sanders\u2019s comments, in the de facto capital of Jewish American politics, buoyed the liberal and increasingly vocal Democrats who believe that a frank discussion within the party has been muzzled by an older, more conservative Jewish leadership that is suspicious of criticism of Israel.Jeremy Ben-Ami, the president of J Street, a progressive pro-Israel lobbying group whose more critical view of the Israeli government has gained influence on Capitol Hill, said Mr. Sanders\u2019s comments were \u201cvery different from the stale talking points that have dominated those types of discussions before\u201d and contributed to a \u201cmeaningful redefinition of what it means to be pro-Israel.\u201dBut the comments, as measured as they were striking, worried more traditionally pro-Israel Jewish Democrats and Jewish organizations trying desperately to maintain bipartisan support for the Israeli government but watching it slowly being chipped away.\u201cMaybe he feels like he has to bend over backwards because he\u2019s Jewish?\u201d Mr. Engel said, adding, \u201cIt bothers me a great deal.\u201dEven before the debate, unease over Israeli policies within the Democratic Party was rising.At the 2012 Democratic National Convention, delegates lustily booed officials who reinstated in the party platform a recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, at odds with the United States\u2019 official position that the city\u2019s status must be negotiated between Israelis and Palestinians.Protesting Israel\u2019s policies and advocating boycotts to pressure its government are practically electives for liberal college students furious about the growth of Israeli settlements in the West Bank. In Washington, relations between President Obama and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are acrid, and last year more than 50 members of the Democratic caucus boycotted Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s speech to Congress in which he criticized Mr. Obama\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran.Mr. Sanders\u2019s response on Thursday was to a question about his past statement that Israel had used disproportionate force in responding to Hamas\u2019s rocket attacks from Gaza into Israeli towns. One of the moderators, Wolf Blitzer of CNN, asked whether Israel had a right to defend itself.Mr. Sanders said Israel had \u201cevery right in the world to destroy terrorism.\u201d\u201cBut,\u201d he said, \u201cwe had in the Gaza area \u2014 not a very large area \u2014 some 10,000 civilians who were wounded and some 1,500 who were killed.\u201dThe applause and cheers that accompanied Mr. Sanders\u2019s answers \u2014 someone yelled \u201cFree Palestine!\u201d \u2014 might have been the most vocal signs yet of shifts in the Democratic Party.13 PhotosA Pew Research Center poll in 2014 about violence in Gaza found that Americans under 30 were more likely to blame Israel than to blame Hamas, though half blamed both or did not have an opinion.

Starboard was spun off from the financial firm Ramius five years ago. It started off pressuring the Internet company AOL, demanding that it shut its Patch local news arm and sell off its patents. AOL eventually did exactly that, though Starboard did not gain any board seats. It managed in 2014 to oust the entire board of Darden Restaurants using a campaign that involved a 300-page presentation castigating the company for a host of sins, including profligate breadstick distribution. Not all of its campaigns have been that successful though. In 2013, Starboard sought to block the $4.7 billion sale of Smithfield Foods to a Chinese meat processor, but failed to put together a rival offer.

{"Headline": "As Campaigns Seek Delegates, Ordinary Voters Feel Sidelined", "Date": "2016-04-09", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 When it comes to nominating presidential candidates, it turns out the world\u2019s foremost democracy is not so purely democratic.For decades, both major parties have used a somewhat convoluted process for picking their nominees, one that involves ordinary voters in only an indirect way. As Americans flock this year to outsider candidates, the kind most hindered by these rules, they are suddenly waking up to this reality. And their confusion and anger are adding another volatile element to an election being waged over questions of fairness and equality.In Nashville a week ago, supporters of Donald J. Trump accused Republican leaders of trying to stack the state\u2019s delegate slate with people who were anti-Trump. The Trump campaign posted the cellphone number of the state party chairman on Twitter, leading him to be inundated with calls. Several dozen people showed up at the meeting at which delegates were being named, banged on the windows and demanded to be let in.Backers of Senator Bernie Sanders, bewildered at why he keeps winning states but cannot seem to cut into Hillary Clinton\u2019s delegate count because of her overwhelming lead with \u201csuperdelegates,\u201d have used Reddit and Twitter to start an aggressive pressure campaign to flip votes.If supporters of Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders feel stymied by the delegate process, that is because it was designed years ago precisely to make it difficult for candidates like them to become their nominee \u2014 candidates who party leaders believe, rightly or wrongly, could never win in November.Like with any private members-only club \u2014 political parties are not official government entities \u2014 the party leaders exercise considerable control over which candidate gets their endorsement and the attendant privilege of using their political infrastructure, financial support and loyal voter base, without which winning in November is all but impossible.In the earliest days of the republic, members of Congress determined the presidential nominees, cutting ordinary Americans out of the process. The national convention system has evolved over more than a century and a half to gradually decentralize the decision making.Exit polls from the primaries and caucuses show which issues and presidential qualities voters value \u2014 or don\u2019t value.Each of their votes has equal weight to delegates awarded through primaries and caucuses. In New Hampshire, for example, the site of Mr. Sanders\u2019s first big victory, he won about 150,000 votes and 15 traditional delegates. Hillary Clinton won nine traditional delegates. But because six of New Hampshire\u2019s superdelegates are supporting her (the other two are uncommitted), she is effectively tied with Mr. Sanders in the state.Republicans have far fewer superdelegates. But the way the party conducts elections \u2014 a complex, layered system of contests that selects local delegates who in turn select state delegates who then vote for national delegates \u2014 can be difficult for newcomers without sophisticated operations to penetrate, as Mr. Trump is discovering.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to start explaining now,\u201d said Curly Haugland, the Republican national committeeman in North Dakota who has tried to draw attention this year to the important role that delegates play. Mr. Haugland summed up the collective realization of many voters this way: \u201cThese primaries weren\u2019t really worth much \u2014 except maybe to spend a billion dollars.\u201dEven if Mr. Trump wins a state, the delegates who are supposed to vote for him at the national convention might privately support one of his opponents, and if no candidate clinches the nomination after the convention\u2019s first ballot, these delegates are usually freed from the requirement that they represent the preference of the voters back home. The campaign of Senator Ted Cruz of Texas has been working in many states to get his supporters named as delegates, even if they must vote for Mr. Trump on the first ballot.12 PhotosThough some voters are only now discovering that sometimes their choices amount to little more than a Facebook \u201clike,\u201d party leaders today say the rules are nothing new.Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, pointed out that superdelegates have been around \u201csince 1984, the year I graduated high school,\u201d and have never been a decisive factor. Sean Spicer, the chief strategist for the Republican National Committee, said of the rules, \u201cThis is a process that has existed since the 1800s,\u201d even though he acknowledged, \u201cIt is incumbent on us to explain it.\u201dBut the sense of futility is building among supporters of Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders, both of whom have strong appeal with people who already believe that a rigged political system leaves them voiceless and disenfranchised.\u201cIt\u2019s people who are in charge keeping their friends in power,\u201d said Tom Carroll, 32, a union plumber who lives in Bethpage, N.Y., summing up how he viewed the electoral system. Mr. Carroll, who was at Mr. Trump\u2019s rally on Long Island on Wednesday, expressed irritation at a system that does not always abide by the one person, one vote concept. \u201cIn other countries, we pay to fix their election systems and they get their fingers colored with fingerprint ink when they vote,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of everyone voting if the delegates are going to do what they want?\u201dEven if superdelegates did not exist, Mr. Sanders would still trail Mrs. Clinton by more than 200 delegates. And his hopes of catching her in the traditional delegate race are looking increasingly thin with several large states favorable to her yet to vote, including New York and Pennsylvania.His supporters, however, say their votes are effectively being nullified by the superdelegates.\u201cOur presidents, our congressmen, anyone in Washington, should not be decided by anyone but the public,\u201d said Jordan Float, 25, a nursing assistant at a Philadelphia hospital, and a volunteer with the Sanders campaign.Though Mr. Sanders has criticized the \u201crigged political system,\u201d he has been less caustic about the influence of superdelegates, cognizant that he needs to woo them in order to win. (There is also a sense on the Clinton side that the system is not completely fair. Mr. Morillo, the Minnesota superdelegate who supports Mrs. Clinton, said he would withhold his vote if the race came down to party leaders like him.)Some of Mr. Sanders\u2019s fans have followed his lead and dialed down their attacks. The \u201cSuperdelegate Hit List,\u201d which was created not by the campaign but by a supporter of Mr. Sanders, no longer uses the word \u201cHit.\u201d And the arrows behind the donkey\u2019s head are now telephone cords.Anxiety over the process is far more acute on the Republican side of the race because Mr. Trump, who unlike Mr. Sanders is the front-runner in his party\u2019s delegate race, stands a chance of not being the nominee. Right now, he is in danger of falling short of the 50 percent-plus-one delegate threshold the Republican National Committee has set in order to clinch the nomination before the convention, a possibility that has started to sink in only recently inside his campaign and among his supporters.Mr. Trump and his backers have been aggressive in criticizing the process, fanning fears that his delegates will be \u201cstolen\u201d at the convention, as they have put it. One of Mr. Trump\u2019s longtime associates, Roger Stone, has made the rounds on conservative radio to urge people to demonstrate en masse at the national convention in Cleveland in July. \u201cDon\u2019t let the Big Steal go forward without massive protests,\u201d he said the other day on a radio program with Alex Jones, a host who has indulged conspiracy theories about tragedies like the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and the Sandy Hook massacre. Mr. Stone has also threatened to post the hotel room numbers of delegates who switched their votes against Mr. Trump.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.The Trump campaign has hired a new senior adviser to oversee his convention efforts, the veteran Republican strategist Paul Manafort, who has described his duties as an enforcer \u201cto secure and protect Mr. Trump\u2019s nomination.\u201dIn Tennessee, Republican officials are already feeling the Trump campaign\u2019s wrath. When the state Republican Party executive committee met for what should have been a routine task \u2014 appointing 14 of the state\u2019s 58 delegates \u2014 suspicious Trump supporters sprang into action. Two of the delegates, they said, seemed hostile to Mr. Trump based on comments they had made even though they were required to vote for Mr. Trump, at least for the first two ballots at the convention.Then Ryan Haynes\u2019s cellphone started ringing. \u201cIt would ring about every 10 seconds,\u201d said Mr. Haynes, the party chairman. \u201cAnd they weren\u2019t Tennessee calls, they were from all over the country.\u201dHe soon found out why. The Trump Tennessee campaign manager, he said, told him that an order came down from on high to post his number on Twitter. \u201cDonald Trump had asked for my phone number and told them to do that,\u201d Mr. Haynes said. \u201cSo they did.\u201dJon Hurdle contributed reporting from Philadelphia and Nate Schweber from Bethpage, N.Y.Advertisement"}

The complainer\u2019s comments were so suspect that the Times participants, including some newsroom journalists listening in, declined to publish an article on the matter, but instead began to investigate.The call, said Carol Giacomo, an editorial writer, was odd \u201cbecause the more we got into it, the more we had questions.\u201d\u201cThe guy who was supposedly Poroshenko was in the background, and we couldn\u2019t hear him very clearly, and the translator\u2019s voice was dominant,\u201d she said.The translator also quoted the voice identified as Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s as saying he did not want to return the money to his country, in part because he did not want to pay taxes on it.That assertion was so outlandish, said Michael Slackman, international managing editor for The Times, that it helped confirm suspicions about the veracity of their interview.The people on the Ukraine end of the phone call spoke in Russian \u2014 unusual for senior Ukrainian officials. The signature on the letter, it turned out, was identical to a Google image result for Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s signature. The email address for his press officer was a Gmail account. Further, Mr. Poroshenko speaks fluent English and regularly conducts interviews with foreign journalists in that language.When a Times journalist, Andrew E. Kramer, called the press office telephone number provided on the email, the man who answered, who identified himself as Sergei Panfilov, spoke Russian with a pronounced Moscow accent.At first he stuck to his story, that the Ukraine president\u2019s office had contacted The Times. When Mr. Kramer pressed further, Mr. Panfilov \u201cadmitted it was a hoax,\u201d Mr. Kramer said. \u201cHe said that Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s office was upset\u201d with the editorial \u201cand wanted to \u2018discredit\u2019 The New York Times, and had thus hired him to stage the fake interview.\u201dBut the president\u2019s actual press office, which has its own email address and a different phone number, denied having anything to do with the hoax attempt and offered its own theory.\u201cIn our opinion,\u201d a press aide, Yarema Dukh, wrote in an email, \u201cthis bizarre situation is a distasteful attempt to attack both reputation of New York Times and President Poroshenko.\u201d The president\u2019s office presumes, Mr. Dukh wrote, that the pranksters were \u201cconnected to some Russian official bodies and executing their orders.\u201d In a separate post on Facebook, another aide blamed \u201cRussian special services\u201d for the failed hoax.There was no immediate response to a request for comment from the Russian authorities in Moscow late Wednesday night.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ruling Juror Didn\u2019t Lie, Judge Upholds Ex-Officer\u2019s Conviction in Stairwell Shooting", "Date": "2016-04-14", "News": "Supported byAfter a two-day hearing during which the juror, Michael Vargas, was questioned about his antipolice beliefs and whether he had hidden his father\u2019s criminal past in order to be placed on Mr. Liang\u2019s jury, Justice Chun decided that Mr. Vargas had not acted improperly by offering confusing statements about his father and that, at any rate, none of what he said had affected the guilty verdict.After the ruling, the Brooklyn district attorney\u2019s office issued a brief statement saying that it agreed with Justice Chun\u2019s decision. Paul Shechtman, Mr. Liang\u2019s lawyer, declined to comment.In a typical criminal trial, the role of jurors like Mr. Vargas, a 62-year-old retired carpenter, is to stand in judgment of defendants. But at a hearing in this case, which from the start has been anything but typical, Mr. Vargas was himself a kind of defendant.For several hours on Wednesday and Thursday in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, he was grilled by Mr. Shechtman at what amounted to a miniature post-trial trial. This minitrial itself was caused by a newspaper article.In a manner that even Justice Chun called \u201crambling,\u201d Mr. Vargas explained his shifting statements at the hearing by suggesting that he had answered the questions literally: someone in his \u201cfamily\u201d had been arrested, but no \u201cclose relatives\u201d had suffered the same fate. Despite their biological closeness, he went on, he had never been emotionally close to his father, having been raised in a series of church-run orphanages and boys\u2019 homes.It was both remarkable and in keeping with the twisting, turning trial that for two days, there remained the possibility that one of the biggest police shooting cases in recent city history could have been thrown out because of the definition of the word \u201cclose.\u201dThough Justice Chun formally precluded that from happening, Mr. Shechtman did not help his own case by drifting away from the central issue \u2014 whether Mr. Vargas had in fact lied his way onto the panel as a so-called stealth juror \u2014 into a sustained attack on several antipolice messages that the juror had posted onto Facebook. On Thursday, after the ninth or 10th example of these posts, Justice Chun lost his patience.\u201cMr. Shechtman,\u201d he said with obvious irritation, \u201cis it on the basis of the juror\u2019s Facebook posts that you want this court to set aside the verdict? That\u2019s all you have? Move on!\u201dSo Mr. Shechtman did, ceding the floor to Joseph Alexis, an assistant district attorney, who defended Mr. Vargas by noting that he had also posted on Facebook several photographs in support of the police. As for Mr. Vargas\u2019s nuanced descriptions of his father\u2019s criminal history, those were not lies, Mr. Alexis said, but statements that showed \u201cthe complex emotions and complexities of this case.\u201dIn all of the complexity, however, one thing on Thursday was certain. The name Akai Gurley, the victim in the case, was never once mentioned in court.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bernie Sanders Campaign Suspends Jewish Outreach Coordinator for Vulgar Remarks About Netanyahu", "Date": "2016-04-14", "News": "They might have been getting ahead of themselves.On Thursday, Senator Bernie Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign suspended Ms. Zimmerman, 25, after revelations that she had used vulgarities in Facebook posts about Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Hillary Clinton. The suspension, hours before a Democratic presidential debate in Brooklyn, made for an embarrassing misstep for Mr. Sanders, a secular Jew who, despite having lived briefly in Israel and being the most successful candidate of his faith in American history, is being pummeled by Mrs. Clinton among Jewish voters.But the suspension was also an important moment in the small but deeply felt universe of Democratic Jewish politics, which has been torn apart on generational and ideological lines over the acceptable level of criticism of Israel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right-wing government.With Ms. Zimmerman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history of opposition to Israeli policies in the West Bank and Gaza, her hiring drew concerted and ultimately overwhelming pressure from American Jewish leaders. Her suspension showed that when it came to the high stakes and intense scrutiny of presidential politics, the establishment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s view of Ms. Zimmerman and her brethren as dangerous radicals still held sway even with Mr. Sanders, a candidate promising a revolution.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe fact that he acted shows that obviously he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it was acceptable,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Malcolm Hoenlein, the executive vice chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations.A chorus of Jewish figures, including Abe Foxman, the president emeritus of the Anti-Defamation League, had joined Mr. Hoenlein in calling for Ms. Zimmerman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s firing. The final straw was a report on Wednesday in the Washington Free Beacon, which found a Facebook post in which she used a vulgarity and described Mr. Netanyahu as \u00e2\u0080\u009carrogant, deceptive, cynical\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cmanipulative.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She then used more aggressive language and continued that he had \u00e2\u0080\u009csanctioned the murder of over 2,000 people this summer.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMichael Briggs, a spokesman for Mr. Sanders, wrote in an email, \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe has been suspended while we investigate the matter.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAfter Mr. Sanders won the New Hampshire Democratic primary in a landslide, Ms. Zimmerman also wrote triumphantly on Facebook, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe first Jew in history just won a primary, as a proud socialist calling for political revolution.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then she criticized Mrs. Clinton and added a vulgarity.Ms. Zimmerman declined to comment on her suspension, but supporters noted that she wrote the Facebook post about Mr. Netanyahu in March 2015, an emotionally charged time, when Mr. Netanyahu infuriated liberals across the United States by addressing Congress to argue against President Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nuclear deal with Iran.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is the American Jewish community eating its own,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Peter Beinart, a mentor to Ms. Zimmerman and a leading voice in liberal Zionism. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSimone is the best of the best. Most of the other kids have given up on the community. She cares deeply and wants to make it live up to its own stated ideals.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn an interview last year about the shifts in American Jewish politics, Ms. Zimmerman talked about how she had grown up in an active Jewish community and household in Los Angeles, with a grandparent who had fought for Israeli independence. Other relatives were killed in the Holocaust, she said.After receiving training from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel lobbying group, Ms. Zimmerman entered the University of California, Berkeley, she said, with the intention of defending Israel. But she began doubting Israeli policies regarding the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, settlements, and what she viewed as the excessive use of military force.She then became the national president of the student branch of J Street, a pro-Israel lobbying group that is critical of the Netanyahu government. She started a grass-roots movement of thousands of young Jews who sought to stop American Jewish groups from supporting Israeli policies in the occupied territories. She protested in front of the offices of Mr. Hoenlein, among others.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey claim to speak for the American Jewish community,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, adding that \u00e2\u0080\u009cyoung people make the establishment the most worried.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBut apparently the Sanders campaign, despite its popularity among young liberal voters who tend to agree with Ms. Zimmerman on the question of Israel, became worried, too. A significant number of Jewish voters consider Ms. Zimmerman and her allies to be radicals, and the Sanders campaign, already facing a more than 30-point deficit among New York\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Jewish Democrats, according to a new NBC New York/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll, took action.In Thursday night\u00e2\u0080\u0099s debate, though, Mr. Sanders advocated a critical discussion of Israel that, while popular with his young liberal base, was unlikely to please the Jewish establishment figures who had sought to hold a common line on Israel in Democratic politics. Mr. Sanders criticized Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pro-Israel orthodoxy, called the Israeli army\u00e2\u0080\u0099s use of arms against Palestinians \u00e2\u0080\u009cdisproportionate\u00e2\u0080\u009d and argued that \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe have to say that Netanyahu is not right all of the time.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMs. Zimmerman would have approved.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders Spar Over Fossil Fuel Donations", "Date": "2016-04-01", "News": "A day after Mrs. Clinton grew enraged, telling a young climate change activist after a rally in Purchase, N.Y., that she was \u00e2\u0080\u009csick of the Sanders campaign lying\u00e2\u0080\u009d about her accepting political donations from the fossil fuel industry, Mr. Sanders doubled down on the accusation, saying on ABC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood Morning America\u00e2\u0080\u009d on Friday that Mrs. Clinton had \u00e2\u0080\u009ctaken significant money from the fossil fuel industry.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe encounter on Thursday was not the first time Mrs. Clinton has been confronted by activists affiliated with Greenpeace, but it came as the two Democrats fight to win liberal support as the race turns toward New York\u00e2\u0080\u0099s April 19 primary.Polls show that Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s significant lead in New York, her adopted home state, has narrowed in recent weeks, as Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s promise to take on Wall Street and special interests has resonated with liberals in New York City and in economically hard-hit areas upstate.On Friday, she held a round-table discussion at the Institute of Technology at Syracuse Central high school, during which she unveiled a $10 billion proposal to bolster jobs in manufacturing. The event was the beginning of a concerted effort by Mrs. Clinton to win back the voters upstate who twice elected her a New York senator.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe fundamentally believe her work in upstate New York really represents a blueprint or road map for people to follow in looking at what she will do as president in terms of creating good-paying jobs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policy director, Jake Sullivan, told reporters.But the environment, in particular the candidates\u00e2\u0080\u0099 positions on hydraulic fracturing, is also a driving issue for Democratic voters in New York, one that was thrust to the forefront this week.The back and forth began on Thursday when the Greenpeace USA activist asked Mrs. Clinton to pledge to reject fossil fuel contributions. Mrs. Clinton tersely responded, saying: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am so sick \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I am so sick of the Sanders campaign lying about me. I am sick of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009dLater, her campaign addressed the issue.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe simple truth is that this campaign has not taken a dollar from oil and gas industry PACs or corporations,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nick Merrill, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign, said in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe simple fact is that the Sanders campaign is misleading voters with their attacks. The money in question is from individuals who work for these companies.\u00e2\u0080\u009dOn Friday, Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign went a step further, enlisting New York City\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mayor, Bill de Blasio, to defend the former secretary of state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s record on climate change. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAny suggestion that she is in anyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pocket on the issue of climate change, or on any other issue, is flat-out false and inappropriate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. de Blasio said on a conference call with reporters, calling fighting climate change a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccentral force\u00e2\u0080\u009d throughout Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s career.According to the Center for Responsive Politics, of the $157.8 million the Clinton campaign has raised over all, $307,561 has come from individuals who work in the oil and gas industries. The Sanders campaign has raised more than $50,000 from individuals who work in the oil and gas industries.Jeff Weaver, Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign manager, said in a statement that it was \u00e2\u0080\u009cdisappointing\u00e2\u0080\u009d that Mrs. Clinton has accused Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s staff of lying on the issue of fossil fuel industry donations. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFifty-seven lobbyists from the industry have personally given to her campaign and 11 of those lobbyists have bundled more than $1 million to help put her in the White House,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you include money given to super PACs backing Clinton, the fossil fuel industry has given more than $4.5 million in support of Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bid,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Weaver said.Justin Barasky, a spokesman for Priorities USA Action, the \u00e2\u0080\u009csuper PAC\u00e2\u0080\u009d backing Mrs. Clinton, said in an email, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy the Sanders campaign\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own metric they have taken fossil fuel money but instead of attacking other Democrats we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re focused on stopping Donald Trump and Ted Cruz from becoming president.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMrs. Clinton has faced scrutiny for her positions on climate change in the past, and was under intense pressure last summer before she staked out a position against the Keystone XL Pipeline. Pressed on the issue at an event in New Hampshire, Mrs. Clinton said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf it is undecided when I become president, I will answer your question.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn September, Mrs. Clinton said she opposed building the pipeline, which divided two Democratic constituencies, organized labor and environmentalists, and which Mr. Sanders has opposed. Mrs. Clinton called the project \u00e2\u0080\u009ca distraction from the important work we have to do to combat climate change.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Ad Agencies Need Young Talent. Cue the Beanbag Chairs.", "Date": "2016-04-18", "News": "Supported byAt the headquarters of the McCann agency in Manhattan, the battle for the future of the advertising industry is being waged with piped-in electronic music and employee-brewed beer.Young professionals, balancing Apple laptops on their knees, drape themselves over space-age chairs near a cafe that sells fresh juice and subsidized snacks. On one floor, plants cover walls, making the office look like a jungle. Elsewhere is a Ping-Pong table.The young and the creative have been the engine that drove the advertising industry for decades. But those who once flocked to the business with dreams of making the next standout television commercial are no longer drawn to the industry in the same way. Some view advertising as stodgy \u2014 who wants to make a 30-second TV commercial when everyone they know is cutting the cord? \u2014 and some are lured by the riches and prestige of the technology industry.\u201cThe biggest threat \u2014 and one of the biggest things that we talk a lot about \u2014 is not only attracting but retaining young talent because there are so many more options,\u201d said David Droga, the creative chairman and founder of the agency Droga5. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost people to Facebook. We\u2019ve lost people to Google; we\u2019ve lost people to Apple.\u201dTo enhance their appeal, many agencies are trying to make themselves look less like Madison Avenue and more like the start-ups and tech companies that are now dipping into the same talent pool. Cue the employee happy hours, table tennis and free snacks. But the advertising industry faces much deeper issues that cannot be fixed with cosmetic changes.Cool new technologies like virtual reality have imperiled the art of the television commercial, which is still, in many ways, the bread and butter of advertising agencies. The proliferation of online ads has made advertising anathema. And money provides little incentive: Last year, the average salary for entry-level employees at agencies was about $35,500, according to the 4A\u2019s, an industry trade group. About 25 percent of the industry makes less than $50,400 a year.\u201cBeanbags and softball matches and a cool Twitter handle doesn\u2019t make young people want to work at your office,\u201d Mr. Droga said. To attract young people, he added, advertising agencies need to produce exciting work again, which many have stopped doing.Even as many agency executives insist that their companies are still the best place for creative minds to shine, they are finding it more difficult to maintain their ranks. Turnover at advertising agencies is higher than in competitive industries like technology and management consulting, and the gap increased 10 percent in the last year, according to a study from LinkedIn and the 4A\u2019s.A lot is at stake: If agencies cannot recruit and retain top young talent, the craft of traditional advertising \u2014 an important part of culture for better or worse \u2014 could disappear.\u201cWe have to fill the pipeline with young talent,\u201d said Tony Weisman, chief executive in North America for the agency DigitasLBi. If agencies fail to recruit and keep top young employees, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to become archaic.\u201dLosing young talent is a problem other industries face as well. Established news organizations are losing people to relatively new outfits like Vice and BuzzFeed. Investment banks like Goldman Sachs and Bank of America have made sweeping changes to their junior-banker programs in part because ambitious college graduates were turning to Silicon Valley.But while Wall Street can match the pay at places like Google and Facebook, advertising agencies cannot. So instead, they are trying to match some of the perks.The creative agency Deutsch offers free snacks and a barista at its New York office and free lunch at its Los Angeles office, moves that Mike Sheldon, the agency\u2019s chief executive in North America, said were modeled after Google. The agency also provides yoga classes, boot camp workout classes and wine tastings. The agency Ogilvy & Mather has beers on the first Friday of every month. McCann allows employees to brew their own beer that is then named after clients. One, named for the military contractor Lockheed Martin, is called Stealth Stout.Some agencies are also revamping their offices to look more like start-ups, with open seating plans and plush chairs. The agency BBDO has created a separate space in its New York office, called Xlab, where restless minds can experiment with virtual reality and drones. (In a bit of a twist, BBDO also happens to be behind the General Electric campaign aimed at getting young people to work for the company.)To reinforce that advertising is an actual career rather than a consolation prize or a steppingstone to something better, agencies like Ogilvy & Mather, Deutsch, Droga5 and DigitasLBi are also bolstering their training and mentorship programs.The changes are geared toward attracting and retaining people like Allan Holmes, 29, who joined the agency Leo Burnett in Chicago after graduating from the Savannah College of Art and Design in 2011, but now works at Facebook\u2019s Creative Shop, the company\u2019s in-house agency. He said he was attracted to Facebook, which he joined roughly two years ago, because it had the \u201csame sort of energy\u201d as a start-up. And what got him most excited initially, he said, was his personal connection to the company \u2014 he met his girlfriend and best friend on social media. \u201cThe platforms mean everything,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re extremely important.\u201dIn the end, perks may do little to combat the advertising industry\u2019s loss of cachet.\u201cPeople no longer have that innate desire and that instinctive desire to be in our business,\u201d said Jay Haines, a founder of Grace Blue, a search firm that works with the advertising industry.But that does not mean the advertising agencies are going to stop trying.At IPG Mediabrands \u2014 like McCann, a part of Interpublic Group, one of the biggest ad holding companies \u2014 the pop hits were already cranked way up on a recent morning. Young employees waited at a coffee bar for lattes and gluten-free pastries. A sign indicated a beer garden. Another, in blue tiles, spelled out \u201cInitiative.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve gone out of our way to make it really comfortable, really cool,\u201d said Henry Tajer, the agency\u2019s global chief executive, as he considered the scene from a conference room. \u201cIt\u2019s a day club.\u201dThe advertising industry can only hope it is not too late to the party.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cassandra Clare Created a Fantasy Realm and Aims to Maintain Her Rule", "Date": "2016-04-23", "News": "Supported byOne morning in early March, Kyli Ledesma, a 20-year-old barista from San Diego, woke up at 3:30 so she could drive to Los Angeles to secure a copy of Cassandra Clare\u2019s newest book, \u201cLady Midnight,\u201d which would be for sale at Barnes & Noble at the Grove, a high-end mall, when it opened at 9. Yet she was not the first at the door.Nor was Lydia Whitman, 15, who pulled in at 5 a.m., driven from Agoura Hills, Calif., by her mother to earn the 12th place in line.Sales of the book were capped at 400, but the urgency propelling Ms. Ledesma, Ms. Whitman and the rest of Ms. Clare\u2019s fans was that the first 100 purchasers would get a seat that evening at a question-and-answer session with Ms. Clare and the actors from \u201cShadowhunters,\u201d the television show that has been made from her series.She writes fantasy for the young-adult market, which means she\u2019s an alternate-world builder, like J. K. Rowling and Stephenie Meyer, who sets her supernatural plots (Shadowhunters are humans, teenagers mostly, who are descended from angels and fight demons and such) in urban settings like New York City and Los Angeles.Ms. Clare\u2019s characters are tougher and wittier than the lugubrious Bella and Edward of \u201cTwilight\u201d fame, and her female protagonists are smart and sassy. Their appeal, besides the innate tension of teenagers on the verge, is their contemporary milieus and sharp dialogue.\u201cThe books give you wonder in everyday life,\u201d said Katherine Mann, 13, who had an armful of \u201cLady Midnight\u201d copies she had bought for herself and family members. \u201cShe shows you that even if you live in a big city, there can be the possibility of fantasy.\u201dThat evening in Los Angeles, there were fans from Seattle, Argentina and Sweden. One of them, Fanny Thorkildsen Fernandes, taught the crowd how to say \u201cShadowhunters\u201d in Swedish. (It\u2019s skuggjagare.)Sogol Gharaei, 15, said she celebrates the day she began reading \u201cCity of Bones\u201d \u2014 Ms. Clare\u2019s first book, out in 2007 \u2014 each year by baking a cake and drawing a big rune on her arm, she said, \u201cto keep the memory alive.\u201d (Runes are part of the Shadowhunter\u2019s arsenal, and appear mainly on body parts. As Sogol\u2019s were, the arms of many attendees at the Barnes & Noble event were embellished with Sharpie-drawn examples.)The 300 fans who didn\u2019t score a seat at the talk waited patiently until Ms. Clare began signing books at 8 p.m. She would remain there until after midnight, when the last book wore her signature and she headed back to her tour bus to ice her hand and sleep while the bus drove all night to Salt Lake City, where the same scene would play out in a high school auditorium at an event sponsored by an independent bookstore.The place Ms. Clare occupies in publishing \u2014 and the work she does to keep herself there \u2014 is emblematic of the burdens and boons fan culture bestows on so many fantasy authors. Deeply possessive of the characters Ms. Clare has created, the fans can turn on her for plot directions they don\u2019t approve of, or for the ways in which the television show diverges from the books. (Ms. Clare has no role in the TV series.)Ms. Clare\u2019s Internet buffeting is intense and rampant. There are numerous blogs devoted to pillorying her. Some of this emotion has its roots in her own start as a fan fiction author; 16 years ago, she wrote some Harry Potter fan fiction called \u201cThe Draco Trilogy.\u201d There were charges she lifted passages from the published, though out of print, work of a fantasy author named Pamela Dean without proper acknowledgment.Some work, like Ms. Clare\u2019s, is embedded with references, direct quotes and even whole passages drawn from the fantasy canon, like in-jokes for the initiated. Some fans think this is part of the game, but others see it as a violation of the rules.Cassandra Clare is the pen name of Judith Lewis, though most people in her circle, except her parents, call her Cassie. In person, Ms. Clare, 42, is more of a Hermione than a Bella.Ms. Clare is the daughter of academics who spent her first two decades living in Tehran, London, Boston and Los Angeles. She retains the confidence of a precocious only-child who grew up with her nose in a book and largely in the company of adults. (Her mother, Elizabeth Rumelt, said her first words, \u201cI want,\u201d were uttered in Farsi.)On any given day, her hair might be blue or pink, and she\u2019ll be wearing a dress she designed herself from vintage patterns and in Liberty prints because as a plus-size woman she is often challenged to find clothing that matches her sensibility.She took her pen name from \u201ca terrible novel\u201d she wrote in eighth grade called \u201cThe Beautiful Cassandra.\u201d The title was a reference to a story Jane Austen wrote for her older sister, Cassandra. \u201cIn it, Cassandra meets a handsome young man and they fall in love and kiss,\u201d Ms. Clare said. \u201cAnd I was 13 and didn\u2019t know what should happen next, so I killed him.\u201dNearly a decade and a half later, Ms. Clare wrote her first piece of fan fiction. She was 25 and an assistant editor at The Hollywood Reporter, putting together a special section on \u201cThe X-Files\u201d when she discovered the genre and tumbled down its rabbit hole (perhaps unsurprisingly, \u201cThe X-Files\u201d have been catnip to fanfic folks).\u201cI printed it all out, and read it one night at the gym,\u201d she said. \u201cI almost fell off the NordicTrack.\u201d That was when Ms. Clare created her \u201cDraco Trilogy,\u201d which begins with Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy switching identities and unspools toward a battle for Hermione\u2019s affections.(She was also writing as Cassandra Claire; she dropped the \u201cI\u201d when another fan-fiction author signed up all the \u201cCassandra Claire\u201d domain names.)In her book, Dr. Jamison devotes a chapter to the Clare brouhaha as a case study of Internet flaming and conflict. This particular one, she said, keeps getting rechurned. \u201cFan fiction looks like it\u2019s a collaborative community playing by the same rules, but it turns out that it isn\u2019t,\u201d Dr. Jamison said.Ms. Clare would add one more variable: gender.\u201cDo I think the animosity toward me from fandom is about my thinking of fan fiction as illegal art and mashing up quotes from books and movies and plays into the fan fiction I wrote 16 years ago?\u201d she said. \u201cNo. A million people did that and still do. I was nothing different or special except that I went on to be a successful author and public figure. They\u2019ve always been very clear it\u2019s about punishing me for the latter, because it\u2019s seen as being uppity. It\u2019s not an old grudge being held on to. It\u2019s the pattern of how women are treated on the Internet every day.\u201dAs rowdy as the fan fiction arena is, there is just as much passion directed at Ms. Clare\u2019s published work. There were fans who were angry that the television cast was not in the 2013 Shadowhunters movie, and Ms. Clare was vilified for not advocating for them.These emotions have spilled out offline, too. Bookstores have received death threats against her; at a signing for \u201cClockwork Princess,\u201d the final book of her second trilogy, set in Victorian England, a fan smashed a book down on her hand because the fan was enraged, Ms. Clare said, that a character had died.\u201cPeople are deeply uncomfortable with the idea that the characters they love and regard as people, real people, were made up by someone, especially if that someone is a woman,\u201d she said.Ms. Clare described a Twitter comment about one of her characters that read, \u201cIf it were up to you, Alec would be dead.\u201d\u201cI pointed out that it is up to me,\u201d Ms. Clare said. \u201cAnd they seemed shocked to have to confront that fact, as if they couldn\u2019t remember that actually I made up Alec, his reality had trumped mine.\u201dAnd then there are the legal disputes.Young-adult and fantasy authors can earn millions, even if they are not household names like Ms. Rowling or Ms. Meyer.\u201cLady Midnight\u201d is Ms. Clare\u2019s 10th book, and the first in a trilogy for which Simon & Schuster, her longtime publisher, paid her in the high seven figures. There are 36 million Shadowhunter books in print (as compared to Ms. Meyer\u2019s 100 million for her \u201cTwilight\u201d books, and Ms. Rowling\u2019s 450 plus million for her Harry Potter books), published in 35 languages.\u201cLady Midnight,\u201d out since March 8, is already in its second printing, with 600,000 copies, and it has landed at No. 1, as her books tend to do, on the New York Times best-seller list for her category.\u201cWhat you find with urban fantasy authors is the loyalty levels are intensely high compared to just about any other fiction category,\u201d said Peter Hildick-Smith, chief executive of the Codex Group, which analyzes the book industry.According to a survey conducted by Codex last week, Ms. Clare\u2019s peak audience is women ages 18 to 24, among whom she\u2019s as popular as Gwyneth Paltrow and Cameron Diaz. \u201cShe may not be a household name, but her fans are intensely loyal,\u201d Mr. Hildick-Smith said. \u201cIt really determines how consistently you can be a best-seller.\u201dThese high stakes may be why so many young-adult and fantasy authors find themselves ensnared by lawsuits.In February, Ms. Clare was sued for copyright infringement, among other charges, by Sherrilyn Kenyon, an American young-adult author who writes an urban fantasy series about demon killers named Dark-Hunters. Ms. Clare\u2019s lawyer, John R. Cahill, said he expected the suit to be dismissed and issued a statement that read, in part, \u201cThe lawsuit failed to identify a single instance of actual copying or plagiarism by Cassie.\u201dBut the dispute puts Ms. Clare in good company: Ms. Meyer; Rick Riordan, another successful author who drew from Greek mythology when he created his young-adult series; and Ms. Rowling have all been sued for plagiarism, often more than once.\u201cFantasy is a genre of tropes, and I think a lot of people don\u2019t understand that,\u201d Ms. Clare said of the lawsuit. Fantasy is also an enormously profitable publishing space, and franchises can extend indefinitely. Ms. Clare is on her third trilogy, and as John Sellers, the children\u2019s reviews editor at Publishers Weekly pointed out, she has said she already has two more trilogies mapped out.\u201cShe is not limiting herself to geography or even time,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only limit I think is what she\u2019s willing to write. It\u2019s a sprawling world she\u2019s created, and it seems it\u2019s only going to become more so.\u201dOn a recent Thursday, Ms. Clare was briefly at home in Amherst, Mass., on the site of the new house the Shadowhunters books have bought for her and her husband, Joshua Lewis.For the last two years, she and Mr. Lewis have been renovating a mid-19th-century former warehouse set beside a crashing waterfall. They bought it for about $400,000 and have put as much as $2 million into the renovation, Ms. Clare said. \u201cWe took everything apart and put it back together,\u201d she said.It\u2019s now an Arts and Crafts showpiece. Stairs are painted to look like bookshelves; bathroom tiles are printed with quotes from their favorite authors, like J. M. Barrie and Oscar Wilde. Their bed is hand-painted with quotes from Verlaine and Rimbaud, and there\u2019s even a hidden passage. \u201cThat\u2019s for Josh,\u201d Ms. Clare said.The two met online over a decade ago, in a group for would-be children\u2019s book authors, where they bonded over literary arcana. Mr. Lewis, now 37, was at the time working on a Ph.D. in computer science at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst. Ms. Clare was living in Brooklyn, working nights as a freelance copy editor for American Media, which publishes National Enquirer and Star, and writing \u201cCity of Bones\u201d during the day.Mr. Lewis, who also writes fiction and with whom Ms. Clare has collaborated on \u201cThe Shadowhunter\u2019s Codex,\u201d a manual for would-be Shadowhunters, said he knew he\u2019d won Ms. Clare over when he identified a line from \u201cCatch-22\u201d in one of her early emails. Their wedding rings are inscribed with this phrase: \u201cAre we not two volumes of the same book?\u201dThey moved to Amherst in 2009, when Ms. Clare\u2019s third book was published. Around that time, her store events began to change. \u201cMy first book event, my parents showed up, and maybe 10 people,\u201d she said. \u201cFor \u2018City of Glass,\u2019 I went to Toronto for an event and 1,000 people appeared. I thought, my God, did something happen?\u201dCollaborating with a mechanical engineer, the Rosenbaums turned all the modern appliances into fantastical contraptions. A tiny steam engine has been electrified and fashioned to look as if it\u2019s powering the ceiling fan.There\u2019s an iPad in an apothecary scale and the gleaming soda fountain holds a tiny clockwork angel (in homage to the title of one of Ms. Clare\u2019s books) upon which play multicolored LEDs. It\u2019s inscribed with a passage in Latin, \u201cwhich I can\u2019t read because I can\u2019t read Latin,\u201d Mr. Lewis said. \u201cBut it\u2019s from Milton, and it\u2019s something like, \u2018If I can\u2019t reach Heaven, I\u2019ll raise hell.\u2019\u201d\u201cActually, it\u2019s from Virgil,\u201d Ms. Clare said. Mr. Lewis beamed at her.The microwave, a wildly elaborate device, has its own Latin inscription, an appropriate coda, perhaps, for Ms. Clare\u2019s career: \u201cJustice should be served hot.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tech Companies Face Greater Scrutiny for Paying Workers With Stock", "Date": "2016-04-17", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For the last few years, LinkedIn, the professional social networking company, has doled out increasingly large amounts of stock to pay its workers.In 2014, LinkedIn paid employees $319 million in stock, or 14 percent of revenue; in 2015, that rose to $510 million, or 17 percent of revenue. At the time, those figures were largely met with shrugs from Wall Street.Now that attitude may be changing.The Silicon Valley company\u2019s stock-based compensation \u201cprovides additional reason to remain cautious\u201d on LinkedIn, Mark May, an Internet analyst at Citigroup, wrote in a research note.The issue is not limited to LinkedIn. With tech earnings season kicking off on Monday, investors are paying more attention to stock-based compensation at many tech companies.Paying employees with stock is largely unquestioned when times are good, since the move theoretically aligns the interests of the workers with company performance. The practice is technically a corporate expense, but during boom periods, Wall Street typically focuses on a company\u2019s operating results that exclude that expense.Tech companies stand out as some of the most generous givers of shares to employees. While the median number of restricted shares granted at Standard & Poor\u2019s 1500 companies to executives and employees in 2014 equaled 450,198 shares, tech companies granted a median 798,000 shares of restricted stock to workers, according to data from Equilar, a research firm that provides data on executives, boards and compensation.As a result, there has been a \u201cheightened investor focus on the level of stock-based compensation among the Internet companies,\u201d Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a recent note.In an interview, Mr. Mahaney said stock-based compensation could \u201cdistort the quality\u201d of a company\u2019s earnings and \u201cmake them look stronger than they are.\u201dMr. Mahaney has identified Twitter, LinkedIn, Yahoo and Alibaba as among the tech companies that are highly dependent on stock to pay their employees. In a report, he wrote that Twitter\u2019s stock-based compensation over the last two years accounted for 39 percent of the company\u2019s revenue, on average, the highest percentage of any Internet company.LinkedIn, whose share price is down about 48 percent this year, did not respond to requests for comment. Twitter, whose stock is down more than 20 percent this year, also did not respond to a request for comment.Another tech company that Wall Street analysts are examining for its stock-based compensation expenses is Workday, which sells human resources and financial management software. The company is expected to increase its stock compensation about 48 percent in its 2017 fiscal year, which is faster than its revenue is projected to grow, according to Sarah Hindlian, an analyst at Macquarie Group.In an illustration of how stock-based compensation expenses can affect a company\u2019s results, Ms. Hindlian says Workday\u2019s margins are projected to be around negative 25 percent for fiscal year 2017. But when the company\u2019s $370 million in stock-based compensation is excluded from results, its operating margins are much better, coming in around zero.Workday\u2019s heavy reliance on stock-based compensation has been a factor in Ms. Hindlian\u2019s projections for the company\u2019s share price. Last month, she forecast that Workday\u2019s stock would trade at $49, down from its current price of about $77. She has a sell recommendation on the stock.Ms. Hindlian says that while it can be reasonable for companies to pay workers a lot in stock, the practice can become scary when the stock starts to fall. \u201cParticularly with software companies, you run the risk of losing your leading salespeople, engineers and developers when the stock falls, because employees feel like they\u2019re getting a pay cut,\u201d said Ms. Hindlian, who also rang the alarm on LinkedIn\u2019s use of stock-based compensation over a year ago.\u201cSomewhere along the way a management team may feel pressure to increase their share price to avoid loss of employees,\u201d Ms. Hindlian said, \u201cwhich can ultimately mean management goals and shareholder interests become misaligned.\u201dWorkday declined to comment.When companies authorize additional shares to pay employees and management, that also creates \u201cdilution,\u201d or a decrease in how much of the company a shareholder owns when new stock is issued. That effect is starting to push others on Wall Street to lower their price projections for tech company stocks. Mr. May of Citigroup lowered his price targets this month on Google, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, eBay, Yahoo and Twitter to \u201cfully capture the likely ongoing dilution from future share grants as part of employee compensation,\u201d he said.The increased scrutiny of tech companies that rely heavily on stock to pay employees is just one of many places where investors are taking a harder look as markets soften, said John Roe, a managing director at ISS Corporate Solutions, a group that advises shareholders on corporate governance issues.He noted that some shareholders had also submitted proposals asking companies to consider the impact of share buybacks on earnings, to figure out whether executives delivered better earnings by improving performance or by reducing the number of shares outstanding.\u201cYou see a brighter focus on certain practices when there is more volatility and markets are going down,\u201d said Mr. Roe. \u201cThe reliance on equity compensation is one of those things that you might always worry about, but recent events have amplified that concern.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe Tried to Rein In Google. It Backfired.", "Date": "2016-04-18", "News": "Supported byBut a landmark court ruling intended to rein in Google has instead put it at the forefront of Europe\u2019s enforcement of Internet privacy. That has upended conventional wisdom about the company and raised questions about the role of commercial interests in protecting people\u2019s privacy, often with little or no transparency.Google\u2019s total number of privacy-related judgments is double those of most of Europe\u2019s biggest individual national authorities over the same period, even though these public agencies address a wider range of data protection complaints.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.Less than 1 percent of Google\u2019s decisions are appealed to Europe\u2019s privacy authorities, according to the regulators\u2019 statistics, and those authorities said they generally ruled in the company\u2019s favor.But several individuals who sent requests to Google told The New York Times that the lack of detail over how these decisions were made left them frustrated and, in some cases, angry that a company adjudicated on such delicate matters. These people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to publicize their own privacy cases.\u201cIf governments were handling \u2018right to be forgotten,\u2019 they would have to publish data,\u201d said Martin Husovec, a professor at the Tilburg Institute for Law, Technology, and Society in the Netherlands, and a signatory of the open letter to Google. \u201cBut with Google, we can\u2019t see what\u2019s happening behind the company\u2019s closed doors.\u201dAfter Europe\u2019s highest court ruled in May 2014 that people with connections to the Continent could ask search engines like Google and Microsoft\u2019s Bing to remove links about themselves from online search results, the companies were handed the power to decide which of these requests were legitimate. Citing European privacy rules, the European Court of Justice mandated that search engines, and not a public body, should be the first port of call for the decisions. Europe\u2019s top court did not require that companies make their decision-making process open to public scrutiny.People\u2019s privacy requests must relate to online information, like personal circumstances or a past criminal conviction, that is no longer relevant or not in the public interest, definitions that privacy lawyers say are inherently fuzzy.Thus far, that has mostly involved people demanding mundane information like phone numbers or addresses be removed from links to online directories (the largest collective group of sites affected). Individuals have also requested that links to references about themselves on social media, including Facebook, be taken down.All the talk about data privacy can get caught up in political wrangling. But the different approaches have practical consequences for people, too.Though Google would not comment publicly about the review process, two company executives gave some detail on how decisions were made. They spoke to The Times on the condition they not be named.Typically, requests are sent to Google\u2019s legal team. Straightforward rulings, like those that involve a public figure who cannot legally apply for links to be removed, are handled by junior staff members. Tougher decisions are referred to senior lawyers who must weigh an individual\u2019s privacy against the public\u2019s right to information, the company officials said.When Google\u2019s team accepts a request, it informs an individual that the privacy demand has been successful, while also notifying the website that links to certain European search results have been removed. The website cannot appeal the decision. If Google refuses the request, the company must tell an individual that the decision can be appealed, but does not specifically explain why the submission failed.Some European officials remain wary of handing Google the power to make privacy decisions, though they declined to comment publicly on the court-mandated privacy process. But regulators acknowledge that the company\u2019s system \u2014 which has so far dealt with removal requests for 1.4 million links \u2014 has proved surprisingly straightforward. Some officials also remain satisfied that Google makes these initial privacy rulings despite a lack of openness over how decisions are made.\u201cWhen it comes to appeals, we agree with Google most of the time,\u201d said Mathias Moulin, a deputy director at the Commission National de l\u2019Informatique et des Libert\u00e9s, the French privacy authority.This muted official response \u2014 from both European regulators and politicians \u2014 is partly because agencies lack the financial, technical and human resources to handle the substantial influx of \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d requests, according to regulatory officials and legal experts.Still, for privacy campaigners and some regulators, Google\u2019s regulatory track record remains outweighed by Europe\u2019s effectively handing the policing of one of its fundamental rights to a for-profit company.\u201cIs Google the right entity to have such power over these decisions?\u201d said Johannes Caspar, supervisor at the Hamburg data protection authority, the primary regulator in Germany that oversees American tech companies such as Alphabet, the parent company of Google, and Facebook. \u201cWe have to live by European law, and that says Google must decide.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Being an order taker is not the same as being a salesperson. Most of the Apple stores&apos sales staff are little more than mobile cashiers. Apple is taking advantage of the economic mess and enjoying extra profit on the backs of its lowest employees. Apple employees shouldn&apost be paid significantly more than other floor workers at other retail stores just because Apple products are expensive and desirable and bring in a lot of revenue. Until those employees unionize, they&aposll continue to get the smallest crumbs possible. Henry Ford realized many years ago that in order for his company to succeed his workers had to be paid wages high enough in order for them to purchase the products the company produced. Apple is able to do this because Apple can recruit employees from its cult-like user base. They have users who would work for free because of their religious devotion to Apple products. Anyone who doesn&apost take advantage of the tax laws is negligent. If we don&apost like it, simplify the tax code. .These profits are possible because of the infrastructure and society that the US uniquely provides.

And\n                                                        why not - the government&aposs greatest talent is wasting taxpayer dollars. Hopefully, Apple contributes generously to US charities, benefiting Americans in ways the government does not.The fundamental flaw is that all federal corporate tax returns of public corporations should be made public. And those returns should be reconciled with all SEC filings. The interested public has a right\n                                                        to know since only public charters allow the corporate form.I expect better of Apple.

The increases would be breathtaking from a Western perspective.We need to remind these companies that there&aposs marketable value in doing the right things.This article ignores a living standard common to hundreds of millions of workers, and instead solely focuses on Foxconn and the large shadow it casts.I would be willing to pay a premium to know my purchase was going to support more jobs in the US.Apple is kidding itself if it believes it can blame their decision to outsource assembly on the fact the American workers aren&apost \"skilled\" enough. It comes down to cold efficiency.China is simply like the United States and England were during the Industrial Revolution. What I don&apost understand is why these companies assume there is only a market for the lowest priced product and not also one for customers who want to pay more for a product made in the USA.We need a global movement so that long term public well-being is served by business, not destroyed by it.What happens to these Chinese workers if, as some suggest, the world was to shut down the &aposevil empire&apos known as Apple?It&aposs one thing to maximize profits; it&aposs another thing entirely to make so much money at the expense of exploiting workers in China.You can&apost really blame companies like Apple, which have to compete on price and features.

Roosevelt, the Democratic nominee, was up against Thomas E. Dewey, the Republican contender.At the time, Mr. Roosevelt was coming off his third term as president, while Mr. Dewey was the governor of New York \u2014 a post to which he was elected three times.Both men were New Yorkers, and both resided in Dutchess County. Common roots.\u201cHe also had to temper his criticism of the national administration\u2019s conduct of the war, lest he impair home-front morale.\u201dNot an easy position to be in, and, as we well know, Mr. Dewey lost in 1944.Even afterward, the Roosevelt-Dewey relationship remained contentious.When Mr. Dewey restarted his presidential aspirations in 1948, ultimately losing to Harry S. Truman, Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s daughter, Alice, offered a few feisty remarks.Here\u2019s what else is happening:Hump day is just that: a high point in this week\u2019s wet weather.And a slight breeze will slowly eat away at the clouds hovering overhead, revealing clear skies by the evening.On Thursday, it looks like it\u2019s back to drippy days until the weekend.We\u2019re feeling warm and fuzzy about a big win in our city\u2019s animal population.Only Manhattan, Brooklyn and Staten Island have full-service shelters, and they receive roughly 35,000 animals combined each year.That\u2019s not just dogs and cats.Their exact locations and when they would open remain to be seen, but here\u2019s to the city at least starting to get its paws dirty.An earlier version of this article misidentified the father of Alice Roosevelt.

Businesses have led successful fights against laws perceived as discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation in some of the most socially conservative states in the country, including Indiana, Arkansas, South Dakota, Arizona and Georgia, where Gov. Nathan Deal vetoed a similar bill this week. These are all states led by Republican governors.\u201cIn just the last few years, many corporate leaders \u2014 and I mean mainstream American companies and brands \u2014 have really stepped outside the boardroom and into the public square to advocate on behalf of their employees and their customers,\u201d said Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, an advocacy group for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender equality.Mr. Griffin was in North Carolina this week meeting local elected officials and opponents of the bill. On Thursday he and a represenative of the transgender community met with the governor.In contrast to four years ago, this time it\u2019s supporters of the bill who seem to be having trouble persuading business leaders to speak in favor of it. Governor McCrory said he had received a letter from 334 North Carolina businesses supporting the measure.But only 41 were willing to be publicly identified. Most of those seem to be small local businesses, and several of those named \u2014 such as Prayerful Touch Massage and Heaven\u2019s Best Carpet Cleaning \u2014 appear to have overt religious leanings.One of the largest companies said to have signed the letter, the apparel maker Hanes Brands, denied this week that it supported the bill and demanded to be removed from the list. Hanes cited the company\u2019s \u201cstrong anti-discrimination policies and practices that include protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity.\u201dSo far the governor has shown no signs of reversing his position, but the pressure is likely to mount. Moral arguments may fall on deaf ears, but for North Carolina, real money is at stake.The High Point Market Authority, which runs what it bills as the largest furniture show in the world, said it was facing a raft of cancellations for this year\u2019s show, set to open in two weeks.\u201cBased on the reaction in just the last few days, hundreds and perhaps thousands of our customers will not attend market this April,\u201d the authority said. It estimates the overall economic impact of the show, which typically attracts about 75,000 people to High Point, at over $5 billion.Outside North Carolina, the governors of New York, Washington and Vermont issued bans on most official state travel to North Carolina, as did the mayors of San Francisco, Seattle and New York.The National Basketball Association implied it might move the 2017 All-Star Game from Charlotte. The National Collegiate Athletic Association said it was considering the status of basketball tournament games scheduled for North Carolina in 2017 and 2018, and the Disney-owned sports cable network ESPN said it would consider attitudes toward diversity in evaluating whether to hold its X Games competition at the Charlotte Motor Speedway.\u201cMany corporations were always ahead of the curve on L.G.B.T. rights, but companies that were hesitant to speak out have recently gotten much bolder,\u201d said Gary Gates, co-author of \u201cThe Gay and Lesbian Atlas.\u201dHe said last year\u2019s landmark Supreme Court ruling that upheld a right to same-sex marriage signified a sea change. \u201cThe Supreme Court gave corporate America the political cover to speak out.\u201dThe speed of North Carolina\u2019s legislative action caught many opponents of the measure by surprise. But business opposition has grown rapidly, in part, Mr. Griffin said, because the North Carolina bill is \u201cthe worst in the country by far.\u201dIt not only requires people to use bathrooms that correspond to the sex on their birth certificate \u2014 a portion of the bill that focuses on transsexuals \u2014 but it also overturns local laws that already protect people from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.Measures in other states have been cloaked as \u201creligious liberty\u201d bills or as efforts to protect children from transgender predators lurking in public restrooms. (Of the latter, Governor Deal said, \u201cI can find no examples that any of the things this bill seeks to protect us against have ever occurred in Georgia.\u201d)Mr. Gold said he has had a much easier time rallying opposition to the bill than he did four years ago. \u201cMore and more business people are realizing the harm these laws do to young people struggling with their identity,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they realize that they need to hire and retain the smartest person, which means a diverse work force. They can\u2019t just hire straight white Christian men.\u201dMr. Gold, who is gay, said he believed in leading by example. He said he was not boycotting High Point and would keep his company\u2019s headquarters in North Carolina.\u201cI can\u2019t just pick up a factory of 600 highly skilled laborers and move them up north,\u201d he said. \u201cMore important, by staying here we can change hearts and minds. We\u2019re the largest employer in our county. We offer our employees day care, health care. We\u2019re model citizens. Our local high school now has a gay-straight alliance. That\u2019s why we need to be here.\u201dSuch efforts seem to be having an effect on public attitudes in North Carolina, as they have in other parts of the country. According to polling data by the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute, 64 percent of the state\u2019s residents oppose discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Support in North Carolina for gay marriage last year reached 44 percent, according to Public Policy Polling.Which makes Governor McCrory\u2019s swift signing of the bill all the more puzzling. After the reaction in states like Indiana, Arkansas and neighboring Georgia, the business reaction and nationwide opposition can hardly have come as a surprise.Governor McCrory seemed to taunt the N.C.A.A. this week when his office issued a statement saying, \u201cThe governor looks forward to cheering for the U.N.C. Tar Heels in the N.C.A.A. Final Four being played in Houston,\u201d a city where voters defeated an ordinance similar to the one Charlotte approved.The governor\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment, but it released a video in which the governor said, \u201cNorth Carolina has been the target of a vicious, nationwide smear campaign.\u201d\u201cThe irony is, McCrory is a former mayor of Charlotte, who was elected as a pro-business moderate,\u201d said Pope McCorkle, associate professor at the Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University and a former Democratic political consultant. \u201cNow he\u2019s pandering to hard-right elements in the Legislature.\u201dProfessor McCorkle added that Jesse Helms, the North Carolina senator who was a legendary conservative maverick, \u201calways said he didn\u2019t care what the rest of the country thought or did.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s still some of that attitude here,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when this starts hitting the High Point market, or the N.C.A.A. tournament, believe me, people here are going to care.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "F.C.C. Approves Broadband Subsidy for Low-Income Households", "Date": "2016-03-31", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Communications Commission on Thursday approved a $9.25 monthly broadband subsidy to help millions of low-income households connect to the Internet, in a move aimed at bridging the digital divide.The vote ensures that \u201cAmericans can access the dominant communications platform of the day,\u201d said Tom Wheeler, the chairman of the F.C.C.Starting in December, those eligible for programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and tribal and veterans benefits, will be able to apply for the subsidy. The funds can be used for wireless or fixed-wire broadband. The F.C.C. said it would aim to keep the budget of the subsidy program under $2.25 billion, money that is provided through line-item charges on wireless and Internet bills.Among the biggest concerns is how financially disadvantaged families are being strained by their inability to connect to the Internet at home. Seven out of 10 schools assign homework that requires Internet access, for example. Most jobs are posted online, and applications for employment are increasingly becoming online-only.\u201cThis meets the 21st-century needs for those most vulnerable,\u201d said Mignon Clyburn, a Democratic commissioner.The vote over the Lifeline plan was delayed for three hours because of back-and-forth between the two Republican commissioners and the three Democratic commissioners over the program\u2019s details. The Republican commissioners, who ultimately voted against the subsidy, said the F.C.C. needed to put a lower and hard cap on the Lifeline program\u2019s budget. Started in 1985 to bring phone services to low-income families, Lifeline later added subsidies for mobile phone services, but some homes started double-billing the program and the budget for the fund ballooned.\u201cThe commission\u2019s failure to clean up the waste, fraud and abuse in the program puts the entire enterprise in jeopardy,\u201d said Ajit Pai, a Republican F.C.C. commissioner.The F.C.C. plans to appoint a third-party administrator to check for double-billing or other instances of fraud.The agency\u2019s two Republican commissioners also voted against the broadband privacy rules, which have drawn strong protest from cable and telecom firms. But the three Democratic commissioners voted in favor, pushing the rules toward a monthslong period of public comments and consideration.Comcast has protested the agency\u2019s privacy proposal, pointing to several recent regulatory decisions that target Internet service providers. The company said that broadband providers had not harmed consumers by abusing their collection and sharing of data. Comcast also pointed to Google and Facebook as more concerning, saying those Internet companies are unregulated, even as their businesses rely on the collection of consumer data for targeted advertising.\u201cThe unfortunate result of the F.C.C.\u2019s extreme regulatory proposals will be more consumer confusion and less competition, and a bunch of collateral damage to innovation and investment along the way,\u201d said David Cohen, senior executive vice president at Comcast.Consumer advocacy groups cheered the vote for Lifeline.\u201cInexpensive options for access have dwindled, not grown,\u201d said Hannah Sassaman, a director at Media Mobilizing Project. \u201cA broadband subsidy for Lifeline will transform access to this basic human right in American cities, where such access is necessary to apply for even the lowest-wage jobs.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Bright Side to the Financial Stumbles of Digital Media", "Date": "2016-04-23", "News": "Supported byCreative DestructionIt is true that the outlook is not great. But there is a bright side: The shakeout may end up taking all the air out of a little bubble that had inflated in the media world. With less hype, we may get to see which new ways of doing things actually work and which don\u2019t. In fact, everything suggests that news consumers are going to get a product that is much more attuned to how they now find, read and discuss the news.So while Mashable, a website that recently announced cuts, BuzzFeed and others may not yet have found the secret sauce, many of the ingredients are there. Those will now be used, improved and added to new ingredients, in the hope of building news operations that can reach millions of readers with strong journalism while generating reliable profits.This probably isn\u2019t going to happen soon, and the news industry seems likely to continue to shrink over all in the near term, but the future need not be grim for innovative publishers that produce well-reported and engaging stories.The solution for this is not easy or cheap. It requires producing articles that are likely to start conversations on social media but also don\u2019t overpromise and then underdeliver.There are no shortcuts to producing such articles, but skilled social media editors with a nose for good stories that will also excel on Facebook, Twitter, Reddit and other digital hangouts can make a big difference. Many already have.Two years ago, the mobile apps for large newspapers mostly presented readers with simple lists of stories with dull headlines. Now they are far livelier, and play a role in driving readership and subscriptions higher.The pessimistic interpretation is that this shows how advertisers are shunning news websites in favor of social networks, and how publications will have to make painful compromises to gain a sliver of that advertising revenue. Some of that will happen. But in some ways the figure was also helpful. It showed that there is a huge amount of money flowing into the advertising-media complex. And the number should further persuade publications to accept reality and think harder about what they have to do \u2014 or, in some cases, stop doing \u2014 to gain more of that revenue.Being a successful news company in these times also requires something less fun: stringent management of resources. Revenues may take time to grow, so costs will have to be contained even as new things are attempted.New media companies, like any other fresh entrants to a sector, are prone to spending too much or underestimating the costs of expansion. They may make the same mistakes again as they pile deeper into video. Older media companies, because they enjoyed strong and dependable revenue for decades, never really developed a management culture that could nimbly deploy newsroom resources.Understanding exactly what\u2019s happening in the new media world is hampered by the lack of detailed data on how these companies are actually performing. They are private companies that don\u2019t have to report regular financial data. But the public stock market is flashing a signal that should give a little hope.The stock of News Corporation, the company that owns The Wall Street Journal and other newspapers, is trading at a multiple that is a substantially higher valuation \u2014 around 24 times expected earnings \u2014 than that of the wider market, which trades at around 18 times future earnings. (The New York Times Company stock has an above-market valuation, too, but it\u2019s bad form to use one\u2019s own employer as an example of an encouraging trend.) There are reasons not to read too much into the valuations, since they may be a temporary phenomenon that disappears as earnings catch up with investors\u2019 expectations.But investors would not be paying through the nose for older media companies if they did not think they could adapt to the harsh new environment.The public is discussing news like never before. The stock market thinks journalism has a future. Maybe those in the media will, too, someday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rainbow Nooses Cause Uproar on Tennessee Campus", "Date": "2016-04-20", "News": "Supported byAn art student hung six nooses, each a different color of the rainbow, from a tree at a university in Tennessee on Monday as part of a class project, the school said, provoking an uproar among students and staff members who saw them as a symbol of racism and homophobia evocative of the Ku Klux Klan.Passers-by found the colorful nooses hanging in a row \u2014 purple, blue, green, yellow, orange and red \u2014 from a tree branch high above the sidewalk in front of a fine arts building at Austin Peay State University in Clarksville, Tenn., at around 5 p.m. on Monday, the university said.They were quickly removed by campus police, but it was not until Tuesday that the administration said in a statement that the nooses had been part of an art project. The school declined to name the student who put them up.\u201cThis is a lesson for everyone about sensitivity and respect for all people and how inclusive and understanding we need to be as a campus community,\u201d said Alisa White, the university president, in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cWhile we support the freedom of expression on our campus, we also have to keep in mind that there are symbols that have very specific and negative meanings to everyone, especially if context is not provided.\u201dThe university said in a statement on Tuesday that the student did not intend for the project to have anything to do with race or sexuality. It said she had been \u201csincerely concerned about the perception of and reaction to the display\u201d and supported the decision to remove them, as did her professor.Barry Jones, the chairman of the university\u2019s department of art and design, said the student made the nooses for an introductory class on outdoor crochet sculpture. She wanted to do a project \u201cabout cycles of life and death and, in particular, how that relates to the arrival of spring,\u201d he said.She used rainbow colored yarn because it was \u201cbright and spring-like,\u201d Mr. Jones said, and she wove them into nooses, which were covered in crocheted flowers, because she thought it symbolized death.\u201cI understand the outrage completely, and it was obviously a huge mistake by the student to not recognize how a symbol so associated with hate and racism cannot be co-opted to talk about other things,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the end it was a really tone-deaf student.\u201dThe nooses were hung without any explanation that they were an art project and without any statement about their meaning, the university said. That omission deepened the confusion and anguish around their sudden appearance, re-opening longstanding racial wounds and inflaming anxieties about prejudice, exclusion and violence.Students and staff members met on Tuesday in a campus ballroom to discuss the incident. In a statement, the administration said the student\u2019s professor had not been aware of what she was doing, but Mr. Jones described that assertion as \u201cnot 100 percent\u201d accurate. He said the student had proposed the project to her professor and was cautioned against doing it.\u201cThe professor explained that it would be kind of a charged image and the student went ahead anyway,\u201d Mr. Jones said. \u201cThey talked about the noose as a symbol.\u201dChris Sanders, the executive director of the Tennessee Equality Project, an L.G.B.T. rights group, said \u201cit would not surprise\u201d him if the nooses had been meant as a threat to the local L.G.B.T. community. But he said his \u201cprimary concern\u201d was the effect on African-American students and staff members.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that long ago in our country\u2019s history where African-Americans were lynched, so this is a troubling signal of danger and unacceptance whenever it appears,\u201d he said.\u201cSome people forget, and that\u2019s why teaching history, especially the hard parts of history, is so important,\u201d he added. \u201dPeople can unintentionally use these images and not realize all the horror, terrorism and pain they include.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Technology Upgrades Get White House Out of the 20th Century", "Date": "2016-04-03", "News": "Supported byWhite House LetterWASHINGTON \u2014 Can you run the country with spotty Wi-Fi, computers that power on and off randomly and desktop speakerphones from Radio Shack, circa 1985?It turns out you can. But it is not ideal, as President Obama\u2019s staff has discovered during the past seven years. Now, as Mr. Obama prepares to leave the White House early next year, one of his legacies will be the office information technology upgrade that his staff has finally begun.Until very recently, West Wing aides were stuck in a sad and stunning state of technological inferiority: desktop computers from the last decade, black-and-white printers that could not do double-sided copies, aging BlackBerries (no iPhones), weak wireless Internet and desktop phones so old that few staff members knew how to program the speed-dial buttons.\u201cWe can\u2019t do this,\u201d recalled Anita Decker Breckenridge, the deputy chief of staff for operations at the White House, who has since worked with the Air Force to upgrade the president\u2019s plane to broadband speeds. \u201cThis is the Oval Office in the sky. Talk about a network that didn\u2019t work.\u201dPart of the problem? Responsibility for White House technology has long been divvied up between four agencies, each with their own chief information officer: the National Security Council, the Executive Office of the President, the Secret Service and the White House Communications Agency. That led to a series of Band-Aid solutions over the years, as one agency or another has attempted piecemeal upgrades to White House gear.It also led to comical moments. In 2014, when White House aides accompanying Mr. Obama on his summer vacation in Martha\u2019s Vineyard struggled with balky laptops as they tried to revise a presidential statement, they could not get on-the-road tech support from the White House Communications Agency because the agency\u2019s staff members were not authorized to log in to computers issued by the Executive Office of the President.\u201cIt was an interesting challenge and world for me,\u201d Mr. Recordon said.One of his first tasks was trying to map the miles of Ethernet cables and phone wires inside the walls of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. The team of technicians eventually discovered and removed 13,000 pounds of abandoned cables that no longer served any purpose.\u201cThey had been installed over the decades by different organizations using different standards, different techniques, from different eras,\u201d Mr. Recordon said. \u201cThey were finding these pipes that just had bundles of cable that had been cut off over the years, no longer used. So we just started pulling it out.\u201dWith the wiring fixed, Mr. Recordon started replacing computers (the new ones have fast, solid-state drives and modern processors) and color printers. The new phone system \u2014 the first since the Clinton years \u2014 is all digital, with built-in speakerphones and speed-dial buttons that can be changed online. Many White House aides now carry the most recent iPhones. Mr. Obama, however, still carries a specially modified, highly secure BlackBerry.Mr. Recordon\u2019s team also designed a new web-based system for admitting visitors to the West Wing that can be managed securely from any computer, including ones outside the White House complex.To be sure, some important West Wing technology was upgraded by the George W. Bush administration, which overhauled the Situation Room for the first time since the Kennedy administration and added modern communications gear. Joe Hagin, the deputy chief of staff for Mr. Bush, recalled having to replace the phones in the presidential limousine after Mr. Bush complained that he had not been able to make a single phone call from his motorcade over an entire weekend.\u201cHe said to me, \u2018What the heck would happen if there were a true national emergency?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Hagin recalled. That fear came true months later on Sept. 11, 2001, when communications glitches plagued the government and led to new equipment in Air Force One and the first BlackBerries in the White House.Mr. Hagin\u2019s team also upgraded the Intel 486 computers and got rid of the slow and cumbersome Lotus Notes email system. But the speed of technological advancement has once again left the current White House behind.\u201cI\u2019m very sympathetic to them,\u201d said Mr. Hagin, who commiserated with Ms. Breckenridge last year about the sorry state of White House technology.Ms. Breckenridge said the White House has not had to request any additional money for the new upgrades, which have been paid for out of the existing technology budgets for the various agencies involved. In some cases, she said, they have saved money by eliminating duplications. The four agencies no longer negotiate their own contracts with cellphone companies and no longer buy duplicate copies of software licenses.Ms. Breckenridge said she was hopeful that Mr. Obama will leave to his successor\u2019s staff a building that is more useful in the Facebook and Twitter era, or whatever comes next.Mr. Hagin said he wished them well, but predicted it will not be easy. He recalled once discovering a basement room in the West Wing filled with telephone switching gear that technicians said could be replaced with a unit the size of a dorm-room refrigerator. But everyone was nervous about cutting the wires because no schematics or design guides existed anymore, he said.Replacing the equipment took a full two years.Advertisement"}

Garland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nomination to the Supreme Court?Senator Mark S. Kirk, Republican of Illinois, offered a momentary glimpse Wednesday of what a conventional nomination process might look like, distributing a memo to his Republican colleagues that laid out the policy concerns he discussed during his meeting with Judge Garland last week.In the one-page document passed around during a weekly lunch, Mr. Kirk again urged his colleagues to sit down with Judge Garland \u00e2\u0080\u0094 albeit in a less charged way than his call for a \u00e2\u0080\u009crational, adult\u00e2\u0080\u009d approach.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe had a positive conversation, and I encourage you to meet with him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said in the memo.Mr. Kirk, who is in a tough fight for re-election, seized on four of his \u00e2\u0080\u009cpriorities\u00e2\u0080\u009d that he said need the court\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attention: the treatment of detainees; the prosecution of drug gangs; the sex trafficking of children; and the autonomy of state governments from federal control. He did not elaborate on Judge Garland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s responses to his inquiries.What was most striking about the memo was what it lacked \u00e2\u0080\u0094 specifically, any reference to the bitter partisan fight that has led lawmakers like Senator John Boozman, Republican of Arkansas, to defend themselves against charges of betrayal for simply agreeing to sit down with Judge Garland.Instead Mr. Kirk took more of a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t we all just get along?\u00e2\u0080\u009d approach, appealing to more universal concerns, such as whether federal law is being used to shield sex traffickers on websites like BackPage.com.

But a Senate Judiciary Committee announcement earlier Wednesday added one more meeting to Judge Garland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s calendar: He will have breakfast on Tuesday with Senator Charles E.

{"Headline": "Satellite Images Can Pinpoint Poverty Where Surveys Can\u2019t", "Date": "2016-04-01", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewAn explosion of data has already changed how we market products and politicians. Now a similar innovation is beginning to change how we combat poverty around the world.Consider an unlikely problem: finding the poor. Even in a world riddled with poverty, nearly every government, nonprofit and aid agency struggles with this issue. Where in Kigali should the Rwandan health ministry place a new health clinic? Which rural districts in India should receive rice at subsidized prices? All these decisions require not just knowing poverty exists, but pinpointing areas of greatest need.These challenges make new kinds of data \u2014 information that can be gathered indirectly using algorithms and novel sources \u2014 particularly valuable. Google searches and Twitter and Facebook posts, which are very useful in the United States, are unlikely to help us in Kibera or Dhaka, Bangladesh. But the core idea behind these sources of data \u2014 measuring without asking people directly \u2014 can be enormously helpful.Take the case of measuring the most basic of economic variables: gross domestic product. The numbers can be unreliable in countries where the statistical infrastructure is weak, the informal businesses do not want to be tracked and the numbers may be manipulated. Morten Jerven, an economist at Simon Fraser University, argues in his book, \u201cPoor Numbers,\u201d that for many African countries the lack of quality data impedes development.It also shows a vast darkness between them, depicting the grim reality of North Korea, where night lighting is a rare luxury. If North Korea is experiencing an economic miracle, it is a purely daytime affair.There are many other important, unconventional sources of data. Consider cellphones. For most of the world\u2019s poor, each call and text has a very noticeable and real monetary cost.We are beginning to see tangible benefits. For example, GiveDirectly, a nonprofit group that gives cash to the poor, now uses satellite imagery to identify villages where thatched roofs signal that they may need help. \u201cRemote sensing data can be powerful, especially when combined with cheap classification tools like crowdsourcing or machine learning,\u201d says Paul Niehaus, co-founder of the organization. \u201cThey\u2019ve let us strip cost and time out of the process.\u201dSome of these projects are about changing how we use old sources of data. Typically we take surveys to determine which variables are most correlated with poverty, such as having a thatched roof or a dirt floor or not having a toilet. These variables are then added up to form a score that ranks households. Those with the highest rank may be deemed eligible for help, whether it is a microloan, a food subsidy or a cash transfer.But this kind of simple score card does not take advantage of the latest technologies. For example, in the United States, modern credit scoring agencies do not simply add a few variables. They use predictive algorithms to scour data for complex relationships most associated with default, which are then combined into a tailored prediction of credit risk. Why should the financial services industry, where mere dollars are at stake, be using more advanced technologies than the aid industry, where human life is at stake?A winning World Bank Innovation Challenge project, with which I collaborated, aims to close this gap. Melissa Adelman, an economist at the World Bank and one of the lead researchers in our project, says: \u201cExisting surveys may contain much more information for poverty measurement than is actually used. We\u2019re exploring how many more of the poor could be identified and targeted for services by using machine-learning tools. It\u2019s exciting because those better algorithms are essentially free to use, so the benefit-to-cost ratio of any gain in targeting will be very large.\u201dAll of these efforts improve efficiency. It doesn\u2019t sound very romantic: Costs go down and accuracy goes up. Typically, efficiency gains like these excite only technocrats. But when these improvements truly help the neediest, all of us should be excited.SENDHIL MULLAINATHAN is the Robert C. Waggoner Professor of Economics at Harvard.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Common Application Saturates the College Admissions Market, Critics Say", "Date": "2016-04-11", "News": "Supported byAs the news rippled across the web last week that a Long Island student had won admission to all eight Ivy League universities, thousands of people reacted with messages of praise.The crux of Mr. Kang\u2019s complaint, one shared by many other students, is that he and his peers are applying to too many colleges, driving down admission rates and elevating the prestige of selective universities, which leads more students to apply.\u201cIt just seems like a vicious cycle,\u201d Mr. Kang, 17, said in an interview.Admissions experts say Mr. Kang has a point.Mr. Kang blamed the Common Application, the standardized form that has risen in popularity and is now accepted by more than 600 colleges, including all the Ivy League universities. The ease of using the form has led many students to decide almost on a whim to add one, two or even 10 more universities to their list.Mr. Kang admitted that he, too, chose to \u201cblast send\u201d his applications. He felt as if he had to. \u201cI was one of those people that took advantage of the system,\u201d he said.He applied to 21 colleges, all but two through the Common Application, and won acceptance to six. All the Ivy League campuses to which he applied rejected him.The experience left him deflated, though despite his critique, he said he was happy for Ms. Uwamanzu-Nna (pronounced oo-wah-man-ZOO-nah), a child of Nigerian immigrants.\u201cShe did the same exact thing I did and she got the results, but I can\u2019t be mad at someone trying to improve their odds,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s so much easier to apply and there\u2019s so much pressure to apply.\u201dBut experts note that universities have taken steps to help to offset this trend.As an example, imagine that 20 years ago Ms. Uwamanzu-Nna had applied to just four of the Ivies. All things being equal, the universities would have had a one-in-four chance of her attending. Fast forward to the present, and that drops to one in eight.To ensure that freshmen classes are filled, \u201csomehow, those institutions have to compensate,\u201d said David Hawkins, the association\u2019s director of public policy.They do that, he said, in part by accepting more students. They are also marketing their campuses more aggressively to widen the applicant pool while, when making admissions decisions, putting greater weight on how serious students are about attending.In the latest association survey, colleges attributed more importance to applicants\u2019 so-called demonstrated interest than in class rank or teacher recommendations.At the same time, more and more universities are waiving application fees or buying the names of desirable students from testing agencies and sending them \u201cfast track\u201d applications that require little more than a signature.Universities say the recruitment efforts are crucial to reaching students who might not otherwise apply as well as increasing campus diversity.Critics, however, note that a more cynical motive is certainly at play.\u201cColleges like to trumpet that they have record numbers of applications,\u201d said Kent Rinehart, dean of undergraduate admission at Marist College, in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. \u201cThey like to turn away more students. It looks good to the alums, it looks good to the people on their campus, it looks good for rankings and ratings.\u201dBut admissions advisers say most students have reason to calm down. Even as competition has grown more fierce at the elite institutions the average acceptance rate at four-year colleges nationwide has remained fairly consistent at about 65 percent.\u201cThe core message is that the number of students and the number of openings at colleges has not changed in some dramatic function,\u201d Mr. Rinehart said. \u201cWhat\u2019s changed is the number of applications that students are submitting.\u201dFor her part, Ms. Uwamanzu-Nna reiterated on Monday that she was not trying to run the board when using the Common Application to apply to all eight Ivies, along with four other colleges.

{"Headline": "The New Day, a British Upstart, Casts Its Fate to the Newsstand", "Date": "2016-04-03", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 The New Day, Britain\u2019s youngest media start-up, has a little something for everyone: a digest of the day\u2019s top news, human-interest features, coverage of popular culture, sports, health and travel, and even advice columnists.What it doesn\u2019t have is a website. Or an app. Or really much of a digital presence at all.But with a goal of attracting as many as one million paying readers a week, The New Day\u2019s publisher, Trinity Mirror, one of Britain\u2019s largest media companies, is convinced that its print-only daily can find an audience in Britain\u2019s famously crowded newspaper market.Started just over a month ago , the 40-page New Day prints five days a week and is available at 40,000 newsstands across Britain, where it sells for 50 pence, or about 70 cents, a copy. Home subscriptions are not an option and, aside from an initial two-week promotion in early March, the newspaper does not plan to give away any of its content.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to go down that avenue,\u201d said The New Day\u2019s editor, Alison Phillips. \u201cThere is still a significant number of people who have the habit in their blood\u201d of paying for content and who prefer the experience of reading off-line, she said.Ms. Phillips acknowledged that the sheer volume of free content online, as well as the convenience of being able to read it on mobile phones and other devices, has helped drive readers away from print. But with The New Day, Trinity Mirror is also gambling that print readership is declining for another simple reason: Many British readers simply do not like the other print choices available.So-called quality dailies like The Guardian, The Times and The Telegraph are too dense and ponderous for some, Ms. Phillips said, while other readers are put off by the brash tone and overt partisanship of mass-market tabloids like The Sun, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch, or The Daily Mirror, which is also owned by Trinity Mirror.\u201cOur readers are time poor,\u201d Ms. Phillips said of The New Day\u2019s target audience, \u201cand they don\u2019t like being told what to think.\u201dStill, analysts said, persuading consumers to switch back to buying print media from a newsstand is no small challenge.\u201cBy definition, these are lapsed newspaper readers,\u201d said Mr. McCabe of Enders Analysis. \u201cEven if their hypothesis is correct, the reality is most people are consuming news on mobile devices. That requires a big change in habits.\u201dIf The New Day\u2019s initial sales figures are anything to go by, those digital habits die hard.Although The New Day sold as many as 150,000 daily copies at a discounted price of 25 pence in early March, its sales have since fallen precipitously, according to British media reports, to fewer than 90,000 copies. Trinity Mirror declined to confirm those early figures, citing plans to publish audited sales figures later in the spring. The company has said it expected to turn a profit by the end of the year. And while it does have some advertising, its business model is circulation driven.Ms. Phillips said she was aware that sales had fallen off since the newspaper\u2019s initial marketing push, but she added that this was unsurprising. \u201cIt was never going to be easy to launch a new print product,\u201d she said.\u201cIf you\u2019re trying to launch a new print product today, then it\u2019s crucial that it becomes something people are talking about,\u201d she said. \u201cThe reality is that, for most people, those kinds of conversations are happening online.\u201dThe New Day has turned to social media as a promotional tool, broadcasting screen shots of its front page and teasers about specific articles. But so far, its social audience \u2014 47,000 on Facebook, 12,000 on Twitter \u2014 remains a fraction of what most newspapers with shareable digital content are able to attract.Still, not all analysts are ready to dismiss The New Day as a doomed experiment.By forgoing digital, Mr. McCabe said, The New Day avoids the problem of having to stretch scarce newsroom resources across multiple platforms.\u201cPublishers today are always trying to balance a print and an online strategy as if somehow it is all going to be the same thing,\u201d Mr. McCabe said. \u201cEveryone feels like they are compromising.\u201dThat balancing act is proving increasingly tricky for many British newspapers.Trinity Mirror has gone out of its way to stress the importance of keeping overhead costs low at The New Day. The newspaper has about 25 staff members, many of whom have been drafted from other publications in the group. (Ms. Phillips, 45, is a former editor of two Trinity Mirror weeklies, The Sunday Mirror and The Sunday People.) Trinity Mirror is also able to print and distribute The New Day using its existing presses and vast national distribution network, which limits costs.But even a low-cost newspaper needs a loyal readership to survive, and analysts said The New Day\u2019s decision to target a broad, general-interest audience, while perhaps appealing to many advertisers, meant that it would struggle to differentiate itself from titles \u2014 including free ones like Metro and The Evening Standard \u2014 aimed at a similar readership.\u201cThe challenge is to be better than what\u2019s already out there,\u201d Ms. Singer said. \u201cWhatever your platform strategy is, you still have to have the goods.\u201dWith a photo-driven design and colorful typography, The New Day strikes a punchy, conversational tone. Articles and columns are brief and frequently paired with vivid charts or graphics. Ms. Phillips added that editors usually strove for a \u201cpositive\u201d story mix \u2014 even on days when the top news was decidedly somber, like the recent terrorist attacks in Brussels.Ms. Phillips said she remained encouraged by positive comments the paper was getting from readers so far \u2014 but she acknowledged that the feedback was coming primarily online.That kind of \u201cpostdigital\u201d reader engagement, she said, suggests that there is still room for successful experimentation in print publishing.\u201cIt\u2019s not just about the news. It is about the experience,\u201d Ms. Phillips said. \u201cFor many people, going to a Facebook page for the news is pretty unfulfilling.\u201dAn article on Monday about New Day, a new print-only daily publication in Britain, described incorrectly the publishing format of Politico, an American publication. Politico publishes a print newspaper and a magazine; it is not a digital-only publication.Advertisement"}

John Kasich of Ohio is going on the air in New York with a commercial that amounts to a preview of his message for a summer convention battle, arguing that he is the only Republican who can defeat Hillary Clinton in November if she is the Democratic nominee.At the same time, Mr. Kasich\u00e2\u0080\u0099s team is calling on Republicans eager to stop Donald J. Trump to supplement the campaign\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts with their own advertising boosting Mr. Kasich ahead of New York\u2019s presidential primary on April 19.The new commercial from the Kasich campaign asserts that Mr. Kasich would win a contested convention, and it casts aside Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who has a large delegate advantage on Mr. Kasich. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u2019t be fooled,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the narrator says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTed Cruz can\u2019t win the nomination outright, and he can\u2019t defeat Hillary Clinton either.

{"Headline": "3 Tied to San Bernardino Gunman Are Indicted", "Date": "2016-04-28", "News": "Supported byOn Dec. 2, Syed Rizwan Farook, and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, who had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, armed themselves with assault rifles and pipe bombs, and carried out one of the worst terror attacks on American soil, killing 14 people and wounding more than 20 others at a social services center in San Bernardino, Calif. The couple then died in a shootout with the police.The only person arrested in connection with the massacre has been Enrique Marquez Jr., a longtime friend of Mr. Farook\u2019s, charged with providing material support to terrorists, making a \u201cstraw purchase\u201d of a gun for Mr. Farook, and other crimes.Federal officials have said that Mr. Marquez also admitted that in exchange for money, and as a favor to the Farooks, he entered into a fraudulent marriage with a Russian immigrant, Mariya Chernykh, so she could gain legal residence in the United States.On Thursday, federal prosecutors in Los Angeles announced felony charges against Ms. Chernykh, 26, her sister, Tatiana Farook, 31, and Ms. Farook\u2019s husband, Syed Raheel Farook, 31, the brother of the San Bernardino gunman. All pleaded not guilty and will be released on bond. A trial is set for June 21. Law enforcement officials stressed they did not believe that any of the three had advance knowledge of the December attack, or took steps to conceal evidence afterward, but that major investigations often lead to the discovery of unrelated offenses.The F.B.I. continues to comb through the backgrounds of the San Bernardino attackers, looking for motives and possible accomplices, and until recently the bureau was engaged in a very public legal battle with Apple over Syed Rizwan Farook\u2019s cellphone. The company refused to help the F.B.I. unlock the phone to search his contacts and messages, but the bureau dropped the matter after cracking the phone\u2019s security with help from an unknown outside group that was apparently paid at least $1.3 million.The indictment, announced Thursday, represents an unusually tough stance for the government in a marriage fraud case. Five criminal charges are leveled at Ms. Chernykh, including fraudulent use of immigration documents and lying to federal agents, with combined maximum prison terms of up to 30 years. Syed Raheel Farook, a U.S. Navy veteran who worked as a computer technician aboard an aircraft carrier, and his wife, are also charged in one of those counts, conspiracy to make false statements under oath on government documents, and face a maximum sentence of five years.Ordinarily, the authorities do not pursue criminal charges for a sham marriage, just an admission by the U.S. citizen, and deportation of the immigrant, said Carl Shusterman, an immigration lawyer in Los Angeles who has formerly handled immigration cases for the government.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like these kinds of charges in a sham marriage case,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it has to be related to the fact that there\u2019s a link to the shooting.\u201dOn immigration forms, Ms. Chernykh and Mr. Marquez stated that they lived with the Farooks in their townhouse in Corona, Calif. Federal agents, who had searched the home this year, did so again Thursday, and also searched a residence in Ontario, Calif., that was identified as Ms. Chernykh\u2019s.In fact, the indictment says, neither Mr. Marquez nor Ms. Chernykh lived with the Farooks, and she \u201cresided with her child and an adult male other than Enrique Marquez Jr.\u201d in Ontario.The would-be couple had wedding pictures taken and opened a joint bank account, but the indictment shows that they were far from expert at creating a false front. At one point, Tatiana Farook told her sister to stop posting pictures of herself posing with her real boyfriend to her social media page, the indictment says, and another time, Ms. Farook told Mr. Marquez that he needed to change the address on his driver\u2019s license to match the one on the immigration forms.They also left a considerable electronic trail, particularly as Mr. Marquez and Ms. Chernykh prepared last fall for an interview with immigration agents, who would try to determine if their marriage was genuine. Last November, they exchanged messages that \u201cdiscussed their mutual anxiety for their upcoming immigration interview due to the lack of contact with each other,\u201d and he told her he was afraid of going to prison for immigration fraud, the indictment says.At about the same time, someone using Mr. Marquez\u2019s Facebook page indicated that he might be in trouble, writing \u201cinvolved in terrorist plots, drugs, antisocial behavior, marriage, might go to prison for fraud, etc.\u201dBut the planning to hide the sham marriage continued. The day before the shooting, the indictment says, Ms. Farook sent an electronic message to her husband, asking him to create a backdated lease agreement to make it appear that Mr. Marquez and her sister lived with them. The indictment said that the Farooks helped the pair open their joint account and buy a wedding band, and served as witnesses on their marriage license.On Thursday, the Farooks\u2019 neighbor, Brittani Adams, said she had maintained a friendly relationship with the couple after the December attack.\u201cIt is rough; they are good people just twisted in family stuff,\u201d she said. If the coupled feared arrest, she said, they kept it bottled up \u2018real well.\u2019The Farook brothers were born in the United States, to parents who immigrated from Pakistan. Ms. Malik was born in Pakistan and spent much of her life in Saudi Arabia, before marrying Syed Rizwan Farook and moving to the United States in 2014.Officials have said they have no indication that the couple had any connection to a terrorist group or mentor, but instead, it appears they \u201cself-radicalized.\u201d They seemed unlikely candidates for it. Mr. Farook worked for several years as an inspector for the San Bernardino County Department of Public Health, where he reportedly had no conflicts with co-workers. Ms. Malik had a college degree in pharmacology, and the couple had a baby daughter.Ian Lovett reported from Los Angeles, and Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The N.F.L. Has Seen the Future, and It Is WWE Wrestling", "Date": "2016-04-08", "News": "Supported bySports BusinessA four-hour-plus extravaganza, WrestleMania 32 culminated with a title match that pitted Roman Reigns against Paul Levesque, a.k.a. Triple H, a villain turned fan favorite who is also a top WWE executive and is married to Stephanie McMahon, the daughter of Vince McMahon, WWE\u2019s billionaire chief executive. Although Triple H controlled the match most of the way, he lost the world championship after his wife leapt into the ring, which flustered him, allowing Reigns to win. Boos rained down as the victor hoisted his championship belt.Although professional wrestling does not exactly qualify as a real sport, nearly 102,000 fans showed up at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Tex., to watch WrestleMania 32, which grossed a record $17.3 million from the live event alone. Tens of thousands of additional fans paid $59.95 to watch on pay-per-view television. Many more watched it on a streaming app called WWE Network, which costs subscribers $9.99 a month.In mid-February, during its quarterly earnings call, the company announced that the WWE Network had 1.22 million subscribers. After WrestleMania 32, that number jumped to 1.82 million. Although some of those subscribers will fall away \u2014 the WWE Network offers a monthlong free trial to potential customers, some of whom undoubtedly signed up just to watch WrestleMania for free \u2014 that is still nearly a 50 percent increase in six weeks.But strategically at least, what the N.F.L. is doing is not all that different from what WWE has done with its digital app. With more and more people watching movies and television shows that are streamed to digital devices rather than shown via traditional platforms like cable and satellite, the N.F.L. is preparing for the day when the same is true for live sports.Right now, live sports are the single most important reason the transition from traditional television to online streaming isn\u2019t happening even faster. There are advertisers who will air commercials only during live events, which mostly means sports; they know that many viewers will avoid ads by seeking out their favorite shows on on-demand streaming services. And there are many viewers whose desire to watch sports is the only thing keeping them from cutting the cord.But the N.F.L. isn\u2019t in the business of propping up traditional television\u2019s business model; it\u2019s in the business of getting people to watch football games. And when the day comes that most of them prefer to have those games streamed, well, the N.F.L. wants to be ready.WWE started its own streaming business in 2014. For more than two decades, its television home has been USA Network, which airs WWE\u2019s flagship show, \u201cRaw,\u201d every Monday night. (A second show, \u201cSmackdown,\u201d runs on Thursday nights.) USA, which is owned by NBC Universal, is one of the top-rated cable networks, in no small part because \u201cRaw\u201d is among the top-rated cable shows. The programming WWE doesn\u2019t air on USA \u2014 premium content like WrestleMania \u2014 has historically consisted of pay-per-view events.Around 2011, WWE started thinking about starting its own HBO-style cable channel, according to George Barrios, the company\u2019s chief strategy and financial officer. (Barrios went to WWE from The New York Times Company, where he was the treasurer.) But by 2013, WWE executives had done research showing that wrestling fans \u2014 most of whom are not wealthy \u2014 were big users of broadband, watching shows from streaming services like Netflix and Hulu considerably more often than most people. They were also voracious watchers of YouTube. (Barrios said the WWE gets more YouTube views for its short-form content, such as highlights, than any other sports channel.) So the company decided to abandon the cable channel idea and develop a streaming service instead.\u201cWe thought if this is where our consumers are going, we needed to be there as well,\u201d Barrios said. Streaming has undeniable advantages over traditional television. The subscribers belong to WWE, not to a cable company, so it can market to them more directly. It can sell WWE clothing and paraphernalia directly from its app. The WWE Network allows it to make money on its popular archives. And it gets steady, monthly checks from its subscribers, rather than having to count on less-reliable pay-per-view revenue.\u201cThey thought they needed one million subscribers to make it work,\u201d said Brandon Ross, an analyst who covers the stock for BTIG, an investment firm. \u201cFor them, it was a no-brainer.\u201d The WWE Network hit the million mark in 2015. WWE still offers its premium events on pay per view \u2014 so as not to lose fans who don\u2019t yet have broadband \u2014 but that income stream is declining as more wrestling fans turn to the WWE Network.What you won\u2019t find on the WWE Network is either \u201cRaw\u201d or \u201cSmackdown,\u201d which remain on USA. But that doesn\u2019t mean that USA executives aren\u2019t nervous. In May 2014, a few months after the launch of its new streaming service, WWE signed a new rights deal with the cable network that was considerably lower than expected. Clearly, the lower amount was a result of USA\u2019s fears that streaming would cut into its ratings. Wall Street panicked, and WWE\u2019s stock dropped almost 50 percent in a day. Though the stock eventually recovered, McMahon lost his billionaire status for a while.Today, \u201cRaw\u201d and \u201cSmackdown\u201d have a combined viewership of well over 10 million. That\u2019s still a lot higher than the WWE Network\u2019s 1.82 million subscribers. And WWE\u2019s television rights remain its largest single source of revenue. But the ratings for \u201cRaw\u201d are down somewhat \u2014 as are the ratings for the entire USA Network \u2014 and if the WWE Network continues to gain subscribers at the pace it is on, it\u2019s worth wondering how long WWE will remain committed to a cable network whose profits are dependent on an eroding business model.If I were an executive at CBS, NBC, Fox or ESPN, I would be nervous, too. The N.F.L.-Twitter deal might not look like much in financial terms, but it offers the N.F.L. a cheap and easy chance to experiment with putting football games online in a way that is untethered to a television network or a cable or satellite subscription. Over time, that can\u2019t possibly lead anyplace good for the networks.Indeed, Twitter got the deal over other Internet companies \u2014 some of which offered more money \u2014 precisely because it was willing to let the N.F.L. do pretty much anything it wants as it tries to work out a business model for streaming.For the N.F.L., Twitter offers a young, sports-minded audience (the Twittersphere lights up during major sports events); a way to reach football fans, and potential fans, internationally; and a chance to lure the many millennials who refuse to subscribe to cable even if it means missing pro football. As for Twitter, the N.F.L. allows the company to offer something no other social media service can claim, which it needs as it tries to reinvigorate its stalled subscriber base. Having professional football will increase user engagement; one can easily imagine people watching the game and posting to Twitter on the same screen. And it will give the company the chance to rethink how it generates advertising, which it desperately needs to do. For both parties, the deal makes sense.\u201cThe N.F.L. has a long history of finding the next wannabe,\u201d said Jay Rosenstein, a former executive at CBS Sports who now consults for Headline Media, a television talent and programming company. By that he means the N.F.L. finds entities yearning to carry pro football and turns that desire into money.The NFL added \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d for ABC (now on its corporate sibling ESPN), brought in Fox for Sunday afternoons, created \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d for ESPN (NBC now televises that package of games), moved games to Thursday night for its own network (which are now also shown on CBS and NBC), and sold its Sunday Ticket package to DirecTV. The N.F.L. is looking to streaming for the next wannabe.Rosenstein noted that all the N.F.L.\u2019s major television deals would be up for grabs at the end of this decade and the beginning of the next. Is it possible that a big Internet player, like Amazon, whose $100 billion-plus in annual revenue dwarfs that of, say, CBS ($13.9 billion last year), could decide to outbid one of the television networks for exclusive rights to one of the N.F.L.\u2019s packages of games? It is.As the N.F.L. gets savvier about streaming games thanks to its Twitter experience, could it decide to create its own subscription-only digital app for another package of games? It could. HBO now has a streaming app that viewers can pay for without needing a cable subscription. Why couldn\u2019t the N.F.L. do the same thing? It\u2019s not going to happen next week, or even next year, but if I were a betting man, I\u2019d say it will happen someday. If its fans eventually abandon old-fashioned television, so will the N.F.L.\u201cSports is what keeps people coming to television,\u201d said Ross, the securities analyst.Until it doesn\u2019t.An earlier version of this article misidentified the network for which \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d was created. It was ESPN, not NBC. (NBC gained the rights to that package of games in 2006.)Email: nocera@nytimes.comTwitter: @NoceraNYTAdvertisement"}

The reason is her r\u00e9sum\u00e9: Nearly 30 years before she worked for foreign companies in China, Ms. Chen served a stint in the Chinese military. After that, she was involved in a joint venture that was partly owned by the country\u2019s powerful domestic security ministry.Like many foreign-owned Internet services, Twitter has long been blocked in China. But Ms. Chen\u2019s appointment \u2014 and the stir it has caused \u2014 shows the complicated relationship between Twitter, the technology industry and China. The country has some of the world\u2019s strictest limits on online expression, and it requires Internet companies to place servers in the mainland. It has shown little compunction about blocking or banning companies that will not play along.Twitter has become an online home to a number of Chinese political activists abroad, who use it to communicate with one another and to share their views of current events in China with the world. Some of them reacted with condemnation over the weekend to Ms. Chen\u2019s appointment.In a statement, Dickson Seow, a Twitter spokesman, said that after college in the late 1980s, Ms. Chen was assigned by the Chinese government to become a junior engineer in the People\u2019s Liberation Army. She left in 1994, when the opening of the Chinese economy provided a chance, the statement said.She then was hired by Computer Associates, an American company, to lead its joint venture in China. The Chinese Ministry of Public Security owned a 20 percent stake in that venture through a local company, the statement said, and Ms. Chen focused on selling antivirus products and never worked for the ministry itself. According to her LinkedIn biography, she worked for Microsoft from 2005 to 2009 and for Cisco from 2009 to 2013, before returning to Microsoft.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S. Cyberattacks Target ISIS in a New Line of Combat", "Date": "2016-04-24", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 The United States has opened a new line of combat against the Islamic State, directing the military\u2019s six-year-old Cyber Command for the first time to mount computer-network attacks that are now being used alongside more traditional weapons.The National Security Agency, which specializes in electronic surveillance, has for years listened intensely to the militants of the Islamic State, and those reports are often part of the president\u2019s daily intelligence briefing. But the N.S.A.\u2019s military counterpart, Cyber Command, was focused largely on Russia, China, Iran and North Korea \u2014 where cyberattacks on the United States most frequently originate \u2014 and had run virtually no operations against what has become the most dangerous terrorist organization in the world.A review of what should be done to confront the Islamic State is on Mr. Obama\u2019s agenda on Monday, when he is scheduled to attend a conference in Hanover, Germany, with the leaders of Britain, France, Italy and Germany. Of these efforts, the cybercampaign is the newest. It is also the one discussed in least detail by officials of many countries, and its successes or failures are the most difficult to assess from the outside.The goal of the new campaign is to disrupt the ability of the Islamic State to spread its message, attract new adherents, circulate orders from commanders and carry out day-to-day functions, like paying its fighters. A benefit of the administration\u2019s exceedingly rare public discussion of the campaign, officials said, is to rattle the Islamic State\u2019s commanders, who have begun to realize that sophisticated hacking efforts are manipulating their data. Potential recruits may also be deterred if they come to worry about the security of their communications with the militant group.Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter is among those who have publicly discussed the new mission, but only in broad terms, and this month the deputy secretary of defense, Robert O. Work, was more colorful in describing the effort.\u201cWe are dropping cyberbombs,\u201d Mr. Work said. \u201cWe have never done that before.\u201dThe campaign has been conducted by a small number of \u201cnational mission teams,\u201d newly created cyberunits loosely modeled on Special Operations forces.While officials declined to discuss the details of their operations, interviews with more than a half-dozen senior and midlevel officials indicate that the effort has begun with a series of \u201cimplants\u201d in the militants\u2019 networks to learn the online habits of commanders. Now, the plan is to imitate them or to alter their messages, with the aim of redirecting militants to areas more vulnerable to attack by American drones or local ground forces.In other cases, officials said, the United States may complement operations to bomb warehouses full of cash by using cyberattacks to interrupt electronic transfers and misdirect payments.The fact that the administration is beginning to talk of its use of the new weapons is a dramatic change. As recently as four years ago, it would not publicly admit to developing offensive cyberweapons or confirm its role in any attacks on computer networks.That is partly because cyberattacks inside another nation raise major questions over invasion of sovereignty. But in the case of the Islamic State, officials say a decision was made that a bit of boasting might degrade the enemy\u2019s trust in its communications, jumbling and even deterring some actions.\u201cOur cyberoperations are disrupting their command-and-control and communications,\u201d Mr. Obama said this month, emerging from a meeting at the C.I.A. headquarters in Langley, Va., on countering the Islamic State.Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, offered broad outlines of the new campaign against the Islamic State, which is also known as ISIS or ISIL, during a news conference in February.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to both physically and virtually isolate ISIL, limit their ability to conduct command and control, limit their ability to communicate with each other, limit their ability to conduct operations locally and tactically,\u201d he said.\u201cBut I\u2019ll be one of the first ones arguing that that\u2019s about all we should talk about,\u201d General Dunford said. \u201cWe want them to be surprised when we conduct cyberoperations. And, frankly, they\u2019re going to experience some friction that\u2019s associated with us and some friction that\u2019s just associated with the normal course of events in dealing in the information age.\u201dIn an interview this month in Colorado Springs, where she talked to Air Force Academy cadets, Mr. Obama\u2019s national security adviser, Susan E. Rice, said that the fight against the Islamic State had to be thought of as a multifront war \u2014 and that computers were just another weapon in the arsenal.\u201cIt should not be taken out of proportion \u2014 it is not the only tool,\u201d she said when asked about Mr. Work\u2019s \u201ccyberbombs\u201d comment. In fact, some of Mr. Work\u2019s colleagues acknowledged that they had winced when he used the term, because government lawyers have gone to extraordinary lengths to narrowly limit cyberattacks to highly precise operations with as little collateral damage as possible.But Ms. Rice said the Islamic State had \u201cuniquely utilized cyberspace\u201d to recruit, to communicate over encrypted apps and to coordinate its operations from Syria to Europe.Ms. Rice would not comment on reports from officials in the Pentagon that Mr. Obama had asked \u2014 quite pointedly \u2014 in the fall why the arsenal of cyberweapons that had been developed at a cost of hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars was not being used in the fight against the terrorist group.But inside Fort Meade in Maryland, home to the N.S.A. and Cyber Command, initial demands from the White House generated some resistance, according to officials involved in the debate.The N.S.A. has spent years penetrating foreign networks \u2014 the Chinese military, Russian submarine communications, Internet traffic and other targets \u2014 placing thousands of implants in those networks to allow it to listen in.But those implants can be used to manipulate data or to shut down a network. That frequently leads to a battle between the N.S.A. civilians \u2014 who know that to make use of an implant is to blow its cover \u2014 and the military operators who want to strike back. N.S.A. officials complained that once the implants were used to attack, the Islamic State militants would stop the use of a communications channel and perhaps start one that was harder to find, penetrate or de-encrypt.\u201cIt\u2019s a delicate balance,\u201d Ms. Rice said. \u201cWe still have to keep our eye on the Russia-China state-sponsored activity, but this was a new mission, one where we have to balance the collection equities against the disruption equities.\u201dIn Britain, the Government Communications Headquarters, the country\u2019s equivalent to the N.S.A., has been going through a similar debate. It is a familiar one for the British: According to an oft-repeated legend from World War II, Winston Churchill decided to let the Nazis bomb Coventry, at a cost of hundreds of lives, rather than reveal that Britain had used its Enigma machine to crack German codes. (There is a historical dispute about whether Churchill knew the city was to be targeted.)Lisa O. Monaco, a deputy national security adviser and Mr. Obama\u2019s top adviser for counterterrorism, has led efforts examining how to disrupt the use of social media for recruiting. She has met technology executives in Silicon Valley; Austin, Tex.; Boston; and Washington to come up with a more integrated plan for both taking down social media posts and encouraging the development of a counternarrative.One effort has included amplifying the testimony of Islamic State recruits who have escaped and now describe the group\u2019s brutality and question its adherence to the true tenets of Islam. Facebook, YouTube and Twitter are also growing more efficient at finding and removing Islamic State posts \u2014 which they can take down without court orders because the posts are a violation of the companies\u2019 terms of service, executives say.But Ms. Monaco suggested that the effort was just beginning. \u201cWe are not going to kill our way out of this conflict,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we are not going to delete our way out of it, either.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Start-Ups Aim at Overlooked Demographic: The Unbanked", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported byLast summer Jimmy Chen walked the streets of San Francisco trying to do simple financial transactions without a bank account, a task millions of Americans face.It cost him $4 to cash a $20 personal check and $5 to send $30 to a relative \u2014 activities that would have been free with a bank account. When he needed to retrieve a money transfer, the process of verifying his identity took so long he almost gave up.In Mr. Chen\u2019s case, Propel is working on an app to make it easier to get access to the federal food stamp system. The relative lack of new entrants trying to address problems faced by the less wealthy is caused, in no small part, by the lack of familiarity with these problems among young, largely affluent entrepreneurs like Mr. Chen, a 28-year-old former engineer at Facebook.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to solve a problem you don\u2019t understand,\u201d he said.The companies in the Financial Solutions Lab first gathered last July. Mr. Chen and the other start-ups in the lab went out into San Francisco on a sort of scavenger hunt to experience the expensive financial services that are the only option for many low-income Americans. In the months after, the companies gathered several more times to get guidance on how to build affordable financial services while still adhering to the manifold regulations that fall on the financial industry.The lab has had to strike a difficult balance of finding start-ups that want to serve low-income people without overcharging them and making their problems worse. Many payday lenders and prepaid card suppliers say they exist to help their clients, but end up preying on their financial vulnerability.Ryan Falvey, the director of the lab, said that among the 300 applicants to the program last year, many did not meet the Center for Financial Services Innovation\u2019s guiding principles of encouraging inclusion, upward mobility and positive consumer behavior. \u201cThere are a lot of products out there that are at odds with the consumer,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can make a lot of money, and the consumer can find themselves in worse and worse shape.\u201dAscend provides loans of a few thousand dollars to borrowers who fall between the prime and subprime categories. The loans start with an annual interest rate around 30 percent, but it can drop to 14 percent if borrowers take steps like saving money or limiting credit card spending.The business model has been promising enough that venture capitalists have put $1.5 million into Ascend. Another participant in the lab was a nonprofit from Manhattan that is trying to build a mobile phone app, PayGoal, to help clients make better financial decisions.Mr. Chen said Chase executives spent hours helping him and his two co-founders understand the entire route a payment travels after a customer swipes a card at a store. But for Propel the biggest lessons have come from going to poor neighborhoods where people use food stamps.These lessons led his team to change the focus of Propel from helping people sign up for food stamps to making it easier to check the balance in a food stamp account, something that had been virtually impossible from a smartphone.The lessons learned on the street are just the sort of thing that Mr. Falvey, who is now choosing the second class of lab participants, is hoping he can push more young entrepreneurs to pursue.\u201cI think that there is a huge disparity between how most consumers live their financial lives \u2014 quickly, on the edge and with a significant degree of stress, and a lot of distrust of financial service providers \u2014 and the world that many of our financial products were designed for,\u201d he said.An article on Thursday about a program that encourages start-ups to address the problems of people without bank accounts misspelled the surname of the chief executive of Neighborhood Trust Financial Partners, which created PayGoal, a phone app that helps people make better financial decisions. She is Justine Zinkin, not Zinkine.Advertisement"}

But on Thursday it was former President Bill Clinton facing a barrage of protests from critics who disapprove of his record on overhauling the criminal justice system.While campaigning for his wife, Hillary Clinton, at an event in Philadelphia, Mr. Clinton was forced to defend his 1994 crime bill while weathering repeated heckling. He argued that the legislation had helped African-Americans by protecting them from gangs, and he said that Black Lives Matter protesters\u00c2\u00a0were misguided.Explaining that the bill caused big declines in murders and other crime during his administration, Mr. Clinton said, \u201cWhose lives were saved, that mattered?\u201dAlthough Mrs. Clinton has been doing well among black voters during the nominating contests, she has had to distance herself from some of her husband\u2019s policies, including the 1994 crime bill, which she implicitly suggested led to the mass incarceration of blacks.

{"Headline": "Sanders\u2019s Message Stands to Resonate Long After Election", "Date": "2016-04-03", "News": "Supported byLetter From WashingtonSenator Bernie Sanders, the democratic socialist from Vermont, is waging an improbable presidential campaign, but he won\u2019t disappear after this election. Nor will his followers.Mr. Sanders probably has no more than a 10 percent shot at winning the Democratic nomination \u2014 and that\u2019s if something bad happens to Hillary Clinton or, less likely, if after winning in Wisconsin this week, he scores a huge upset in New York two weeks later and transforms the race.Yet Mr. Sanders, who for the left wing was a consolation choice after Senator Elizabeth Warren wouldn\u2019t run, has a message that will continue to resonate, especially among the multitudes of young supporters.The clarity and coherence of the campaign have surprised even those who sharply disagree with him.\u201cBernie has run a much better campaign than I ever thought he would,\u201d said Trent Lott, the former Senate Republican leader and Mississippi conservative.Mr. Sanders is setting much of the Democratic agenda, forcing Mrs. Clinton to move left by opposing the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Keystone pipeline and by frequently assailing Wall Street. Even Republicans have picked up some of his populist rhetoric.If, as the odds-makers now predict, Mrs. Clinton wins the nomination and the presidency, Mr. Sanders, with two years left in his Senate term, will be looking over her left shoulder.If Democrats, including the next president or the next Democratic Senate leader (likely Chuck Schumer of New York), cozy up to Wall Street, expect a Sanders-Warren barrage. The so-called bank bailout in 2008 probably prevented the economy from going over the cliff. But Mr. Sanders has reinforced a public sense that bankers are making out like bandits while Main Street struggles.One virtual certainty: The next Treasury secretary won\u2019t come from Wall Street.Mr. Sanders also has galvanized public outrage over Supreme Court decisions that unleashed a flood of big money into politics. Most Americans agree with him that the United States system of money in politics is corrupt. Both President Bill Clinton and President Obama gave lip service to campaign-finance reform and then put it on the back burner. Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign ensures that another President Clinton won\u2019t have that luxury.Some of his notions, including higher taxes on the wealthy and a completely government-run health care system, are nonstarters. But the public has moved closer to his view on economic fairness, and his call for free public higher education is a debate that will endure.Mr. Sanders has attracted extraordinary support from young voters, beating Mrs. Clinton by huge margins. These Americans have grown up in tough times, with more limited opportunities. They\u2019re skeptical about the establishment, and the socialist label doesn\u2019t have the negative connotation it does for many older Americans.The question is whether Mr. Sanders will keep these young people politically energized. The last such cause-centric candidate was Eugene McCarthy in 1968, though he basically checked out of Democratic politics after he lost the presidential nomination.Katy Harriger, a political scientist at Wake Forest University who has studied the youth vote, thinks that Mr. Sanders has the capacity to keep them mobilized on issues like campaign financing and economic inequality. That engagement could carry to the off-year elections, when the participation of young voters traditionally drops off. \u201cHe has tapped into something very real and has credibility with a lot of these young voters,\u201d Ms. Harriger said.Unlike McCarthy, whose views evolved over time, Mr. Sanders has been consistently to the left for almost a half-century. Although he started in dingy basements and sparsely attended rallies for lost causes, he now has a national megaphone that he\u2019s not likely to relinquish. He also will have more than two million contributors, mostly small donors, and almost four million \u201clikes\u201d on his Facebook page. In today\u2019s politics, that\u2019s a machine.Advertisement"}

Says It Needs Hackers to Keep Up With Tech Companies", "Date": "2016-04-19", "News": "Supported byAmy Hess, the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s executive assistant director for science and technology, made the comments at a hearing by members of Congress who are debating potential legislation on encryption. The lawmakers gathered law enforcement authorities and Silicon Valley company executives to discuss the issue, which has divided technology companies and officials in recent months and spurred a debate over privacy and security.Yet that has done little to quell the controversy. The encryption debate has continued with new hearings, proposed legislation and other cases that involve locked iPhones and law enforcement demands that the devices be opened to aid investigations.In Tuesday\u2019s hearing, Ms. Hess did not provide details on how the F.B.I. ultimately gained access to the San Bernardino iPhone but said the agency had come to rely on private sector partners to keep up with changes in technology. She said that there was no one-stop solution and that the agency generally should not use third parties to hack into systems but lacks the expertise to break past encryption.\u201cThese types of solutions that we may employ require a lot of highly skilled, specialized resources that we may not have immediately available to us,\u201d Ms. Hess said.The focus on third parties at the hearing illustrates a growing discomfort by some in Congress and in the tech industry with the use of \u201cgray hat\u201d hackers, who are hackers who may push the boundaries of the law and anger companies but whose intentions are not malicious.\u201cI don\u2019t think relying on a third party is a good model,\u201d said Representative Diana DeGette, a Democrat from Colorado. She questioned if the use of third-party hackers was ethical and whether it could open up greater security risks because sensitive and valuable data could be accessible to outside groups.Ms. Hess did not answer directly when asked about whether there were ethical issues in using third-party hackers but said the bureau needed to review its operation \u201cto make sure that we identify the risks and benefits.\u201d The F.B.I. has been unwilling to say whom it paid to demonstrate a way around the iPhone\u2019s internal defenses, or how much, and it has not shown Apple the technique.Apple\u2019s general counsel, Bruce Sewell, said at the hearing that encryption did not prevent the authorities from solving crimes.\u201cAs you heard from our colleagues in law enforcement, they have the perception that encryption walls off information to them,\u201d Mr. Sewell said. \u201cBut technologists and national security experts don\u2019t see the world that way. We see a data-rich world that seems to be full of information. Information that law enforcement can use to solve \u2014 and prevent \u2014 crimes.\u201dLaw enforcement officials testifying before the committee on Tuesday expressed frustration over their inability to run a number of cases to ground \u2014 particularly sex abuse and child pornography cases \u2014 because of encrypted phones. They said the recent publicity over the issue could end up helping criminals.\u201cMake no mistake \u2014 criminals are listening to this testimony and learning from it,\u201d said Charles Cohen, commander of the Indiana Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force.The F.B.I. said there has been an increase in the number of devices it has acquired through investigations but was unable to gain access to because of encryption. Ms. Hess said that since October, 13 percent of the devices obtained by the F.B.I. were impenetrable by the agency. When asked at Tuesday\u2019s hearing if the relationship between the tech industry and law enforcement had become adversarial, Ms. Hess responded, \u201cI hope not.\u201dTech companies, which have largely banded together in support of Apple\u2019s pro-encryption position, are lobbying against the draft bill.Timed to the Tuesday hearing, trade groups representing top technology companies including Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft sent a letter to Senators Burr and Feinstein, opposing their bill.\u201cWe believe it is critical to the safety of the nation\u2019s, and the world\u2019s, information technology infrastructure for us all to avoid actions that will create government-mandated security vulnerabilities in our encryption systems,\u201d the groups, which include the Reform Government Surveillance and Computer and Communications Industry Association, said. \u201cAny mandatory decryption requirement, such as that included in the discussion draft of the bill that you authored, will to lead to unintended consequences.\u201dMichael Petricone, senior vice president for government affairs at the Consumer Technology Association, added, \u201cThis is urgent because the one thing you don\u2019t want is Congress coming in a knee-jerk fashion and doing something with all sorts of negative consequences, which is what we may be seeing happen now.\u201dPresident Obama has done little to assuage concerns by the tech industry. In a speech in March, the president warned against \u201cfetishizing\u201d encryption and urged more compromise between tech companies and the F.B.I.Advertisement"}

Mr. Sanders said Mrs. Clinton has advocated for natural gas pipelines that will hurt the environment, and that as secretary of state she had rewarded companies through fracking expansions. He also expressed support for climate change activists who rallied to get fracking banned in New York.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI want to applaud you for standing up to Governor Cuomo and demanding that New York State ban fracking,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said to loud applause. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat you have done is prove to the world that when people stand up and form a grass-roots movement of environmentalists and public health advocates, farmers, working families and religious leaders, there is nothing that we cannot accomplish.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe senator also pushed back against many who question whether Mr. Sanders\u2019s proposed policies \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a single-payer health care system, tuition-free public colleges and an expansion of Social Security \u00e2\u0080\u0094 are achievable.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat may have been considered unrealistic or pie in the sky just a few years ago has now been achieved in New York because you made it happen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe growing body of evidence tells us that fracking is a danger to our water supply, our most precious resource. It is a danger to the air we breathe. It has resulted in more earthquakes. It is highly explosive. And it is contributing to climate change.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe senator added that Vermont was the first state in the nation to ban fracking and that Maryland last year imposed a moratorium on the technique.  Mr. Sanders also stressed that he and Mrs. Clinton have \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery strong differences of opinion\u00e2\u0080\u009d on the issue.\u00e2\u0080\u009cSecretary Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role in fracking when she was secretary of state is not a good record,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cSecretary Clinton and her State Department worked to export fracking throughout the world.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe senator added that Mrs. Clinton used fracking to reward companies like Chevron, Haliburton, and Exxon Mobil and that he, as president, would push to end fracking everywhere. Soon after the senator\u2019s speech in Binghamton, the Sanders campaign released a new ad featuring the actress Susan Sarandon, one of Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most visible surrogates.\u201cDo Washington politicians side with polluters over families?\u201d Ms. Sarandon says in the 30-second spot. \u201cThey sure do, because big oil pumps millions into their campaigns. Bernie Sanders is the only candidate for president who opposes fracking everywhere. Why? Because fracking pumps dangerous cancer-causing chemicals into the ground and threatens our drinking water.

{"Headline": "Google\u2019s Antitrust Woes in Europe Are Likely to Grow", "Date": "2016-04-19", "News": "Supported byGoogle\u2019s antitrust problems in Europe are about to get a whole lot bigger.The company is expected to be charged with breaking the European Union\u2019s competition rules by unfairly favoring Google services, like its search engine and Google Maps, on its Android smartphone operating system over those of rivals, according to three people. The three, who work in either government or the private sector, spoke on the condition of anonymity.The charges, known formally as a statement of objections, may be announced in Brussels as soon as Wednesday, though the announcement could still be postponed until later this month, according to one of the people.The expected charges against Google are the latest in a raft of regulatory problems that American tech giants have faced as the European Union has cracked down on these companies\u2019 perceived dominance over how people in the 28-member bloc get access to digital services.Google denies that it has breached the region\u2019s tough competition laws, and it will have several months to respond to the charges from the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union.\u201cAnyone can use Android with or without Google applications,\u201d Mark Jansen, a Google spokesman, said in a statement when asked about the company\u2019s mobile software. \u201cHardware manufacturers and carriers can decide how to use Android, and consumers have the last word about which apps they want to use on their devices.\u201dA spokesman for the European Commission declined to comment.Despite the company\u2019s denials, the expected charges linked to Android, which powers 77 percent of European smartphones, would represent a major setback for the Silicon Valley company as it grapples with a growing number of global competition investigations into Google\u2019s vast operations.Canadian authorities, though, said on Tuesday that they had closed their investigation into claims that Google had misused its dominant position in online search. They added they would continue monitoring the company\u2019s activities.Apple continues to generate the largest share of revenue from global smartphone sales. The company also bundles its own services, including digital maps, into its mobile software, but has yet to face similar questions over whether it has broken Europe\u2019s antitrust rules.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.If European officials demand that the company provide rivals greater access to the Android universe \u2014 a possibility if Google is found to have broken the region\u2019s laws \u2014 the search giant may find it more difficult to promote its own mobile services to users worldwide as well as to smartphone makers.As part of the charges to be announced as soon as Wednesday, Margrethe Vestager, Europe\u2019s antitrust chief, is expected to focus on Google\u2019s deals with cellphone manufacturers that include bundles of Google services included in Android.Speaking in Amsterdam on Monday, Ms. Vestager said that these deals may have hindered competition by forcing cellphone manufacturers to rely on Google\u2019s mobile services that come preinstalled on certain versions of the Android software.\u201cOur concern is that, by requiring phone makers and operators to preload a set of Google apps, rather than letting them decide for themselves which apps to load, Google might have cut off one of the main ways that new apps can reach customers,\u201d Ms. Vestager said ahead of the charges being announced.The case related to Google\u2019s Android operating system has been long expected.These companies say that they have been financially hurt by Google practices that they call unfair, an accusation the company rejects.\u201cConsumers deserve more choice and innovation in mobile devices and applications,\u201d said Thomas Vinje, a lawyer for FairSearch. \u201cA statement of objections in the Android case would be an important step forward for competition and consumers.\u201dGoogle says that its partnerships with cellphone makers that rely on its operating system are voluntary, and that these relationships offer benefits to consumers as well as manufacturers.In February, Mr. Pichai traveled to Brussels to meet with Ms. Vestager and other European politicians, including G\u00fcnther Oettinger, a German politician in charge of the digital economy in the bloc. Eric E. Schmidt, Alphabet\u2019s executive chairman, has also been a regular visitor to Europe, meeting often with regional officials, in part to discuss the company\u2019s continuing antitrust problems.Now, Google faces mounting pressure over accusations it abused its position in everything from online search to its Android operating system. And it is the turn of Mr. Pichai, along with other Google executives, to respond.An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of Europe\u2019s antitrust chief. She is Margrethe Vestager, not Margrethre.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How You\u2019re Making Facebook a Money Machine", "Date": "2016-04-29", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsWhat you do when waiting for the bus or avoiding work goes a long way to explaining a tectonic shift in business and media.In such moments you are most likely checking Facebook. More of you will be doing that than tweeting, searching on Google, checking stock prices on Yahoo or reading articles like this. And that constant lure, a fix you can easily satisfy both on a phone and a desktop computer, explains why Facebook is pulling ahead of every other large technology company right now.Your addiction is making Facebook astonishingly profitable. Put a little more kindly, your emotional and intellectual interactions on the social network are creating a great place for companies to advertise.What this means in dollars and cents for Facebook can be seen in numbers contained in its first-quarter financial results, released on Wednesday. For the United States and Canada, Facebook pulled in $11.86 in advertising revenue per user in the first quarter. That\u2019s what advertisers are willing to pay to catch your attention as you argue with your friends and relatives over Donald Trump or coo over baby pictures or both.Facebook\u2019s revenue was up over 50 percent from a year earlier, while its net income soared nearly 200 percent. Its stock leapt on Thursday as the wider market fell. Facebook\u2019s blowout financial performance stood out because Apple, Twitter and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, all reported disappointing first-quarter numbers.Facebook is doing well because it occupies a huge sweet spot in the connected world, perhaps an even bigger one than Google owns.But people apparently hang around on Facebook far longer. According to SimilarWeb, users spent just over 17 minutes on the social network on average in March, well ahead of the nine minutes for Google (these figures don\u2019t accurately reflect how active people are on the sites, but you can still see the difference.)Google has long enjoyed a big advantage in the battle for online advertising revenue because users are more likely to click on an ad for something they are searching for. But even though Facebook users are not usually on the network to buy something, the sticky way in which they engage once there makes it an attractive place to advertise.Another advantage for Facebook is that its costs are lower than Google\u2019s, which helps it make more money out of every dollar of revenue. In the 12 months through March, Facebook\u2019s operating profit was equivalent to 37 percent of its revenue; at Google it was 26 percent. Facebook is in the enviable position of spending less to bring in revenue that is growing more quickly than Google\u2019s.Pundits made a big deal this week about how Facebook excelled as Apple stumbled. But there was a warning for Facebook in Apple\u2019s results. Apple has relied heavily on one product \u2014 the iPhone \u2014 for much of its revenue, so when sales of the device slowed, there was little Apple could do to keep growing. Facebook is even more reliant on a single element: advertising revenue. If people spend markedly less time on Facebook \u2014 because an enticing new network comes along, for example \u2014 the company\u2019s revenue growth could slow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Give Us a King!", "Date": "2016-04-30", "News": "Supported byEVERY era gets the heroic founding father it deserves, and thanks to Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s celebrated musical, ours has Alexander Hamilton \u2014 the immigrant striver, the political genius, and of course, the closet monarchist.And that legacy is at work in the current political moment. Executive-branch Caesarism has been raised to new heights by the last two presidents, and important parts of the country have responded by upping the ante, and \u2014 like ancient Israelites in the Book of Samuel \u2014 basically clamoring for a king.That clamor is loudest from the Trumpistas and their dear leader. Donald Trump is clearly running to be an American caudillo, not the president of a constitutional republic, and his entire campaign is a cult of personality in the style of (the pro-Trump) Vladimir Putin.But the response to Trump is equally telling. The alleged wise men of the center keep imagining that the problem with Trumpism is just its vulgarity and race-baiting, and that a benevolent technocrat could step in and lead the country out of gridlock and polarization, into the broad, sunlit uplands of reform.Michael Bloomberg sensibly recused himself from this role. But the dream lives on, most recently in the former Politico executive editor Jim VandeHei\u2019s Wall Street Journal op-ed urging the formation of an \u201cInnovation Party,\u201d to be led by our Facebook-Google overlords and our best military minds.VandeHei\u2019s piece was deservedly mocked on political Twitter, but his impatience with the two-party system as we know it is shared across the country\u2019s upper class, from Silicon Valley to the (ahem, Hamiltonian) world of finance.Tellingly, none of these Trump-era enthusiasms involve a reinvigoration of congressional prerogatives or a renewed push for federalism and states\u2019 rights.Quite the reverse: They all imagine that the solution to our problems lies with a more effective and still-more-empowered president, free from antique constitutional limits and graced with a mandate that transcends partisanship.And equally tellingly, they are enthusiasms of the center-left and center-right rather than the ideological extremes. This is obviously true of the people pining for a Bloomberg era, a Silicon Valley-led administration, or a Mattis man-on-horseback presidency. But it\u2019s true of Trump\u2019s constituency as well: While the G.O.P.\u2019s staunch ideologues are mostly voting for Ted Cruz, Trump is winning with Northeastern moderates and blue-collar populists, with voters who may be xenophobic but on many issues are closer to the political middle than to the poles.It\u2019s not that our ideologues are averse to an imperial presidency when their side is in charge. (The theory of Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign assumed a rather \u2026 remarkable level of presidential influence.) But the cult of the presidency is clearly strongest in the American center. This means that political polarization probably isn\u2019t pushing us toward a Weimar moment, in which the only question is whether the far right or far left consolidates a dangerous level of power. Instead it\u2019s encouraging a kind of moderate-middle enthusiasm for crown government, as a means of escape from congressional dysfunction and endless right-left war.The good news for the republic is that this center is itself complex and divided, over specific issues like trade and immigration and then along lines of class and culture. The Bloombergist upper-class moderates fear the Trumpist working-class moderates, and Trump\u2019s middle-American populists loathe the globalist elite right back. As long as that\u2019s the case it\u2019s hard to imagine them finding a centrist Caesar to actually unite behind. (Though they are united in their admiration for the military ...)But even if the risk of a true post-constitutional power grab is low, the arc of our history still bends toward a Trumpian conception of the presidency, which means the limits on its power will probably continue to erode \u2014 justified in the name of pragmatism, of Hamiltonian energy, of the need to \u201cget things done.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll be back, time will tell, you\u2019ll remember that I served you well,\u201d George III sings to his rebellious subjects in \u201cHamilton.\u201dWe still might prove him right.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Physical Therapy, Why Not Cancer Therapy?", "Date": "2016-04-07", "News": "Susan Gubar writes about life with ovarian cancer.In mid-January, after a fall on invisible ice, I was informed by an emergency room doctor that my fractured pelvis would heal in six to eight weeks. To help me recover from the injury, therapists started coming to my house. Their ministrations posed a question that nagged at me: why aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t trained professionals made available to cancer outpatients in the way occupational and physical therapists are routinely assigned to orthopedic patients?  The occupational therapist appeared only a few times, when I was completely incapacitated. With extraordinary tact, she taught me how to unclothe in a narrow bathroom and then positioned me on a bench in the tub where I could use a hand-held shower.Throughout February, my physical therapist, Sherry, rang the doorbell twice a week, entered as she heard me yell \u00e2\u0080\u009cCome in,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and placed a clean pad under the large bag she put on the floor near the blue couch on which I reclined. Out came the equipment she used to check and record my vital signs. The rituals that followed slowly raised my levels of mobility and confidence.  At the beginning, Sherry suggested ankle pumps and a few stretches. She would watch me rise to the walker and shorten its legs or tell me to change my gait. A week later, she had me move to the bedroom to show me the least painful way to get into or out of the bed.  So I could sleep on my side, she propped a pillow between my legs.  Later in February, Sherry taught me the Clamshell: lying on my right side with my knees bent, feet together, I moved my left knee up a few inches. I could feel the muscles strengthening.  In early March, she encouraged me to place my hands on the kitchen counter and raise my strong leg off the floor for 20 seconds in a pose I called the Flamingo. Putting weight on my weak leg gave me the sense that I might meet my goals: to graduate onto a cane, go up and down steps and become a functioning biped again.   Not one comparable sequence of instruction occurred during my eight years of cancer treatments, although I was much more incapacitated and traumatized at the start. Reeling with anxiety back in 2008, I never received any professional assistance at home for wounds, edema, neuropathies, fatigue, weakness, eating disorders, drains, elimination problems, rashes, insomnia, infections, a PICC line, and other complications that were especially shocking during the first year after diagnosis. I relied only on family and friends.  What escalated the injury of cancer for me was the passivity medical protocols produced or required. I was knocked out by anesthesiologists, cut up by surgeons, and infused with chemicals by nurses. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe very word \u00e2\u0080\u0098patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (Latin root, patior, \u00e2\u0080\u0098to suffer\u00e2\u0080\u0099) is a giveaway,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the columnist Max Lerner once explained. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPatients suffer things to be done to them, becoming thereby the acted upon, the diminished.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Cancer patients like me would profit from supportive care aides who could spring us from this induced passivity and its accompanying fear. In my case, such a counselor would have allayed the bewilderment of treatment and also empowered me to exert a modicum of control over the broken rhythms of everyday existence.Perhaps very wealthy people find and hire staff with the requisite expertise, but it never entered my mind. My new oncologist, Dr. Mina, assures me that breast cancer patients do receive physical therapy after mastectomy to prevent lymphedema. After a massive debulking operation for ovarian cancer, however, no physician or nurse ever hinted at the possibility of my obtaining outpatient therapy. Wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t people with prostate or lung, throat or colorectal cancer prefer to receive help at home than go to the emregency room \u2014 a prospect that terrified me? Sherry\u2019s interventions persuade me that therapists could provide cancer patients a multitude of ideas \u00e2\u0080\u0094 on pain management, nutrition options, personal hygiene strategies, psychological and sexual prompts, meditation and massage and workout routines \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to ameliorate the harms cancer and its treatments typically cause. Is this sort of therapy unavailable because insurance companies will not cover it? Or it is unavailable because it brings no profitable returns to hospitals? Yet paid therapists might be less expensive than recurrent E.R. visits as well as the psychic toll exacted by the depression that frequently burdens cancer patients.Why not use the model of the occupational and physical therapist in orthopedics to create a central role for therapists in oncology, advisers who could help cancer patients help themselves in taking small, strengthening steps? After surgery and at the start of chemotherapy, my family and I would have given anything for the house calls of a creature we never imagined:  an oncological therapist.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat a comfort such a person would have been,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said to Sherry after one of our sessions. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAn oncological therapist might have given me what you give me \u2014 a sense of agency.\u00e2\u0080\u009dSherry said she had done extensive training in a host of proficiencies that would be useful for cancer patients, as have many of her peers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPhysical and occupational therapists with all sorts of skills pertinent to cancer treatment abound, but to enlist them, specialists in surgery, radiology, and chemotherapy need to think outside their specialization.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then she added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMaybe the oncologists need to be educated.\u00e2\u0080\u009dRelated:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

Trump and Hillary Clinton work to regain their footing after stinging defeats.\u201cThe shine is off and the Donald\u2019s impermeable Teflon coating has finally been pierced,\u201d said Ryan Williams, a Republican political consultant and former spokesman for Mitt Romney. \u201cThe sheer magnitude of the margin of Trump\u2019s humiliating loss shows that his trail of outrageous comments is finally catching up with him.\u201dAt one point, Mr. Cruz was asked in Spanish about bringing his hard-line message on undocumented immigration to a community of immigrants.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.\u201cOur community, the Hispanic community,\u201d he said, before the reporter asked if he could answer in Spanish. He said he understands the language better than he speaks it.\u201cI have the problem of a second-generation immigrant,\u201d he said, before sprinkling in a bit of Spanish \u2014 closer to \u201cSpanglish,\u201d he allowed \u2014 and addressing the question.\u201cI think the most powerful value in the Hispanic community is the American dream,\u201d he said.He added that the news media often tried \u201cto convey any Republicans as somehow mean and nasty\u201d to the Hispanic community.As Mr. Trump tries to correct course, drama within the campaign could be percolating. Mr. Trump has shrugged off reports of internal strife, but calls to fire his campaign manager, who is facing battery charges, could grow if Mr. Cruz\u2019s team continues to outmaneuver them in the hunt for state delegates across the country. The loss in Wisconsin means that it is increasingly likely that Mr. Trump will need to be ready for a fight at the convention in Cleveland starting on July 18 unless he pulls off a string of big victories in coming states.Exit polls from the primaries and caucuses show which issues and presidential qualities voters value \u2014 or don\u2019t value.Despite his recent gains, Mr. Sanders faces a challenge when it comes to erasing Mrs. Clinton\u2019s lead of more than 200 pledged delegates. Math is not the only concern, however, as increased scrutiny this week appeared to lay bare some gaps in the Vermont senator\u2019s knowledge of policy.In an interview in New York with the The Daily News\u2019s editorial board, Mr. Sanders struggled to explain how he would carry out his Wall Street reform plans, and he was vague when asked about the economic ramifications of thousands of bankers losing their jobs.Mrs. Clinton, who has clashed repeatedly with Mr. Sanders over financial regulation, took notice of her rival\u2019s apparent blunder in an interview with MSNBC on Wednesday and suggested that he was not prepared to be president.\u201cWell, I think he hadn\u2019t done his homework,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cHe\u2019d been talking for more than a year about doing things that he obviously hadn\u2019t really studied or understood, and that does raise a lot of questions.\u201dMatt Flegenheimer contributed reportingAdvertisement"}

Is that cute enough for you?\u201dMr. Lysiak, a former crime reporter for The Daily News, said that his daughter was exposed to journalism through his work and that she was \u201cobsessed\u201d with reporting on vandalism in her neighborhood. In turn, she developed grass-roots sources in the area and gained people\u2019s trust \u2014 which is how she got the scoop about the death on Ninth Street.He said he and his wife were most proud of the way Hilde faced the criticism.\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to get a great scoop, but you\u2019ll find adversity all through your life like that,\u201d said Mr. Lysiak, who \u201clightly\u201d edits her articles and helps edit the headlines.The family lived in Brooklyn before moving in 2014 to Selinsgrove, a Pennsylvania borough of about 5,800 people that is about 50 miles north of Harrisburg. Mr. Lysiak said that Hilde shadowed him on assignments in New York City.\u201cI get it,\u201d Mr. Lysiak said. \u201cI can understand why you are questioning why a 9-year-old is working a crime scene.\u201dBut he said parents today are so concerned about child abductions and other dangers that they become overprotective.Despite some naysayers, Mr. Lysiak said, residents of the area have been overwhelmingly supportive of Hilde, who roams the neighborhood on her bike even in winter.Her admirers extend outside her family. The Selinsgrove Borough Council president, Marvin J. Rudnitsky, said he believed residents appreciated her \u201cefforts.\u201d\u201cOf course, we all smile when she cannot get anywhere near the microphone at the podium at our Borough Council meetings where I preside,\u201d he said in an email. Still, he said, he addresses her as \u201cMs. Lysiak\u201d and takes her questions seriously.Even news media professionals expressed admiration for her work.The family had not heard of the movie until about a year ago, when a friend mentioned it.\u201cHilde loved the character,\u201d her father said.He bought Hilde an old movie poster that she keeps in her room.The girl shrugged off her fame as a reporter turned newsmaker. \u201cI feel I\u2019m getting the attention for my age, not my work,\u201d she said.Over breakfast at an Applebee\u2019s near her home recently, her father tried to assess her feelings about the scrum of media attention. But she was too distracted wondering when the police would call her back about an arrest in a string of vandalism cases she had covered. She had staked out the police station for 45 minutes in the cold.Embracing the reporter\u2019s adage that you are only as good as your last story, Hilde returned the next day from her whirlwind visit to New York City and made a beeline to the station in pursuit, again, of details about the vandalism arrest.She waited an hour and left empty-handed \u2014 this time.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Shuts Out Competitors on Android? Hardly", "Date": "2016-04-27", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtOne of the persistent tragedies of Android, Google\u2019s globe-conquering mobile operating system, is that it continues to be better in theory than in reality.The charges make sense in the abstract. Google makes the world\u2019s most popular mobile operating system, and some of its licenses do compel phone makers to include several Google apps, even if they just want to include the Google Play app store. On paper, that may constitute unfair \u201cbundling,\u201d one of the sins that did in Microsoft at its apex in the late 1990s.Yet the European charges miss the messy reality of life on Android, which is clear to anyone who studies the mobile software business: Android phones come teeming with non-Google apps, often to the point of frustration for users. The search company appears powerless to keep many of them off people\u2019s devices, even when doing so might help its business.Harry First, a law professor at New York University who studies antitrust issues, says the key difficulty for regulators in this case is that the tech world has changed radically since the Microsoft antitrust case. Back then, Microsoft managed to outflank rivals like Netscape by bundling its Internet Explorer browser with its Windows operating system, and by using licenses and payments to prevent computer makers from installing competing browsers.\u201cIn the Microsoft era people were unfamiliar with downloading, and nothing was as effective as getting the browser installed by the O.E.M.s,\u201d he said, using the abbreviation for original equipment makers, or computer manufacturers.\u201cBut now, I\u2019d be surprised if people aren\u2019t fully at ease with downloading things from app stores, and people are familiar with having more than one app on their phone that does the same thing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe E.U. has to tell an exclusion story, but it\u2019s hard for me to see the exclusion story here.\u201dBut Hangouts is clearly no messaging juggernaut. In much of the world, that title belongs to two apps owned by Facebook \u2014 Messenger, which has 800 million active users a month, and WhatsApp, which has more than a billion. (Google has never disclosed the Hangouts user base; analysts I spoke to estimated that its share of the messaging market was in the single digits.)Then there\u2019s the popularity of the main Facebook app. As its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has acknowledged, the company was late to realize the importance of mobile phones; for years, its smartphone app was a slow, kludgy mess, and until just a few years ago it had no mobile revenue to speak of. Google, meanwhile, bundled its own social network, Google Plus, with Android phones.So if you were looking at the market a few years ago through the eyes of an E.U. antitrust regulator, you might have anticipated some trouble for Facebook on Android phones, and you might even have ventured that Google Plus would become a hit. After all, here was a small, late-moving upstart pitted against a bundle-friendly giant that owned the operating system.Of course, that\u2019s not how things turned out. Google Plus is now all but dead. And Facebook did not just survive the shift to mobile phones, it became the unstoppable force in the industry.How did Facebook get so popular on phones? On the whole, it happened the old-fashioned way: People loved Facebook, they had no trouble finding it in mobile app stores, and they began to download and use it. In other words, unlike in the desktop era ruled by Microsoft, Google\u2019s platform dominance on mobile phones does not appear to have posed any hindrance to a competitor\u2019s rise.The E.U.\u2019s objections go beyond the supposed restrictions that Google places on Android\u2019s app ecosystem. Another key charge involves Google\u2019s dominance in web search. Regulators say Google ensures that it remains Android\u2019s dominant search engine both by requiring phone makers to install the Chrome browser on their phones and, in some instances, by paying manufacturers to position the Google Search app on the phone\u2019s home screen.Mr. First, the law professor, said the search issue isn\u2019t as clear-cut as the question of whether Google has restricted rival apps. But he noted that the general flexibility of Android \u2014 the fact that, in general, Google makes it pretty easy for device makers and users to tinker with the software \u2014 cuts in Google\u2019s favor.Mr. First said the interaction was noteworthy: Android easily let him download a rival to Google\u2019s offering, and it even asked him if he wanted to set the rival as a default.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see how the commission could do better than that,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bernie Sanders Courts Black Voters at Church Service in Harlem", "Date": "2016-04-17", "News": "After weeks of hosting packed rallies around New York State, Senator Bernie Sanders on Sunday decided to do something ahead of Tuesday\u2019s primary that his Democratic rival had already been doing for weeks: He spoke at a predominately black church service.Mr. Sanders visited First Corinthian Baptist Church in Harlem to speak with the Rev. Michael A. Walrond Jr. about his past civil rights work, the need to reform the criminal justice system and his experience growing up in a family fraught with financial stress. And while he was visiting the church, the Sanders campaign also began a new fund-raising pitch using comments from the actor George Clooney, who raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for Hillary Clinton over the weekend, that the amount of money in politics is \u00e2\u0080\u009cobscene.\u201d The moves came just two days before New York\u00e2\u0080\u0099s primary, a contest that Mr. Sanders has said is crucial to his campaign and that he is counting on to help him overcome Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s large lead in pledged delegates.At First Corinthian Baptist Church, Mr. Sanders asked voters that they not only vote for him but encourage others to do the same. On stage, Mr. Walrond asked Mr. Sanders a series of questions about why he remained in the race and why he got involved in politics in the first place. Mr. Sanders told the church members that he learned important economic lessons from watching his parents argue over not having enough money. He also said he was moved to protest segregation as a college student because he was interested in social justice.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am running for president because it is just too late for establishment politics and establishment economics,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said, repeating a line he uses often in his stump speeches. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need a candidate now who has the track record, the agenda, and the guts to stand up to the billionaire class.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Sanders added that he believes many of the goals of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. remain unrealized and pointed out that black people continue to be underpaid without access to affordable housing and proper health care. He also said he learned about racial profiling by talking to people who regularly experienced being \u00e2\u0080\u009charassed\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cintimidated\u00e2\u0080\u009d by police officers.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI learned from Black Lives Matter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said to applause. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat I learned is how police in white communities are regarded very differently than police in black communities.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMrs. Clinton and former President Bill Clinton have visited several churches during the New York primary season, likely shoring up their base. Some of the churches the Clintons visited  include Christian Cultural Center in East New York, Brown Memorial Baptist Church in Clinton Hill, Mt. Pisgah Baptist Church in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem and Greater Allen A.M.E. Cathedral in Jamaica, Queens.Meanwhile, the Sanders campaign sent out an email to supporters asking for donations and quoting comments Mr. Clooney made to NBC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cMeet The Press.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The actor helped lead an event in San Francisco to raise money for the Hillary Victory Fund on Friday night. For seats at the round-table dinner with Mr. Clooney, his wife, Amal, and Mrs. Clinton, a couple had to pay or raise $353,400, the network reported.When asked about Mr. Sanders\u2019s criticism of the event, Mr. Clooney said he agreed with the senator. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes. I think it\u2019s an obscene amount of money,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Clooney said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Sanders campaign, when they talk about it is absolutely right. It\u2019s ridiculous that we should have this kind of money in politics. I agree completely.\u201dAs the Sanders campaign collected donations from the actor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words, Mr. Sanders visited Brooklyn Bridge Park on Sunday afternoon. He walked around shaking hands, hugging babies, and asking for support. As he made the rounds, several people shouted \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood luck,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe love you.\u00e2\u0080\u009dSmiling, Mr. Sanders said he enjoyed meeting people face to face. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s getting close to people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.As the Vermont senator was leaving, one man happily shouted to him, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a beautiful day.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Sanders quickly responded, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s make Tuesday a beautiful day, too.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

Instead her team scours the Internet for interesting TED talks, newscasters, retiring ambassadors, professors and others who have the expertise, presentation skills and people skills the cruise lines look for.More than just offering a few lectures, speakers now are told to be ready for a diverse and well-read audience that wants to interact beyond the podium.Speakers unwilling to spend extra time with a guest who wants to socialize day or night won\u2019t last long. \u201cAs soon as you step out of your stateroom, you are in the public eye,\u201d Ms. Flager said.Kiki Hellman, who runs a biomedical consulting business in Clarksburg, Md., with her husband, Alfred Hellman, have taken about 60 cruises over the last 30 years to destinations on every continent. Passengers, Dr. Hellman said, are now more knowledgeable than ever about history, anthropology and archaeology \u2014 and expect more from lecturers.\u201cThey can get some very esoteric questions from the audience,\u201d she said.New technology also places more demands on speakers. Lectures may be streamed to tablets or rebroadcast multiple times on the ship, so visual elements must be strong and the speakers\u2019 presentation must translate well to broadcasting.\u201cPassengers can walk out of my lecture or turn off the TV at any moment,\u201d said John Rennie Short, a cruise lecturer on trips to destinations like Myanmar, \u201cso it better be good.\u201dSome passengers use their smartphones to fact-check a speaker if they think they hear something that seems amiss during a talk.While lecturers were encouraged in the past to socialize a bit with the guests, now it is required, said Douglas Gray, a Manhattan-based consultant. Passengers, he said, want authentic engagement with everyone on board, and that desire for accessibility and openness means that lecturers \u201cstay after the talk and hang out with the participants.\u201d\u201cThey exchange stories and experiences,\u201d Mr. Gray said.Dr. Hellman said that getting to know the speakers was one of her favorite activities on a ship. She prefers cruises with smaller passenger lists, preferably with just a few hundred, so she can spend time with the experts.\u201cThere are so many ways to interact with them over a meal or tea,\u201d she said. She and her husband have even invited speakers to meet them for ballroom dancing in the evening.Dr. Sandy Greer of Spokane, Wash., has taken cruises to Hawaii, Alaska and Mexico. He says he enjoys it most when the speaker \u201cfeels like another passenger, a member of our group.\u201dSocial media has changed the nature of the speaker\u2019s job in another way, Ms. Flager said. The ubiquity of vacation selfies posted to Facebook and Instagram translates to a need for a camera-ready guest lecturer.\u201cTheir ratings often come down to 50 percent content and 50 percent social skills,\u201d Ms. Flager said.While motivational speeches and financial talks have dwindled in popularity over the last five years, demand for anything related to the ship\u2019s destination, whether it\u2019s archaeology, geology, history, politics or culture, has grown, said Tim Castle, who runs a small agency for lecturers in New York and works with luxury cruise lines. The New York Times is among the companies that have worked with cruise lines to offer trips featuring journalists or other specialists as featured speakers.Ms. Flager said today\u2019s traveler considered knowledge of the destination essential to enhance the trip ashore.And the requirements may become even more demanding soon, said Paul DiFilippi, director of enrichment programs at Sixth Star, which provides programs for cruise ships.\u201cCruise lines departing from new ports like China and Brazil have now started asking us for bilingual lecturers and native speakers,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

The senators, Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, and Jerry Moran, Republican of Kansas, share little ideological turf.

This bipartisan legislation would allow Americans to utilize a rare moment of financial flexibility that accompanies a tax refund to plan for the future.\u201d The senators\u2019 proposal would allow the 80 percent of American taxpayers who are due a refund each year to defer receiving up to 20 percent of that money until six months after their initial refund is approved.

{"Headline": "A Consequential Week Comes to an End, and Rifts Endure", "Date": "2016-04-08", "News": "What was one of the most consequential weeks in the presidential primaries is finally winding down, after a series of wins, losses and skirmishes that could make it more difficult to put the political parties back together. On the Democratic side, it was one of the nastiest weeks to date, as Hillary Clinton, back in New York where she served as senator for eight years, strongly implied that Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, her rival for the nomination, was not qualified for the presidency. Mr. Sanders responded with a searing attack of his own about Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s qualifications. Then, on Thursday, Bill Clinton erupted at Black Lives Matter activists while campaigning for his wife in Pennsylvania, as he defended not just his wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s record, but his own from the 1990s. Mr. Clinton also defended his wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s use of the phrase \u00e2\u0080\u009csuper-predators\u00e2\u0080\u009d during the 1990s, when crime was rampant. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how you would characterize the gang leaders who got 13-year-old kids hopped up on crack, and sent them out in the streets to murder other African-American children,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Clinton said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMaybe you thought they were good citizens \u00e2\u0080\u0094 she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBy the evening, both the Sanders and Clinton teams appeared conscious of trying to tamp down their fight.

{"Headline": "How to Switch to iPhone From Android: Patience and Persistence", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported byGadgetwiseThe iPhone has obviously come a long way since then. It can now be used on any carrier. Its voice and data quality are stellar. Some of its built-in apps, such as Apple Pay, are best in class. There are 1.5 million apps created by outside developers.I have finally caved in: My phone is now an iPhone.Faced with slowing sales growth, Apple is counting on millions of people like me to give up their Android phones, which can be bought new for as little as $30 in some countries, to purchase iPhones, which cost $400 or more.\u201cWe were blown away by the level of Android switchers that we had last quarter,\u201d Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, told Wall Street in January. \u201cWe see that as a huge opportunity.\u201dAs someone who has since 2010 used high-end phones based on Google\u2019s Android operating system, I have experienced a rocky transition, like moving to a faraway city. The landmarks are unfamiliar, the customs are different, and I miss my old haunts even as I explore new ones.Switching phone operating systems should in theory be simple. First you transfer your data from the old phone to the new one. Then you reinstall your favorite apps. Finally you customize the settings for features like ring tones and notifications and learn the quirks of your new device.But as I learned, many things can go wrong, and my experience is not unusual.\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to go through the things that are most valuable to you and make sure it\u2019s all there,\u201d said Jonathan S. Geller, editor in chief of BGR, a tech news site that reviews phones and writes frequently about switching. \u201cFor a normal consumer, it\u2019s reasonably frustrating.\u201dHere\u2019s what happened when I switched:A lot of contacts and photos never made it through. It was as if a moving company had lost half my stuff during a cross-country haul.Apple later told me that I could have called a toll-free number for help, gone to an Apple store or erased everything and started over. The company lent me another iPhone 6S to try the Move to iOS app again \u2014 and this time it did transfer my data. But it failed to do the other half of the job: download the Apple versions of my Android apps to the new iPhone.The most fundamental difference between iPhones and Androids is the level of conformity dictated by each company. This is where personal preferences play a big role in customer satisfaction.Apple exercises great control over the look, feel and features of iPhones to deliver its idealized version of what it thinks people want. Android is free-form and adaptable \u2014 so much so that the look and feel can vary widely from one phone maker to the next, especially in Asia.One consequence of Apple\u2019s approach is that the iPhone is more stable. Every Android phone I have ever used has suffered mysterious hardware and software problems like random reboots and crashing apps. These happen much more rarely in iOS.But Apple\u2019s control has its downsides. The company makes its apps the permanent default options for common services like maps, web browsing and email.In my case, I have a Windows laptop; my employer, The New York Times, uses Google\u2019s enterprise apps; and I depend on Google\u2019s search technology to find airline tickets, email addresses and old photos stored in my various digital pockets. My life is deeply enmeshed in the Google ecosystem.To make my iPhone more familiar and my data easier to find, I put my favorite Google apps on my home screen and mostly use them instead of Apple\u2019s apps. Google has knitted its iPhone apps together so that Gmail uses Google\u2019s browser, Chrome, when you click on a link in an email, and Google\u2019s calendar uses Google Maps when you click on an address.Given the headaches of switching, most people avoid it.Michael R. Levin, partner and co-founder of Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, which surveys smartphone users in the United States, said only about one out of five people activating a new iPhone or Android was switching from the other platform. \u201cIn the past two years, the loyalty and switching rates have gotten very, very set,\u201d he said.Over all, I am getting more comfortable with my iPhone. I like Apple\u2019s fingerprint reader and have finally figured out how to align my fingertips precisely enough to unlock the phone (at least most of the time).Will the iPhone ever feel like home? Check back in two years, when I am due for my next upgrade.An article on the Personal Tech pages on Thursday about switching to an iPhone from an Android device misstated the content of a Google web page. It has tips for those switching from an Apple iPhone, not to it.Advertisement"}

Other bidders included the private equity firm TPG.A special committee of Yahoo\u2019s board is now expected to sort through the preliminary offers to decide which to pursue. The company did disclose that it paid its outside advisers $9 million during the quarter.Ms. Mayer hinted that Yahoo would prefer a buyer like Verizon that could achieve \u201cstrategic synergies,\u201d as opposed to a purely financial buyer like a private equity firm.Yahoo, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., said revenue fell 11 percent to $1.09 billion, and its net loss was $99 million, or 10 cents a share, in contrast to revenue of $1.23 billion and net income of $21 million, or 2 cents a share, in the same quarter a year ago.After deducting payments Yahoo made to advertising partners for traffic, its revenue exceeded Wall Street\u2019s expectations. Profits after adjusting for certain items also narrowly beat projections, although shareholders are much more focused on the potential sale of the company than quarterly financial results.Yahoo shares were up slightly in early after-hours trading.Analysts were unimpressed with the results, but said that the company\u2019s exact financial results did not matter.As Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research, put it in a note to clients, there was \u201crelatively little commentary on the transaction news that so many are waiting on, and relatively more commentary on the current state of the business and management\u2019s plans, which likely won\u2019t matter for very long.\u201dYahoo, a leading content portal in the early days of the web, missed the shift to mobile devices and has been struggling to compete against Google, Facebook and specialty apps for advertising dollars and user loyalty.Ms. Mayer, Yahoo\u2019s chief executive since 2012, has failed to turn around the company. Restive shareholders are pressing the board to sell the Internet businesses and unlock Yahoo\u2019s large stakes in Alibaba, a Chinese e-commerce company, and Yahoo Japan, an independently traded company.Together, those two investments have a face value of about $40 billion \u2014 more than the $35 billion stock market value of all of Yahoo, based on Tuesday\u2019s stock prices.While the sales process has advanced, Yahoo\u2019s management team, led by Ms. Mayer, has continued to run the business as if nothing were going to change. Yahoo said it again increased mobile revenue in the quarter, but declines in search and display advertising revenue more than offset that growth.Yahoo noted that it ended the quarter with 9,400 employees, down 21 percent from the previous year, as it eliminated many of its digital magazines, closed overseas offices and made cuts in other parts of the business.Kenneth Goldman, Yahoo\u2019s chief financial officer, said the company was continuing to explore the sale of real estate.Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said, \u201cThis was same old, same old at Yahoo,\u201d adding, \u201cThe overall trends remained relatively soft.\u201dJeffrey Smith, the chief executive of the Starboard Value hedge fund, said on Tuesday that he intended to keep the pressure on Yahoo. Starboard has proposed an alternative slate of nine directors to replace Yahoo\u2019s entire board at the company\u2019s next annual shareholder meeting, expected in June or July.\u201cIf we get to the end, and they haven\u2019t been successful as it relates to getting the company sold \u2014 the core business sold \u2014 well, we\u2019re going to need to pick up the pieces,\u201d he said.Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Disrupted,\u2019 by Dan Lyons", "Date": "2016-04-08", "News": "Supported byWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Dan Lyons is the last journalist who should have been surprised when he became yet another casualty in the war on old-media workers. A longtime tech writer (he began writing for PC Week in the 1980s, before the field became sexy), he was the technology editor at Newsweek in 2012 when he was \u201cunceremoniously dumped\u201d (would \u201cceremoniously dumped\u201d have been better?) and at the age of 52 became what a story about the recession in his own magazine the previous year called a \u201cbeached white male.\u201d When Lyons started his job four years earlier, Newsweek employees were already being offered buyouts; how could he not have seen what was coming? But he is also the last journalist who should have been leveled by the blow, since he had already shown himself to be enviably resourceful: In 2006, while he was the technology reporter at Forbes, he started a wicked, at first anonymous blog called The Secret Diary of Steve Jobs, in which, writing as Fake Steve, he portrayed the real Jobs as a constellation of personality disorders and satirized everyone of note in Silicon Valley. He turned the blog into a novel and also got a TV deal out of it. And though the show was never produced, he developed some pretty sweet Hollywood connections \u2014 the superagent Ari Emanuel and Larry Charles, of \u201cSeinfeld\u201d and \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d fame.\u201cDisrupted\u201d is born of Lyons\u2019s attempt to cross over from covering tech to getting a piece of the action in the second, current Internet bubble. He lucks out to a degree that is enviable, not because of his payday (he never tells us his salary, and his stock-option payout isn\u2019t grand), but because the company he ends up working for, HubSpot, a marketing-software firm in Cambridge, Mass., is tailor-made for someone like him to write about, not as Fake Steve but as Real Dan. HubSpot embodies everything that\u2019s ridiculous about the culture of start-ups, and in the bargain it reinforces every paranoid worry Lyons has about his age: As he learned from the beached-white-male piece, \u201cin the new economy, age 50 was the new 65.\u201dIf I were not able to confirm the existence of HubSpot on the web, I might think Lyons had invented it. The place is, to use Lyons\u2019s references, a hash of Orwellian doublespeak, the movie \u201cOffice Space\u201d and Scientology. HubSpot blasts its customers with what normal people call spam but they call \u201clovable marketing content.\u201d It wants to put its customers into a state of \u201cdelightion.\u201d Employees are entitled to unlimited free food and unlimited vacation time. There\u2019s a wall of candy. One of the founders of the company brings a teddy bear to meetings so that the idea of \u201cthe customer\u201d they are determined to delight is less abstract. And then there\u2019s the unnerving, unreal reality that HubSpot shares with a number of other Internet companies: Although it has a valuation of around $2 billion, it has never made a profit. Unfortunately, Lyons isn\u2019t able to get beyond the obvious ridiculousnesses. The young people who work at HubSpot \u2014 they\u2019re so horribly, horribly young \u2014 are indistinguishable aliens to Lyons, and incapable, he says, of appreciating irony or sarcasm, or him.None of this will be new to anyone who read even a couple of pieces about the first Internet bubble. The Ping-Pong \u00adtables, the snacks, the beanbag chairs \u2014 it\u2019s all very familiar. Lyons doesn\u2019t get below the surface of the place, or get to know anyone; connection and insight don\u2019t seem to be his strengths. It\u2019s not all his fault: After being hired as a \u201cmarketing fellow,\u201d he is essentially ignored, and has nothing useful to do, and no one listens to his ideas. Naturally, he hates HubSpot almost instantly, gets into power struggles with co-workers and posts trouble-courting comments on Facebook. The disrupted is now a disrupter. You can\u2019t blame him for what seems to be a kind of termination wish \u2014 HubSpot is clearly a crazy-\u00admaking company. One of the founders promulgates a corporate \u201cculture code\u201d called Heart, an acronym of five deadening words: humble, effective, adaptable, remarkable, transparent. At the same time, when employees are fired it is said they are \u201cgraduated,\u201d and their names are never mentioned again.Lyons\u2019s book derails about three-\u00adquarters of the way through, as he becomes obsessed with the unpredictable behavior of one of his co-workers, a fellow he calls Trotsky, toward him. (Almost everyone in the book has been given a mildly clever pseudonym.) The reader can\u2019t make sense of their relationship either, and soon stops caring enough to try. What carries the book through to the end are two twists: One is that Lyons is summoned to Hollywood again, to write for the HBO comedy \u201cSilicon Valley,\u201d for a few months (while he\u2019s still at HubSpot); the other is that once Lyons leaves HubSpot and writes this book, the company\u2019s chief marketing officer is caught trying to procure the manuscript before it\u2019s published, and is fired for his enterprising efforts.That is, of course, a gift to Lyons, but he disingenuously professes shock over the news: \u201cWhy would anyone go to such lengths to get hold of a memoir whose essential purpose was to entertain?\u201d (Oh, perhaps because people don\u2019t find it very entertaining to be depicted as charlatans.) Such faux na\u00efvet\u00e9 is unbecoming in someone as savvy as Lyons is, and makes him seem, in the end, an unreliable narrator of his own story.Nancy Franklin was the television critic of The New Yorker from 1998 to 2011.Advertisement"}

Seidman.The center includes a preschool (\u00e2\u0080\u009cfor more info, call Shula,\u00e2\u0080\u009d reads a sign out front) and a \u00e2\u0080\u009cModel Matzah Bakery\u00e2\u0080\u009d that serves about 2,000 children, according to an administrator, while teaching them about Passover.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe experience of the exodus of Egypt is felt in a very real, exciting and educational way,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the center\u00e2\u0080\u0099s website says.Mr. Cruz arrived around 4:35 p.m., walking upstairs to the bakery, where about a dozen children and several adults from the Hasidic Jewish community waited. The room included a painting of the Egyptian pyramids, a m\u00c3\u00a9lange of wooden blocks on the floor, a collection of fish-themed balloons and two New York City police officers standing guard.Two stations were assembled, labeled \u00e2\u0080\u009cflour\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cwater,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as an adult kneaded the dough.The children, mostly 3 and 4 years old, wore paper chef\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hats. One of the hosts wore a \u00e2\u0080\u009cDanger: Men Cooking\u00e2\u0080\u009d apron.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow do we make matzo?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Leah Winner, the youth program director, asked the youngsters. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe just get some cheese and some ketchup?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cNOOO,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they replied in unison, and soon a \u00e2\u0080\u009cwater and flour!\u00e2\u0080\u009d chant filled the room.Entering the bakery, Mr. Cruz stopped to pose for a few pictures. The adults led a chant of \u00e2\u0080\u009croll, roll, roll your matzo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as the group migrated to the dough table and fetched rollers.Mr. Cruz was asked if this was his first matzo-making outing.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.Would he like a matzo-making hat?\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll pass on the hat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a basic rule of politics: Be careful with hats.\u00e2\u0080\u009d (He used equivalent logic in declining to wear a cheesehead in Wisconsin on Monday.)Would he like dark or light matzo?\u00e2\u0080\u009cAhhhhh, surprise me.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAn administrator asked if the children were excited to see Mr. Cruz. There was mostly silence \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and an intense focus on rolling.\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou guys are doing a great job,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cruz said.Mr. Cruz was asked if he would like to have holes in his matzo. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would like to have holes in my matzo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.Then came another chant: \u00e2\u0080\u009cMake, make, make the holes.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Cruz, in a light blue tie and cowboy boots, lowered his head a bit, joining the children around the table.\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo how old is everybody?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThree!\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThree!\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cOver three!\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cEveryone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s three!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cruz said. A child chimed in to correct him. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re four?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cruz asked. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re four. Three and four. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re four? You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re five?\u00e2\u0080\u009dOne child said he was 13, unconvincingly.With ages established, Mr. Cruz asked the children to name their favorite thing about Passover.\u00e2\u0080\u009cMaror!\u00e2\u0080\u009d a boy replied, naming the bitter herbs eaten at a Seder.\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are going to have an interesting life,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cruz said, to the laughter of adults. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are attracted to the more difficult things in life.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a man nearby told him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is my son.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u201cThis is a young man who doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t shy away from a challenge,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cruz said.The father surmised that his son could run for president one day. Mr. Cruz did not reply; it was not clear that he heard.As the girl to his left worked the dough, Mr. Cruz observed that the piece had many holes.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is a lot of holes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cruz said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hole-y matzo. There we go!\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe joke killed in this room.Mr. Cruz went on to say he had been \u00e2\u0080\u009cprivileged to be at many a Seder table,\u00e2\u0080\u009d recalling an encounter last year with a Holocaust survivor.Someone remarked on the fish balloons.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fabulous,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cruz said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got fish, like, flying in the air.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThen Mr. Cruz grabbed a pizza-peel-style utensil and lifted the dough toward an oven in the corner of the room. He asked about the differences between this oven and a pizza oven, and began discussing Passover with some of his hosts.\u00e2\u0080\u009cNext year in Jerusalem,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cruz said at one point, uttering the phrase that comes at the conclusion of a Seder. He was told that, because Passover had not yet come, the appropriate phrase would be \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis year in Jerusalem\u00e2\u0080\u009d at this stage.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, next year in Jerusalem,\u201d he said, \u201chopefully I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need a bigger plane to get there.\u201dMr. Cruz was asked if he consulted often with any particular rabbi or other counselor on the Jewish faith.\u201cNick!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, calling over an aide, Nick Muzin, who he said advised him often on the subject.A short while later, the matzo was ready, and the attendees gathered for a picture.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat camera are we looking at?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cruz asked. This never became entirely clear.But soon, a tune broke out: \u00e2\u0080\u009cDayenu,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a Passover song that translates to \u00e2\u0080\u009cit would have been enough.\u00e2\u0080\u009dDay-day-enu, day-day-enu, day-day-enu, dayenu, dayenu!Mr. Cruz joined in, a bit uneasily, for a few syllables at a time.\u201cMany blessings, and thank you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cruz said, as an aide signaled it was time to leave.Removing her chef\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hat, Ms. Winner said it had been \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery important\u00e2\u0080\u009d for a presidential candidate like Mr. Cruz to have taken in the scene.She was asked if he seemed familiar with Jewish traditions. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSomewhat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to lie. Somewhat.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAs Mr. Cruz reached the door, flanked by a phalanx of staff members and photographers, another host was less equivocal.\u00e2\u0080\u009cDefinitely good for the Jews!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he shouted, and the senator stepped out again onto Ocean Parkway.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Tempest in a Toilet", "Date": "2016-04-23", "News": "Supported byOUT of the potty mouths of billionaires sometimes comes potty sense. This was the case last week with Donald Trump, who weighed in on which bathrooms transgender people should use.His answer: the ones they want. He assumed, correctly, that this is what many had been doing all along. He noted, accurately, that it hadn\u2019t ushered in the apocalypse.The pee-peeved plutocrat took a gentler tack when asked on Thursday morning where Caitlyn Jenner should find relief in Trump Tower. Up to her, he said. No need for a fuss.No need indeed. The notion that we should prevent transgender people from using bathrooms that match their gender identity \u2014 and that allowing them to do so would imperil children \u2014 is a tempest in a toilet, one of the more ludicrous political causes to gain currency in a while.The Cruz campaign released an ad with shadowy footage of bathroom stalls, sinister music and dire warnings, printed in large letters, about how vulnerable \u201cyour daughter\u201d and \u201cyour wife\u201d would be if Trump\u2019s perspective held sway. \u201cIt\u2019s not appropriate,\u201d said words that flashed on the screen. \u201cIt\u2019s not safe. It\u2019s PC nonsense that\u2019s destroying America.\u201dI\u2019m guessing that Cruz hasn\u2019t met or read much about transgender people. \u201cGrown adult men\u201d is precisely how many transgender men appear \u2014 with beards, muscles, pants \u2014 and exactly how they\u2019d look to little girls in the women\u2019s rooms that the North Carolina law would command them to use.And such legislation tells someone who may well wear a dress to march into the men\u2019s room if her birth certificate said male. That\u2019s a greater invitation to potty pandemonium than letting people make their own calls when nature calls and turn in the direction consistent with the way they conduct the rest of their lives.How would these potty prohibitions be enforced, anyway? What species of sentry or manner of inquisition would assess the external and internal anatomy of the bathroom-bound? Shall we divert government spending to this? We skimp on money to repair America\u2019s infrastructure, but let\u2019s find funds to patrol America\u2019s lavatories.Cruz, Schilling and many others are obsessed with \u2014 or cynically exploiting \u2014 the hallucinated scenario of male sexual predators suddenly feeling emboldened to stalk little girls in public bathrooms, presumably because they could, if caught, claim that they identify as women and belong there.Besides which, child molesters aren\u2019t famously expert at impulse control: I doubt that they\u2019re raptly watching CNN and patiently awaiting some legislative green light to hunt for female victims by the toilets in public parks. They\u2019re hunting already, and as everything from \u201cSpotlight\u201d to the Denny Hastert case has shown us, the grounds aren\u2019t always the ones you expect, nor are the hunters.If parents want to get worked up about threats to their children\u2019s welfare and future, how about a more concerted and constructive look at the failings of schools? Or at the lures of sexting? Or at the injuries in contact sports? Or at the junk in children\u2019s diets? Or at the lead in some cities\u2019 water?The list is endless, because there\u2019s plenty standing between America\u2019s children and safety. It\u2019s seldom if ever a man in a dress in a stall at the highway rest stop.AND there are plenty of more relevant reasons to avoid such a rest stop: its dubious cleanliness, its unbecoming bouquet, the open question of whether anyone\u2019s bothered to stock it with toilet paper. These rest stops weren\u2019t pristine idylls before this debate about which ones transgender people should use, and transgender people were present all along. No cataclysm occurred. That was Trump\u2019s point.It won\u2019t be a view that he routinely volunteers or presses with any force. He made that clear on Fox News on Thursday night, in an interview with Sean Hannity, who returned to the issue. Trump said that it wasn\u2019t a federal concern and was best left to states. But he didn\u2019t take back his earlier assertion that in his opinion, the State of North Carolina had erred.I understand the anxiety that many Americans feel. I get their confusion. I\u2019m not immune to it myself.Less than a year ago, one of the most celebrated Olympians in the history of men\u2019s sports appeared on the cover of Vanity Fair magazine in a corset, with an altered physical appearance and a new, feminized first name. She pressed the accelerator on a public discussion and education that were stuck in a low gear. Now we\u2019re zooming forward fast.But the right response to any sense of dislocation isn\u2019t the invention of threats that don\u2019t exist and vilification of people who\u2019ve done nothing to warrant it. Politicians who promote that are opportunists. Politicians who indulge it are cowards.Let\u2019s navigate these waters calmly. Let\u2019s flush away the nonsense.Let\u2019s listen to Trump. I write that sentence abashedly, and with no expectation of repeating it much.Advertisement"}

Garland, a Justice Department official preparing to prosecute the culprits of what was then the worst domestic terror attack in United States history, visited shortly after, as bodies were still being recovered. It was the beginning of what would become a defining moment in his legal career.On Wednesday, almost 21 years to the day since those grim trips to Oklahoma City, their paths crossed again as Judge Garland, now chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, sat down with Mr. Inhofe and Senator James Lankford, Oklahoma\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current senators, to discuss his Supreme Court nomination.While White House officials had certainly hoped that the meeting could highlight the pinnacle of Judge Garland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time in the public eye, Mr. Inhofe and Mr. Lankford made it clear that they opposed his nomination to replace Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Senate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s constitutional role of \u00e2\u0080\u0098advice and consent\u00e2\u0080\u0099 includes the ability to choose the right time and determine if the nominee is the right person,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they said in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell before the president nominated Judge Garland, the majority of the members of the Senate determined that a presidential election year is not the right time to start a nomination process for the Supreme Court.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn an unusual joint meeting that lasted almost 55 minutes, Mr. Inhofe and Mr. Lankford said they thanked Judge Garland for what he did for their state during a painful time.\u00e2\u0080\u009cDuring our time with Judge Garland, we extended Oklahoma\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gratitude for the many weeks he spent in our state working for justice for those who lost loved ones from the Oklahoma City bombing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they said.Senate Democrats seized on last week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing to draw attention to Judge Garland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stalled nomination, even holding a news conference on the Supreme Court steps with two of his fellow prosecutors. Mr. Lankford, who lives near Oklahoma City, criticized them for politicizing the tragedy.Mr. Inhofe said he was one of the first senators Judge Garland called after President Obama announced his nomination.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think a lot of him, so, of course, I took his call. He said, would I meet with him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Inhofe said in an interview. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI said, yeah, but you have to understand, there is absolutely no scenario by which I would participate in a confirmation. And he said, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fine.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Inhofe does not shy away from the fact that he was one of seven current Republican senators who voted to confirm Judge Garland to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in 1997. And 23 Republicans voted against him then, he added Wednesday.But he said the fact that it was a presidential election year outweighed the factors that had once prompted him to support Judge Garland.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Bernie Sanders\u2019s Big Win: Tickets to \u2018Hamilton\u2019", "Date": "2016-04-09", "News": "Bernie Sanders snagged tickets Friday to one of the hottest Broadway shows in town, and of course, it featured a political revolution.The senator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign staff requested the tickets and had been working for several months to figure out a date for him to see the show, according to Sam Rudy, a spokesman for \u201cHamilton.\u201d Hillary Clinton saw the show  last year, when it was Off Broadway, Mr. Rudy said.Just before Mr. Sanders entered  the theater, people outside spotted him walking along the sidewalk and cheered.Abigail Kass, a 20-year-old sophomore at Boston University who got tickets for her birthday, said people inside the theater instantly went wild when they saw Mr. Sanders joining the audience a few minutes before the start of the show. Several people leaned over to gawk at Mr. Sanders as he sat in middle orchestra seats. At one point he received a standing ovation just before the show began, with some people shouting \u00e2\u0080\u009cBernie! Bernie! Bernie!\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was sitting in the upper orchestra and all of a sudden I saw people standing and freaking out and at first I thought the show was starting early,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Kass said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut then I heard someone whisper \u2018Bernie,\u2019 and I looked down and there was this crowd of people. And I could see the top of his head, which is very recognizable, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Bernie Sanders.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMs. Kass, who plans to vote for Mr. Sanders in the Kentucky primary, said that during intermission she made her way to the senator for a selfie  with Mr. Sanders, who was posing for pictures, chatting and shaking people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hands.Ms. Sanders bought a compact disc of the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s music during the break, as word spread on Twitter that he and his wife were there. Soon, a small crowd gathered outside,  waiting to catch a glimpse of Mr. Sanders leaving the theater.Garrett Chalk, 16, a high school sophomore from Dallas who was visiting the city for his birthday with family, heard about Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s whereabouts on Twitter.  He quickly ran over to the theater from his hotel. Just before 11 p.m., Mr. Chalk stood grinning as police officers asked people to make room for people exiting the theater.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m so excited, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m shaking,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the teenager said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI get to meet a candidate who hopefully will be the president at the end of 2016.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAfter the show ended, Mr. Sanders went on stage and took pictures with the play\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actors. He then came out of the building, where a few dozen people stood cheering his name. The senator quickly got into a waiting motorcade and waved to people on the sidewalk as his car sped off.Ilana Yonas, a 36-year-old professor who lives in Memphis, came to the show with her sister, Sharon Graetz, a 30-year-old education director at a synagogue who lives in Atlanta. Both voted for Mr. Sanders during their states\u2019 elections and beamed late night Friday as they described seeing Mr. Sanders at the show.Ms. Graetz said that despite  the Secret Service surrounding Mr. Sanders for much of the show, she managed to accidentally bump into the senator. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was just in the bathroom and I was coming out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI ran into him.

{"Headline": "For Families in Flint, a Daily Struggle to Avoid Tap Water", "Date": "2016-04-04", "News": "FLINT, Mich. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Shanice Ollie is 18 weeks pregnant with her third child, so she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not taking any chances. No matter what city health officials say, she will not drink, cook, do dishes or wash with \u00e2\u0080\u009clead water,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which is how people here now refer to the tap water delivered to their homes.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re saying it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s O.K. to shower in it, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fine for dishwashing and clothes, but I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Ollie, 31, motioning toward her cluttered kitchen, where cases of bottled water were stacked by the counter and three gargantuan garbage bags were overflowing with empty bottles for recycling. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey knew for a whole year and didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do anything about it. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t risk it.\u00e2\u0080\u009dLocal fire stations stock the water, but residents have to pick it up and cart it home every day or every other day. Families go through prodigious amounts of bottled water: A family of four can easily use up a case of 40 half-liter (16.9-fluid-ounce) bottles in a 24-hour-period \u00e2\u0080\u0094 just for drinking and cooking. While health officials say the water is safe for bathing, laundry and dishwashing, many families don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t trust the advice.Mrs. Ollie has trained her sons, 6-year-old Kingston and 4-year-old Jase, to take sponge baths using microwaved bottled water \u00e2\u0080\u0094 no more playing in the tub. They must also use bottled water to brush their teeth. After dinner, she uncaps and empties dozens of pint-size bottles of water into a large pot that she heats on the stove to wash dishes. On weekends, she and her husband drive the kids and all the laundry to Mrs. Ollie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s parents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 home in Lansing, Mich., to shower and wash up.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like living in a third-world country, right here in America,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Ollie said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m very angry. But what can you do? You have to keep living your life,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added as she rinsed out the blender used to make smoothies for breakfast. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere goes three bottles of water right there.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAnd then last fall, health department officials told residents to stop drinking the city tap water because it contained high levels of lead, a neurotoxin that can take a devastating toll on overall health and cognition.Health officials are urging parents to test their children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blood-lead levels and beef up their diet with foods rich in calcium, iron and vitamin C, which may blunt the body\u00e2\u0080\u0099s absorption of lead. But blood tests measure only lead exposure within the last 30 days, not the body burden of lead that has already settled in bones, soft tissue and the brain, said Dr. Carl R. Baum, a professor of pediatrics at Yale School of Medicine who is an expert on lead exposure.Doctors have little advice about how to reduce the harm already done: There is no way to reverse the effects of lead, which affects every organ system. Children under the age of 6 are thought to be most vulnerable, Dr. Baum said.Dr. Jeanne Conry, an obstetrician and gynecologist who is an expert on environmental exposures during pregnancy, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur guidelines weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t written for this level of exposure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d With so many unknowns, researchers are eager to study Flint, she added.Christina and Adam Murphy, who have five children between them, including a newborn, learned their water was heavily contaminated with lead after one of their dogs got sick and another dog gave birth to a stillborn puppy.Tests on the water in their home revealed lead levels of thousands of parts per billion, way over the allowable limit of 15 parts per billion, and now they are worried about the effects on everyone in the family. A son from Mr. Murphy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s previous marriage was recently diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome, and the couple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 3-year-old daughter has been irritable lately. An older daughter has been having severe abdominal pain, which can also be caused by lead, while another son is having difficulties at school for the first time.And Mrs. Murphy, like many parents in this area, spends an inordinate amount of time emptying bottles of water into pots and bowls, where it can be boiled or microwaved for bathing, washing dishes and cooking for five children 10 and under. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like living in the 1800s,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.Last fall, Magen Baker and her husband moved away from Flint to a suburb on a different water system, but they remain worried about their children, including a 10-month-old who has been hospitalized twice with pneumonia and an older daughter who has been coming home with teachers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 notes about misbehavior and having trouble getting her homework done.Mrs. Baker, 30, who manages a salon at a J.C. Penney, has been breast-feeding her baby, but she drank and cooked with Flint\u00e2\u0080\u0099s contaminated water while pregnant and now worries the baby may have been exposed to lead, which can cross the placenta and has been found in breast milk.After Luke Waid, 29, a laid-off aerospace welder, found out his baby girl, Sophia, had tested high for lead, a public assistance case manager threatened to call Child Protective Services and have Sophia removed from their home because of the lead exposure. Last fall, of course, the family and case manager learned it was the water.Now Mr. Waid is suing state and city officials, hoping to have his daughter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s medical bills covered at the very least. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI come from a poor family,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI paid my taxes, and paid an awful lot for water, and they poisoned my child through the water.\u00e2\u0080\u009dYour health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

Mr. Moya, a Queens-born Democrat elected to the State Assembly in 2010, spent Sunday coordinating a local response with civic organizations and the consulate in Manhattan.Inevitably, the 7.8-magnitude earthquake affected some Queens residents more directly.

She stood with her daughter, Tana Quillupangui, 19, at a rally in Corona Plaza for Hillary Clinton, in advance of the state\u2019s Democratic primary on Tuesday.\u201cWe are scared. It was the strongest earthquake, and those provinces are very poor,\u201d Ms. Gualotuna said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to need money and medicine. They\u2019re going to need a lot of help.\u201dVictoria Aria, 39, brought her children to the rally just to let her husband continue making calls to Bibli\u00e1n, about 400 miles south of the epicenter. Her husband\u2019s brothers and mother were not responding, and they are not on Facebook, she said. That had been the prime source of news for many in the Ecuadorean community in Queens.\u201cHe\u2019s worried because it was so strong. He\u2019s very sad because he doesn\u2019t know where his mother is,\u201d Ms. Aria said.Even former President Bill Clinton understood the concerns of the crowd in Queens, where he was campaigning for his wife on Sunday. \u201cOur hearts go out to Ecuador,\u201d he said to start his remarks at the rally.At El Peque\u00f1o Coffee Shop, a well-known Ecuadorean restaurant on Roosevelt Avenue in Jackson Heights, the buzz was muted as soccer flashed on the television screens.\u201cI was nervous,\u201d Jorge Matute, 57, said. \u201cI called my family in Azogues immediately. They told me they felt the quake very strongly there.\u201dEven though none of his relatives in Azogues, about 400 miles south of the epicenter, was injured, he said people in the country were frightened.To help New York residents with Ecuadorean connections, Mr. Moya\u2019s office and that of State Senator Jose Peralta, a Democrat, planned to provide resources for contacting relatives and information on where to direct donations.\u201cRight now, we\u2019re still gathering information,\u201d Mr. Peralta said.In Ecuador, according to Linda Machuca, the consul general in New York, the most pressing need now is finding equipment and professionals to assist in rescue operations.She acknowledged the enthusiasm of several New York-area organizations who had already expressed their desire to help, but requested patience. \u201cOne of the best qualities that Ecuadoreans have is solidarity, especially in this difficult moment,\u201d Ms. Machuca said.Advertisement"}

On a solitary road, Mr. Bubriski, a 28-year-old freelance photojournalist from North Adams, Mass., who had moved to Santa Fe to study film, spotted an arresting image. A man carrying a life-size, homemade wooden crucifix on one shoulder and his T-shirt, peeled from his back, on the other, walked purposefully down the lonesome highway, a vast sky, relentless sun and wide-open countryside his only company. The man had planned the long hike ahead, about 28 miles from Santa Fe to Chimayo, to get a jump on traffic. The next day, tens of thousands of pilgrims would clog New Mexico\u00e2\u0080\u0099s roads for the annual Good Friday trek to Chimayo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 200-year-old wooden chapel, known by Catholics the world over for the legendary healing powers of its dirt.   Mr. Bubriski captured his first Chimayo pilgrim from behind, his subject\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head and neck tilted by the weight of the cross, his stride straight as a march. The black-and-white image speaks volumes about the proud traditions of Hispanic New Mexicans (commonly called Hispano Nuevomexicanos), whose roots in Santa Fe and its surroundings began with the first Spanish conquistadors who invaded Native America in the 1500s.He was smitten. The culture he glimpsed in northern New Mexico was as different from New England as any he had seen in remote lands. Whole villages turned out for festivals, pageants and religious ceremonies. Relationships between families went back generations, and rituals were as old as anyone could remember. Mr. Bubriski had gone to Santa Fe to learn 16-millimeter documentary filmmaking at the Anthropology Film Center and then return to Nepal, where he had spent four years after college, first as a Peace Corps volunteer, then as a photographer documenting the austere, hard lives of the Nepalese. His goal was to make a documentary film about Nepal. But while he lived in Santa Fe, no rule said he couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t explore his new surroundings. For two years he studied film, worked at a local newspaper and photographed every festival, pageant and community tradition he could attend, from Albuquerque to Chimayo. Some four decades later, Mr. Bubriski (who directs the documentary studies program at Green Mountain College in Vermont) is finally bringing the mysterious and fascinating culture he explored in northern New Mexico to light. The photos explore life during special occasions \u00e2\u0080\u0094 weddings, state fairs, car shows and the like \u00e2\u0080\u0094 showing a close community in everyday life. Some of the most intimate portraits depict teenagers with feathery D.A.s who would pile into old sedans and glossy muscle cars to hang out in San Gabriel Park. These are not clandestine snapshots, but intimate views of couples in love, guy cliques, B.F.F.s. and local beauties. If they look as if the photographer spent time with his subjects, he did. They often gaze directly into the camera, always with the clear understanding that the photographer is aiming to show something \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a deep kinship, affection and comfort \u00e2\u0080\u0094 they might be too used to to notice.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was fully engaged with the richness of everything I experienced while in New Mexico in the early 1980s,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Bubriski said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was my first real connection to being back in the U.S. after years in Nepal.\u00e2\u0080\u009dNorthern New Mexico today has changed, of course. But not entirely. When Mr. Bubriski was in Santa Fe and Albuquerque last month, he spoke with many people who remarked on the changes in hair and fashion, and he noticed an urban sprawl that had not existed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut maybe what remains the same is the warmth of community and family,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cor that or couples\u00e2\u0080\u0099 affection and connection.\u00e2\u0080\u009d One morning, he said by way of example, he ate breakfast at Garcia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kitchen in Albuquerque. It was full of families, affectionate couples young and old and \u00e2\u0080\u009csuperfriendly staff.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cI gave them a copy of the book, which they pored over appreciatively on break from their work,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is just a tiny glimpse, but the feeling of pride and community was palpable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d "}

{"Headline": "Texas Lures Data Centers, Not for Jobs but for Revenue", "Date": "2016-04-26", "News": "Supported bySquare FeetFORT WORTH \u2014 The billionaire developer Ross Perot Jr. describes data centers as the modern equivalent of America\u2019s giant factories in the early 20th century. And here in the sprawling Dallas-Fort Worth region, they seem to be spreading as fast as springtime wildflowers.Texas has become one of the country\u2019s leading destinations for data centers, propelled by robust economic growth in recent years, a business-friendly tax climate, abundant sources of water and dependable electricity.Suburban Northern Virginia, near Washington, is widely considered the nation\u2019s top data center market, and others high on the list include the greater New York-New Jersey region and the Silicon Valley-San Francisco area.So far impervious to the boom-bust cycles in residential real estate, data centers have been a reliable bright spot, and analysts call for continued expansion in the foreseeable future, both in the United States and in developing markets like Latin America.As long as people are tethered to computers, the Internet and smartphones, there will be an insatiable need for data centers.The boom seems to be playing out under the radar of the public, in part because data centers prefer to keep a low profile, largely for security reasons. Average citizens are most likely unaware that the large, windowless buildings they pass on their morning commutes might be data centers housing equipment to facilitate their computer-reliant lives.\u201cThe general public today probably doesn\u2019t realize how they tap and touch and utilize the data center all throughout their day,\u201d said Bo Bond, a leader of JLL\u2019s data center solutions team.State and local leaders across the country have increasingly made data centers a target of their community development strategies, often by offering tax incentives and other inducements. While data centers, with relatively small staffs, are not a big source of jobs, they contain millions of dollars of components that provide a lucrative source of tax revenue, even with abatements.Large enterprises like Facebook often maintain their own centers, but many companies are shedding that costly and complex function to concentrate on their core business, giving rise to a continuing increase in multitenant centers that offer security and expertise to a range of clients.Across the 13 counties in the Dallas-Fort Worth region, the governor\u2019s office says, there are at least 200 enterprise and multitenant data centers.Richardson, Tex., whose registered trademark is Telecom Corridor, was one of the state\u2019s first municipalities to actively pursue data centers, said John Jacobs, executive vice president of the city\u2019s chamber of commerce.\u201cEach one of these data centers is a little gold mine cranking out wealth for the city,\u201d he said.While much of the data center development in North Texas has been clustered in the Dallas corridor, government and business leaders on the western side of the metropolitan region have been waging an aggressive effort to lure more data centers toward Fort Worth and its surrounding communities.Mr. Perot, 57, said the growth of data centers at Alliance struck a nostalgic chord, recalling how, as a boy, he used to collect old punch cards when his father was running Electronic Data Systems in the 1960s. \u201cI\u2019m one of the few kids that grew up in data centers,\u201d he said.Fort Worth leaders landed the Facebook deal after a 220-city competition that stretched for more than a year. Fort Worth and Tarrant County provided a total of $146.7 million in tax abatements for up to 20 years. During that time, the city, county and an area school district will receive a total of $228.5 million in additional property taxes, the Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce said.The center will draw power from a 202-megawatt wind farm that the company is helping to build about 100 miles northwest of Fort Worth. That move plays into a trend in the industry to be more sensitive to environmental concerns since the centers draw tremendous amounts of electricity.To appeal to Facebook, local officials promoted the availability of wind energy, a strong labor pool in technology and access to airports. And in addition to tax incentives, they pointed out a Texas law that spares larger data centers from sales taxes on equipment.Fort Worth\u2019s mayor, Betsy Price, who was heavily involved in the Facebook talks, said city leaders across the region were scrambling to lure more data centers because they offer well-paying jobs, attract other high-tech enterprises and do not require a large investment on infrastructure.\u201cWe love those guys,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Obama Puts His Weight Behind Smart-Gun Technology", "Date": "2016-04-29", "News": "Supported byOver the opposition of gun rights groups, he also vowed to push ahead with a new federal policy giving the F.B.I. access to more mental health records of some Social Security recipients to better flag people who might be banned from buying a gun.But the steps announced Friday generated objections not only from usual opponents like the National Rifle Association, but also from some police groups, which raised safety concerns about officers\u2019 using untested smart guns in real-life situations.The administration stopped short of mandating the use of smart guns by federal agencies but said it saw promise in committing more federal money and attention to a technology that has evolved in fits and starts over more than two decades.The idea behind the smart-gun technology is to limit the use of a firearm to its owner, through personalized identifiers like a biometric sensor on the gun grip, a ring sensor worn by the owner or a digital pass code entered on a wristband.But despite millions of dollars in federal grant money awarded to gun manufacturers and researchers, no commercially viable smart gun has emerged, officials said.This collection of past Times interactive graphics and explanatory articles focuses on the American gun control debate.To that end, the Justice and Homeland Security Departments will develop criteria for gun manufacturers that want to sell smart guns to federal, state and local law enforcement agencies.The administration will also offer millions more in cash awards and grants to gun manufacturers to encourage development of the technology.James O. Pasco Jr., executive director of the National Fraternal Order of Police, which has more than 330,000 members, said in a telephone interview that he was glad to see that the plan announced by the White House did not mandate the testing of smart-gun technology by law enforcement agencies.But he said he remained concerned by a renewed push.\u201cThey\u2019ve been talking about smart guns for 25 years,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t want unproven technology to be tried out on law enforcement officers, who are most likely to be in the line of fire when they need their weapons to work. This is fine if the concept works, but we don\u2019t want people going helter-skelter to embrace the latest shiny object.\u201dThe Obama administration also posted online Friday a proposed regulation from the Social Security Administration that officials believe could help keep guns out of the hands of people who are not allowed to own a firearm because of mental illness.Advocates for the mentally ill say that those with mental illnesses would be unfairly stigmatized even though they account for only about 4 percent of all incidents of gun violence.The National Rifle Association, meanwhile, said that both the Social Security plan and the push for smart-gun technology were unwarranted \u201cdistractions\u201d by an administration intent on imposing more restrictions on gun ownership.\u201cPresident Obama\u2019s obsession with gun control knows no bounds,\u201d said Jennifer Baker, a spokeswoman for the N.R.A.\u2019s lobbying arm.Mr. Obama signaled that he would take steps on the smart-gun technology and firearms purchases by Social Security recipients in January, when he announced a series of executive actions that also expanded background checks for some gun purchases and improved the tracking of stolen weapons.The president said he was forced to act on his own authority out of frustration after Congress stymied him in trying to enact broader gun control measures. In 2013, he failed to convince Congress to pass a universal background check requirement even after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn, and other mass shootings.Robert Pear contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018American Idol\u2019 Ends, Eclipsed by Internet Democracy", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported byCritic's NotebookThe early front-runner in Season 9 of \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d was Andrew Garcia, an amiable pop-R&B singer with a smooth voice, a neck tattoo and a relaxed mien. He was also, by some measures, already something of a star.That was a re-entrenchment maneuver by a superpower dipping a toe into uncharted waters and then recoiling. But it also reflected the new reality of the entertainment business \u2014 alternate starmaking apparatuses were on the rise.That \u201cIdol\u201d didn\u2019t embrace social media more aggressively when it first had the chance was a surprise, because in many ways, it trained the generation of young people who would go on to crown not just \u201cIdol\u201d winners but also untold luminaries of YouTube, Vine, YouNow, Periscope and many more. \u201cIdol\u201d was a monolith and a prime-time network television phenomenon, but one in which fans made the stars, not the other way around.Now, with the show coming to an end Thursday night at the conclusion of its 15th season, it hasn\u2019t been replaced by other televised singing contests (sorry, \u201cThe Voice\u201d) but rather by the grand democracy of the Internet, where to vote with clicks is to breathe.In 2002, when \u201cIdol\u201d debuted, empowering the public to vote on musical talent was a quietly radical act, possible solely because \u201cIdol\u201d was a show about discovering singers that was largely divorced from the music industry. The show was shunned by the old guard for its populism, its reliance on young singers gaming their way through decades-old chestnuts, its unrelenting cheese. And also for its mechanism, in which experts offered advice (and also insults), but actual people made decisions. Fan voting was a gimmick for TV designed to engage viewers, not an accepted A&R technique for record labels.But it undeniably worked. From the beginning, \u201cIdol\u201d drew millions of votes each week, so many that some fans were accused of finding ways to vote thousands of times for their favorites. In a largely hagiographic documentary aired on Tuesday night, \u201cIdol\u201d suggested that it effectively taught America how to send text messages, so that they might vote.By simply inverting and laying bare the usual process \u2014 working bottom up instead of top down \u2014 \u201cIdol\u201d presented a genuine alternative to familiar music business practices. Sometimes it had the same results: Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood, \u201cIdol\u201d winners and fantastically gifted singers, were absorbed into the major label system and went on to long careers, but they\u2019ve been the exceptions. Other alumni have found less direct paths to success, like Jennifer Hudson, Chris Daughtry and Adam Lambert. And there is a whole ecosystem of midlevel fame occupied by several of the show\u2019s many semi- and almost-celebs, like the Broadway careers of Justin Guarini, Diana DeGarmo or Frenchie Davis. (I was recently in the Nashville International Airport, where the disembodied voice of Bucky Covington welcomed me.)But \u201cIdol\u201d should be better remembered for how it set the table for the online fan communities that are now the norm. Those fascinated by \u2014 or terrified of \u2014 Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Beyhive or Rihanna\u2019s Navy might not remember the Claymates of Season 2, who pledged allegiance to the runner-up, Clay Aiken, or the Soul Patrol, supporters of the Season 5 winner, Taylor Hicks. (It should be said that some of the most virulent negative feedback I\u2019ve received online over the years has been from \u201cIdol\u201d loyalists, particularly those enamored of the tepid Season 8 winner, Kris Allen.)By the time \u201cIdol\u201d began to understand the power of social media, though \u2014 say, allowing fans to use Twitter to vote to save contestants in danger of elimination last year \u2014 it was already facing declining ratings. It also had become home to a very specific strain of popular taste: Seven of the last eight winners were young, guitar-music-inclined white men who went from awkward and unpolished at the beginning of the season to reasonably smooth at the end. \u201cIdol\u201d began to resemble a combination day-care and elder-care facility, nurturing young singers and outmoded music.A recurring tension in early seasons of \u201cIdol\u201d was whether the true stars of the show were the singers, unknowns pleading for a chance at fame, or the judges, who were the anchors from season to season. (Later seasons of \u201cIdol,\u201d and also \u201cThe Voice,\u201d reoriented that discussion for good, by choosing actual stars for judges.) But the real stars of \u201cIdol\u201d turned out to be neither of those groups \u2014 it was the fans, who didn\u2019t need to be on camera to have the loudest voice in the room.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Pete Wilson of California Backs Ted Cruz and Warns of Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-04-30", "News": "BURLINGAME, Calif. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Former Gov. Pete Wilson of California used a surprise appearance before the state\u2019s Republican convention on Saturday to endorse Senator Ted Cruz, warning that the nomination of Donald J. Trump could lead to political ruin for the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s candidates this November.\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy friends, we cannot afford a Republican nominee that brings us down-ticket decimation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Wilson, pointing to Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weakness among women voters.He also used his remarks to argue that Mr. Trump could not be trusted with Supreme Court appointments, an issue of great importance to the highly engaged conservative activists gathered in a hotel ballroom here near San Francisco.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHeaven knows what justices Donald Trump would pick,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Wilson, adding: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t afford a wild card when it comes to the president who will be making critically important Supreme Court appointments.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe Republicans in attendance, many of them supporters of Mr. Cruz, responded warmly. But Mr. Wilson, 82, a former senator as well, has been out of office since 1999 and was raising issues that today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Republican primary voters have largely dismissed as Mr. Trump has piled up an overwhelming delegate advantage. Traditional Republican leaders and activists are deeply fearful of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s candidacy, but their arguments against him have largely fallen on deaf ears.There was also something rich about Mr. Wilson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blunt words of caution: Many Republicans in attendance at the state party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s convention fear that Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stridency on the immigration issue could do the national party what they believe Mr. Wilson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approach to the issue did to California Republicans. His support as governor for Proposition 187 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the successful, but ultimately overturned, 1994 ballot initiative to deny health care, public education and other social services to illegal immigrants \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is widely seen as having damaged the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to win statewide elections here. (Since the ballot initiative, no Republican presidential candidate has won California, and the state has elected only one Republican governor or senator, Arnold Schwarzenegger, a centrist.)Mr. Cruz used his remarks to promise a hard line on illegal immigration but did not dwell on the topic, instead faulting Mr. Trump on taxes, health care, guns and foreign policy.He\u00c2\u00a0did, though, incorporate a locally themed attack in his speech. He noted that Mr. Trump had given $12,000 to some of the present and probable future leaders of the California Democratic Party: Gov. Jerry Brown, Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Kamala Harris, who are generally reviled by this state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beleaguered Republican Party.\u00e2\u0080\u009cY\u00e2\u0080\u0099all are experiencing firsthand the consequences of those misguided choices,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Cruz, drawing boos with his mention of the California Democrats.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "School Athletes Often Lack Adequate Protection", "Date": "2016-04-18", "News": "Jane Brody on health and aging.With all the attention on national rules to prevent and properly treat injuries to professional and college athletes, it may surprise you to learn that there are no nationwide guidelines to protect high school athletes from crippling or fatal injuries.Last year alone, about 50 high school athletes died, according to the association, and thousands suffered long-term complications from sports-related injuries, most of which could have been avoided had well-established safety practices been in place and observed.The leading causes of sports-related deaths among high school students are sudden cardiac arrest, head and neck injuries, and exertion-induced heatstroke or sickling, which occurs in athletes who carry the sickle cell trait. Fatalities occur primarily because most schools lack four critical ingredients to assure sports safety: emergency action plans, policies for proper conditioning and safe exercise in high heat and humidity, the presence of trained health professionals at all practices and games, and immediate availability of automated external defibrillators, or A.E.D.s, to reset a stilled or erratically beating heart.In July 2004, Laura Friend of Fort Worth lost her 12-year-old daughter Sarah during a junior lifeguarding class because nobody recognized the child was in cardiac arrest and no one initiated CPR or used the A.E.D. on the premises. Not until after Sarah died was it known that she had been born with an enlarged heart.However, despite a 2007 law requiring an A.E.D. in every school in Texas, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmany are locked up in an office and not accessible, or only the school nurse knows how to use it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Friend said.Knowing that sudden cardiac arrest is by far the leading cause of death among student-athletes, Dr. Casa owns an A.E.D. and takes it to every practice and game of soccer, lacrosse and swimming involving his three school-age children.The Mallon family of Del Mar, Calif., knows all too well the importance of having a trained professional on hand during practices and games. When he was 17, Tommy Mallon landed hard after colliding with another lacrosse player, and a quick-thinking teammate refused to help him up. Instead, an athletic trainer, a certified health care professional, was summoned who, noticing subtle neurological signs that suggested a catastrophic, potentially fatal injury, called immediately for an ambulance.Tommy, 23, now a global risk analyst in Austin, Tex., had sustained a fractured vertebra in his neck and torn artery to the brain. Had he been moved incorrectly, he could have died or been paralyzed.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn just two hours, the kids learn all they need to know: This could be serious, when and how to get help,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Mallon said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had three success stories so far: one involving a heatstroke, one with cardiac arrest and a third with a neck injury and concussion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cHigh schools spend tons of money on referees, but almost nothing on safety,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to see every high school in the country adopt a sports safety curriculum. You never think a catastrophic injury will happen to your kid, but if it does, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be so grateful that someone is there who knows what to do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0096\u00a0 An athletic trainer at every practice and game;\u00e2\u0096\u00a0 An emergency action plan to respond appropriately to an athlete in distress;\u00e2\u0096\u00a0 A publicly accessible A.E.D. and school-based program in its use;\u00e2\u0096\u00a0 Climatization policies to prevent heat injury and heatstroke.Although having a medically trained person readily available can be too costly for many schools, an A.E.D. costs only about $1,000 and can be used to save anyone \u00e2\u0080\u0094 coaches, refs and spectators as well as athletes.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have universal access to A.E.D.s in schools; they should be like fire extinguishers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Drezner said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are 7.5 million high school athletes in this country. During the academic school year 2014-2015, there were 55 cases of cardiac arrest among them, and 57 percent died.\u00e2\u0080\u009dParents whose children want to play school sports often focus more on uniforms than on measures to protect them from serious or fatal injuries. Experts say that a pre-participation medical exam is critical and should include an EKG if there is any family history of heart trouble.Coaches should know CPR, the location and use of an A.E.D., the signs of a possible concussion, and when to keep a player on the sidelines. Coaches should also monitor climate conditions and know when to postpone or suspend a practice or competitive event to avoid heat injuries. During hot weather and high humidity, a cooling tub should always be available. If school money is tight, parents might hold a fund-raiser to assure that an athletic trainer or sports medicine doctor attends every practice and game.Related:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "Review: In \u2018Exit Strategy,\u2019 Scrambling Before School\u2019s Out Forever", "Date": "2016-05-06", "News": "Supported byAmong the play\u2019s strongest, funniest scenes is its first, a testy meeting between the boyish, tidily dressed assistant principal, Ricky (Ryan Spahn, exuding earnest spunkiness), and a veteran English teacher, Pam (Deirdre Madigan), who glares across the desk that separates them as if she\u2019d like to make a meal of her much younger boss.It\u2019s summer, and Ricky is gently trying to break the news to the school\u2019s staff that, um, as he puts it, \u201cThe negotiations didn\u2019t go as smoothly as we expected.\u201dWhen he continues to dance nervously around the real news, Pam, oozing the weariness of a teacher who has logged 23 years in an inner-city public school, barks at him to get to the point. Like a chastened child, he soon does: The city\u2019s school board has decided that the school will be closed at the end of the year. \u201cLow test scores, unfavorable conditions,\u201d he mumbles. \u201cLots of \u2014 lots of, lots of, lots of stuff.\u201dIf he was expecting a teary reaction, forget it. Pam, played with acrid humor by Ms. Madigan, barely bats an unmascaraed eyelash. \u201cForty percent of our seniors graduated last year,\u201d she says. \u201cOne could say that I had a feeling.\u201d She then wryly adds: \u201cLeaks, holes. Even the paint\u2019s trying to run away from this place.\u201dMost of the rest of the play takes place in the teachers\u2019 lounge, which does indeed attest to the moldering facilities. The minimal furnishings are, shall we say, vintage, and you wouldn\u2019t want to go near the water cooler. (Andrew Boyce\u2019s sets are grimly atmospheric.) As the teachers gather for a fall meeting to plan how to break the news to the students, Sadie (Aim\u00e9 Donna Kelly), casually slaps down a package of rat poison; the budget didn\u2019t stretch to an exterminator this year.The announcement will be made by the senior teacher in their midst, Arnold, played with grizzled cynicism by Michael Cullen. Providing Spanish translation will be Jania (a feisty, funny Christina Nieves). After they\u2019ve settled the matter, Sadie brings up the next order of business: her plan to foster community support to keep the school open, beginning with a public march.This plan is greeted with various degrees of skepticism by her colleagues; Arnold and Jania have tried before \u2014 and failed \u2014 in similar fight-the-city school closure protests. In fact the teachers have already walked out to demonstrate against the lack of funding, with no results. An air of resignation fogs the small room, and the unwanted presence of the ever-perky Ricky doesn\u2019t help matters.Each character in \u201cExit Strategy\u201d comes quickly into clear focus. And while the play serves as a stinging indictment of the state of public schools in Chicago and, more broadly, the country, Mr. Holter deftly embeds his finger-pointing in the drama itself. We see beyond the surface dysfunction to the toll it takes on the lives, and careers, of the teachers, whose dedication to their students comes across movingly, even when they are complaining about them.We eventually meet one of those students, Donnie (Brandon J. Pierce), when he\u2019s called onto the carpet by Ricky for having hacked the school\u2019s website, and essentially turned it into a Kickstarter page to raise funds. This is, technically, cause for disciplinary action, if not expulsion. But Donnie, who is portrayed with blazing magnetism by Mr. Pierce, cuts Ricky\u2019s disciplinary chat short with a shattering monologue about his grim journey through public schools, including one that was so poorly financed that the students had to request toilet paper from their teachers.Ricky is so impressed that instead of suspension or expulsion, he names Donnie his \u201ccreative associate\u201d in charge of social media for a newly formed group called Team Winning, which will seek to rally public support for the school.With this improbable (if sweet) development, \u201cExit Strategy\u201d takes a sentimental turn. The amorous relationship between Ricky and one of the teachers, the genial Luce (a buoyant Rey Lucas), also injects a formulaic note into the proceedings.But the pungent dialogue, winning performances and Kip Fagan\u2019s streamlined direction help us overlook the small hiccups in the dramaturgy. And Mr. Holter is ultimately cleareyed about the parlous state of the American public school system. Donnie and Ricky may stir up quite a firestorm on Facebook, but no amount of social media attention can make up for the straitened circumstances and lack of civic support.The teachers may love their students, the students may love their school, but all the affection in the world won\u2019t buy pencils and books and blackboards.Advertisement"}

Trump likes to pick out the people who, despite his having insulted their ethnic group, support him in the race for the Republican presidential nomination. They love him, they really do.These immigrants are supporting him for reasons that are intensely personal and, not surprisingly, are often aligned with their politics back home.A recent informal poll conducted by a Russian-language radio station in New York City showed that more than 80 percent of 5,000 callers preferred Mr. Trump, the Republican front-runner, to Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party\u2019s likely nominee. A group of Latino Republicans in Rockland County is planning to endorse him, and some older Indian-American professionals and young Hindus in the region already have.Mr. Ahuja praised Mr. Trump for wanting to stop immigrants from entering the country illegally. \u201cYou should not reward people who have broken the law,\u201d he said. \u201cYou follow the law, you get punished.

{"Headline": "Thomas Staggs, Disney\u2019s Heir Apparent, Is Stepping Down", "Date": "2016-04-04", "News": "Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Thomas O. Staggs, the favored contender to lead Disney after Robert A. Iger\u2019s retirement, unexpectedly announced his departure on Monday, throwing succession at the world\u2019s largest entertainment company into disarray.Mr. Staggs, who became the Walt Disney Company\u2019s No. 2 executive last year, beating out another candidate, will step down as chief operating officer on May 6. Disney said that Mr. Staggs, 55, would remain an employee until the fall, serving as \u201cspecial adviser\u201d to Mr. Iger, who is the company\u2019s chief executive and chairman. In a statement, Mr. Iger called Mr. Staggs \u201ca great friend and trusted colleague.\u201dAfter the promotion, as Mr. Staggs came under intense scrutiny by Disney\u2019s board, it became clear that at least some board members were not convinced he had the skills required to maintain Disney\u2019s creative momentum. While Mr. Staggs has extensive financial experience, his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is light when it comes to the successful creation of movies and television shows. (For his part, Mr. Iger ran ABC early in his career.)Disney prefers to promote from within, but Mr. Staggs was the only obvious candidate \u2014 the man he beat out for the No. 2 job, James A. Rasulo, has since left the company. The board may now look outside for a successor to Mr. Iger, who has led Disney to record-breaking results.Left with no guidance from Disney, Hollywood instantly began to guess about potential candidates on Monday, with a member of Disney\u2019s board, the Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg, frequently mentioned. In a statement, Disney said the board \u201cwill broaden the scope of its succession planning process to identify and evaluate a robust slate of candidates for consideration.\u201d So far, Mr. Iger has not indicated a desire to extend his contract again.\u201cAs roughly two years remain before Iger steps down, there is still ample time to find a replacement, and we think Iger could potentially delay his exit (again, for the third time) if need be,\u201d Doug Creutz an analyst at Cowen and Company, wrote in research note on Monday.A decade earlier, Disney endured a lesser degree of succession strife with Jeffrey Katzenberg, who resigned as chairman of Walt Disney Studios after Mr. Eisner refused to promote him to president of the broader company. There was also an ill-fated run by Michael S. Ovitz as president of the entertainment conglomerate.In many ways, choosing a successor for Mr. Iger is a near-impossible task. Under his leadership, Disney has made a number of transformative acquisitions, including buying Marvel Entertainment, Lucasfilm and Pixar Animation Studios. Last year, Disney had $8.4 billion in profit, a 12 percent increase from the year before. Disney shares have recently traded for about $98, up from about $24 when Mr. Iger took over. (Shares fell about 2 percent in after-hours trading on Monday.)Mr. Iger also has an ability to command attention with his personal style, an attribute that has greatly helped him rule over disparate Disney fiefs.Over the last year, Mr. Staggs devoted a substantial amount of his time to Disney Media Networks, a division that includes ESPN, ABC and Disney Channel.Mr. Staggs, who joined Disney in 1990, has an extensive list of accomplishments. In the 12 years he spent as chief financial officer, he worked on the Pixar and Marvel deals. In the five years he spent as chairman of Disney Parks and Resorts, Mr. Staggs more than doubled theme park operating profit, to $2.66 billion, and fixed the kinks in an important $1 billion Disney World technology project.In a statement, Mr. Staggs called his tenure at Disney a \u201cprivilege,\u201d adding that working with Mr. Iger during a \u201cdynamic era of unprecedented growth and transformation\u201d had been \u201ca great experience.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Bets on Bots for Its Messenger App", "Date": "2016-04-12", "News": "Supported byThe experience is akin to chatting with a friend, \u201cthe one whose taste you always trust while you\u2019re shopping,\u201d said Alan Tisch, chief executive of Spring.There\u2019s just one thing: The entity on the other end talking to you and helping you choose the shoes is not human. It is a chatbot, a relatively simple piece of software that uses artificial intelligence to carry on a conversation.On Tuesday, Facebook underlined the rise of bots at its annual F8 developer conference in San Francisco. Facebook said it was opening up Messenger, its own messaging app, so that any outside company \u2014 from Applebee\u2019s to Zara \u2014 could create a bot capable of interacting with people through the chat program.With the move, Facebook is aiming to usher in a new era of customer service by bringing together the 900 million regular monthly users of Messenger with the more than 15 million businesses that have an official brand page on Facebook. Facebook is kicking off the project with partners like Spring, 1-800-Flowers, a weather and travel app called Poncho and news partners like CNN. Facebook is also testing advertising on chatbots as a potential source of revenue.\u201cWe\u2019re conversational creatures,\u201d David A. Marcus, vice president of messaging at Facebook, said of chat. \u201cThat\u2019s the way our brain functions. That\u2019s the way we\u2019re wired. As a result, it\u2019s probably the most natural interface there is.\u201dMark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, also sketched out his grand vision at the conference for the company\u2019s future over the next five, 10 and 15 years. Under his plan, people would accompany Facebook as it builds out a comprehensive global system of communications, virtual reality and shopping.\u201cWe all have a desire to be understood and relate to each other,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u201cWe\u2019re always trying to get closer to capturing the purest form.\u201dUnderlying many of these bot efforts is their presence primarily on messaging services, which are increasingly becoming a primary form of communication and computing. More than 1.6 billion people are projected to become regular users of mobile messaging apps by the end of this year, equivalent to 22 percent of the global population, according to eMarketer, an industry research firm. That figure is expected to reach two billion people by 2018.The bot revival is also taking place at a time when people are growing tired of individual apps. While big brands have long promoted easier access to shopping and customer service through their own proprietary smartphone apps, some consumers are fatigued by having to download a different app for each company. More than a quarter of the time spent on mobile apps by Americans is now focused on just a handful of social networking and communication apps, according to Forrester, an industry research firm.As a result, brands in search of the best way to talk to consumers are now pairing off with some the world\u2019s dominant messaging platforms \u2014 and their chatbots.\u201cImagine if you had, say, 10 bot interactions a day, and if your entire daily commercial life was powered by a chat platform,\u201d said Ted Livingston, chief executive of Kik. \u201cHow that platform works \u2014 and who controls it \u2014 is going to be very important.\u201d Kik is heavily promoting its \u201cbot store\u201d to lure businesses to its platform.There are no guarantees the bot medium will take off. Facebook, Kik and Microsoft are up against other artificially intelligent assistants like Apple\u2019s Siri and Amazon\u2019s Echo, the hardware devices that are voice-controlled \u2014 no typing required. And making each transaction into a personal conversation may not be what people need when they just want to book a flight or order food.\u201cA lot of apps are already incredibly functional,\u201d said Robin Chan, chief executive of Operator. \u201cTake Uber, for example: You just push a button and it works. You don\u2019t need a drawn-out conversation for every single app.\u201dRegardless, the bot wave is coming, said John Lilly, a venture capitalist at Greylock Partners who has long been interested in bots and artificial intelligence. It may not come right now, with consumers needing to type in \u201ccommand line\u201d-style text to the chatbots, but he said the trend may gather momentum as bots increasingly blend technology and \u201chuman product design,\u201d whatever form that may take.Mr. Tisch of Spring, the mobile shopping start-up that just started offering a bot on Facebook Messenger, said working with the social media company to unveil the chatbot was a no-brainer. Facebook\u2019s huge scale, at more than 1.6 billion global users, makes it a good candidate for kickstarting a new form of commerce online, he said.And chatbots themselves are simply an extension of the kind of personal conversations that are already happening in retail, he said. Many high-end retailers offer personal shopping services, often through text messaging.Conversing with a chatbot to shop feels \u201cmagical,\u201d Mr. Tisch said, though \u201cin reality, much of commerce is happening through the conversations we\u2019re already having all the time.\u201dQuentin Hardy contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Plans New Stock Class to Solidify Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Control", "Date": "2016-04-27", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Mark Zuckerberg nurtured Facebook from a dorm room idea into the world\u2019s biggest social network. Now the company is taking steps to ensure its founder remains in charge.Mr. Zuckerberg on Wednesday cited the Silicon Valley mantra of founders in explaining the new class of stock, calling Facebook a \u201cfounder-led company.\u201d In a conference call, he added, \u201cFacebook has been built on a series of bold moves. When I look out on the future, I see more bold moves ahead of us, not behind us.\u201dFacebook\u2019s shares, which are up more than 33 percent over the past year, soared 9 percent in after-hours trading.The new C shares effectively allow Mr. Zuckerberg to maintain 60 percent of voting power while still giving away large amounts of stock. Under the proposal, all holders of Facebook stock will get two C shares for each A or B share that they own. Importantly, the C shares come with no voting power. Holders of A shares are entitled to one vote per share, while holder of B shares have 10 votes a share.That means Mr. Zuckerberg, as the majority owner of Facebook shares, will obtain a large amount C shares that he can then donate without diluting his voting power in the company.\u201cIt is a rational, if somewhat eyebrow-raising way, for founders to distribute wealth without giving up operating control of the company,\u201d said Lise Buyer, founder of the Class V Group, which advises start-ups on initial public offerings. \u201cThis structure will continue to allow Facebook to make decisions that may not always look great in the short term, but may pay off for investors over time.\u201dFacebook\u2019s C shares may trade at a slight discount to A shares, which would still have one vote. Most investors currently hold A shares, which only have about a quarter of the overall shareholders\u2019 voting power, so they may not be forgoing much if they choose to sell their A shares versus their C shares.\u201cIt\u2019s almost like voting Republican in Massachusetts \u2014 you can do it, but it won\u2019t affect the outcome,\u201d said Rick Kline, a partner in the technology and capital markets practice of law firm Goodwin Procter.Investors getting new C shares will not gain economically because the same proportion of new stock will be given to all holders.Facebook, in contrast, has figured out how to wring billions of dollars from its members on mobile devices and other platforms, making the company\u2019s revenue-generation machine unstoppable.And while growth in new users on Facebook has slowed in recent years, the total is still getting larger. Facebook said 1.65 billion people visited the site on a monthly basis in the first quarter, up from 1.44 billion a year earlier. More than 1.5 billion people are monthly mobile-only users, up from 1.25 billion a year ago.Facebook\u2019s other big bets like WhatsApp, the messaging service, and Oculus, its virtual reality play, have yet to pay off with immense new revenue streams. But Facebook is comfortable gathering a critical mass of users \u2014 nearly a billion in WhatsApp\u2019s case \u2014 and then introducing advertising later on when it makes more sense.\u201cTo me, this is like Google 10 years ago,\u201d said Mark Mahaney, an Internet analyst at RBC Capital. \u201cThey really had such momentum, and they\u2019re proving how valuable they are to both advertisers and consumers.\u201dMike Isaac reported from San Francisco and Leslie Picker from New York.

She also\u00c2\u00a0defended her father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s record on women with a personal soliloquy.Asked whether the campaign had strained\u00c2\u00a0her friendship with the younger Ms. Clinton and whether she thought they would be friends after Election Day, Ms. Trump was diplomatic.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell look, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re children and we love our parents, so that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the great equalizer, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the great common ground,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, before segueing into talking about how proud of her father she is.Ms. Trump also talked about how the man she knows is not the one who is often portrayed in the media as a misogynist.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve witnessed these incredible female role models that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s employed in the highest executive positions at the Trump Organization my entire life,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cin an industry that has been dominated by men, is still dominated by men, but certainly was when he was starting out in his career and employing some of these women and raising them through the ranks.\u00e2\u0080\u009dShe added that the way he had\u00c2\u00a0encouraged\u00c2\u00a0her and her younger half sister, Tiffany \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only child with his second wife, Marla Maples \u00e2\u0080\u0094 saying that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t anything I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do if I set my mind to it, if I had deep passion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was a testament to his belief in empowering women.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the message a father would relay to a daughter who he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe had the potential to accomplish exactly what her brothers could,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo for me, his actions speak louder than the words of many politicians who talk about gender equality but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not evidenced in their daily employment practices.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe tweets are fine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe retweets sometimes get a little bit shaky.\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Mr. Trump has come under fire for retweeting an unflattering picture of Heidi Cruz, the wife of his chief Republican rival, as well as for retweeting a quote attributed to Benito Mussolini, the founder of the Fascist movement.)During the day, Mr. Trump said, he will sometimes \u00e2\u0080\u009cjust shout it out to one of the young ladies\u00e2\u0080\u009d who work in his office and have them actually send his Twitter messages.

{"Headline": "The Islamic State of Molenbeek", "Date": "2016-04-11", "News": "Supported byBRUSSELS \u2014 There are military trucks parked in Molenbeek, and soldiers with submachine guns patrol the jittery streets of the Brussels district that has been the epicenter of European terrorism in recent months. On the Place Communale idle youths loiter, shooting glances at the police. This is where the Paris and Brussels attacks, with their 162 dead, overlap.Salah Abdeslam, the only surviving direct participant in the Paris attacks, hid in Molenbeek before his arrest on March 18. Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the suspected chief planner of the Paris attacks, lived in Molenbeek. In all, at least 14 people tied to both attacks were either Belgian or lived in Brussels.One of them is Mohamed Abrini, a Belgian of Moroccan origin who grew up in Molenbeek and was arrested in Brussels on Friday. He has told the police he is \u201cthe man in the hat\u201d caught on surveillance cameras leaving Brussels airport after two accomplices blew themselves up on March 22. Cameras also placed him in Paris last November with the Paris attackers.Sleepy Brussels: goodbye to that image. Yet even today there\u2019s something soporific about this French-speaking city marooned within Flemish-speaking Flanders, beset by administrative and linguistic divisions and the lethargy that stems from them, home to a poorly integrated immigrant population of mainly Moroccan and Turkish descent (41 percent of the population of Molenbeek is Muslim), and housing the major institutions of a fraying European Union.It is hard to resist the symbolism of the Islamic State establishing a base for its murderous designs in the so-called capital of Europe at a time when the European idea is weaker than at any time since the 1950s. A jihadi loves a vacuum, as Syria demonstrates. Belgium as a state, and Belgium as the heart of the European Union are as close to a vacuum as Europe offers these days.Belgium \u2014 a hodgepodge of three regions (Flanders, French-speaking Wallonia and Brussels), three linguistic communities (Flemish, French and German) and a weak federal government \u2014 is dysfunctional. That dysfunction finds its most powerful expression in the capital, where Flemish geography and French culture do not align. The administrative breakdown assumes critical proportions in Molenbeek, the second-poorest commune in the country, with 36 percent of people younger than 25 unemployed.This is an outrage. Splintered Belgium had lost control of Molenbeek. A heavily Muslim district of Brussels had in effect seceded. If this were the extent of the problem, it would be grave. But Molenbeek is just the most acute manifestation of a European failure.The large-scale immigration from Turkey and North Africa that began a half-century ago at a time of economic boom has \u2014 at a time of economic stagnation \u2014 led to near-ghettos in or around many European cities where the jobless descendants of those migrants are sometimes radicalized by Wahhabi clerics. As the French prime minister, Manuel Valls, warned recently, an extremist minority is \u201cwinning the ideological and cultural battle\u201d within French Islam.The fact that the jihadis, often Syrian-trained, are a minority, and that many Muslims who immigrate to Europe are leading successful and integrated lives, is little consolation. After the carnage in Paris and Brussels, the laissez-faire approach that had allowed those clerics to proselytize, private Muslim schools to multiply in France, prisons to serve as incubators of jihadism, youths to drift to ISIS land in Syria and back, and districts like Molenbeek or Schaerbeek to drift into a void of negligence, has to cease. Improved intelligence is not enough. There is an ideological battle going on; it has to be waged on that level, where it has been lost up to now. The moderate Muslim communities of Europe need to do much more.Europe, of which Brussels is a symbol, presents an alarming picture today. The Dutch, susceptible to propaganda from Russia, have just voted in a referendum against a trade agreement with Ukraine for which more than 100 Ukrainians died in an uprising in 2014. The British are set to vote in June on whether to leave the Union. The euro has sapped economies insufficiently integrated for a common currency. A huge refugee flow has raised questions about a borderless Europe. President Putin plots daily to do his worst for the European Union.There is a vacuum. Vacuums are dangerous. The answer is a reformed, reinvigorated and stronger Europe, not the kind of division that produced Molenbeek \u2014 a microcosm of what fragmentation can bring.My two older children were born in Schaerbeek. My daughter, now a doctor in New Mexico, took some of her first steps at Brussels airport. This is not the Europe I imagined for them.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "Gold. The word beckons with promises of beauty, elegance and wealth. Empires were built on its trade, reshaping regions where generations of people were displaced, uprooted or caught up in the fever.\u00e2\u0080\u009cMining is one of the main reasons why lots of parts of Latin America even exist,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Elizabeth Ferry, an anthropologist who has studied mining in Latin America. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne of the main forces of colonialism was the search for precious metals.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAs she knows, the quest for gold and silver remains a powerful force, especially after the financial crisis sent gold prices to new highs because of nervous investors looking for stability. Yet their economic well-being has had some of the opposite effects in place like Colombia, where a new gold boom has attracted thousands of traditional artisanal miners as well as transnational behemoths, sometimes pitting the two groups against one another.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re both respectful of the efforts of these small miners who do a job that the world wants,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Ferry said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHumanity wants gold. Gold is tied into the history of humanity. It is not going to go away. All over the world people use gold for wedding celebrations, for all sorts of purposes. You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bad.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe Ferrys trace the current rush to the 2011 spike in gold prices north of $1900 an ounce, which proved to be an irresistible lure for campesinos and others who have often been left to fend for themselves in regions where the state \u00e2\u0080\u0094 ensnared in a long armed conflict with Marxist guerrillas \u00e2\u0080\u0094 has little presence. As people turned to mining, either in mountains or on riverbanks, they found themselves also having to pay a \u00e2\u0080\u009ctax\u00e2\u0080\u009d to the armed groups that controlled the area.The scenes Mr. Ferry captured show the range of human activity, from the local miners who descend on a riverbank for their chance to sift through the muck for a few hours each day, to the processes used to separate gold from stone and mud using mercury. He also saw how in other parts of Colombia \u00e2\u0080\u0094 for example, on its Pacific Coast \u00e2\u0080\u0094 small miners were more sensitive to protecting the environment from damage caused by the mining and refinement process. Of course, the new global demand has also attracted large corporations, especially from Canada, that employ large-scale methods that transform the landscape, as well as trigger conflict among local residents. In Marmato, Mr. Ferry said, a longtime community of miners has been trying to protect their town from being obliterated by an open-pit mine.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt has been a pretty anarchic situation in Colombia because the state has leased out a lot of subsoil to multinational mining companies,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Ferry said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA lot of that process happens in a way that does not have any transparency and people don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know who owns the subsoil rights.\u00e2\u0080\u009dDr. Ferry said her collaboration with her brother allowed her to try a different type of writing, as well as giving him a new way of looking at a story he has long followed as a photojournalist.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re both at a time in our careers that we are open to experimenting with thinking about how the way you look at something changes what you think,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Ferry said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m very much from an academic background where there is a particular procedure for how you gather information and what audience you are talking to.

Someone posted a video of the dangling dog on Facebook, and the clip went viral. Galvanized by public outrage, the police combed the area and on Tuesday announced that a 23-year-old man named Ransom May II had been arrested on a charge of cruelty to animals. The arrest made news nationwide.Look, I don\u2019t believe in reincarnation. But if I\u2019m wrong, let\u2019s hope you and I are fated to come back as puppies and not as chickens.\u201cWhen birds get it, it eats their muscles and bones and organs away until they drop dead,\u201d Mike Weaver, a West Virginia chicken farmer in the video, told me. \u201cThe bird just rots away; it turns to mush.\u201dEric Hedrick, who raises 1.1 million chickens a year in West Virginia, said he had no evidence that the disease harms humans, but added, \u201cI\u2019d be apprehensive about buying a chicken in the market.\u201dWeaver and Hedrick, who risk their livelihood by speaking out, say that the chicken companies rig the system against the ordinary farmers who actually raise the birds for them. The companies supply the birds and feed, so the farmers describe themselves as modern sharecroppers, with no control over their operations, squeezed by the companies and punished if they protest.A 12-piece KFC chicken meal costs about $30, and the farmers say their share is about 1 percent of that \u2014 less than the tax.In fairness, the chicken companies excel at producing cheap food, with the price of chicken falling by at least half in real terms since 1930. Chicken is cheap partly because companies have tinkered with genetics so that a baby chick burgeons in five weeks to a full-size bird with an enormous breast. By my calculations, if humans grew that explosively, a baby at five weeks would weigh almost 300 pounds.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it is dysfunctional,\u201d Weaver told me. \u201cMore like it is functioning very well for the companies and their executives only, and very poorly for farmers and consumers.\u201dThe animal welfare issue is a bit complicated. Chickens raised for meat roam within a barn, so while conditions are grim, these chickens are at least better off than egg-laying hens crowded into tiny cages.Yet terrible things happening to children shouldn\u2019t excuse abuse of animals. Moreover, Leah Garces of Compassion in World Farming argues that modern chicken genetics constitute a form of abuse: It is inhumane, she says, to breed a bird with a huge breast that its legs can barely support.\u201cChickens have a cage,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s their own body.\u201d She has a point: Many chickens today stagger about, sometimes on splayed legs, or mostly just sit down.Poultry farming now is entirely different from what it was when I was a farm kid in Oregon with our family flock of chickens. Today\u2019s business model is infinitely more efficient, but it also raises environmental concerns such as antibiotic overuse and is fundamentally oppressive for animals and farmers alike.When even chicken farmers say that the system has failed, it\u2019s time for consumers to use their buying power to push for food that causes less harm to everyone, human and bird alike. If we can rally on behalf of a frightened dog in Orlando, can\u2019t we also muster concern for billions of farm animals \u2014 as well as the humans struggling to raise them?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "North Carolina Law May Risk Federal Aid", "Date": "2016-04-01", "News": "Supported byCutting off any federal money \u2014 or even simply threatening to do so \u2014 would put major new pressure on North Carolina to repeal the law, which eliminated local protections for gay and transgender people and restricted which bathrooms transgender people can use. A loss of federal money could send the state into a budget crisis and jeopardize services that are central to daily life.Although experts said such a drastic step was unlikely, at least immediately, the administration\u2019s review puts North Carolina on notice that the new law could have financial consequences. Gov. Pat McCrory of North Carolina had assured residents that the law would not jeopardize federal money for education.But the law also represents a test for the Obama administration, which has declared that the fight for gay and transgender rights is a continuation of the civil rights era. The North Carolina dispute forces the administration to decide how aggressively to fight on that principle.The North Carolina law created a mandatory statewide anti-discrimination policy, but it did not include specific protections based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The law prohibits transgender people from using public bathrooms that do not match the sexes on their birth certificates.A Department of Education spokeswoman, Dorie Nolt, said on Friday that her agency was also reviewing the North Carolina law \u201cto determine any potential impact on the state\u2019s federal education funding.\u201d She added, \u201cWe will not hesitate to act if students\u2019 civil rights are being violated.\u201d The agency said it provided $4.3 billion to North Carolina last year for kindergarten through 12th grade as well as colleges.The Department of Housing and Urban Development said it was doing a similar evaluation. \u201cWe\u2019re reviewing the effects of the law on HUD funding allocated for North Carolina,\u201d said Cameron French, a department spokesman.White House officials had no comment.Any decision on federal aid would take time, experts said. Federal agencies have used the threat of lost money to pressure a handful of municipal governments in California and Illinois to change their policies and allow transgender students to use the restrooms of the gender they identify with. There is no recent precedent for the federal government\u2019s applying similar pressure to address a state law that it sees as discriminatory.\u201cIt would be a long process of negotiation,\u201d said Jane R. Wettach, an education law specialist at the Duke University School of Law in Durham, N.C. \u201cI think the federal government would be loath to do it and would give North Carolina every possibility, every chance to change their position, to change the law, to negotiate, to make some exceptions. I think they\u2019d go back and forth for a while and try to come to a negotiated settlement.\u201dMr. McCrory, a Republican who is seeking re-election, and other supporters of the law have been aware, but dismissive, of suggestions that the measure might endanger the state\u2019s federal largess. Mr. McCrory\u2019s office did not respond to messages on Friday.Dan Forest, the Republican lieutenant governor and the president of the State Senate, said he expected that federal aid would continue. He noted that many states did not explicitly provide gay and transgender people with anti-discrimination protection. Neither does federal law.\u201cIt would be wrong \u2014 even illegal \u2014 to single out North Carolina for unfavorable treatment,\u201d Mr. Forest said in an emailed statement. He said the state complied with the Constitution and federal laws. \u201cI\u2019m confident that we will continue to receive this federal money despite the threats from a few in Washington, D.C.\u201dMr. Forest is correct that federal anti-discrimination laws do not explicitly mention gay and transgender people: the Obama administration has repeatedly called on Congress to pass a law banning discrimination against them in employment decisions. On several occasions, however, the administration has also said that gay, lesbian and transgender people are already covered by laws banning sex discrimination. Last year, a federal judge in Virginia rejected that notion, ruling that restricting the bathroom choices for transgender students did not violate federal law. The Obama administration had argued otherwise and the case is on appeal.The Obama administration would not need to go to court to withhold grant money, but doing so would surely lead to a court fight, especially since the law is unsettled.Advocacy groups have praised the Obama administration for its broad view of civil rights laws. During the past seven years, \u201cthe fight for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender equality has reached an incredible crescendo,\u201d Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch said last year.James D. Esseks, who works on gender and sexual orientation issues for the American Civil Liberties Union, said the North Carolina law represented a chance for the Obama administration to stand behind those views. He called on the federal government to say: \u201cHey folks, we\u2019re serious here. We\u2019re not going to give you all this federal money if you\u2019re requiring discrimination in every corner of the state.\u201dNorth Carolina has faced criticism from businesses including Bank of America, which has its headquarters in Charlotte, N.C.; Apple; and Facebook. The National Basketball Association suggested that it might move the 2017 All-Star Game from Charlotte. The White House called the law \u201cmeanspirited.\u201d\u201cDisregarding the facts, other politicians \u2014 from the White House to mayors to state capitals and City Council members and even our attorney general \u2014 have initiated and promoted conflict to advance their political agenda and tear down our state, even if it means defying the Constitution and their oath of office,\u201d Mr. McCrory said.Matt Apuzzo reported from Washington, and Alan Blinder from Atlanta.

Tip.Didn\u2019t ask for that taxi door to be opened? No need.Of course, what to give varies.(And the minimum tip here is much higher than in other cities, Mr. Stallings said.)For dining, he suggests a minimum of 18 percent, but \u201cfor high-end places, it\u2019s 20 percent,\u201d he said.So many other daily exchanges, though, are often head scratchers.Elizabeth Charrow, 34, a barista at Joe Coffee in Greenwich Village, said she appreciates a dollar a drink.\u201cYou give a dollar to a bartender for opening a bottle,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m doing more than opening a beer.\u201dFor Luis Maisonet, 52, a doorman in the West Village, it\u2019s the thought that counts, he said.\u201cSometimes we get cookies, or a nice bottle of wine,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the average is $50 around the holidays. Anything else is gravy.\u201dAntonio Romero, 33, a deliveryman on the Upper West Side, said he was happy with $2 to $3 a trip.Mohammed Uddin, 48, a taxi driver from the Bronx, didn\u2019t say how much he\u2019d like, but he put it this way:Out-of-towners are good for 5 percent to 10 percent, he said.Locals are more generous, leaving around 10 percent to 20 percent.\u201cAnd we\u2019re always happy to pick up New Yorkers,\u201d he said.Here\u2019s what else is happening:Hair forecast: frizz.Here\u2019s to hoping that April showers really do bring May flowers.Times Square can be a jungle sometimes.Now it sounds like it, too.You\u2019re hearing a swamp in the Mamori rain forest at night.Soothing, right?Maybe.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sweep in Bronx Tackles Decade of Gang Chaos", "Date": "2016-04-27", "News": "Supported byOn Wednesday, in what the authorities said they believed was the \u201clargest gang takedown\u201d ever in New York, prosecutors announced charges against 120 people accused of being members of two gangs in the borough. By the afternoon, prosecutors said, close to 90 of the defendants had been taken into federal custody; 30 others were still being sought.Court papers say the gangs were responsible for at least eight murders. Defendants were arrested and arraigned in Federal District Court in Manhattan on counts including racketeering and narcotics conspiracies.The arrests were the latest effort to crack down on gang violence in the city, where the spread of street crews has been an anomaly and a vexing challenge for law enforcement: Though crime, especially murder, has fallen over all in the last 25 years, certain precincts, especially in the Bronx and Brooklyn, have experienced upticks in acts of violence.About half of the defendants charged are associated with the 2Fly YGz street gang, according to a federal indictment. The rest, a second indictment said, were part of a rival gang, Big Money Bosses, which was responsible for the death of Sadie Mitchell, the 92-year-old woman killed in 2009, as well as the fatal stabbing last year of a 15-year-old boy near East Gun Hill Road.The leaders of Big Money Bosses, the indictment said, called themselves Big Suits, while other gang members, to signify their status, were ranked by names like Burberry Suits, Gucci Suits, Ferragamo Suits and Sean John Suits.The two gangs used social media \u201cto promote, protect and grow their ranks,\u201d including posting videos on YouTube \u201cbragging about their criminal endeavors,\u201d Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, said at a news conference where the charges were announced.Mr. Bharara said the investigation began in December 2014, as violence surged around the Eastchester Gardens public housing complex. Much of it was found to have been caused by the two gangs.Fifty-seven people have been charged with conspiring with the 2Fly YGz street gang, which operated around the Eastchester Gardens public housing project and in the vicinity of Gun Hill Road in the Bronx, according to the indictment.During the investigation, Mr. Bharara said, the government obtained warrants for more than 100 Facebook, Twitter and Instagram accounts linked to the gangs\u2019 criminal activity, an investigative technique the authorities are using more often against gangs.But even as the authorities move against one gang, others seem to fill the void.\u201cThese gangs are the epitome of organized crime today,\u201d Angel M. Melendez, who leads the New York office of Homeland Security Investigations, said at the news conference.Nearly 700 police officers and federal agents swept through the city Tuesday night and Wednesday making arrests and conducting court-authorized searches, Mr. Bharara said. The arrests and charges, he said, would essentially \u201cdismantle\u201d the two gangs \u201cfrom top to bottom.\u201dEukeysha Gregory, 48, who lives on the first floor of an eight-story brick building in the Eastchester Gardens complex, said the thumping of a police helicopter woke her at 4 a.m. Wednesday. Looking out the peephole of her door, she said, she saw police officers in helmets and protective vests charge into the building with a battering ram. Over the next hour, she watched the police arrest young people across the complex.\u201cI\u2019m so glad I would kiss the captain\u2019s feet,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m so excited now my child can actually play in the park.\u201dMs. Gregory said the sound of gunshots had become common in the six years since she moved into the apartment. Two bullets, she said, recently came through the window of a neighbor, and last weekend she heard the sound of around a half-dozen shots coming from between a playground in the center of the complex and her building\u2019s front door.Ms. Gregory said she had attended a community meeting with Eastchester Gardens residents and the police on Tuesday night. There was no mention that a raid was imminent.\u201cIt was exciting,\u201d she said of the raid while sitting on a bench outside her building Wednesday with her 9-year-old daughter Jewel. \u201cI was so glad.\u201dMr. Bharara\u2019s office said that the investigation was continuing, and that in addition to the murders attributed to the gangs in the indictments, several other killings were part of the inquiry.Sixty-three people have been accused of participating in the Big Money Bosses gang, which operated around White Plains Road and on Boston Road in the BronxThe officials at the news conference focused on what New York\u2019s police commissioner, William J. Bratton, cited as the \u201ccollateral damage\u201d caused by gang violence, and Mr. Melendez noted that 2Fly YGz members had taken over a playground at Eastchester Gardens, which it used as its \u201cbase of operations\u201d for selling and hiding drugs and guns.Mr. Bratton said that the arrests announced Wednesday would go \u201ca very long way toward ending the historical violence\u201d that has plagued public housing projects in the area and that had also affected Bronx neighborhoods like Laconia, Wakefield and Williamsbridge.Mr. Bharara noted that the arrests came as his office\u2019s Civil Division has been conducting a separate investigation, previously cited in news reports, into environmental health and safety conditions in public housing projects. He said that there were over 400,000 public housing residents who, according to federal regulations, were entitled to housing that was \u201cdecent, safe, sanitary and in good repair.\u201d\u201cAnd it\u2019s clear,\u201d he said, \u201cthat many are not getting that.\u201dNear the modest single-family house at 721 East 224th Street where Ms. Mitchell, the 92-year-old woman, was killed in 2009, neighbors reacted with resigned satisfaction to news of the arrests.\u201cClean up the streets, you don\u2019t want that happening to an old lady,\u201d said Mike William, 30, who said he had known Ms. Mitchell. \u201cThis is the ghetto and things happen in the streets, but you don\u2019t want your kids getting hurt, or an old lady getting hurt.\u201dNate Schweber contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The Carson surge, it turns out, never actually happened.As of Wednesday morning, unofficial results from the county showed Mr. Carson with 2,058 votes in the Westchester part of the 16th District, which includes Yonkers, Mount Vernon and New Rochelle, as well as part of the Bronx.Reginald A. LaFayette, one of Westchester County\u00e2\u0080\u0099s election commissioners, said that he did not know exactly what had happened with the vote totals, but that he suspected it was a matter of human error. \u201cSomeone could have called in something wrong,\u201d he said.Mr. LaFayette said that the unofficial results had been merely provided as a convenience, \u201cso that the people can have fun and declare themselves a winner.\u201dIf Mr. Carson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s votes had counted, it could have made a tiny difference in the number of delegates that Mr. Trump and Gov. John Kasich won in New York.Consider the unofficial results in the 13th Congressional District, which stretches from Upper Manhattan to parts of the Bronx. Three delegates are awarded for each district, and if one candidate wins a majority of votes, he receives all three. If no one earns a majority, the candidate with the most votes receives two delegates and the runner-up receives one as long as he wins at least 20 percent of the vote.Excluding Mr. Carson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s votes, Mr. Trump won 50.5 percent in the 13th district, which would give him three delegates if those results stand. But if Mr. Carson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s votes were included, Mr. Trump would win only 49.2 percent, giving him two delegates and Mr. Kasich, who came in second place, the other one.Mr. Kasich\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief strategist, John Weaver, wrote on Twitter on Wednesday that \u00e2\u0080\u009call votes\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including Mr. Carson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0094 should count in New York.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are exploring our options,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a spokesman for the campaign, Mike Schrimpf, said on Thursday.Results are not yet official, but as it stands, Mr. Trump picked up at least 89 delegates on Tuesday, according to The Associated Press, and Mr. Kasich won at least four.

{"Headline": "Media Websites Battle Faltering Ad Revenue and Traffic", "Date": "2016-04-17", "News": "Supported byThis month, Mashable, a site that had just raised $15 million, laid off 30 people. Salon, a web publishing pioneer, announced a new round of budget cuts and layoffs. And BuzzFeed, which has been held up as a success story, was forced to bat back questions about its revenue \u2014 but not before founders at other start-up media companies received calls from anxious investors.The trouble, the publishers say, is twofold. The web advertising business, always unpredictable, became more treacherous. And website traffic plateaued at many large sites, in some cases falling \u2014 a new and troubling experience after a decade of exuberant growth.Online publishers have faced numerous financial challenges in recent years, including automated advertising and ad-blocking tools. But now, there is a realization that something more profound has happened: The transition from an Internet of websites to an Internet of mobile apps and social platforms, and Facebook in particular, is no longer coming \u2014 it is here.It is a systemic change that is leaving many publishers unsure of how they will make money.\u201cWith each turn of the screw, people began to realize, viscerally, that this is what it feels like to not be in control of your destiny,\u201d said Scott Rosenberg, a co-founder of Salon who left the company in 2007.Audiences drove the change, preferring to refresh their social feeds and apps instead of visiting website home pages. As social networks grew, visits to websites in some ways became unnecessary detours, leading to the weakened traffic numbers for news sites. Sales staffs at media companies struggled to explain to clients why they should buy ads for a fragmented audience rather than go to robust social networks instead.Advertisers adjusted spending accordingly. In the first quarter of 2016, 85 cents of every new dollar spent in online advertising will go to Google or Facebook, said Brian Nowak, a Morgan Stanley analyst.The power shift was made clear last week as the Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg took the stage for the company\u2019s annual developer conference. He stood in front of a diagram outlining an audacious 10-year expansion plan, which included several features to help keep people inside Facebook\u2019s world instead of following links out.\u201cMessenger is going to be the next big platform for sharing privately, and for helping you connect with services in all kinds of new ways,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said, after demonstrating a CNN chat bot on stage.At the same time, publishers pored over a report from the analytics firm Parse.ly, detailing how important Facebook had become to their business: Among sites tracked by the firm, more than 40 percent of web traffic came from the social network.Facebook\u2019s users seem to be following Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s lead. NewsWhip, which tracks how publishers are performing across major Internet platforms, says the rate at which links to outside websites are shared on Facebook, compared with videos and Instant Articles, has declined.Liam Corcoran, NewsWhip\u2019s communications director, says that in recent months a wide range of publishers have called him to ask whether sudden drops in Facebook reach are widespread, and asking how they might be remedied \u2014 as if they were asking how to cure a disease.\u201cIt\u2019s a doctor\u2019s office,\u201d he said.So far, publishers are responding in a variety of ways. With the help of venture capital funding, companies like BuzzFeed and Vox are investing heavily in video production with a focus on TV and film. Others, like Mashable, are diverting resources to increasing their audience on Facebook, hoping that enough money \u2014 through revenue-sharing arrangements with the company \u2014 will follow.\u201cWe invest in a number of strategies, then figure out which strategies are most effective,\u201d Pete Cashmore, Mashable\u2019s founder, said in an interview.Others are planning to do less with less. \u201cWe talk about our business as though we\u2019re in a shrinking market, and plan accordingly,\u201d said Alex Magnin, chief revenue officer at Thought Catalog, an essay site.Online news sites have watched the rise of social platforms closely. Publishers have started in recent years to obsessively monitor the ways in which their readers arrived at their sites. The sheer speed with which Facebook, Twitter, Google and Snapchat have come to dominate the landscape has taken publishers by surprise.In 2014, Gawker Media\u2019s founder, Nick Denton, wrote a memo to his staff that admonished them for giving in too fully to the influence of platforms, which drove many of his company\u2019s most popular stories. \u201cWe \u2014 the freest journalists on the planet \u2014 were slaves to the Facebook algorithm,\u201d he wrote.Looking back at 2015, however, Mr. Denton, once known for harsh assessments of the media business, struck a conciliatory tone.\u201cThe Instant Articles deal seems great,\u201d he said in an interview last week. \u201cUsers get relevant stories and relevant ads. It\u2019s the realization of that particular Internet dream.\u201dMr. Denton said he was hopeful, like many publishers, that deep \u201cniche\u201d brands have something to offer advertisers. E-commerce partnerships, in which publishers are paid commissions by retailers for products recommended, or mentioned, on their sites, now cover the company\u2019s editorial spending. The arrangement largely sidesteps social networks, but relies on agreements with another huge partner: Amazon.Other companies are looking to focus more on branded content like videos, sponsored stories and full-fledged campaigns. But publishers have quickly learned that those efforts are labor-intensive and put them in direct competition with advertising agencies.Mr. Malik of Gigaom, whose site employed 85 people at its peak, said if he were to start the business today, it would probably be a Facebook page. There is an opportunity, clearly, to reach people there.Money? That\u2019s another matter.\u201cHow do I monetize?\u201d he asked. \u201cStill not clear.\u201dJim Rutenberg contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Politics of Backlash", "Date": "2016-04-04", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 There is a global backlash against rising inequality, stagnant middle-class incomes, politicians for sale, social exclusion, offshoring of jobs, free trade, mass immigration, tax systems skewed for giant corporations and their bosses, and what Pope Francis has lambasted as the \u201cunfettered pursuit of money.\u201dThe backlash takes various forms. In the United States it has produced an angry election campaign. The success of both Donald Trump on the right and Bernie Sanders on the left owes a lot to the thirst for radical candidates who break the mold. Trump is unserious and incoherent; Sanders is neither of those things. But they both draw support from constituencies that feel stuck, reject politics as usual, and perceive a system rigged against them.Hillary Clinton\u2019s chief predicament, apart from the trust issue, is that she represents the past in a world where the post-cold-war optimism that accompanied her husband\u2019s arrival in the White House almost a quarter-century ago has vanished. To embody continuity these days is political suicide.There are similar feelings \u2014 of being unheard or excluded \u2014 behind the rise of the leftist Jeremy Corbyn to the leadership of the Labour Party in Britain, and the \u201cBrexit\u201d movement that seeks to \u201cfree\u201d Britain from the imagined stranglehold of Brussels bureaucrats.Anger over the direction of globalization \u2014 particularly the meltdown of 2008 (and the impunity of its financial architects) and the austerity that followed \u2014 explains the election of the left-wing Syriza government in Greece, headed by Alexis Tsipras. On the European right, Marine Le Pen and her National Front party in France, and the Sweden Democrats, draw support from anti-immigrant and anti-globalization sentiments.As in the United States, right and left produce distinct politicians who tap an overlapping pool of resentments. The similarities between American and European politics are greater now than in many years because societies on both sides of the Atlantic face similar dilemmas. Sanders, Corbyn and Tsipras; Trump and Le Pen: The parallels are striking.But of course what I called a global backlash is not really one. It\u2019s confined to Western developed societies. In the developing world, the past two decades have seen hundreds of millions of people emerge from abject poverty and join the \u201cconsuming class.\u201dMany of these new consumers now have access to education, health services and opportunity. That\u2019s a huge gain for humanity. The problem is the rise of the rest \u2014 with its accompanying transfer of jobs, investment and optimism from places like Ohio or Alsace-Lorraine to places like Vietnam or Indonesia \u2013 has created a bitter class made up of the losers in this global shift.They are Trump\u2019s people, and Le Pen\u2019s.Steven Weisman, in his intriguing book \u201cThe Great Tradeoff: Confronting Moral Conflicts in the Era of Globalization,\u201d observes that in recent decades the bottom third of the world\u2019s population have gained \u201cwith many of them escaping destitution.\u201d The middle third has become richer, while the \u201ctop 1 percent, and to a lesser extent the top 5 percent, have gained significantly.\u201d The losers have been the 20 percent below that top swathe, with stagnant real incomes or minimal gains. \u201cThey represent the working class in the United States and other advanced countries.\u201dSo the picture is mixed. Emergent societies have done well, even if some like Brazil have now lost their way, deluged in corruption. But what the angry politics of the developed world show is that the current trends are untenable. Another two decades of neo-liberal, reward-the-rich, trust-globalization-to-deliver politics will lead to social breakdown, the triumph of demagogues, and perhaps mayhem. A rising tide may raise all yachts. It does not raise all boats.Those words were written decades ago. They are no less valid today. Justice and fairness have lost out in the West to \u201cthose who wish to dominate.\u201d If this election cycle can be viewed positively, it is as a clear warning that something is rotten in America and must change.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Democratic Debate Serves as Clear Display of Love Lost", "Date": "2016-04-15", "News": "The Brooklyn-based Democratic debate between Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, possibly the last before the party convention in July, evoked a singular memory for some New York reporters: It was of a photograph of Edward I. Koch and Mario M. Cuomo sitting on a couch in a holding room for a mayoral debate in 1977, clearly sick of each other. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders were very much at that point on Thursday evening, often shouting over and interrupting each other. Mr. Sanders, in particular, seemed angry, as he deployed his new, on-offense stance while saying he was provoked by Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s team. The tenor may have turned off undecided Democrats, but it made for an intense and engaged debate. Mr. Sanders needed a major breakout moment to change the trajectory of the race. He did not get one. But he also nicked Mrs. Clinton repeatedly on issues like her paid speeches to Wall Street firms, remarks that will energize his base and will add to his belief that he should stay in the race for the foreseeable future. Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best answer was on the topic of guns: She repeatedly laid into Mr. Sanders for his record on a vote that benefited gun manufacturers and for his remarks in his earliest races in Vermont, a state with a thriving gun culture. The topic resonates deeply with the Democratic base, and Mr. Sanders struggled to answer questions about that support. He also stuck to his remark that Mrs. Clinton won the \u00e2\u0080\u009cDeep South,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a veiled point about her wins among heavily African-American primary voters. Mrs. Clinton, for her part, struggled to come up with a clear answer on why she will not release transcripts from the Wall Street speeches. But the other significant moment of the night was when Mr. Sanders talked about Israel, in the heart of a city with a large Jewish population. He was blunt in criticizing Israeli policies toward the Palestinians, and he received large cheers in the debate hall, a reminder that the politics in the Democratic Party about Israel may have shifted more than has been conventionally reported. Mr. Sanders, appearing on television after the debate, mentioned that Mrs. Clinton had support from a \u00e2\u0080\u009cdark money\u00e2\u0080\u009d group, known as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cC4\u00e2\u0080\u009d for its tax status. It indicated a new line of attack he might use. But it also indicated, plainly, that while Mr. Sanders is not growing his base of support, he is not shrinking it either, and he is likely to remain in the race through the convention.  \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

For almost two years, European Union citizens have been able to apply to have links to certain web search results taken down.

More than anyone else, Google. How do they decide whether the application is warranted? Google won\u2019t say.European Union officials appear to think Google is acting fairly, but that doesn\u2019t answer the question of why Google should be policing itself. The answer to that appears to be that no one else has the money and know-how to effectively do the job.As the Internet gets to be a bigger part of everyone\u2019s lives, it may increasingly be that only the biggest Internet companies can do Internet-scale tasks.

It would be interesting to see whether Alibaba and Baidu have more computational and data power than the Chinese government.Much the way it curates much of what happens on the Internet, Google has spent years scanning books to create its searchable corpus.

As the scandal built, she resigned on Tuesday as parliamentary private secretary to John McDonnell, the party\u2019s spokesman on the economy.But another Labour legislator, Lisa Nandy, called on the party to suspend Ms. Shah pending an investigation. \u201cThere is a real problem for the Labour Party if we don\u2019t look like we are taking these things seriously,\u201d she told the BBC. \u201cBut this is not just about the impact on the Labour Party, there is also the question here about what is the right thing to do.\u201dIn Parliament later in the day, Prime Minister David Cameron said it was \u201cextraordinary\u201d that Ms. Shah was still a full member of Labour\u2019s parliamentary party and also urged suspension. \u201cAnti-Semitism is effectively racism and we should call it out and fight it whenever we see it,\u201d he said.Labour said later that a suspension was agreed upon mutually by Mr. Corbyn and Ms. Shah while the party\u2019s national executive committee investigates.In 2014, before being elected, Ms. Shah endorsed a Facebook post displaying a graphic that showed Israel\u2019s outline superimposed on a map of the United States. The map was under the headline, \u201cSolution for Israel-Palestine conflict \u2014 relocate Israel into United States,\u201d with the comment, \u201cProblem solved.\u201dThe post suggested the United States had \u201cplenty of land\u201d to accommodate Israel as a 51st state, allowing Palestinians to \u201cget their life and their land back.\u201d It said Israelis would be welcome and safe in America, while the \u201ctransportation cost\u201d would be less than three years\u2019 worth of Washington\u2019s support for Israeli defense spending.Ms. Shah added a note suggesting the plan might \u201csave them some pocket money.\u201dIn a statement, Ms. Shah said: \u201cI made these posts at the height of the Gaza conflict in 2014, when emotions were running high around the Middle East conflict.

{"Headline": "Renewable Energy Stumbles Toward the Future", "Date": "2016-04-22", "News": "Supported byIt was just last summer that SunEdison was a Wall Street darling, the very air around the fast-growing company seeming to shimmer with potential.There is a timeless element to SunEdison\u2019s swift demise: an executive with an Icarus complex chasing a fast-growing market embarks on an aggressive strategy fueled by cheap debt. Soar. Crash. Burn. Repeat.Yet the collapse raises a bigger question: Can renewable-energy companies be profitable? Can green make green?The answer, of course, is yes. Just as soon as they cross over a fundamental hurdle: finding a strategy that actually works.\u201cWe haven\u2019t totally figured out exactly what the business models are going to look like, for who wins and who loses,\u201d said Jason Bordoff, director of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University.Significantly, though, the sudden decline in oil prices isn\u2019t largely to blame. The difficulties run much deeper, echoing industrial collapses of earlier eras \u2014 the telecom-industry boom and bust of the 1990s and early 2000s, and disruptive cycles before that.On the surface, the various green-energy companies all seem to be pursuing different strategies. But there is a unifying problem they have yet to overcome: Finding enough customers to support the costly infrastructure they must first build.SunEdison is far from being the only troubled green-energy business.What\u2019s remarkable is that these leading energy companies are struggling at a time when regulatory, public and investor support for the renewable-energy industry has arguably never been greater.Moreover, investors around the world sank hundreds of billions of dollars into clean-energy technologies last year even as the prices of competing fossil fuels \u2014 oil and natural gas \u2014 tumbled.Though development in renewable energy climbed in the last 15 years, the industry is still widely considered to be in its early stages. Nonetheless, there has been a race among companies to develop, commercialize and eventually prosper from what many see as one of the largest tectonic economic shifts in decades.And in the United States, the federal government recently approved a major new transmission line to move wind-generated electricity east from the Great Plains.But all good bubbles burst. What is happening in renewable energy now has similarities to the telecommunications bubble of the 1990s. Led by hard-charging executives seeking big paydays, giants like WorldCom, Global Crossing and Adelphia started far-reaching acquisition and capital-expenditure programs \u2014 burning through billions of dollars \u2014 to buy cable companies or bury long-haul fiber-optic cable under land and sea. They were all chasing expected high demand and soaring revenues from the dawn of the Internet.But the infrastructure they created lived on. Last weekend, when you binge-watched the fourth season of \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d or streamed your own cooking show on Facebook Live, chances are better than not that your data zoomed through at least some of those networks.In that case, it turned out that if you build it, they will indeed come. But as many renewable energy companies are learning, building it costs dearly.Even before SunEdison, the landscape of green energy companies was littered with failed strategies.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.Part of the conundrum for these companies is that the most effective way to cut costs has been to grow, to take advantage of economies of scale, certain forms of financing and generous subsidies that were set to expire.But with all that growth has come debt, and an inability to show a profit, even if the companies are creating value.\u201cClearly in a market that has had a lot of growth, you are going to have some companies \u2014 and in this case many companies \u2014 that try to do too much, too fast,\u201d said Shawn Kravetz, founder of Esplanade Capital, which invests in solar power. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to see a shakeout.\u201dBut it is especially the case at SunEdison, where its chief executive, Ahmad R. Chatila, set about expanding, seemingly in all directions at once.\u201dThis is going to be a big industry globally, but we\u2019re stumbling and bumbling to get there,\u201d said Erik Gordon, a clinical assistant professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan. \u201cIf they weren\u2019t trying to beat each other to the next rooftop they wouldn\u2019t be needing to do this financial engineering.\u201dStill, industry analysts and executives say that despite the fall of SunEdison, the future for renewable energy is bright.Indeed, there are a few stalwarts in the renewable-energy race.Take First Solar. The company, which supplies solar panels and develops solar farms, has had its share of troubles. It has been the target of shareholder lawsuits claiming it hid big problems and misrepresented its prospects. Its stock, at $62 a share, is a far cry from its bubble-peak of $311 in the spring of 2008.But by adopting a slower-growth strategy and reducing debt, First Solar is a rarity in the green-energy industry. It is profitable. Last year, the company made $546 million on $3.6 billion in revenue.For now, First Solar may be an anomaly, particularly amid uncertainty around the presidential election and the policy stances of candidates like Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump on renewable energy sources. Some warn that a lull could settle over the industry in the short term.\u201cThe Secretary Clinton perspective on lots of distributed clean energy couldn\u2019t be more different than the Trump view,\u201d said Daniel M. Kammen, the director of the Renewable and Appropriate Energy Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cThat could mean hugely different things for the growth of the industry.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Al Sharpton, Mrs. Clinton declared that \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmerica\u2019s long struggle with racism is far from finished\u00e2\u0080\u009d and presented an agenda that included overhauling the criminal justice system and eliminating lead as a major public threat within five years of taking office. A scattering of audience members occasionally applauded.Each year, Mr. Sharpton hosts presidential candidates and other influential speakers at his New York City conference. Senator Bernie Sanders is scheduled to address the convention on Thursday. Mrs. Clinton focused on specific policy items, including expanding low-income housing tax credits, matching $10,000 in savings for a down payment for blacks who lag behind whites in home ownership, and a new plan \u00e2\u0080\u009cto fight environmental justice across America.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cRace is the single biggest factor determining whether you live near a toxic site, from \u2018asthma alley\u2019 in the Bronx to \u2018cancer alley\u2019 in Louisiana,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, vowing to clean up lead found in water and schools and other environmental hazards that disproportionately affect black Americans. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe reverend asked me to be substantive,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she told the crowd.The gathering was somber this year, as Mr. Sharpton and other keynote speakers bemoaned that in January a white president will be inaugurated to replace the nation\u2019s first black president. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be a real hard day for us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Angela Rye, chief executive of the consulting firm Impact Strategies, who spoke before Mrs. Clinton.Addressing the crowd, John D. Podesta, Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign chairman and a former aide to President Obama, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just want it to be the first time a white president replaces a black president, but the first time a woman replaces a man president.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe crowd was silent.One of Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest applause lines came when she said: \u201cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think President Obama gets the credit he deserves for digging us out of the ditch the Republicans put us in in the first place.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  She did not discuss the 1994 crime bill, which her husband, Bill Clinton, signed into law as president and which both she and Mr. Sanders supported at the time.

{"Headline": "Does a Video Glimpse Into Chicago\u2019s Year of Violence?", "Date": "2016-04-01", "News": "Supported byCHICAGO \u2014 As the video begins, a man in a baseball cap and sweatshirt is on a street, moving in a circle as he talks into a camera he seems to be holding. Suddenly the sounds of pops, one after the next, interrupt. The camera flips to different views, then lands face up, pointed to the sky, as a gunman steps into clear view, still shooting.It is a jarring, disturbing, highly cinematic video, and the police are trying to determine whether it really is what it looks like: a selfie video that inadvertently recorded the man\u2019s own shooting. Since it emerged Thursday night, the video has taken off on social media.Anthony Guglielmi, a spokesman for the Chicago police, said the department suspected that the video may have captured a shooting that was known to take place Thursday afternoon along a South Side street \u2014 the latest in what has been a gruesome rash of more than 600 shootings in this city so far this year. But Mr. Guglielmi said the department had not verified a link between the video and the shooting, and could not be certain it was legitimate.A man who was shot was in critical condition, the police said, having been shot four or five times, but they had not yet been able to learn from him whether he was the man in the video. Law enforcement authorities said the wounded man was 30 and a known gang member who had been released from prison not long ago.Some experts say Chicago\u2019s uptick in shootings and killings may be an anomaly, but it has caused deep concern here. Officials said many of the shootings involved the city\u2019s increasingly splintered web of gangs, with a growing number of disputes now playing out on social media sites \u2014 the equivalent of gang graffiti from another era.Not long after the shooting on Thursday, the police said they found the video on Facebook during what has become a routine search of social media in such investigations. As soon as calls of shootings and other violence come in, police analysts begin scanning for related chatter, videos and postings. \u201cThat\u2019s in our playbook at this point \u2014 we canvass on the street and we canvass digitally,\u201d Mr. Guglielmi said.By Friday afternoon, no arrests had been made in the shooting that took place Thursday near 56th Street and Hoyne Avenue. The police said the shooter fled in a vehicle.The video, which was being shared widely on Facebook and Twitter, remained a puzzle for the authorities. After the camera falls to the ground, pointing up at a blue sky and a stop sign, the apparent shooter can be seen raising a gun right above the camera. Faint music can be heard and people call out about taking the wounded man to a hospital.

{"Headline": "Female Architects on the Significance of Zaha Hadid", "Date": "2016-04-01", "News": "Supported by\u201cA client of ours said to me he didn\u2019t want any of my female colleagues to work on his project,\u201d Ms. Jiricna said. \u201cIt was completely incomprehensible.\u201dThe New York Times would like to hear from women in the architecture field about what Zaha Hadid meant to them.\u201cFor young architects here, especially the female ones, she was like a great princess,\u201d Mr. Mahmoud said in a telephone interview from Damascus. \u201cFor us, it was like: If Zaha Hadid could go to London and be a great architect and build for the Olympics and in China and everywhere, then why can\u2019t we do that? And that was very strong for the women I studied with.\u201dThe architect Richard Meier recalled how several architects used to gather casually for dinner at the Century Club in New York, including Philip Johnson, Michael Graves and Peter Eisenman. \u201cZaha was the first woman, as far as I can remember, to attend one,\u201d Mr. Meier said. \u201cShe had a sense of herself that she could fit in wherever she wanted. She knew that what she did was highly respected.\u201dMs. Hadid\u2019s ambitious architecture spanned the globe. Here\u2019s a look at some of the highlights.Initially, Ms. Hadid seemed to resist the idea of serving as a role model because of her gender.\u201cShe\u2019s a woman architect who never wanted to be called a woman architect \u2014 she was just an architect and one of the best ones,\u201d said Amale Andraos, the dean of Columbia University\u2019s architecture school. \u201cBut clearly she broke new ground by being a woman, by not being Western, by being educated all over the world \u2014 there is so much she enabled.\u201d\u201cI used to not like being called a woman architect: I\u2019m an architect, not just a woman architect,\u201d Ms. Hadid said after winning the award, in an interview with CNN. \u201cGuys used to tap me on the head and say, \u2018You are O.K. for a girl.\u2019 But I see the incredible amount of need from other women for reassurance that it could be done, so I don\u2019t mind that at all.\u201dDespite her efforts over the years to be judged on the merits of her work, the news media often included discussion of her physical appearance or manner, rather than her professional performance.\u201cCan you imagine the leading practitioners in other professions treated to such personal scrutiny on receiving a major award?\u201d asked Robert Ivy, in Architectural Record, after Ms. Hadid won the Pritzker. \u201cMarie Curie, for instance, subjected to fashion commentary? Or Nobel Laureate Toni Morrison appraised for her hairstyle? In receiving the Pritzker, Hadid joins those noble ranks and deserves better. Architecture deserves better.\u201dNevertheless, over the years, Ms. Hadid continued to be criticized for headstrong behavior that her friends say would have gone unnoticed in a man.\u201cEverybody knows her as a diva and as a tough woman,\u201d the architect Thom Mayne said. \u201cShe\u2019s tough because she\u2019s in a profession that takes toughness to get through it. She has this great sense of humor and is actually a very motherly, caring person. Funny, incredibly loyal. She was a sweetheart. And it\u2019s not the part that most of the world sees.\u201dTegan Bukowski, a former student of Ms. Hadid\u2019s at the Yale School of Architecture, who now works in the London office of Ms. Hadid\u2019s practice, said the office was rare in the profession, not only because it was nearly equally split between men and women.\u201cZaha herself was a role model, but she also created role models in the company by making sure that women thrived,\u201d Ms. Bukowski said. \u201cShe never held down men at all, but it was just about your work and your talent. It never felt like gender was an issue. Because she basically just leveled the playing field in a way that I\u2019ve never seen in any other practice before. And it makes me so sad to think about her being gone because I think, Who can I look up to like that now?\u201dAdvertisement"}
