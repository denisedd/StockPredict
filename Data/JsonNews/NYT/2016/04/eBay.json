The action can make sense when it is related to a high street brand obviously copying a runway look, but the approach has been extended to humorous takeoffs, as when Yves Saint Laurent went after a T-shirt company in 2013 for selling a style emblazoned with the words \u201cAin\u2019t Laurent without Yves\u201d (a response to the new artistic director Hedi Slimane\u2019s decision to rename the ready-to-wear line Saint Laurent). It caused some understandable eye-rolling among industry-watchers and consumers, but not enough to significantly alter the brand mood.The Vetements folks, however, seem more amused than charged up by Mr. Tran\u2019s homage. \u201cVetements will not be filing any lawsuits over the Vetememes raincoat and hope that he has enjoyed making his project as much as we do making our clothes,\u201d Mr. Gvasalia said in an email.Well, there you go.That will probably come as something of a relief to Mr. Tran, who said he had not bothered to consult a lawyer when making his raincoat, and who is kind of hoping that his newfound fame might lead to a life in fashion as opposed to architecture. \u201cI\u2019m just a dumb kid,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cHopefully, I can use this to create more stuff.\u201dBeyond his own career, however, the Vetements case \u2014 or lack of it \u2014 could have potentially broader implications, especially given Mr. Gvasalia\u2019s role at Balenciaga, which is owned by Kering, which also happens to own Saint Laurent.

In the 21st century, it is not impossible to imagine an Internet revolution beginning in China.That possibility is, as with so many aspects of China, a function of scale. Alibaba, the sprawling Chinese digital marketplace, is already by some measures larger than Amazon. Its payment tool Alipay alone accounts for one-third of the $2.5 trillion global online payments market. The dizzying rise of the company is a crucial part of China\u2019s ascension as a global economic power, and if you\u2019ve never heard of the company, rest assured that you will. When the Alibaba founder Jack Ma appeared onstage last year at a summit in Manila with Barack Obama, Obama interviewed him.We often think of successful tech C.E.O.s climbing from the nerdy ranks of tinkering programmers, like Bill Gates, but as \u201cAlibaba,\u201d Duncan Clark\u2019s engaging biography explains, Ma\u2019s humble origins gave no clue to his future \u2014 then again, in 1970s China, the very idea of a homegrown technology business executive was inconceivable. Born in 1964 to a photographer and a factory worker, Ma grew up a mediocre student in the city of Hangzhou. About the only thing that set Ma apart was learning English, which he would practice by speaking to tourists passing through his hometown. One of these tourists, a vacationing Australian Communist, became a generous benefactor who even helped buy a house for young Ma and his wife.After a stint teaching English, Ma began running a tiny translation business, focused on Chinese companies \u2014 beginning to flourish under Deng Xiaoping \u2014 seeking to do business with the West. During his first visit to the United States in the mid-90s, a friend in Seattle logged Ma onto the Internet, and it occurred to him that listing Chinese companies online might be a good idea.If you think early American web pioneers had a tough time persuading investors and consumers to embrace the scary new world of e-commerce, imagine the challenge Ma\u2019s start-up faced: Most of China had no Internet, so his early clients were handing him thousands of dollars to create web services they themselves could not see. \u201cI was treated like a con man for three years,\u201d Ma said.Soon enough, though, his clients answered their phones to find curious Western customers on the line. In the late \u201990s, as the Chinese government began a delicate program of encouraging Internet growth without giving up state control, Ma\u2019s \u201cChina Pages\u201d and several other Chinese start-ups began to attract the attention of outside investors. That money, some of which came from the Japanese billionaire Masayosha Son, was rocket fuel for what became Alibaba, which has a massive shipping-logistics arm on top of its e-commerce services. When Alibaba went public in 2014, the $25 billion it raised made it the largest I.P.O. in world history (the next two, incidentally, were Chinese state-controlled enterprises).Clark is a China-based investment adviser and onetime consultant to Alibaba; he notes that his failure to exercise stock options he was given as payment became a $30-million mistake. The access he got to the company pushes his breezy account more toward the business than to Ma\u2019s personality. Still, Ma emerges as an unpretentious, self-deprecating leader, fond of quoting martial arts novels and \u201cForrest Gump.\u201d Yet he is clearly also shrewd and extremely driven. And his company has acquired enough wealth to begin to reshape the Western business world; he has announced a Netflix-style video streaming service and now has a movie division that invests in Hollywood blockbusters. The Chinese government\u2019s control over the Internet may still make political dissent difficult, but Ma and some others have demonstrated that there are few limits to building world-beating companies.James Ledbetter is the editor of Inc.

{"Headline": "Obama\u2019s Clemency Problem", "Date": "2016-04-01", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorEdina, Minn. \u2014 IN my pocket is something ancient: a 1,700-year-old Roman coin. It bears three human images and the word \u201cClementia.\u201d That was the name of the Roman goddess of mercy, who was often depicted standing beside (and holding the hand of) the Roman emperor. The message was clear: Mercy was a virtue not only of individuals but also of governments. The framers of the United States Constitution embraced that tradition when they preserved for the president one of the traditional powers of kings: the pardon power.That ancient ideal needs to be put into action by President Obama. Despite commuting on Wednesday the sentences of 61 federal prisoners convicted of drug and firearm crimes \u2014 bringing his total number of commutations to 248, more than that of his six predecessors combined \u2014 he is far from accomplishing the ambitious goals his administration publicly set out two years ago.In the spring of 2014, the Obama administration announced an initiative to consider granting clemency to thousands of federal prisoners serving what Mr. Obama called \u201cunjust\u201d sentences for low-level drug crimes. Federal prisoners were notified of the project, and more than 30,000 responded by submitting surveys to begin the process.Despite the relatively high number of commutations that Mr. Obama has now granted, there are still more than 9,000 pending commutation cases, many of the sort singled out in the 2014 initiative as potentially worthy. So why has the president acted on so few?Typically, a reluctance to exercise the pardon power is a result of political timidity. But in this case, the Obama administration already took the political risk two years ago when it announced the clemency initiative.The problem here is that too many cases can\u2019t be adequately considered by the president because of a sluggish and often intransigent review process. Clemency petitions undergo no fewer than seven levels of review, four of them within the Department of Justice. Within the Justice Department, clemency petitions run not only through the Office of the Pardon Attorney but also through the office of the deputy attorney general.When the pardon attorney, Deborah Leff, resigned in January, she complained in her letter of resignation that meritorious clemency cases had been thwarted by those above her. She noted in particular that some of her own recommendations had been overruled by the deputy attorney general, Sally Quillian Yates.It is not an incidental fact that Ms. Yates is a career prosecutor. When the Department of Justice reviews clemency cases, the opinions of prosecutors in the district of conviction are solicited and given considerable weight. But prosecutors are the wrong people for the task of vetting clemency cases. I was a federal prosecutor for five years. In that job, deciding someone\u2019s fate is a necessary but difficult emotional commitment. The prospect of being wrong \u2014 and a clemency initiative like Mr. Obama\u2019s can feel like a judgment that prosecutors were wrong \u2014 can be a lot to bear. We should not be surprised if, when it comes to Mr. Obama\u2019s clemency initiative, prosecutors systematically resist what is, in effect, an indictment of their work.President Obama can and should fix this problem with a simple executive order that places the Office of the Pardon Attorney in the White House, rather than at the bottom of the institutional structure at the Department of Justice. An empowered pardon attorney (or perhaps a pardon board, as we find in many states) would then report directly to the president. That would allow an independent but thorough review of clemency petitions free from the influence of career prosecutors.In addition, by reducing the number of levels of review, the president could focus more effectively on those cases that may matter most to him \u2014 for example, the hundreds of prisoners, nearly all of them black, who are serving excessively long terms under crack-cocaine laws that were subsequently reformed with the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010.If he is going to make good on his administration\u2019s promise from 2014, Mr. Obama needs to take action soon. And he should: The value of mercy is profound and lasting, as the coin in my pocket suggests.It may seem odd that I carry around with me an ancient Roman artifact, but the truth is that it cost only $28 on eBay. It\u2019s not a fake; it just isn\u2019t that rare. So many were minted that the supply remains large, even now. It is a striking image: millions of Roman subjects carrying around with them the name of the goddess of clemency.Her spirit, and that of the Constitution, should be remembered now. President Obama still has time to honor his promise.Advertisement"}

For the 2016 game, though, the brand wanted to reach more younger people, who tend to watch less TV.The company turned to Snapchat, the mobile photo messaging app popular with teens and millennials. Aiming to \u201cdemocratize the dunk,\u201d according to Kenny Mitchell, senior director of consumer engagement, Gatorade created a \u201csponsored lens\u201d ad that allowed people to overlay an animated dunk of the drink onto their selfies. They did so 165 million times in just two days.But should brands insert themselves into one of the most personal activities online? Many apps, such as games, allow advertising, but who wants ads from Pampers cluttering their most intimate chats with friends?Marketers are wary, too.\u201cIf we misstep with certain audiences, they\u2019ll unplug,\u201d said Suzy Deering, chief marketing officer at eBay.That doesn\u2019t mean brands are completely unwelcome on messaging apps. But it does mean that so far on these services, they are remarkably restrained in their approaches, focusing less on promotion and more on providing entertainment or utility \u2014 or both. In some cases, the marketing isn\u2019t even in the form of paid ads.On WhatsApp, for instance, the shoe brand Clarks avoided an overt sales pitch, and instead created three virtual characters to promote its venerable Desert Boot, allowing users to connect to them on the app to receive messages, videos and music playlists.Focus Features, a film division of NBCUniversal, used a chatbot created by Massively, an interactive marketing technology start-up, to promote its 2015 movie \u201cInsidious: Chapter 3.\u201d People could converse on the Kik chat app with a bot version of a main character in the film, Quinn Brenner. A sample snippet of a chat:Quinn: Do you believe in life after death?Me: Not really.Quinn: A little while ago I might have agreed with you\u2026 but lately\u2026This might sound crazy\u2026 but I tried to contact my mom on the other side.Me: Did it work?Quinn: It was like I could still feel her, you know? I thought if I just reached out, maybe I could speak with her. ...Over a period of a few days, the Quinn-bot sent increasingly intense messages about being haunted and threatened. Some 350,000 people exchanged an average of 69 messages. Kik, which has done 80 of these \u201cpromoted chat\u201d campaigns, on Tuesday plans to open a \u201cbot shop\u201d for consumers to try out more of them.\u201cBots are a creative canvas just starting to be realized,\u201d said Josh Jacobs, president of Kik Services, a company unit exploring messaging-related services like banking and shopping.In fact, these kinds of interactions might not be advertising at all. Several marketers say they are talking to Facebook about connecting clients to users of its Messenger app for personalized customer relations, such as answering questions or making appointments.\u201cAn interaction in messaging may look very different from other marketing,\u201d Matthew Idema, Facebook\u2019s vice president of monetization product marketing, said in an interview.In reality, nearly all the marketing in these apps remains experimental. Because the apps vary in their user appeal and acceptance of ads, companies often have to create different campaigns for each app, a costly and time-consuming process. And they lack the tools to track results as well as they can with other forms of advertising.Besides, said Kira Wampler, chief marketing officer at the ride-hailing service Lyft, \u201cWe have a lot on our plate with our other marketing channels.\u201dBut perhaps not for long. \u201cMessaging is a more human and conversational way to interact, much more powerful than throwing out a bunch of media dollars,\u201d said David Hewitt, a vice president for mobile strategy at the agency SapientNitro.An article on Monday about a Gatorade advertising campaign on Snapchat described incorrectly a function of the Gatorade \u201csponsored lens.\u201d It can overlay an animation of a bucket of Gatorade being dumped on a Snapchat user\u2019s photos or video clips. It cannot do the same on photos or video clips of the user\u2019s friends.Advertisement"}

The team used an internal version of group chat to communicate with one another while building the game. When Glitch was shuttered in 2012, Mr. Butterfield and his partners made the communication software the primary product offering.But critics warn that while Slack may have traction with tech companies and small start-ups, it could be difficult for the company to attract the even larger corporations that would provide significant repeat revenue over time.Recently, the ride-hailing service Uber dropped Slack because the service could not handle the thousands of Uber employees trying to communicate simultaneously, according to people who work at both companies.Advertisement"}

The bowls have survived papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 art projects (first hers, then her two children\u2019s) and endless reprises of chocolate-chip cookies. \u201cThey\u2019re almost an extension of who I am,\u201d Ms. Chia said.Her parents, born in China during World War II, fled with their families to Taiwan when the Communists came to power. \u201cThat kind of upheaval does something to you,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to abandon things.\u201dThey came to the United States for graduate school, unsure of their future: At the time, only 105 Chinese immigrants were allowed into the country each year.

{"Headline": "What Chatbots Reveal About Our Own Shortcomings", "Date": "2016-04-21", "News": "Supported byOn TechnologyEvery so often, an idea comes along that mesmerizes Silicon Valley and convinces the most powerful people there that this innovation will irrevocably alter the course of humankind. Outsize proclamations are made, lavish events are held and millions of dollars in venture money are funneled into young, unproven companies. Right now, that fixation has landed on chatbots, little artificial-intelligence programs that work like personalized assistants.In January, Sam Lessin, an entrepreneur and former Facebook employee who is working on his own chatbot called Fin, wrote a blog post breathlessly declaring the trend \u201ca fundamental shift that is going to change the types of applications that get developed and the style of service development in the Valley.\u201d If prominent investors, executives and entrepreneurs like Lessin are to be believed, the arrival of the chatbot heralds an entirely new phase of computing, one with the potential to overwrite the current app-centric model that smartphones rely on.In late March, Microsoft invited 5,000 developers to San Francisco for an annual conference called Build. A palpable sense of excitement surrounded the event: Microsoft intended to show off its latest achievement, a software tool kit that would allow anyone to use its A.I. platform to create custom chatbots. Though the company is often viewed as a dinosaur, it has introduced some surprisingly sleek products in recent years, and its bot tool kit seemed interesting enough.Over a live stream, I watched Satya Nadella, the chief executive, pacing triumphantly as he talked about the company\u2019s advances in machine learning and language processing. I nodded along as he described a \u201cpersonal digital assistant that knows you, knows about your world,\u201d a bot \u201chelping you with your everyday tasks.\u201d A few minutes later, an executive giddily showed off a chatbot that lets people order pizza via text message, Skype or Slack. The demonstration centered on what Microsoft presumably found most dazzling about the bot: It could be programmed to recognize slang. You can send it a message like \u201csup pizzabot, send a cheese pizza to my crib ASAP,\u201d and a cheese pizza will still arrive at your crib, ASAP.We\u2019ve long been promised a future augmented by intelligent helpers, of the type depicted in movies like \u201cHer\u201d: benevolent digital beings who remove some of the chaos of modern existence by organizing our lives, all the while offering emotional support through chipper encouragement and cute jokes. Sometimes, these helpers turn on us, as in \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey.\u201d Either way, artificial intelligence represents the manifestation of humanity\u2019s biggest hopes and fears for technology. But for now, it can help us order Domino\u2019s in a different window on the same device we would normally use to order Domino\u2019s.Commerce seems to be the primary preoccupation of the booming chatbot universe. There\u2019s Operator, an all-around assistant bot created by a founder of Uber; Assist, which lets people reserve hotels and concert tickets by text; and x.ai, which books appointments. In April, Facebook announced that it was introducing chatbots to its Messenger app, so that the company\u2019s 900 million users can order food and get the news, simply by \u201cchatting\u201d with the bots on their contact list. Like Facebook\u2019s, most of these bots work right inside messaging apps; it\u2019s like texting with a concierge, or if Siri birthed a litter of smarter, faster and nimbler offspring \u2014 ones you can issue orders to silently and who never get tired, or creeped out, by the nature of your requests.Outsourcing work to bots sounds ideal to me. My attitude toward technology is fueled by a desire for efficiency \u2014 and by laziness. In college, while my friends got into D.I.Y. hobbies like woodworking and sewing, I joked that I was ready for the D.I.F.M. \u2014 do-it-for-me \u2014 revolution. And yet for all the hype, none of these bots seem to work that well yet. Over the last few weeks, I\u2019ve played with a handful and have struggled to make much use of them. I recently needed to make a reservation for a work lunch. I fired up Operator to find me a table, and it quickly sent back a pleasant but unhelpful reply \u2014 declining my request, as it didn\u2019t yet have that capability.I also suspected that many chatbots depend on human workers to complete their requests. Mat Honan, the San Francisco bureau chief for BuzzFeed, was able to uncover the logistics behind M \u2014 a chatbot concierge in development by Facebook \u2014 by sending, of all things, a rental parrot to another Bay Area tech reporter. It worked; the parrot arrived. But afterward, Honan made some phone calls and discovered that M\u2019s artificial intelligence was largely a front. M processed the question and passed it along to a human counterpart to finish the job.Similarly, Operator, Magic and Fin all fall back on hybrid bot-human models. Seen this way, chatbots aren\u2019t that different from hiring a worker through a service like TaskRabbit or Handy, but without ever having to acknowledge there\u2019s another human at the other end. As the sheen of A.I. fades, you can see these chatbots for what they really are: a convenient way to hide human labor. It starts to resemble an update on a centuries-old illusion called the Mechanical Turk, a chess-playing device that was said to be automated but was, in fact, powered by a person hidden inside the \u201cmachinery\u201d itself.Even when the services are truly automated, their functions seem secondary to Facebook\u2019s quest for domination. Bots developed in partnership with CNN and The Wall Street Journal can deliver news headlines by Facebook Messenger; Operator and Spring let people shop from within Messenger for clothing and food. Disney built a bot based on the Muppet Miss Piggy that users can talk to if they are bored, and there\u2019s even a version of Zork, an early, text-based video game, that works in there, too. Eventually, Facebook users will be able to use bots to check movie times, bid on eBay items, browse for hotel deals on Expedia, place an order at Burger King and check their bank balances \u2014 all without ever having to exit Messenger.Indeed, it\u2019s hard not to see that as the depressing point of it all: These bots will simply help Facebook and others rope users in as long as possible, like fishermen trawling the open seas with gaping nets. The current slate of chatbots on Facebook look like innovation clipped for the sake of supremacy. The company has been moving in this direction for some time now. Everything from Facebook Live, its new real-time streaming product, to Internet.org, the nonprofit it oversees that seeks to provide Internet access to the developing world, has been accused of harboring the same goal: keeping users on Facebook\u2019s turf.Bots, which promise to make us more godlike, are instead revealing our all-too-human shortcomings and pettiness. This was on full display when Microsoft tried to show off the prowess of its A.I. in March with a chatbot named Tay, a virtual buddy you could talk to on messaging services like GroupMe and Twitter. Almost immediately, the demonstration turned into a public-relations nightmare as online pranksters taught Tay to mimic hate speech (e.g., \u201cHitler was right I hate the Jews\u201d; \u201cI [expletive] hate feminists and they should all die and burn in hell\u201d). Tay\u2019s rants weren\u2019t the intended work of Microsoft, obviously, but the meltdown revealed an uncomfortable truth: A bot, like any other piece of software, is only as good as its makers\u2019 imagination. Technologies embody the values \u2014 and the biases and prejudices \u2014 of the society that incubates them, and if we can\u2019t imagine the future we want, then neither can our creations.Jenna Wortham is a staff writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}

Now, there\u2019s a separate question \u2014 we can talk about the \u201cthird side,\u201d which would be the writers.Something like a Tumblr or Medium \u2014 a place where people can just post? Yes, where there\u2019s clearly a direct interaction, and there\u2019s a lot more control by the two sides \u2014 it\u2019s truly on the platform, not a lot of control exerted by the publication as an aggregator.How would you then describe, in similar terms, what a company like Facebook is \u2014 or a company like Snapchat?Facebook, I always say it\u2019s at least a four-sided platform. They have users, they have advertisers, they have third-party application developers, and then finally they have websites that use the Facebook Connect system \u2014 which is to say that you can log in with your Facebook credentials.Where does a company that is producing professional video or journalism for Facebook \u2014 publishing those directly on Facebook and getting some kind of revenue \u2014 fit in?So, basically they\u2019re adding one extra side, which we can call \u201cpremium content publishers,\u201d broadly. It makes sense, and it\u2019s very similar to the transformation that YouTube has gone through. They went from having pretty much one side \u2014 when they started off, for the first few years, everyone was a user. As a user you could watch videos or post videos. But everyone was the same. Sometimes I watch, sometimes I post; some people just watch, some people just post. But they are all the same users. Now they\u2019ve become a lot more sophisticated, with advertising and revenue sharing, and with professional video producers.If a publication-style business becomes a participant in a marketplace like Facebook, what has changed for it?This has been an ongoing concern. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re an established company, and now there\u2019s a multisided platform in your business, what happens? And say you have to play on that multisided platform, because they\u2019re big and everyone else is playing, so you need to get on top of it. The concern is always commoditization. I think partly it\u2019s true \u2014 what a platform does, to some degree, is introduce a lowest common denominator. In particular, they make the substitution, or the switching cost, between the different players a lot lower. I think that\u2019s undeniable. It\u2019s much easier to switch between, say, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal as a user, and as an advertiser by the way, if those are on top of Facebook.When Amazon emerged as the pre-eminent e-commerce platform, a lot of big companies said, we need to find a way to play with them \u2014 it seems like there\u2019s a lot of e-commerce going on there, and we can\u2019t ignore it, so we need to do something. Toys \u201cR\u201d Us struck a deal that turned out later to be not very advantageous. Initially, it was a good deal for Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, and it gave them access to Amazon\u2019s customers. But afterward what happened was Amazon found ways to take advantage of Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, using the relationship, and its presence on their platform, to start a toy category on Amazon, to figure out how to sell toys on Amazon, and then to invite a lot of competing companies on the same platform to compete with Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, which made it a lot less attractive for them to be there.Essentially, they overlooked the possibility that Amazon would just use them as a way to start a category of toys \u2014 they somehow assumed it would be exclusive, without putting it in the contract. And, obviously, if I\u2019m a platform, of course I don\u2019t want to be exclusive with anyone, right? I mean, that\u2019s the point of a platform. I want to have as much competition between whatever participants as possible.So if we grant some sort of comparison between a publishing partner\u2019s relationship with a large distribution platform and a retailer\u2019s relationship with Amazon, that might sound alarming? How do pre-existing companies typically make the transition from being an independent participant in a particular category to being, basically, a platform constituent? That\u2019s a broad question, but \u2014 is there an industry that might have useful parallels to the media industry with something like a major social platform?I don\u2019t think it\u2019s true that transitioning from independence to life on a platform necessarily has to make things worse. One thing that I think a lot about \u2014 in conversations with venture capitalists and others \u2014 is the notion that platforms or marketplaces inherently commoditize. I think more likely what\u2019s happening is the following: I think platforms, or marketplaces, make it a lot easier for, say, the content providers or app developers that are very, very good to rise to the top, and pretty much commoditize everyone else. So if you\u2019re average, it\u2019s definitely going to be very bad. Life is going to be worse on a platform, because you\u2019re exposed to more competition. If you\u2019re very good, life on a platform is a lot better.It\u2019s a little bit like, if you ask drivers how they rate their driving ability, you know, 80 percent say they\u2019re above average. The important qualifier to what I said earlier, about how the best rise to the top, is that, inherently, the platforms force a lot more specialization than before. Previously, in the independent world, players were able to afford to be a little bit broader. I think the problem is, now, you really have to think very deeply, a lot more carefully \u2014 what, exactly, are the one or two things we\u2019re really good at, and focus on those. So there\u2019s going to be a lot of forced specialization, because on a platform, competition will be vertical by vertical.In a case like Facebook, the content was largely there before \u2014 in the form of links.It makes perfect sense, right, to bring more of that content inside, because they can increase engagement.Things load faster, it\u2019s a better experience, and posts and videos are created with Facebook in mind, which means they might feel better inside the platform.Yes, and they want to do as much as possible \u2014 ideally, for them, they want to get as much content as they can to increase readership. There\u2019s probably a function between the well-being of the platform and the quality of the content that they have.This is harder \u2014 for video games, right now, the large game developers are nonexclusive. They used to be more exclusive, and I think this has decreased over time \u2014 it\u2019s become very hard to convince, say, Electronic Arts to give up the Xbox One market to work with the PlayStation. So that has definitely played against the platforms. Game platforms always try to buy or produce their own games for differentiation, but it\u2019s very hard.A different example, the other way, is online video \u2014 Netflix and Amazon. The problem there is very similar. Everyone has, basically, the same movies by now. So this has pushed Netflix and Amazon to start producing their own content. If I\u2019m one of the original providers \u2014 studios, I guess \u2014 then I\u2019m not happy, because now you have this high-quality production from Netflix and Amazon, who are stealing viewers from you.You take this down to the level of articles and shorter videos, and you have different considerations, no? Especially around exclusivity. I\u2019m trying to imagine any sort of leverage.Well, let\u2019s say the content in question requires a lot less investment. First of all, there\u2019s going to be a lot more competition. It\u2019s very hard to compete with the video game Call of Duty. It\u2019s a lot easier to come up with close substitutes for something that requires a lot less investment. The substitution concern on a platform is a lot higher.The most profound piece of this \u2014 the trend that I find fascinating \u2014 is that every year, people look at this and say, these are the products and services that are right now being transacted on these multisided platforms, but there\u2019s a limit. There\u2019s always higher-level, higher-value products and services that are extremely out of reach. Now we\u2019re saying, oh, there are all these on-demand economy platforms like Taskrabbit, but, surely, this is limited to low-skill labor or things that very easily contractable. The reality is, there will be platforms for pretty much everything \u2014 pretty much any product or service that we can imagine. It\u2019s going to happen.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton Again Looks Upstate for Win in New York", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported byHillary Clinton\u2019s political ascent can be traced to the time in 1999 when she expressed her support for dairy farmers in the upstate New York village of Endicott. And the summer that year when she shunned Martha\u2019s Vineyard to vacation in Skaneateles, and promised voters in the depleted industrial city of Schenectady that as a New York senator she would revive the upstate economy.Now, 16 years later, Mrs. Clinton is again promising to bring jobs back to the region as she courts the people who helped secure her first election victory. But this time her message is colliding with a surprisingly potent threat from the left and doubts about her ability to deliver.Her current effort, which advisers say is critical not just to winning the New York primary on April 19 but to swaying voters nationwide to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s style of pragmatic problem solving, comes as she looks to rebound after losing six of the last seven primary elections to Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.Of all the battles this primary season, this will be the most personal.As Mrs. Clinton contemplated a Senate run, upstate represented her test as to whether a polarizing first lady not from New York could win over skeptics in traditionally Republican areas.In 2016, the region once again represents a test of whether Mrs. Clinton\u2019s message can resonate, this time among voters who have gravitated to Mr. Sanders\u2019s brand of economic populism. \u201cHer work as senator in upstate New York can serve as a blueprint for how she would seek to create the good-paying jobs of the future as president,\u201d said Mrs. Clinton\u2019s senior policy director, Jake Sullivan.Spanning vast territory north of New York City and its suburbs, the region has long suffered from the decline in American manufacturing, with jobs disappearing and residents deciding to leave.At a rally on Monday in Cohoes, north of Albany, Mrs. Clinton recalled working to obtain funding to invest in the nanotechnology industry in the area. \u201cThat\u2019s what we need to do across upstate \u2014 indeed, across America,\u201d she said, vowing to be the \u201cpresident who brings manufacturing back to upstate New York and America.\u201dWhile Mrs. Clinton will continue to campaign in New York City, to solidify her strength among minority voters, recent polls show that the fight to win New York could be waged in places like the Rochester area and Buffalo, where she plans to campaign on Friday.A victory in the area is psychologically important for her as well. Mrs. Clinton harbors an emotional attachment to upstate, even making sure that her State Department office always had a fresh shipment of New York apples and putting wine ice cream from the Finger Lakes on the dessert menu at official dinners. Campaigning in Depew on Tuesday, former President Bill Clinton said her years in the Senate working to help New Yorkers were \u201cthe happiest she ever was.\u201dBut Mrs. Clinton\u2019s critics say that she failed to deliver on the centerpiece of her 2000 push \u2014 a promise to bring 200,000 jobs to New York \u2014 and many cities upstate have higher unemployment than when she became a senator. The number of private-sector jobs in upstate New York remained virtually stagnant in the eight years Mrs. Clinton served in the Senate, according to state Department of Labor statistics.Her 2000 Republican Senate opponent, Rick A. Lazio, called Mrs. Clinton\u2019s jobs promise \u201ca cynical play to attract voters in the hard-hit areas\u201d and likened it to the unrealistic vows made by Mr. Trump in his presidential campaign. \u201cThe people were desperate for hope, and some voters embraced the false promise,\u201d Mr. Lazio said.To combat Mr. Sanders\u2019s message, Mrs. Clinton and a lineup of influential New York surrogates, including Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, plan to take voters down a memory lane of proposals, from the quirky to the conventional, that she advanced to spur the upstate economy.Representative Louise M. Slaughter told a crowd in Rochester on Tuesday that Mrs. Clinton \u201cbrought Japanese businessmen here by the planeload to help us rebuild our economy.\u201dIn Depew, near Buffalo, on Tuesday, Mr. Clinton provided an extemporaneous laundry list of her efforts upstate, including a partnership with eBay that trained craft makers in mill towns on the Erie Canal to sell their goods online, and efforts to transform a vacant car dealership in Buffalo into an artist\u2019s work space, funnel federal funding to the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus and protect the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station.An interactive delegate calculator that lets you simulate how the 2016 Republican nomination process could unfold.\u201cShe worked so hard to get you all that money \u2014 for things that may seem small,\u201d Mr. Clinton said, \u201cbut if you did it in every city in America, it would make a huge difference.\u201dDefending her economic record, Mrs. Clinton has said the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the Great Recession and a Republican administration prevented her, as a freshman senator, from fulfilling her jobs promise. \u201cWe had a very difficult situation with the Bush administration,\u201d she said Monday in an interview on \u201cCapital Tonight,\u201d an upstate cable news program.Robert Hockett, a professor of law at Cornell who specializes in financial regulation and is supporting Mr. Sanders, said his anti-trade message would resonate as it has in other economically ravaged areas.\u201cUpstate New York is the classic Rust Belt on the one hand and the classic working-poor rural population on the other hand,\u201d Mr. Hockett said. \u201cThe things Bernie wants to do are things this population generally agrees with.\u201dChristopher Ryan, president of the Communications Workers of America Local 1123, which represents Verizon and American Red Cross workers in Syracuse, said that he backed Mrs. Clinton in 2000 but that the area had been eviscerated by jobs moving overseas. He plans to vote for Mr. Sanders, whom the union has endorsed.\u201cYou see the weeds growing through the parking lots at factories,\u201d he said.Arlene Maynard, 73, a retired school bus driver from Greece, near Rochester, said Mr. Sanders was too far to the left. She plans to vote for Mrs. Clinton, but thought she would be hurt by the frustration some voters are feeling. \u201cAlthough they say everything\u2019s good, a lot of people don\u2019t think it\u2019s that good,\u201d she said.Unlike voters in other primary states, many people in upstate New York have met Mrs. Clinton.Joan Shearin, 65, a retired respiratory therapist from Batavia, like many local Democrats, spoke fondly of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s time in the Senate. \u201cWhen something needed to be done, she was doing it,\u201d she said. \u201cShe never hid herself.\u201d\u201cWe have a friend that was a dairy farmer, and they were having all kinds of troubles with different regulations,\u201d she said, adding that Mrs. Clinton showed up and \u201cwent through the barn.\u201cShe took a tour of everything,\u201d Ms. Shearin said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t anything beneath her.\u201dAdvertisement"}

There are no stereotypes bestowed on that child. It\u2019s always about the eyes to me, but I know the limitations of depth of field, how close I can get. There\u2019s no negotiating with a 1-year-old.\u201dHe or she can convey humor, charm, surprise, anxiety, dismay. Their faces express what they don\u2019t have words for yet. Age 1 is \u201cthe final moment of expressive innocence,\u201d Professor Solomon writes.6 PhotosIn another of the book\u2019s essays, the writer Francine Prose attributes a magical state of being to 1-year-olds, drifting between the infant world of pure consciousness and the world of older children or adults, of experience and language.That world is a sacred space to Mr. Mapplethorpe. \u201cOne is a beautiful word, concept, age,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s that cusp before they\u2019re tainted, before any outside influence gets into their psyche.\u201dParents are kept out of earshot and eyesight during the photo shoot, with no idea what will ensue.\u201cMy wife and I love pictures of our children looking rosy-cheeked and gorgeous, but what these photos show is character and a bit of gumption,\u201d said Tim Jeffries, who owns Hamiltons Gallery in London and who commissioned portraits of Coco and Rex. \u201cAnd let\u2019s not forget that Edward was profoundly aware of his brother\u2019s practice. These photos are Mapplethorpes, works of art, with all the integrity of that image-making, the quality of light and of composition.\u201dThe photographer, a wiry 55 with a tiny chin piercing, was himself the \u201cbaby\u201d of six siblings growing up in Floral Park, Queens, and had only a glancing early relationship with the increasingly infamous brother who considered the family and community to be provincial and d\u00e9class\u00e9.Edward could have chosen a profession that wouldn\u2019t engender comparisons, but he believed, in a lapsed Catholic sort of way, that he was destined to get to know his brother through a shared vocation.\u201cAt the end of the day he\u2019d say, \u2018What are you doing? Why don\u2019t you stick around?\u2019\u201d Edward said. \u201cWe\u2019d smoke a joint and look at the fruits of the last few days\u2019 work. It was all about him, not \u2018Let me see what you\u2019ve been doing.\u2019 I was taking pictures and doing my printing on the off hours, not even telling him about it. But those are some of my fondest memories. He used to giggle like a little kid with me.\u201dTheir professional alliance essentially ended when both were invited to exhibit at the same show, and Robert insisted that Edward change his surname to Maxey (their mother\u2019s maiden name).\u201cHe did not want any competition or any confusion,\u201d Ms. Morrisroe said. \u201cMy sense was that Robert was aware he didn\u2019t have much time on earth and didn\u2019t want another photographer named Mapplethorpe. Edward was family but was not made to feel that way. He was treated like the help, but he liked the work and admired his brother very much.\u201dAfter Robert was told he had AIDS, Edward became one of his caretakers until his death in 1989, but the brotherly approbation he yearned for never came. And Edward had quite a few anxious H.I.V. tests himself.\u201cI numbed myself in those years, thinking I was fooling everybody,\u201d he said. \u201cMarijuana had seeped into our Queens neighborhood pretty early \u2014 that was nothing new \u2014 and then cocaine and heroin, which really kicked my ass. You think you have control, and maybe you do on Thursday, but then on Friday, you lose it. It\u2019s the devil.\u201cI went to my medical doctor in tears and said: \u2018I\u2019m in trouble. Robert\u2019s going to die and will possibly leave me some money, and if I\u2019m in this state, I know where it will go. I\u2019ll end up dead or in jail.\u2019\u201d With counseling, he said, he has remained drug-free for two decades.Inheriting his brother\u2019s cameras, Mr. Mapplethorpe developed his own successful style. His early work is considered a bridge between photography and abstract painting; one series of photos was taken under water or through sheets of ice; another used human and animal hair as the medium. But his personal life was chaotic.\u201cTwo of my brothers died young, and I wondered how much time I had left,\u201d he said. \u201cI told women I wasn\u2019t going to get serious. I was brazen and unapologetic. That\u2019s how I lived my life for the next decade.\u201dHe asked her to become ordained as a Universal Life minister to officiate at his 2012 wedding, and she wrote a poem as the introduction to his book.\u201cOne\u201d is dedicated to Mr. Mapplethorpe\u2019s 1-year-old son, Harrison, whose portrait is included in it, although unidentified, as are all the babies. \u201cThere are some children of very wealthy people, sons and daughters of celebrities,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want, \u2018That\u2019s so-and-so\u2019s baby.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t matter that one is from privilege and another from a more modest background.\u201dWell, not so modest: The cost is $15,000 for two large gelatin silver prints. \u201cOne, I always say, is safe, meaning I\u2019m quite confident that the parent is going to like it,\u201d Mr. Mapplethorpe said. \u201cThe other is a little more challenging. That\u2019s the one that when the parents call me years later, they often say: \u2018You were absolutely right. There\u2019s something you got about him or her that\u2019s now apparent.\u2019\u201cBut I prefer not to ever see these children again. I like the idea that they are forever frozen at that time. Like Peter Pan.\u201dAn article last Sunday about the photographer Edward Mapplethorpe misspelled the surname of a writer for The New Yorker who contributed an essay to Mr. Mapplethorpe\u2019s new book.

{"Headline": "Queen Elizabeth\u2019s Party Planner Is Proud to Wear $35 Shoes", "Date": "2016-04-23", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Lady Elizabeth Anson, Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s cousin and her party planner for more than 50 years, was raised in a Downton Abbey-like home where servants ironed the newspapers, and was married at Westminster Abbey.But on a recent Friday, Lady Elizabeth \u2014 the orchestrator of some of Britain\u2019s most aristocratic parties \u2014 was in her white-azalea-filled sitting room. She was wearing a gray Tomasz Starzewski jacket bought on sale more than 40 years ago, drinking tea from a purple-flowered tankard (an eBay find) and discussing her recovery from her weekly lottery ticket-buying addiction.\u201cI still do a lucky dip if it\u2019s a huge amount of money,\u201d said Lady Elizabeth, who has also organized events for Tom Cruise and other celebrities seeking discretion.On her feet were what looked like Roger Vivier court shoes, but when a reporter suggested she might like to remove whatever was stuck to the bottom of them before having her photograph taken, Lady Elizabeth, 75, handed the footwear to her liveried butler. \u201cCertainly, my lady,\u201d he said, before getting rid of the price tags that revealed that the shoes cost \u00a325 (about $35).\u201cMarks & Spencer\u2019s best,\u201d Lady Elizabeth said, looking delighted at this evidence of her frugality.And really, why shouldn\u2019t she be? Among her \u201cgrander family,\u201d as she calls them, frugality is a trait to be celebrated. The queen has been known to take public trains. Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge (whom Lady Elizabeth refers to as \u201cCatherine\u201d), is applauded for wearing dresses more than once.Let somebody else be the embarrassingly profligate relative that makes the monarchy look bad. Lady Elizabeth \u2014 daughter of Princess Anne of Denmark, goddaughter of King George VI \u2014 is just another hard-working entrepreneur, albeit possibly the only one with the word \u201clady\u201d in her email address.\u201cI do not know how to be a lady who lunches,\u201d she said. \u201cI love my work, and my work pays for my home.\u201dShe asked the butler to bring her her nicotine sweets. She gave up smoking in the \u201960s, picked it up after 17 years, then quit with difficulty again 11 years ago.If she were to start again, the sitting room would rebuke her. Every surface is crammed with decorative eggs \u2014 536 of them, by her grandchildren\u2019s last count \u2014 that she began collecting after her stepfather presented her with an alabaster one as a worry bead for her right hand when she first put down the cigarettes.Hers is a nerve-racking business. One of her projects is the queen\u2019s 90th birthday this month. The milestone is being marked with street parties, pageants and ceremonies, but Lady Elizabeth handled the private family celebration, which, like all of her events, she was \u201cnot prepared to discuss.\u201dStill, she is as unguarded as one can possibly be when bound by confidentiality agreements, referring to one of Ivana Trump\u2019s post-Donald husbands as \u201clooking like a frog.\u201d (Mrs. Trump is a former client. Things did not end well.)Of the overweight king of Tonga, whom she was looking after, along with all the other foreign heads of state, at the 2011 royal wedding, she said, \u201cHe thought he\u2019d break the furniture in Buckingham Palace.\u201d The chairs there are \u201cvery low,\u201d she said, \u201cvery wonderful Louis Quatorze. It looks as if you sat on it, it would break. But it doesn\u2019t.\u201dDuring a discussion about the lost art of conversation because of cellphones, she took her incessantly ringing land line off the hook, letting the receiver dangle at her stockinged feet, and leaned in, saying: \u201cI think I can tell this. It\u2019s a bit about the royal family.\u201dShe described how the queen had had her grandchildren over for dinner. \u201cAnd she said to me that she found it really difficult,\u201d Lady Elizabeth said, \u201cbecause they didn\u2019t really know how to talk each other. And she said, \u2018I suppose it\u2019s because they\u2019re always getting up and down and helping somebody and putting something in a dishwasher or whatever they\u2019re doing, because they don\u2019t have enough staff.\u2019\u201dOn the subject of Her Majesty: For the record, the queen is a \u201cmost meticulous hostess,\u201d though she does not insist only on Malvern water or yellow freesias, as has been reported. \u201cPeople love creating myths,\u201d Lady Elizabeth said. \u201cIt makes them feel very self-important.\u201d In fact, it was a gardener at Windsor Castle who decreed the yellow flowers.For the wedding of William and Kate, for which Lady Elizabeth was an adviser (and planned the wedding eve family dinner), the couple had very strong ideas that the queen \u201cwas marvelous and listened to,\u201d she said. Traditional royal weddings have no reception afterward \u2014 guests just depart after the service \u2014 but William and Kate wanted one after seeing that was what their friends had had.\u201cAnd so the palace had to learn quite a lot about different canap\u00e9s, because they weren\u2019t used to doing them,\u201d Lady Elizabeth said.Her code name around the office for the queen is (or was until it\u2019s been published) Shirley Temple, though Lady Elizabeth said she can\u2019t remember why. Referring to her staff of five, she said: \u201cWe literally had the funniest names possible for everybody. And the people who were the most aware of their celeb importance that I\u2019ve ever had got names that were truly extraordinary.\u201dLady Elizabeth started her business at age 18, in 1960. Her inspiration was the stress of planning her own 1959 debutante party, which prevented her from enjoying the evening.Chasing down R.S.V.P.s was a particular headache, and she claims credit for inventing \u201cthis ghastly thing called the reply card\u201d to solve the problem. The first time she created one, she forgot to leave a space for people to write their names, and so she ended up with a bunch of yeses and nos but no clue who they were from.Her first event for the queen was a disco at Windsor Castle for Prince Charles, then 15, and Princess Anne, then 13. \u201cMy business started before the discoth\u00e8que was invented,\u201d she said. \u201cSo when this man told me he was going to charge me \u00a325 to put on records for the evening, I thought, \u2018Is this man absolutely crazy?\u2019 Anybody can put on a gramophone record.\u201d She soon learned it was \u201can art form.\u201dA party for the Rolling Stones ended with the police showing up as guests were drunkenly throwing unopened bottles of Dom P\u00e9rignon into the Thames, but generally Lady Elizabeth\u2019s events are known for their calm elegance and thoughtful touches.At a white-themed dinner for 40 people last month hosted by royalty at the cavernous, drafty Victoria & Albert Museum, Lady Elizabeth marched over to \u201cmy little Indian caftan man on the Portobello Road\u201d and bought a load of white pashminas to drape on each chair. She hid hot-water bottles underneath cushions. (She also suggested to guests that they wear \u201cheat tech from Uniqlo.\u201d)\u201cIt\u2019s that ghastly boring phrase \u2018the devil\u2019s in the details.\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThe devil is in the detail, and the detail doesn\u2019t need to cost very much.\u201dShe can do strict protocol \u2014 working out what year various marquesses or earls were created to determine seniority (and thus seating arrangements) \u2014 but she is not afraid to break it, along with convention.Glynn Woodin, who has worked with her for 30 years as the managing director of Mustard Catering, a society favorite, recalled that recently she decided the damask tablecloth (Mr. Woodin described its color as \u201ceau de vie with a bit of olive\u201d) would look better flipped upside down, using the rougher textured side. \u201cWe were doing a party absolutely littered with royals,\u201d he said. \u201cYou and I would be horrified to use a cloth on the wrong side, but it was exactly right.\u201dShe has never advertised. Instead, she attributes her success in part to being \u201cterribly, terribly shy\u201d \u2014 she still bemoans a party she never quite made it to years ago where, dressed in a red velvet trouser suit and with her hair freshly done, she stood by the elevator watching people go in, unable to summon the nerve to do the same.And so she arranges party spaces with the timid in mind. \u201cThe downfall of any party in the countryside is to walk into a hall and be confronted by a dance floor,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd some young man has driven you down, so he\u2019s got a girl on both arms, and what do you do with yourself?\u201d Her solution: a well-lit bar, which she calls a \u201cpicking up and dumping ground.\u201dShe paused to contemplate what she would do if she retired, but then quickly got back to work.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ride-Hailing Start-Ups Compete in \u2018Uber for Children\u2019 Niche", "Date": "2016-04-13", "News": "Supported byThe juggle of work, school and myriad extracurricular activities is all too familiar to parents like Kelly Aluise of Los Angeles.Her 12-year-old daughter, Emma, had enrolled in August for after-school surfing and swimming. Ms. Aluise and her ex-husband, who work full time, didn\u2019t know how they would get her to the activities. Complicating matters, Ms. Aluise\u2019s schedule as a real estate agent with Keller Williams is unpredictable.She now schedules three rides a week for her daughter, which costs about $45 to $50 a week. While ride-hailing services have been popular in the start-up economy, new entrepreneurs are going after a specific niche: providing rides for children.These start-ups are nibbling at the industry\u2019s fringes, where Uber and Lyft \u2014 at least officially \u2014 don\u2019t go. (Per policy at Uber and Lyft, drivers are not supposed to give rides to unaccompanied minors.)Although they are still testing the waters in a small number of markets, the sector is already becoming competitive. It\u2019s part of a bigger trend of ride-hailing, with services finding ways to capture a very specific market segment, said Harry Campbell, who writes about the industry at his blog TheRideShareGuy.com and is a driver for Uber and Lyft.Almost all the drivers for these services are women \u2014 often teachers, nannies, day care workers and mothers. Most companies carry insurance that exceeds state requirements and covers liability related to driver (or babysitter) conduct.To a certain extent, many of these start-ups still compete against Uber or Lyft because many drivers for those companies don\u2019t know about the unaccompanied-minor policy or choose to look the other way once they have picked up an underage passenger. \u201cI would say between 10 and 20 percent of rides are minors and it\u2019s increasing,\u201d said Mr. Campbell, who corresponds with hundreds of drivers a day because of his blog.As parents try these services, they are becoming more comfortable with the idea of allowing a stranger to drive their children. Ms. Aluise, for instance, receives a photo of the car and driver ahead of time, which she places inside her daughter\u2019s lunchbox. The driver wears a HopSkipDrive shirt and uses a password that confirms her identity to Emma.Ms. Aluise receives a text message when her daughter gets in the car and when she arrives at her destination, and during that time Emma is never unsupervised. Last year Ms. Aluise spent $150 a week for her babysitter to pick Emma up twice a week from school. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about her car either, so that was a little terrifying,\u201d she said.Word-of-mouth marketing and referrals are crucial. \u201cMom networks are very important for us,\u201d said Joanna McFarland, a co-founder and the chief executive of HopSkipDrive. \u201cWe have found that when you solve one parent\u2019s problem and make their life easier, they will tell other parents.\u201dZum just completed a seed round of funding for a little more than $1 million. During its early phase, revenue and customers were growing 65 percent month over month. Today, the company provides 150 to 200 rides a day.Like other start-ups, Zum allows parents to schedule rides ahead of time (even for the entire year) or call for an on-demand ride. All of Zum\u2019s drivers work either a morning or afternoon shift for five to six hours a day, so they rarely drive for other services, said Ritu Narayan, a co-founder of the company while she was a group product manager at eBay.Many of these companies have modest expansion plans, in large part because of the need to hire well-vetted drivers.\u201cIt takes a lot of work to keep supply and demand in balance, to keep the driver pool matched to the customer pool and remain 100 percent reliable, so we\u2019ve taken very pragmatic views on growth,\u201d said Doug Aley, chief executive of Shuddle. \u201cThe demand is there, but it\u2019s not the same as in other industries. If you don\u2019t get your groceries delivered it\u2019s not the end of the world, but we\u2019re talking about someone\u2019s child.\u201dThe extra safety and security measures as well as other features translate to rides that are, on average, more expensive than a ride with Lyft or Uber. For example, HopSkipDrive\u2019s rides are about 10 to 15 percent higher and Kango\u2019s roughly 15 to 20 percent higher.Still, higher fares are not seen as a deterrent because this business is driven, in part, by a force more powerful than economics.\u201cOne factor in this market people don\u2019t talk about is the guilt,\u201d said Ms. McFarland of HopSkipDrive. \u201cThere\u2019s no shortage of that.\u201dA picture caption on Thursday with an article about ride-hailing services aimed at children whose parents cannot chauffeur them misstated part of the name of a service in Los Angeles.

{"Headline": "The Digital Afterlife of Lost Family Photos", "Date": "2016-04-26", "News": "Supported byOn PhotographyThe photographs were Polaroids, taken between the 1970s and the 2000s. Zun Lee bought them at flea markets, at garage sales or on eBay. Most of them depicted African-Americans: people wearing stylish clothes, relaxing in the yard, celebrating birthdays. A few depicted people in prison uniforms. All the photographs had somehow been separated from their original owners and had become what Lee calls \u201corphaned Polaroids.\u201dFound photographs have long been important to artists like Lee. Photos taken by amateurs can sometimes acquire new value on account of their uniqueness, their age or simply the knowledge that they were once meaningful to a stranger. As part of a group, they can evoke a collector\u2019s sensibility or tell us something about a historical period in a way professional photographs might not. For Lee, collecting found photographs of African-\u00adAmericans \u2014 a project he called \u201cFade Resistance\u201d \u2014 had an additional and deeply personal meaning.Lee was raised in Germany by Korean parents. In his 30s, his mother told him that the man who raised him was not his biological father. But because her relationship with that man, who was black, had been fleeting, she refused to tell her son more about him. This revelation, at once momentous and limited, changed Lee\u2019s life. To make sense of his personal loss, and to explore his connectedness to black America, he took up photography. I became friends with Lee around the time he began making pictures of black fathers and their children in the Bronx and elsewhere; that project led to a book, \u201cFather Figure,\u201d for which I wrote a preface. Later, Lee began to collect the Polaroids \u2014 thousands of them \u2014 that ended up in \u201cFade Resistance.\u201dWho took these photos? Who do they depict? The basic contextual details we would usually expect from snapshots are missing here. The absence of this information is bittersweet: We are bewildered, but we are also ferried over from imagery into imagination. In Lee\u2019s case, the story of his orphaned Polaroids took a surprising turn. When he uploaded some of them to Facebook, the social network\u2019s facial-recognition technology immediately began to match them with real people. Lee was not sure who was doing the tagging. Intrigued and wary, he sent a message to one individual who was tagged in several of the pictures. There was no response. Then, several weeks later, he got a message from the same man: a curt request that he take the pictures down.Twenty-two of the pictures I bought that day featured the same woman at different stages in her life. She was sometimes alone and sometimes with family. But there she was, in picture after picture, from as far back as the late 1930s until at least 1980. She was dark-haired (was she Italian?) and had an unmistakable, toothy smile and cheeks that rose high on her face. A few of these photos had inscriptions, in pencil or pen, on the back or along the white border on the front. \u201cRock of Gibralter [sic] \u2014 Margaret, Kate & myself.\u201d \u201cLake Huntington, May 1939.\u201d I felt I was somehow rescuing these pictures from the anonymity of the pile. I named the woman Mrs. X.I didn\u2019t put my images of Mrs. X online, in part because I didn\u2019t want anyone to recognize her. I also felt a little guilty: \u201cmy\u201d images of Mrs. X? I had the sense that my possession of these pictures was not their ideal posterity. They should be in the keeping of people who knew this woman, who cared about her. (Imagine your own most precious family photos permanently in the hands of a complete stranger.) And yet, despite my doubts, I was also happy to have the pictures. Here she is in 1939 in her bathing suit, here she is with her husband (?), her son (?). Here she is abroad. We have color pictures now. Then she\u2019s noticeably older, and the husband (?) is no longer there, but there are friends (?) and relatives (?). I looked at each of the photographs through a mesh of question marks, sustained by Mrs. X\u2019s absolutely distinctive smile. From time to time, returning to the pictures, I am aware that I am touching a photograph that Mrs. X also touched. Is this woman still alive? It\u2019s possible, but I doubt it.The photos Zun Lee collected, digitally scanned and put out in public, have had a different life from the photos in my collection. He wrote back to the man who was tagged in some of them and suggested meeting. After all, he did not consider himself the owner of the photos, only their custodian. Perhaps, Lee offered, he might fly to Los Angeles and hand the photos over in person. The man said no. Lee was disappointed but sympathetic. He said he\u2019d already been thinking about how databases and tags are not neutral, how they can wind up being hostile toward communities of color. \u201cI completely understood,\u201d Lee told me. \u201cThis man was saying, \u2018We are not willing participants.\u2019 The black body is used as a commodity, as something that is surveilled. The man was telling me, \u2018No, you\u2019re not welcome, this is not art, get the hell out of our lives.\u2019 And I understood it.\u201dPeople have a right to be skeptical about the encounter between the analog experience of life and the futuristic algorithms that often prioritize what is possible over what it desirable. Already there are reports of churches scanning worshipers\u2019 faces to determine who attends regularly, the better to know whom to ask for donations. Shops match your face to a database so that they can greet you by name \u2014 or identify you as a potential shoplifter. Black people in particular, against the historical backdrop of surveillance and state hostility and corporate disregard, have a right to doubt these technologies. There was a recent report of Google\u2019s photo app automatically tagging a photo of two black people as \u201cgorillas\u201d \u2014 another instance of machines replicating the nastier prejudices of their human teachers.Lee\u2019s pleasure in the Polaroids he bought was also shadowed by questions: Why had so many families lost their things to secondhand dealers and estate sales? Behind these photos of bell-bottoms, Afros, birthday parties and interiors rich with period detail lay the invisible stories of evictions, dispossessions or separations. The Polaroids were evidence of joy, but the fate of the photographs themselves was unhappy. Lee acceded to his interlocutor\u2019s request and took the tagged photos down.In my collection, there is a picture from the late 19th or early 20th century, an image I think about as much as the entire series of Mrs. X pictures. This seated woman wears a long dark skirt, dark stockings and polished dark shoes. Her hair is a neatly parted mass of black, almost an Afro. She wears a pale jacket and is seated outside, next to a door and a brick wall. She looks off to her right. Below, not on the white border of the photograph but directly on the photograph itself, someone has written, in ink, the single word \u201cnigger.\u201dI doubt that the person responsible for this vandalism knew this woman personally. Perhaps it was written decades later. The word, after all, has been with us a long time, as has the spitefulness with which it is deployed. But whenever the defacement occurred, I feel it has something in common with both a contemporary form of aggression and a very old one. Black Americans, for most of their time in this country, were named, traded and collected against their will. They were branded \u2014 physically tagged \u2014 both to hurt and to control them. The woman in my photograph has been tagged, too, semantically. The written slur is like a brand.Lee sent me a screen shot of his Facebook page as it looked while he was uploading a batch of Polaroids. Several of the images are of men in prison. There are white rectangles framing the faces, and there is an instruction above each picture: \u201cClick Anywhere to Tag.\u201d That mild directive \u2014 an automated instruction from Facebook \u2014 suddenly seems sinister. What if these people don\u2019t wish to be tagged? What are their rights? These doubts have led Lee to focus more on an offline display of these images. I faced the more immediate conundrum of illustrating this column and decided not to show the faces of the people in my collection.American history has long struggled to believe the joys and intimacies of black American life. Social media, fortunately, makes those human realities visible to a much larger swath of the population than ever before. But there\u2019s also a paradox: To make intimacy public is often to render it less intimate. For all of us, but especially for those in communities of color, being digitally tracked does not solve the conundrums of inequality. Whatever else the machines learn, they\u2019ll have to learn about our sense of privacy too, the human necessity of leaving some things untagged and undeclared.Teju Cole is a photographer, essayist and the author of two works of fiction, \u201cOpen City\u201d and \u201cEvery Day Is for the Thief.\u201d He teaches at Bard College.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "My Grandfather Was a Famous Artist. He Also Made Greeting Cards.", "Date": "2016-04-28", "News": "Supported byTWO brawny construction workers perch on a plank dangerously suspended hundreds of feet off the ground in \u201cMen of Steel,\u201d a print that hangs in an exhibition at New York University\u2019s Grey Art Gallery. The men are heroic figures intent on their task \u2014 bolting a horizontal beam to a column.In a nearby display case, there is a greeting card illustrated with a snowy woodland scene called \u201cPeaceful Valley,\u201d depicting deer standing stock-still between gnarled trees.Both etchings are by Samuel L. Margolies, who is best known for his New York cityscapes from the 1930s. And looking at them together \u2014 one a dynamic composition with pointed political undertones done by the artist at the peak of his powers, the other static, unconvincing and entirely tame \u2014 might be puzzling for some.For me, it\u2019s almost painful.I\u2019m the artist\u2019s granddaughter. I didn\u2019t know my grandfather well \u2014 he was estranged from the family and died in 1974, when I was 16 \u2014 but I\u2019ve spent a good part of the last two years piecing together his life and, in the process, trying to understand how an artist whose work hung in the Whitney Museum of American Art alongside Edward Hopper\u2019s could also have been capable of such, well, schlock.Although Associated would branch into artist-designed home and fashion goods during its 66-year history \u2014 there are arresting stoneware platters and cotton fabrics in \u201cArt for Every Home\u201d \u2014 it started with prints, and they remained the foundation of the company.At first, Associated sold them through department stores. It also opened galleries, including one on Fifth Avenue. But Mr. Lewenthal\u2019s marketing breakthrough was mail order. Every year, Associated American Artists sent out catalogs that listed new works and profiled the artists. Gail Windisch, a retired Los Angeles lawyer whose research on the company was the basis for the show, said in a telephone interview, \u201cThe idea was that people would be more likely to buy prints if they felt invested in the people who made them.\u201dFor the artists themselves \u2014 many of whom barely survived the 1930s, when their work was deemed a luxury by those who had difficulty putting food on the table \u2014 the company was salvation. Most received $200 for each work \u2014 the equivalent of more than $3,500 today. \u201cIt was manna from heaven,\u201d Ms. Windisch said.It surely would have been for my grandfather. Born in 1897 on the Lower East Side to Jewish immigrants who had fled czarist Russia, Samuel Margolies studied at Cooper Union, the Art Students League and the National Academy, first painting and doing bronze sculptures before discovering etching.Despite a strong exhibition record, blue ribbons from art fairs and praise in the press, my grandfather struggled to make a living, even after joining the Works Progress Administration\u2019s Federal Art Project, for which he produced prints that ended up everywhere from Evander Childs High School in the Bronx to the Library of Congress in Washington. He grew increasingly cranky. When the public paid scant attention to shows he helped organize for the Queensboro Society of Allied Arts & Crafts \u2014 he lived with his family for a time in Hollis, Queens \u2014 he published a tirade in its newsletter, which he produced, under the headline: \u201cIs There Something Wrong With the People of Queens?\u201d (He was ousted shortly thereafter.) My grandmother ultimately gave up on him, moving out with their two children (my father and aunt) and opening up the chasm between the artist and the rest of the family.His relationship with Associated began in 1941, when, two years after the drypoint \u201cMen of Steel\u201d was exhibited at the New York World\u2019s Fair, he sold the company the copper plate. The same year, it bought his mezzotint \u201cReflections,\u201d a scene of boaters in Central Park with the buildings of Fifth Avenue in the background. During the next nine years Associated acquired 18 more plates, some he\u2019d etched years before, some he made expressly for the company.Here\u2019s the rub: Associated\u2019s goal certainly wasn\u2019t to foster mediocrity, but Mr. Lewenthal would only buy works he believed would appeal to the general public \u2014 the average housewife looking for something to hang on a wall. Though \u201cArt for Every Home\u201d and its catalog feature many of the company\u2019s most potent images \u2014 see Curry\u2019s fiery portrait of the abolitionist John Brown \u2014 a number of artists, my grandfather included, found they had better luck if they stuck to innocuous fare.Which meant that not only did fine works like \u201cMen of Steel\u201d go out into the world in large numbers, but so did snowy rural landscapes that my grandfather created under seemingly interchangeable names: \u201cWinter Symphony,\u201d \u201cWinter Wonderland,\u201d \u201cWinter Solitude\u201d (none of the above in the exhibition, thankfully). These \u201csnow scenes,\u201d as he dismissively referred to them, typically involved some combination of white-blanketed trees, distant farmhouses, meandering streams and, sometimes, deer (which he rendered with far less success than he had the New York skyscrapers). One called \u201cWhite Fantasy\u201d practically makes me cringe.But customers gobbled them up. While it took two years for Associated American Artists to sell out its inventory of \u201cMen of Steel\u201d prints, the snow scenes sold out quickly \u2014 in some cases immediately. During the patriotic war years, when the company placed eagles on its catalog covers, artwork that played up the wholesomeness of the countryside appealed to many Americans, Ms. Windisch said. \u201cThe art said, \u2018This is the peace and beauty we are fighting for.\u2019\u201dThen, too, my grandfather, who went to work at a General Motors plant outside New York City that built carrier-based bombers for the Navy, might simply have been too busy to attempt anything artistically ambitious. He implied as much in a note he dashed off to Associated in 1944: \u201cAlthough I can\u2019t spend a minute away from my war job, I\u2019ll not sleep a wink until I\u2019ve etched a new plate. I\u2019ll deliver it to headquarters within 10 days.\u201dIn time, Associated American Artists, under Mr. Lewenthal\u2019s successor, Sylvan Cole, embraced nonrepresentational art. And it was the first American publisher of David Hockney prints. The company folded in 2000.A half-century before, my grandfather sold his last plates to Associated; one was the aquatint \u201cBuilders of Babylon.\u201d Like \u201cMen of Steel,\u201d it\u2019s a New York scene of two construction workers high above the city \u2014 though this picture has a dreamy, vaporous quality, as if the stylized, almost mythic figures are evanescing into thin air. The 1950 company catalog called it his \u201cnewest\u201d work, but he almost certainly created it in the 1930s.I\u2019ve tried to buy both works at auction but have had to drop out of the bidding as prices for prints that originally cost $5 climbed to several thousands of dollars.Meanwhile, the snow scenes flood eBay.\u201cArt for Every Home: Associated American Artists, 1934-2000\u201d runs through July 9 at the Grey Art Gallery, 100 Washington Square East, Manhattan; greyartgallery.nyu.edu.Advertisement"}

This was not a tragedy. Things are only things, after all. Back to the coat. Birdy, a vegetarian, had researched the down industry earlier in the year and concluded that it was not her ethical cuppa. Her father and I, in love with her and her principled self, offered to replace her old feather-filled jacket with a good-quality synthetic one, which we bought on Ebay and which, despite being \u00e2\u0080\u009cgently used,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cost approximately one million dollars. Now it was gone.I evaluated potential solutions. There are many schools of parenting thought right now, and so many of them have so much to offer.And then it turns out that it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean anything. It turns out that you like having your babies in the bed because you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re too lazy to get up in the night, or because you like to look at those silvery little moonlit eyelids. Or you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like having them in your bed because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re like diapered squids suckered onto you with their squid beaks and flailing tentacles. One child is verbal early, and you have rational conversations about how best to comport oneself in the frozen-food aisle (M.I.T.!); another persists in wordlessness, and you have to carry her wailing, writhing shape out to the car, prying tiny fingers from the icy box of a Salisbury steak dinner (meth lab!).You know how the one-size-fits-all yoga pants technically fit everyone, but for some of us, they make your butt look like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been sculpted from a quesadilla? Parenting is like that. Every kid requires something different; every moment does. We can love them. We can lean down to listen, tune in to who they are. We can enjoy ourselves, enjoying them. We can care for them, set limits, try to be gracious, smooth their hair behind their ears, walk them into town for froyo, hope they trust us enough to unburden themselves. Those are just some of the verbs. But we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to pick a one-size-fits-all style from parenting\u00e2\u0080\u0099s extremes. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to strand them or solve all their problems.We can look at our near-tears jacket loser and say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry, my love. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a jacket. And hey, what do you think we should do next?\u00e2\u0080\u009dWhich is what I ended up saying. Because Birdy is a person who does not overvalue things, and we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want her to. Because she is also a person who trusts that nobody intentionally stole her jacket, and we love that about her. Because she could probably stand to keep track of her stuff a little better, but does not have a history of losing important things. Because she is inclined to be fretful, to be hard on herself, and we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want her to linger over mishaps.She thinks we should get another jacket, another black one, but cheaper. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd then we should order a dog tag for the zipper, with my name and Daddy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cell number on it. So people know it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mine. So if I lose it I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get it back.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a test case, not pie-chartable. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just one person, with a small problem and a good solution.

At the time, those figures were largely met with shrugs from Wall Street.Now that attitude may be changing.The Silicon Valley company\u2019s stock-based compensation \u201cprovides additional reason to remain cautious\u201d on LinkedIn, Mark May, an Internet analyst at Citigroup, wrote in a research note.The issue is not limited to LinkedIn. With tech earnings season kicking off on Monday, investors are paying more attention to stock-based compensation at many tech companies.Paying employees with stock is largely unquestioned when times are good, since the move theoretically aligns the interests of the workers with company performance. The practice is technically a corporate expense, but during boom periods, Wall Street typically focuses on a company\u2019s operating results that exclude that expense.Tech companies stand out as some of the most generous givers of shares to employees. While the median number of restricted shares granted at Standard & Poor\u2019s 1500 companies to executives and employees in 2014 equaled 450,198 shares, tech companies granted a median 798,000 shares of restricted stock to workers, according to data from Equilar, a research firm that provides data on executives, boards and compensation.As a result, there has been a \u201cheightened investor focus on the level of stock-based compensation among the Internet companies,\u201d Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a recent note.In an interview, Mr. Mahaney said stock-based compensation could \u201cdistort the quality\u201d of a company\u2019s earnings and \u201cmake them look stronger than they are.\u201dMr. Mahaney has identified Twitter, LinkedIn, Yahoo and Alibaba as among the tech companies that are highly dependent on stock to pay their employees. In a report, he wrote that Twitter\u2019s stock-based compensation over the last two years accounted for 39 percent of the company\u2019s revenue, on average, the highest percentage of any Internet company.LinkedIn, whose share price is down about 48 percent this year, did not respond to requests for comment. Twitter, whose stock is down more than 20 percent this year, also did not respond to a request for comment.Another tech company that Wall Street analysts are examining for its stock-based compensation expenses is Workday, which sells human resources and financial management software. The company is expected to increase its stock compensation about 48 percent in its 2017 fiscal year, which is faster than its revenue is projected to grow, according to Sarah Hindlian, an analyst at Macquarie Group.In an illustration of how stock-based compensation expenses can affect a company\u2019s results, Ms. Hindlian says Workday\u2019s margins are projected to be around negative 25 percent for fiscal year 2017. But when the company\u2019s $370 million in stock-based compensation is excluded from results, its operating margins are much better, coming in around zero.Workday\u2019s heavy reliance on stock-based compensation has been a factor in Ms. Hindlian\u2019s projections for the company\u2019s share price. Last month, she forecast that Workday\u2019s stock would trade at $49, down from its current price of about $77. She has a sell recommendation on the stock.Ms. Hindlian says that while it can be reasonable for companies to pay workers a lot in stock, the practice can become scary when the stock starts to fall. \u201cParticularly with software companies, you run the risk of losing your leading salespeople, engineers and developers when the stock falls, because employees feel like they\u2019re getting a pay cut,\u201d said Ms. Hindlian, who also rang the alarm on LinkedIn\u2019s use of stock-based compensation over a year ago.\u201cSomewhere along the way a management team may feel pressure to increase their share price to avoid loss of employees,\u201d Ms. Hindlian said, \u201cwhich can ultimately mean management goals and shareholder interests become misaligned.\u201dWorkday declined to comment.When companies authorize additional shares to pay employees and management, that also creates \u201cdilution,\u201d or a decrease in how much of the company a shareholder owns when new stock is issued. That effect is starting to push others on Wall Street to lower their price projections for tech company stocks. Mr. May of Citigroup lowered his price targets this month on Google, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, eBay, Yahoo and Twitter to \u201cfully capture the likely ongoing dilution from future share grants as part of employee compensation,\u201d he said.The increased scrutiny of tech companies that rely heavily on stock to pay employees is just one of many places where investors are taking a harder look as markets soften, said John Roe, a managing director at ISS Corporate Solutions, a group that advises shareholders on corporate governance issues.He noted that some shareholders had also submitted proposals asking companies to consider the impact of share buybacks on earnings, to figure out whether executives delivered better earnings by improving performance or by reducing the number of shares outstanding.\u201cYou see a brighter focus on certain practices when there is more volatility and markets are going down,\u201d said Mr. Roe. \u201cThe reliance on equity compensation is one of those things that you might always worry about, but recent events have amplified that concern.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Selling Luxury in Iran", "Date": "2016-04-05", "News": "Supported byBypassed for decades by the luxury industry, Iran and its explosive market growth potential have recaptured the attention of global luxury heavyweights in the last 12 months.After more than 30 years of isolation and austerity, the country re-entered the global economy when economic sanctions were lifted in January, something Morgan Stanley described as the biggest thing for the global economy since the fall of the Berlin Wall.Now, with an educated, surging middle-income population of almost 80 million \u2014 many of whom possess a budding appetite for high-end consumer goods and mobile phones \u2014 Western brands are sizing up the opportunities, and risks, of setting up shop in Iran.\u201cIran as a prospect had interested us for some time, but once the sanctions went, we accelerated the process of setting up our boutique inside its borders,\u201d said Renato Semerari, chief executive of Roberto Cavalli, the first sizable luxury brand to enter the market with the opening in February of its two-story boutique in Tehran\u2019s upmarket neighborhood of Zafaraniye.Branded cosmetics, with their accessible price points, are often perceived as gateway products to luxury spending. So news that Sephora, the LVMH-owned cosmetics chain, was widely expected to open seven stores later this year hardly raised eyebrows.Yet expansion into Iran is not without its challenges. For a sector obsessed with controlling brand image, the country\u2019s lack of infrastructure, from trained staff to a shortage of quality real estate, remains the biggest obstacle. Only a handful of premium shopping malls exist, although there are plans to build more in the next two to three years.Tourism also is limited \u2014 vacation spending being a key sales contributor for most brands \u2014 and Iran\u2019s political relationships with the West, while thawing, still remain complex, to say the least. As a result, Claudia D\u2019Arpizio, a senior partner at Bain based in Milan, said the country was more suited to some labels than others.\u201cI think we will see some more mid-sized Italian players go in next, especially men\u2019s wear groups like Zegna or Brioni, as well as watch and jewelry brands, as a taste for the latter tends to develop very rapidly in emerging markets,\u201d she said. Historically, the larger clothing and accessories houses have been cautious about finding the right local distributors and partners, so it is likely they will take longer to establish a presence, she added.Despite the recent flush of enthusiasm, plenty of Western luxury-branded products have been making their way into the country for some time. When the banking sanctions over Iran\u2019s nuclear program were in place, investment coming and going from the country was essentially blocked, making it very difficult for foreign companies to get their profits out. But local third-party businesses always have imported goods into Iran by nonofficial channels, selling them at sky-high markups either in independent boutiques or in private sales behind closed doors.Now, with more Iranians online, learning about Western luxury brands and hungry for reasonably priced goods, entrepreneurs both at home and abroad are racing to fill the vacuum.Milad Monshipour and Hooman Damirchi are two Iranian entrepreneurs who have spent much of their professional lives working overseas before returning home to look at consumer- focused opportunities. Their luxury e-commerce site Madeleine Moda, which they say they hope to be Iran\u2019s version of Net-a-Porter, is expected to begin business soon.\u201cWhen we conducted market research among Iranian luxury goods consumers, we found that over 60 percent of our respondents said accessing the clothing and shoes they wanted continued to be very difficult due to supply limitations,\u201d said Mr. Monshipour, formerly a consultant at the Boston Consulting Group who holds an M.B.A. from HEC Paris. \u201cThey know what they want, they just struggle to get it.\u201cThe tech-savvy consumer here is just as hungry for immediate gratification as their Western counterparts,\u201d he noted.Almost all Iranians have debit cards, and online players like Digikala (an Amazon-style consumer goods website) and e-Sam (an Iranian equivalent of eBay) have made millions of Iranians comfortable with shopping online. So Mr. Damirchi is as bullish as his partner about their short-term, online-focused venture, as well as the longer-term growth potential of large Western brands to establish bricks-and-mortar presences.\u201cThis is a country where for thousands of years a sizable portion of the population has had a culture around and deep appreciation of design, art and fine things,\u201d he said. \u201cThe winners and losers today will be those who define the notion of luxury, and know how to really appeal to the 21st century consumer.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Busy Queen Elizabeth II Pencils In a 90th Birthday", "Date": "2016-04-20", "News": "Supported by9 PhotosOn Thursday, Queen Elizabeth II celebrates her 90th birthday, and a grateful Britain is honoring a woman her biographer Douglas Hurd, a former foreign minister, has called \u201cThe Steadfast.\u201dAnd the frenzy will not end this week.The queen could be forgiven for showing emotion when she blows out her candles. But it is unlikely.Vernon Bogdanor, an eminent constitutional scholar at King\u2019s College London, commended the queen for her self-restraint and for keeping her views to herself, arguing that the enigma of her persona has been essential to her success at symbolizing and unifying the nation.\u201cShe grew up during the war when people had to show emotional restraint,\u201d he said. \u201cNot like today when you have to let everything out.\u201dKey moments highlighted during the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.\u201cShe should be congratulated for living this long,\u201d Mr. York said. \u201cThe certainty of her life reminds Britons of the continuity of their own.\u201d\u201cEvery so often you see a little lip-tightening that suggests, \u2018What fresh hell is this?\u2019 when she is forced to endure something hideous or idiotic,\u201d Mr. York said.He also expressed concerns that the queen\u2019s line of presumed successors \u2014 Charles, Prince of Wales; Prince William, Duke of Cambridge; and Prince George \u2014 may lack her luster. \u201cWilliam has become just another middle-aged bald bloke in a suit,\u201d he said.Whatever the challenges, the queen appears to have kept the promise she made on her 21st birthday: \u201cI declare before you all, that my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated when the queen asked about the financial crisis. It was in 2008, not 1998. Earlier versions of two picture captions with this article misidentified the queen\u2019s mother. She was also named Elizabeth, but was not Queen Elizabeth I.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon May Violate India\u2019s New Rules on Foreign E-Commerce", "Date": "2016-04-07", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 For Amazon, no country is more important to its global growth ambitions than India, the second-most-populous nation in the world behind China, where online shopping is in its infancy and growing explosively.But Amazon\u2019s India plans just ran into a hitch.Late last month, the Indian government issued additional rules governing foreign ownership of e-commerce companies operating in the country. The government added regulations related to pricing and the sourcing of sales on sites that Amazon and several rivals appear to violate. What is more, the new policy was effective immediately, giving Amazon and others no time to comply.A trade group representing the Internet companies is considering sending a letter asking the Indian government for clarification or to delay enforcement of the rules until September.Analysts and Internet executives in India say they do not expect an immediate government crackdown on Amazon and others, and it is not yet clear what the consequences would be for breaking the new rules.But the regulations were at least helpful to Amazon and its rivals because India finally clarified its murky policies regarding foreign-owned e-commerce companies.Uncertainty is part of the tumult of doing business in India, which has had a flood of foreign investment in its Internet commerce sector and a corresponding wave of opposition from politically powerful domestic retailers. Online spending in India is expected to jump to nearly $75 billion by 2020 from a mere $12.1 billion last year, as more of the country\u2019s 1.25 billion people get on the Internet, according to Forrester.The stunning growth projections have led executives at Amazon, the e-commerce giant, to predict that India could be its second-largest market after the United States within a decade. In 2014, the company\u2019s chief executive, Jeffrey P. Bezos, stood atop a bus in Bangalore wearing a jodhpuri-style Indian coat and holding a giant check for $2 billion, representing the amount Amazon pledged to plow into its business in the country.\u201cWith a growing middle class and propensity to shop online, the revenue potential there is enormous,\u201d said Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Company.As in the United States, in India brick-and-mortar retailers have expressed alarm at the growth of e-commerce, and they have sued the Indian government to compel it to place more restrictions on the industry.For Amazon there is a special urgency to get India right after fumbling attempts to crack the e-commerce business in China, another huge emerging market dominated by domestic players.From the day it started in India in 2013, Amazon had to make big changes to comply with its restrictive rules governing retailing.India essentially bars companies with substantial foreign ownership from operating retail outlets that sell from their own inventories of goods. Although American multinationals like Amazon, Walmart and Apple have sought to overturn or soften those restrictions, the government has made few changes.To work around the restrictions, Amazon and competitors billed themselves as e-commerce marketplaces, eBay-like websites that matched buyers with independent sellers. Amazon owns no inventory of its own in India, though it handles the warehousing and delivery of goods for many of its independent sellers, a model it also employs in the United States.The new regulations appear to make Amazon\u2019s dependence on one large seller on its site, Cloudtail, illegal, according to industry officials and analysts. While Amazon says it has more than 80,000 sellers on its India site, Cloudtail is estimated to account for 40 percent to 50 percent of the site\u2019s sales, according to Mr. Meena of Forrester.The parent company of Cloudtail is a partnership between Catamaran Ventures, the investment firm of the Indian business magnate, N.R. Narayana Murthy, and Amazon, which owns 49 percent. India\u2019s leading e-commerce company, Flipkart, also works closely with an affiliated large seller and faces a similar problem.The agency that issued the new rules, the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion, declined to comment on whether any violations had occurred. Ishtiyaque Ahmed, a director of foreign collaboration at the agency, said he was not familiar with the details of the two companies\u2019 business arrangements \u201cso I cannot discuss a hypothetical situation.\u201dFlipkart declined to comment.One obvious course of action for Amazon is to form more joint ventures with Indian companies to reduce its reliance on any single seller like Cloudtail. Arjun Narayan, managing director of Catamaran Ventures, Amazon\u2019s partner in Cloudtail, said in an email that he did not expect any \u201cabrupt business changes\u201d for Cloudtail.Snapdeal, one of the largest e-commerce companies, which has no large sellers, welcomed the regulations.Nick Wingfield reported from Seattle and Vindu Goel from San Francisco.
