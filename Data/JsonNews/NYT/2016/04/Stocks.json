{"Headline": "Disposable Workers", "Date": "2016-04-16", "News": "Supported byLettersReaders discuss the culture and lack of job security in tech companies today.If the most critical issue this article is highlighting is how disposable employees are in the technology world, I think it would be wise to consider the macro trends in the economy, all of which point to a more distributed, happier work force of people who use their skills across dozens of companies in their working lives.CHRISTOPHER SCHRADERHong Kong The writer is chief executive of The Graduate, a company that connects students with experts using artificial intelligence.To the Editor: People who are willing to work \u201coff the clock,\u201d or work 60-plus-hour weeks at entry-level positions, or read work email and respond 24/7, even when \u201con vacation,\u201d are also a substantial part of the problem. They\u2019re feeding the very beast that\u2019s feasting on their flesh.It\u2019s been observed that companies have no social compact with employees anymore, so it is incumbent on individuals to set limits and stick to them. I did so and never once got fired for it. Even if I had been, who wants a job that robs you of any personal life? After hanging on to my first job, one that made me soul-sick, I was determined that I would never repeat that mistake again, and didn\u2019t. My career may have suffered some, but I gained immeasurably. I refuse to work for any entity that doesn\u2019t recognize that I am a human being who not only has a life outside of work, but also that I work in order to have that life. I don\u2019t live to work. No one should.BRIAN VOGELStaunton, Va.To the Editor: Nothing described in this article is in any way limited to the tech industry. I\u2019m rather amazed that Dan Lyons sounds so surprised \u2014 as if \u201cit\u2019s not supposed to happen here.\u201d Of course it does, and of course it will. It is old-fashioned contempt for workers, only now it\u2019s occurring in an exposed-brick setting with a latte machine off to the right. Perhaps some of the obvious arrogance feels new to Mr. Lyons, but it really isn\u2019t.Workers, of whatever caliber and educational level, have always been exploited by employers and management, and that\u2019s not going to change just because it\u2019s the next generation being all whizzy. I\u2019ve seen just about everything highlighted in this article on two continents (I\u2019m American-born but have lived and worked in the Netherlands for the last 11 years) \u2014 not just in tech-related companies, but in other for-profit environments, as well as in nonprofit and social service areas.In fact, the first time I heard a manager fling the word \u201cproductivity\u201d at her staff was in a mental health agency setting. She was angry that counselors weren\u2019t seeing enough patients per day, completely ignoring the fact that a lot of the patients, who were members of very stressed and troubled populations, weren\u2019t showing up. But of course, it was the staff\u2019s not \u201cproducing\u201d enough, not the context within which they worked, that was viewed as the problem. All of this should remind people why strong and powerful unions are necessary, and why union membership should be embraced by us all.CARL M. LEWISAmsterdamTo the Editor: I understand that being laid off can be confusing and frustrating. However, you quoted a line from a book that expresses it perfectly: \u201cYour company is not your family.\u201dTimes are changing. Companies see people as a resource, and their bottom line is profit. If you can\u2019t provide value for them, why should they keep you around? There is no such thing as job security today. It is time to adapt to this new work culture that many companies have adopted rather than reminisce about the \u201990s. An alternative to this insufferable environment is being your own boss, where freedom awaits you.JAMES LEISan Jose, Calif.To the Editor: Dan Lyons takes issue with the idiosyncrasies of start-up culture. Unfortunately, his essay fails to understand the millennial zeitgeist and what young people really want out of work and life. While he craves normalcy, stability and hierarchy, our generation seeks out adventure, progress and meaning. A start-up provides these things in abundance. Change is a constant, and no one knows whether the company will be around in six months. Despite the risk, this is an environment where we can truly feel alive.JEFF PAWLAKSan FranciscoThe writer is a growth marketer for GrubMarket, a start-up.To the Editor: One might ask why it is that executives were so focused on retaining technology talent in the \u201980s and \u201990s and are so indifferent to it now. It\u2019s because back then technology talent was harder to come by. You had to be a lot of things \u2014 an analyst, a business process architect, a programmer, a documentation writer, etc. There weren\u2019t that many who could do that, then or now. Every discipline now has its career path, so people are far more replaceable because they\u2019re far narrower in what they offer; also, a lot of the processes are being automated, so people are increasingly disposable.RICHARD LUETTGENRamsey, N.J.To the Editor: The toxic work environment we have today simply reflects our current American values. Employees were once a valued part of the organizations I worked for. Now they are disposable parts. Our children have been raised to value material gain at the cost of lifestyle and positive human experience, and we are paying the price in lower happiness and higher stress and related disease. This won\u2019t change until our culture changes.GREGORY A. BORRORBailey, Colo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dell\u2019s SecureWorks Has Lackluster Trading Debut", "Date": "2016-04-22", "News": "Supported bySecureWorks is the first initial public stock offering of the technology industry this year. That may be the extent of the victory lap for the tech I.P.O. market, at least for now.In its first day of trading on Friday, shares of SecureWorks, a digital security company, have been hovering near the $14 price it set the night before. The stock opened on the Nasdaq market at $13.89.SecureWorks raised $112 million, selling eight million shares. It had been marketing nine million shares within the range of $15.50 to $17.50, indicating that demand was weaker than expected.The lackluster demand is not that surprising.For one thing, SecureWorks has little in common with so-called unicorns \u2014 those private, venture-backed start-ups with valuations above $1 billion that have been avoiding the public markets. SecureWorks is 17 years old, based in Georgia and owned by Dell.And the ways in which SecureWorks does resemble some unicorns \u2014 top-line revenue growth, a history of losses and an enterprise-software business model \u2014 are not the most encouraging for investors.Recent trading among already public security stocks did not help SecureWorks\u2019 deal.Shares of FireEye and Rapid7 declined in recent weeks as SecureWorks was meeting with potential buyers of its stock. Investors look to companies similar to the one going public when trying to determine what price they might be willing to pay for the I.P.O. When the so-called comparables slip, it can be a bad sign for the debutant.Dell will own 86 percent of SecureWorks after the offering, and it is hoping the share price will rise in the public market. Dell will also control more than 98 percent of the voting power through a separate class of shares.The I.P.O. price yields a valuation of $1.1 billion, which is almost double the roughly $600 million Dell paid for the company in 2011, according to Triton Research, which provides information on private companies.SecureWorks said it might use the proceeds from the offering to develop new solutions or enhance current ones, and fund capital expenditures. Those funds may be necessary as competition in the security world increases.The company said in the filing that it expected \u201cpricing pressures within the information security market to intensify as a result of action by our larger competitors to reduce the prices of their security monitoring, detection and prevention products and managed security services.\u201dStill, the company has drawn quite a bit of revenue from its 4,200 customers. SecureWorks reported $339.5 million in total revenue for the year through Jan. 29, a 30 percent increase from the same period last year. SecureWorks had $72.4 million in losses for the year, almost twice as much as the same period in 2015.Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase are managing the offering.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yale Advances in Shaping Portfolio to Address Climate Change", "Date": "2016-04-12", "News": "Supported byYale University has made progress in minimizing its endowment portfolio\u2019s exposure to less environmentally sound investments such as stocks of companies that contribute to climate change, a letter released on Tuesday showed.Yale generally does not manage its own investment directly but hires outside money managers to make decisions. Nearly two years ago, the Yale University Investment Office asked the firms that managed its endowment, then $20.8 billion, to assess their investments. The office asked managers to avoid investments that did not take sensible steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Yale endowment, while not the largest, is closely watched by other universities and money managers who invest in publicly held companies.On Tuesday, David F. Swensen, Yale\u2019s chief investment officer, released a letter to the school\u2019s Advisory Committee on Investor Responsibility saying that Yale had taken several steps with climate change in mind.Rather than simply selling investments as a response to political pressures, Yale was asking its managers to consider the financial risks of climate change and the risks that those investments held if governments did impose carbon taxes. \u201cWhat we did was to take a look at the economics and come up with an economically driven decision,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. Mr. Swensen added that the reaction was heartening.\u201cWhen we sent out the letter, one of our energy-focused managers, Arc Financial, did an analysis of a carbon audit of every single energy position in the portfolio and assessed the exposure to more stringent emissions regulation,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are using it as a tool when they make new investments. They also published a white paper on the issue.\u201dIn his letter to the committee, Mr. Swensen pointed out that the firm developed \u201ca framework for assessing, reporting and comparing the greenhouse gas intensity of fossil fuel operations on an apples-to-apples basis.\u201dTwo of Yale\u2019s other money managers had positions that were not consistent with Yale\u2019s approach, Mr. Swensen wrote. One held a small position in a company that engaged in the production and sale of coal. Another had interests on Yale\u2019s behalf in two publicly traded oil sands producers. Though the investments were valued at only $10 million in total, those positions have since been sold.While it would not have been as easy for Yale to sell investments in individual companies because it does not manage most of its money internally, it still has some separate accounts that would allow the endowment to sell those stocks as it did when it sold holdings in South Africa and Sudan some years ago.For example, the Yale endowment was close to making an investment in an energy company. \u201cThat investment had even been approved by the endowment\u2019s board,\u201d Mr. Swensen said. \u201cBut when we sat down with the company and brought up these issues, they denied it was a problem, so we did not go forward with the investment.\u201dMr. Swensen\u2019s average return over 10 years ending June 2015 was 10 percent, slightly eclipsed by returns at M.I.T., Bowdoin College and Princeton. At each of those schools, the endowment is led by a manager who trained under Mr. Swensen in the investment office at Yale.Mr. Swensen recalled that the initial approach came up after Yale decided that it would not simply ask managers to sell shares in companies under question. Yale\u2019s president, Peter Salovey, asked Mr. Swensen what the school could say, and the investment office came up with this plan.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In a Big Hole for a Detroit House, but Happy", "Date": "2016-04-22", "News": "Supported byYour Money7 PhotosDETROIT \u2014 Many residents of high-cost areas entertain the dream, at least occasionally: Give up the rent or mortgage grind, liquidate assets and start over someplace cheaper, perhaps one that could use a few spirited new residents.Amy Haimerl and her husband, Karl Kaebnick, fell hard for Detroit and thought they could make their own dream of financial freedom come true when they moved here in 2013. But this is what happened: They put more than $400,000 (including all of their retirement savings) into a 3,000-square-foot, 102-year-old home in the city\u2019s West Village neighborhood that was most recently appraised at just $300,000.They claim, however, to be 100 percent satisfied and genuinely happy. Which raises a question: Are they insane?So let\u2019s start with those facts. Ms. Haimerl, who is 40, and Mr. Kaebnick, 44, had about $10,000 in liquid assets when they decided to move. They settled on a house on a block where only two homes were boarded up.They bought the smaller one, a wreck with no wires or radiators or doors or pipes, for $35,000, liquidating Ms. Haimerl\u2019s retirement account to close without a mortgage. \u201cThere is essentially nothing left inside the walls,\u201d she writes in her book. \u201cWhat we have is a pile of bricks with character.\u201dFor the renovation, they were counting on the $110,000 that would be left from Mr. Kaebnick\u2019s accounts. The previous owners had figured it would take $150,000 or so to make it habitable. What could go wrong?Well, the couple was missing two crucial bits of knowledge, one about the Detroit market and the other about themselves.First, they realized only after they had bought the house that there were no construction loans available. That was because there wasn\u2019t any evidence that after renovation, homes like theirs would be worth more than what it would cost to fix them. So whatever work the couple wanted to do, they would have to pay for it themselves. Then, they could try to get a mortgage after the work was done and take out cash to repay any other debts they incurred along the way.And it turned out that there were a lot of those debts, in part because the couple misjudged the amount of work they would need and want to do. They started by looking at options for doing just $100,000 of work, but that might have forced them to move in without any water. The only contractor who made them feel comfortable figured it would take $300,000.He went to work, and they ended up spending $400,000 total, not including the purchase price. You\u2019ve heard versions of this story before, but the specifics here involved a balcony from a crumbling church that made incredible wainscoting but begged for matching custom woodwork and installation that eventually cost $65,000.So they borrowed $75,000 from Ms. Haimerl\u2019s father and $40,000 from her grandparents and aunt. Mr. Kaebnick\u2019s family chipped in with kitchen appliances in lieu of a wedding or a gift, and the rest came from a $25,000 Lending Club loan, $50,000 in USAA personal loans and some credit card debt.The result is by no means extravagant, though it is a lot of space for two people with no designs on having children. The interior trim is bare, and the house still needs paint in many rooms. It\u2019s missing a porch, and the garage out back is crumbling.On paper, Ms. Haimerl is about the last person you would expect to go all in like this. She grew up poor and lost a house to a foreclosure in Denver several years ago, when a previous relationship disintegrated. She has even worked as a personal finance editor.The money scold in me believes she should have known better, but she believes she knows plenty. \u201cAs a contractor\u2019s daughter, I grew up with men who want to do it right,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t skimp on work now because you pay for it later.\u201d So they shored up the roof and rebuilt the rear of the structure.Then, there is her take on retirement. Her father had $75,000 to lend to her because he had been forced to liquidate a once-thriving business that he built after the family\u2019s earlier lean years. \u201cI never grew up with any idea that there would be retirement,\u201d she said. \u201cYou were trying not to go to a payday lender. My dad\u2019s retirement was supposed to be the business.\u201dMs. Haimerl is a writer and Mr. Kaebnick is a computer programmer, and perhaps they can work well into their 70s or 80s. In the meantime, their net worth is negative. They did get a mortgage after the work was done, and the appraiser assigned the $300,000 value to their home, a triumph in their neighborhood at the time.\u201cI\u2019m confident other contractors would not have made the same call,\u201d Mr. Garfield said. \u201cBut I do think everyone we have done business with has become a friend, and in that mix of things, this seemed to be the right thing to do.\u201dBut how best to explain away their lack of retirement savings? Plenty of people who sank their life savings into real estate in less desirable parts of Brooklyn or San Francisco a decade or two ago are probably thrilled.So is that how they think about the money they have put into their Detroit dream? That they bet on a city instead of a bunch of stocks? \u201cWe have gotten gun-shy about talking that way,\u201d Ms. Haimerl said. \u201cPeople here say, \u2018How dare you treat our city like an investment.\u2019\u201dMr. Kaebnick said he understood the sentiment. \u201cSo many people who stuck it out here for so long never had anything to show for it,\u201d he said. \u201cTo them, we might come across as privileged newcomers who are going to ride it to the bank.\u201dIn the meantime, Ms. Haimerl and Mr. Kaebnick have not found financial freedom in Detroit, though they insist that they are so much richer for having moved. In a poignant moment early in her book, Ms. Haimerl describes gazing longingly into a window in a newly gentrified Denver neighborhood, before her dream of homeownership there turned into a nightmare. The living room looked like luxury, a place where the residents weren\u2019t constantly hustling to hold things together.Aspiring homeowners in Detroit may well walk down her street someday soon, see her through the window and wonder how she had it so good. Would they be jealous? Should they be?\u201cI thought maybe that once you were inside the window, you didn\u2019t have to hustle,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the truth is, we\u2019re all hustling.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the surname of the contractor hired by Amy Haimerl and Karl Kaebnick for their home in Detroit. It is Calvin Garfield, not Maxwell.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Despite Wall St. Wavering, Merger Market Is Largely Intact", "Date": "2016-03-31", "News": "Supported byBy many measures, the markets should have made for a fairly weak quarter in deal making.And yet, somehow the numbers came out all right.Globally, companies conducted $682.3 billion worth of transactions during the three months through March, according to data compiled as of Wednesday by Thomson Reuters. While that figure is below last year\u2019s comparable period, it is about 14 percent above the average volume during each of the first quarters over the last two decades, the data showed. The number of deals \u2014 8,491 during the first quarter \u2014 was about 1.6 percent less than the mean, according to the data.\u201cI think this market is relatively healthy, not withstanding the fact that we had some pretty significant market turbulence,\u201d said Mark G. Shafir, the global co-head of mergers and acquisitions at Citigroup. \u201cThe market held up pretty well and confidence held up pretty well.\u201dInstead of succumbing to the turbulence, companies sought targets outside their homelands. Cross-border mergers and acquisitions represented almost half of the deals, a record for any first quarter, Thomson Reuters data showed.Six of the top 10 deals during the quarter involved buyers and sellers from different countries.\u201cGiven the decline in the U.S. stock market, it certainly created opportunities to buy companies at values that may not have existed in recent years,\u201d said Larry Hamdan, the head of Americas mergers and acquisitions at Barclays.For many deal advisers the quarter felt a bit quieter compared with last year \u2014 a record in terms of aggregate transaction values. In the first three months of 2016, the figure was more than 57 percent below the fourth quarter of 2015, Thomson Reuters data showed.\u201cThere\u2019s a little more uncertainty in the market than a year ago,\u201d said Kai Haakon Liekefett, a partner in the mergers and acquisitions group at Vinson & Elkins. \u201cLast year was an unbelievable, record year.

{"Headline": "Climate-Related Death of Coral Around World Alarms Scientists", "Date": "2016-04-09", "News": "Supported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 Kim Cobb, a marine scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology, expected the coral to be damaged when she plunged into the deep blue waters off Kiritimati Island, a remote atoll near the center of the Pacific Ocean. Still, she was stunned by what she saw as she descended some 30 feet to the rim of a coral outcropping.\u201cThe entire reef is covered with a red-brown fuzz,\u201d Dr. Cobb said when she returned to the surface after her recent dive. \u201cIt is otherworldly. It is algae that has grown over dead coral. It was devastating.\u201dThe damage off Kiritimati is part of a mass bleaching of coral reefs around the world, only the third on record and possibly the worst ever. Scientists believe that heat stress from multiple weather events including the latest, severe El Ni\u00f1o, compounded by climate change, has threatened more than a third of Earth\u2019s coral reefs. Many may not recover.Coral reefs are the crucial incubators of the ocean\u2019s ecosystem, providing food and shelter to a quarter of all marine species, and they support fish stocks that feed more than one billion people. They are made up of millions of tiny animals, called polyps, that form symbiotic relationships with algae, which in turn capture sunlight and carbon dioxide to make sugars that feed the polyps.An estimated 30 million small-scale fishermen and women depend on reefs for their livelihoods, more than one million in the Philippines alone. In Indonesia, fish supported by the reefs provide the primary source of protein.\u201cThis is a huge, looming planetary crisis, and we are sticking our heads in the sand about it,\u201d said Justin Marshall, the director of CoralWatch at Australia\u2019s University of Queensland.Bleaching occurs when high heat and bright sunshine cause the metabolism of the algae \u2014 which give coral reefs their brilliant colors and energy \u2014 to speed out of control, and they start creating toxins. The polyps recoil. If temperatures drop, the corals can recover, but denuded ones remain vulnerable to disease. When heat stress continues, they starve to death.Damaged or dying reefs have been found from R\u00e9union, off the coast of Madagascar, to East Flores, Indonesia, and from Guam and Hawaii in the Pacific to the Florida Keys in the Atlantic.\u201cThere is a good chance a large portion of the damaged coral will die,\u201d he added.Scientists say the global bleaching is the result of an unusual confluence of events, each of which raised water temperatures already elevated by climate change.In the North Atlantic, a strong high-pressure cell blocked the normal southward flow of polar air in 2013, kicking off the first of three warmer-than-normal winters in a row as far south as the Caribbean.A large underwater heat wave formed in the northeastern Pacific in early 2014, and has since stretched into a wide band along the west coast of North America, from Baja California to the Bering Sea. Nicknamed the Blob, it is up to four degrees Fahrenheit warmer than surrounding waters, and has been blamed for a host of odd phenomena, including the beaching of hungry sea lions in California and the sighting of tropical skipjack tuna off Alaska.Then came 2015, with the most powerful El Ni\u00f1o climate cycle in a century. It blasted heat across the tropical and southern Pacific, bleaching reefs from Kiritimati to Indonesia, and across the Indian Ocean to R\u00e9union and Tanzania on Africa\u2019s east coast.\u201cWe are currently experiencing the longest global coral bleaching event ever observed,\u201d said C. Mark Eakin, the Coral Reef Watch coordinator at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Maryland. \u201cWe are going to lose a lot of the world\u2019s reefs during this event.\u201dReefs that take centuries to form can be destroyed in weeks. Individual corals may survive a bleaching, but repeated bleachings can kill them.Lurid reports of damaged reefs started coming in from worried scientists in the summer of 2014.Lyza Johnston, a marine biologist in the Northern Mariana Islands, dived to the reefs off Maug, a group of small islands: \u201cIn every direction, nearly all of the corals were bright white.\u201dMisaki Takabayashi, a marine scientist at the University of Hawaii at Hilo, surfed the waves above the blue rice coral there: \u201cI could see what looked like bleached white ghosts popping up off the ocean floor at me.\u201dCory Walter, a senior biologist at the Mote Marine Laboratory in Florida, peered down from a boat over Wonderland Reef off the Lower Florida Keys: \u201cIt almost looks like it snowed on the reef.\u201dPredicting the duration of the bleaching or forecasting the next one is difficult. The Blob has cooled somewhat, and El Ni\u00f1o, while weakening, is expected to stretch into 2017.Dr. Eakin, the coral-reef specialist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said he expected the bleaching to continue for nine more months. Scientists will not be able to measure the full extent of the damage until it is over.What is clear is that these events are happening with increasing frequency \u2014 and ferocity. The previous bleachings, in 2010 and 1998, do not appear to have been as extensive or prolonged as the current one.The 1998 bleaching, which Dr. Eakin said had been set off by a fierce El Ni\u00f1o, killed around 16 percent of the world\u2019s coral. By 2010, oceans had warmed enough that it took only a moderate El Ni\u00f1o to start another round.Then in 2013, Dr. Eakin said, \u201ca lot of bleaching happened due to climate change, before the El Ni\u00f1o had even kicked in.\u201dReefs that were bleached in 2014, like those in the Florida Keys and the Caribbean, had no time to regenerate before suffering further thermal stress from El Ni\u00f1o last year, leaving the coral vulnerable to disease and death.The reefs in the Florida Keys \u201care about to go into a third year straight of bleaching, something that has never happened before,\u201d said Meaghan Johnson, a marine scientist at the Nature Conservancy. \u201cWe are worried about disease and mortality rates.\u201dOve Hoegh-Guldberg, the director of Australia\u2019s Global Change Institute, noted that 2015 was the hottest year ever recorded, both on land and in the oceans \u2014 breaking a record set just the year before.\u201cRising temperatures due to climate change have pushed corals beyond their tolerance levels,\u201d he said, adding that back-to-back bleaching can be particularly deadly to the corals.El Ni\u00f1o warms the equatorial waters around Kiritimati Island more than anywhere else in the world, making it a likely harbinger for the health of reefs worldwide. That is why Dr. Cobb, the Georgia Tech scientist who made the recent dive, has been making the trek at least once a year for the past 18 to the tiny atoll, part of the Line Islands archipelago.Though the atoll sits just north of the Equator, trade winds suck water up from the depths of the ocean, usually keeping the water temperature surrounding the reefs a healthy, nearly constant 78 degrees.But in 2015, the expected upwelling of deep, cold water did not happen, Dr. Cobb said, speaking by satellite phone after her dive. So water in the atoll was 10 degrees warmer than normal, and never cooled enough to allow coral to recover.\u201cThe worst has happened,\u201d she said. \u201cThis shows how climate change and temperature stresses are affecting these reefs over the long haul. This reef may not ever be the same.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Claims of a Ponzi Scheme in the Collapse of a Rare-Wine Seller", "Date": "2016-04-02", "News": "Supported byInside WealthFrom the outside, the Premier Cru wine store in Berkeley, Calif., looked like a traditional, upscale wine seller. The 29,000-square-foot store was lined with tapestries, wood shelves and a \u201crare wine room\u201d stocked with trophy Bordeaux and Burgundies.Yet Premier Cru didn\u2019t just sell wine off the shelves. According to court documents, it built a global, multimillion-dollar trading empire selling futures contracts for French wine to thousands of rich collectors and investors over the Internet. Now investigators and customers are looking into whether Premier Cru\u2019s futures business was also used to fund the largest-ever Ponzi scheme in the wine world \u2014 with some of the biggest victims coming from China.In January, facing mounting lawsuits from customers, Premier Cru filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation. The company listed $70 million in debt and only $7 million in assets. Along with more than 9,000 victims, the crash of Premier Cru has left a trail of questions: What happened to the more than $60 million in customer payments? How did a 35-year-old wine store that became a favorite of the rich suddenly go bust? And how did so many smart collectors get bilked out of millions?Premier Cru\u2019s co-founder and owner, John Fox, could not be reached for comment. His bankruptcy and criminal-defense lawyers declined to comment.Mr. Fox has invoked his Fifth Amendment right in declining to provide financial details on his bankruptcy or the case, according to lawyers. Creditors are seeking his 2016 Corvette and his 2014 Ferrari as part of the bankruptcy.\u201cA few of our old-time customers are used to waiting,\u201d Mr. Fox said at the time. \u201cThey know they\u2019ll get their wine. But customers that have come around in the last six to seven years, because we have good wines at the right price, they are not used to waiting extended periods.\u201dThe list of Premier Cru\u2019s victims reads like a who\u2019s who of wealthy wine collectors \u2014 from the billionaire Jeff Greene to top financiers on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley. Arthur Patterson, the tech venture capitalist of Accel Partners, was owed $836,000 by Premier Cru, according to court filings. Adebayo Ogunlesi, the Goldman Sachs board member and chairman of Global Infrastructure Partners, spent over $470,000 with Premier Cru.Of course, few will have sympathy for wealthy oenophiles crying over their spilled Margaux. Yet the victims also include teachers, doctors, accountants and wine store workers who used their savings to buy special-occasion wines with Premier Cru.\u201cSure it hurts,\u201d said Ned Valois, a retired Florida policeman who may have lost $800 to Premier Cru. \u201cI got suckered into it by the prices. They seemed too good to be true, and they were.\u201dPremier Cru\u2019s collapse has sent a chill through the broader wine and collectibles market. As wine, art, classic cars and other collectibles have soared in value and transformed from status trophies into financial investments, they have also become more prone to fraud. Although fake vintage wine has dogged the industry for years, there are signs that wine fraud has reached a new \u201cfinancialized\u201d stage, where millions of dollars are lost without a single bottle changing hands.Premier Cru started out as a low-price wine shop for high-income collectors. Founded in 1980 by Mr. Fox and other partners, it outgrew its store in Emeryville, Calif., and in 2011 opened its gigantic emporium on University Avenue in Berkeley.Clients said Mr. Fox was the driving force behind Premier Cru. Tall, businesslike and better known for his taste in fast cars than fine wine, Mr. Fox often dealt with Premier Cru\u2019s biggest clients and orders. Much of Premier Cru\u2019s business came online. Clients say wine buyers often search the Internet for the best prices for top wines, and Premier Cru often undercut its competitors by 15 to 20 percent \u2014 significant savings for wines that may sell for more than $1,000 a bottle.In the 2000s, Premier Cru started expanding its business of selling wine futures, according to clients. Futures allow customers to pay for wine (usually Bordeaux or Burgundy) while it is still in the barrel but is not yet bottled or sold in retail outlets. The wine is delivered more than a year later. If a wine increases in value while it\u2019s aging, the buyer gets the wine at a discount. Some buyers can also use futures to buy wine they can later flip for a profit, making futures more like a financial investment.Thomas Boothe, a lawyer in Portland, Ore., started buying wine and futures from Premier Cru in the late 1980s, he said. He talked with Mr. Fox several times over the years.\u201cHe was pretty formal, not someone you would chat about family or wine with,\u201d Mr. Boothe said. While Mr. Boothe\u2019s shipments would sometimes be delayed, Premier Cru largely delivered as promised \u2014 until about 2010, he said. The delays and excuses kept building until April 2015 when, Mr. Boothe said, Premier Cru owed him more than $161,000 for wine that was never delivered. His orders included a $9,600 bottle of Roman\u00e9e-Conti and $2,700 bottles of P\u00e9trus.When Mr. Boothe called the store to complain, he said Mr. Fox offered various excuses, such as computer errors, shipping snags and problems with a wine merchant in France. Mr. Boothe filed suit in January. Like many lawsuits filed by customers against Premier Cru, Mr. Boothe\u2019s has been stayed by the bankruptcy. Mr. Boothe said his credit card company has reimbursed him for all but $50,000 or $60,000 of his claims.In 2010 and 2011, prices for many Bordeaux wines fell as Chinese buyers started turning to Burgundy. The value of some Bordeaux wines fell more than 40 percent below their original futures price. As the values fell, Premier Cru\u2019s prices went from \u201csimply low to irrationally low,\u201d according to Mr. Boothe.For instance, clients say Premier Cru was selling bottles of 1996 Lafite Rothschild for $600, even though they normally sell for $1,000 or more.\u201cAt that point the alarm bells should have sounded,\u201d Mr. Boothe said.When Brad Karp, a New Mexico real estate developer, started buying wine from Premier Cru, he was happy with the initial deliveries. But then he started buying Burgundy and Bordeaux futures purely as financial investments.\u201cI wanted a different risk profile from stocks,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I started allocating capital toward wine futures.\u201dBy 2015 he was owed $712,000 by Premier Cru, he said. Some of the wine he bought was later delivered and his credit-card company refunded some of his payments. Yet Mr. Karp estimates he is still owed about $300,000.\u201cI don\u2019t expect to see that money or wine again,\u201d he said.Some of biggest victims appear to be from China. Lawrence Wai-Mun Hui of Hong Kong spent about $981,000 for wine from Premier Cru that was never delivered, according to a court documents. A collector named Amanda Gong in Harbin, China, is owed $669,000, while a Chinese wine collector and investor named Bo Feng is claiming losses of $660,000, according to filings.So far, the bankruptcy trustee and investigators have not been able to find out how Mr. Fox or his partners spent or lost the money. Mr. Fox filed for Chapter 7 personal bankruptcy in February claiming assets of less than $50,000 and debts of $50 million to $100 million. He sold his home in Alamo, Calif., in January for about $3 million and is now renting, according to lawyers involved in the case.Mr. Boothe said Mr. Fox complained to him of health problems in one of their last conversations, late last year.\u201cHe had back issues, and he said the stress was getting to him,\u201d Mr. Boothe said.An article last Sunday about Premier Cru, a Berkeley, Calif., wine store that is under investigation on suspicion of running a Ponzi scheme on futures contracts for French wines, erroneously included one person among the creditors or customers of the store. William Koch, of Medford, Ore., was in that group; William I. Koch, the Palm Beach, Fla., billionaire, was not.ROBERT FRANK is CNBC wealth editor and the author of \u201cRichistan.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Only one family has ever done so.Nor do the parents at P.S. 124 consider test preparation to be anathema, as other parents do. Many purchase their own test-prep books \u2014 a nearby stationery store stocks a wide variety, including Barron\u2019s \u201cCommon Core Success\u201d series \u2014 or send their children to after-school or Saturday programs where they get additional drills.On Wednesday after school, teachers were offering some students help. Alpona Datta was there to pick up her son, who is in the third grade. \u201cI just said, \u2018Take the test \u2014 this is a good thing,\u2019\u201d she said. Ms. Datta, a teaching aide for the city\u2019s Education Department, said that she was nervous about the exams and had made her son do three practice tests at home in the past month. But she believed that taking the tests was a valuable experience.\u201cI grew up in Bangladesh, and at the end of the year we always have tests,\u201d she said. \u201cI like that they have tests.\u201dKevin Chin, an executive at a nonprofit with a daughter in the fourth grade at P.S. 124, said he had not considered for a minute to opt out of the tests.\u201cIf she does well, then I\u2019m happy,\u201d he said. \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t do well, I know where she is.\u201dHe acknowledged that a test may not speak to every child\u2019s talents. \u201cBut when you go out into the real world, you\u2019re measured against everybody else,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not how brilliant you are, in your own way.\u201dThe city\u2019s high-performing charter schools have also had very few students opt out. Throughout KIPP NYC, a network of charter schools, just four of some 2,200 students eligible to take the exams opted out last year. Success Academy, the city\u2019s largest charter network, has not had a single student opt out in its existence, Eva S. Moskowitz, Success\u2019s founder, said on Friday at the network\u2019s pretest pep rally, which was held in a gymnasium at the City College of New York in Upper Manhattan.Ms. Moskowitz said that when parents have asked about opting out, as a few did last year, the network has urged them to have their children take the test. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to be able to opt out of the SAT,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to be able to opt out of the Common Application for college\u201d or assignments given to them by employers.\u201cWe think it\u2019s just part of life,\u201d she added.Some parents at P.S. 124 said that they had heard through the news media that some parents objected to the tests and felt they were not a valid measure of students\u2019 abilities.Kathy Ou, who has a son and daughter in kindergarten, said that she still believed the tests were important.\u201cTests figure out the level of the students,\u201d Ms. Ou said. Without tests, she added, students could easily be overconfident and not work hard.\u201cThey give them some motivation for further study, for further learning,\u201d she said.At P.S. 124, where 95 percent of the students are Asian, nearly half come from families receiving some form of public assistance, and 37 percent are not proficient in English. Even so, 57 percent of the school\u2019s students in grades three through eight passed the state reading tests last year, and 81 percent passed the state math tests. Citywide, the passing rates were 30 percent and 36 percent.By contrast, at P.S. 8, in Brooklyn Heights, where 16 percent of the students are on public assistance and 3 percent are not proficient in English, 64 percent of students passed the reading tests, and 63 percent passed the math tests. Nearly 17 percent of the students opted out last year.Throughout the year, P.S. 124, in partnership with a nonprofit, offers help in reading and math on Saturdays for some third and fourth graders. Beginning in January, students who need more preparation stay after school once a week for extra practice.On Wednesday afternoon, children in a fourth-grade classroom were going over a section in their test-prep books about how to distinguish among poems, plays and prose.In another room, a group of third graders were looking at a classmate\u2019s essay on a story about three woodland animals. The essay prompt asked how the animals\u2019 feelings changed over the course of the story. The teacher, Rebecca Adelman, asked the students to score their classmate\u2019s essay on several features: content and analysis; command of evidence; coherence, organization, and style; and accurate punctuation, capitalization, spelling and grammar.Ms. Adelman asked the girl whose essay it was to point to a piece of evidence she had drawn from the story. The girl pointed to where she had quoted one of the animals saying, \u201cIt is boring in the night forest.\u201d\u201cHow do we know that\u2019s evidence?\u201d Ms. Adelman asked the students. \u201cHow do we know that\u2019s evidence from the text?\u201d\u201cBecause it\u2019s something a character says,\u201d a boy volunteered.And what else did the writer do, Ms. Adelman asked, so that \u201cwe can definitely tell she used evidence exactly from the text?\u201dAnother boy\u2019s hand shot up. \u201cQuotation marks,\u201d he said.The parents at P.S. 124 are not wholly uncritical of the tests. Minphay Chiou, whose son is in the fourth grade, said that she wished the tests were shorter and more closely aligned to the curriculum. But she said that she believed that test-taking was a skill and that her son might as well develop it.\u201cWhen he applies to college, he\u2019s going to need to take a test,\u201d Ms. Chiou said.When another parent, Yvonne Chen, was asked if she had considered having her daughter sit out the tests, she made an expression that suggested the questioner needed to have her head examined.\u201cI thought she has to take the test,\u201d Ms. Chen said with a furrowed brow. \u201cIs it optional?\u201dIn any case, she said, if she did have a choice, she was having her daughter opt in.\u201cLet her get used to it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a bad thing; I think it is good.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Investing With a Conscience, but Done by a Robot", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported byCracker Barrel Old Country Store, the company behind a chain of down-home restaurants, might not seem an obvious model for advanced financial technology. Its specialty is vintage: vintage food, and in its gift shops, vintage toys and vintage music in the form of hymnal CDs.Yet an upstart fund manager called Arabesque Partners has determined that Cracker Barrel is among the most attractive investments out there in a special category that takes into account environmental, social and governance factors \u2014 known in the industry as ESG.And even more intriguing: The calculation was not made by a human analyst, but by a robotic one.In the most recent full quarter for which data was available, Cracker Barrel represented 1.31 percent of the Arabesque Prime fund, which factors in a company\u2019s sustainability and corporate responsibility track record before investing. That was more than any other stock, including more obvious suspects like Unilever, the consumer goods giant that is obsessed with sustainability, and Xinyi Solar Holdings, a big maker of solar panel components.Arabesque is one of a growing number of investors that are leaning on mountains of new data about companies\u2019 environmental, social and governance performances in hopes of making more profitable trades.New firms like Arabesque are making ESG data a core part of their strategy. Goldman Sachs has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to start an ESG-focused exchange-traded fund. And the biggest money managers in the world, including BlackRock, now regularly incorporate ESG analysis as they compose their portfolios.The motivation is not entirely about ethics. Underpinning the strategy is a belief that companies that take better care of the environment and their communities will perform better in the long run.\u201cNo one wants to be patronized with a moral argument,\u201d said Andreas Feiner, head of ESG research at Arabesque. \u201cYou tell investors that these companies are going to perform better.\u201dAnd yet even among the most strident capitalists, there is a growing sense that doing well by doing good is in vogue.\u201cWe have the opportunity to marry making money with a purpose,\u201d Mr. Feiner said. \u201cThat is a very rare thing in finance.\u201dWhat makes the Arabesque position in Cracker Barrel all the more surprising is that it wasn\u2019t a fund manager who made the decision to invest. It was an algorithm.Arabesque bills itself as the first firm exclusively focused on ESG investing through quantitative analysis \u2014 that is, with algorithms, rather than humans, picking the stocks. It has two funds, with about $50 million under management. Its Prime fund is fully invested in equities and rebalanced quarterly, while its Systematic fund moves money to cash holdings during periods of market volatility and is rebalanced daily.To make these decisions, Arabesque\u2019s technology relies on an expanding universe of data concerning the ESG performance of thousands of companies. Among the biggest suppliers of such information are Bloomberg, Sustainalytics and MSCI. Bloomberg said that about 15,000 of its customers regularly accessed the ESG data it provided through its terminals.To compile the data, firms like Bloomberg mine regulatory filings, company sustainability reports and websites to find seemingly obscure information, such as how much nitrous oxide a manufacturer emits each year, how many employees died on the job, and how many women are in management positions.Once firms like Arabesque get their hands on the data, they add it to their algorithms and place their faith \u2014 and funds \u2014 in the wisdom of the machine.Arabesque has gone further than most, turning over the entire composition of its funds to algorithms rather than to humans. But many traditional institutional investors are moving in similar directions. At Newton, part of BNY Mellon, ESG considerations are part of the everyday investment decisions.\u201cTo make the best risk-adjusted return decision, what I am doing is thinking more broadly and more holistically about things that a lot of investors don\u2019t traditionally think about,\u201d said Sandra Carlisle, head of responsible investment at Newton. \u201cTake climate change. It\u2019s very clear that that manifests itself in physical risk, in all sorts of things. That was not something that we were thinking about in the 20th century.\u201dBNY Mellon scoops up data from Bloomberg and Sustainalytics, as well as RepRisk, which does broad ESG analysis; CDP, which focuses on carbon emissions; and Institutional Shareholder Services, a corporate governance specialist.About 15 years ago, the accounting scandals at Enron and WorldCom began to focus investors\u2019 attention on the importance of corporate governance. After that, investors began to wonder if environmental and social factors should be on their radar, too.\u201cThe door opened a crack so you could have a conversation about the possibility of these things,\u201d said Michael Jantzi, chief executive of Sustainalytics, one of the main providers of ESG data.\u201cMore and more people are realizing that this is a smart thing to do when you\u2019re making investments,\u201d Ms. Carlisle said. \u201cBetter to know than not to know.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Does Your Stockbroker Draw Complaints? Here\u2019s How to Find Out", "Date": "2016-04-08", "News": "Supported byYour Money\u25a0 Among brokers employed from 2005 to 2015, 7.28 percent had at least one disclosure in their industry records for a settled consumer complaint or worse.\u25a0 Many household-name firms have double the percentage of brokers with such marks. Oppenheimer tops the list at 19.6 percent.\u25a0 Five of the 10 counties with the highest percentage of brokers with disclosures are in Florida.To spot-check these figures, I looked up all 50 Oppenheimer brokers within 25 miles or so of Palm Beach. Seventeen of them \u2014 or 34 percent \u2014 had spotty records, and some had nine or 10 things to disclose. Then I called them all and tried to ask them how they would advise readers to evaluate their records. The company acknowledges that it has some work to do.Before we get there, however, let\u2019s stop and talk about this data, where it comes from and some of the assumptions the researchers made.Any of these items results in what the database refers to as a disclosure. A disclosure is not evidence of wrongdoing in and of itself, because there are disclosures even when a customer brings a complaint and arbitrators dismiss it. Still, any disclosure ought to give a customer or potential customer pause.The analysis relied on a particular definition of \u201cmisconduct.\u201d To them, it is fair to describe settled consumer complaints as misconduct. After all, the median settlement amount that aggrieved consumers receive is $40,000, which would pay for a lot of a lawyer\u2019s time to defend an innocent broker. A quarter of the settlements exceed $120,000, though settlements generally include boilerplate language about not having admitted or denied wrongdoing.Professor Matvos said he still believed that their definition of misconduct was conservative. He added that even when brokers had a complaint that was dismissed or dropped, that was still predictive of future problems. And brokers who do have disclosures for misconduct, by the professors\u2019 definition, are five times as likely, on average, to end up with similar marks on their records in the future as all other brokers. (The other broker disclosures that meet the professors\u2019 definition of misconduct are regulatory actions, a job change after an allegation, customer disputes with actual awards and completed civil actions.)But whatever the correct definition of misconduct, down in Florida, Oppenheimer\u2019s roster of brokers would raise most reasonable people\u2019s eyebrows. Most of the professionals there with disclosures have more than one. One person who recently left the firm had a no-contest plea for felonious assault on his record.Does Oppenheimer have specific standards for whom it is willing to hire and retain? Yes, according to the company, but they are proprietary. In a statement, the company said that it had replaced the branch manager in Boca Raton, Fla. It added that it was also making \u201csweeping\u201d changes to its team of brokers there and had already asked \u201ca number\u201d of them to leave.He\u2019s right about that. After all, 80 percent of Oppenheimer\u2019s brokerage force has a clean record, and many of them would no doubt do right by consumers. The new fiduciary rule \u2014 and ever-increasing compliance efforts at Oppenheimer and elsewhere in the industry \u2014 will probably help some.Still, you cannot be too wary when turning your money over to a financial professional. If you or your relatives are in Florida or your broker is, it sure seems that you need to be especially careful. The researchers note that in general, brokerage customers who are older, less educated and wealthier tend to end up in trouble most often.If your broker does have disclosures (and you should check every year or so for new ones that may have popped up), ask some questions. If the response is defensive, that ought to tell you something. If brokers don\u2019t like answering your inquiries, perhaps they ought to work in an industry where there isn\u2019t as much disclosure.If the response is unintelligible, keep pressing. If the brokers have gotten in trouble for pushing complex products that you (or they) don\u2019t understand, then that is a significant sign as well. The money management industry is much too complicated, and it\u2019s not your job to translate the gibberish that some of its sales agents spew.Too many people do not do this, which is a source of endless frustration and sadness to people like Professor Matvos. \u201cDespite the information being out there, the most vulnerable people don\u2019t know that it\u2019s there,\u201d he said. \u201cThe big puzzle we face is how do we get those people to use the information at their disposal?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Big Board Aims to Keep an Upstart at Bay, but Copy Its Technology", "Date": "2016-04-08", "News": "Supported byFair GameThey say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but is the nation\u2019s top securities cop letting the New York Stock Exchange carry that a bit too far?The regulator\u2019s deliberations have been unusually protracted. Hundreds of small and large investors have written letters supporting the application, saying that IEX\u2019s proposed platform will make equity markets fairer.Established exchanges and high-frequency trading shops have opposed the application.So it was striking last month when the Big Board asked the S.E.C. to let it imitate IEX by adopting a new trade type based on a technology invented by the upstart. That IEX innovation provides investors with better prices on their trades when a stock\u2019s price is about to make a move.The IEX technology is a variation on a type of trade known as a discretionary order. Brokers already use such orders to ensure that their customers\u2019 trades are not disadvantaged by big action in a stock. But the kind of order created by IEX, known as a discretionary peg or D-Peg order, is not yet in use on exchanges.\u201cIf the S.E.C. supports an expansion of the ways an exchange can innovate with order types,\u201d she said, \u201cthe New York Stock Exchange is interested in introducing new offerings to meet our clients\u2019 needs and to respond to changing market structure and regulation.\u201dIt\u2019s great that the exchange wants to incorporate a new technology designed to protect both investors and the public. And the invention that it wants to mimic is entirely separate from the aspect of the IEX exchange application that the Big Board considers unfair and problematic.That element is the speed bump that IEX has proposed for its system, which would delay all participants\u2019 trades by 350 microseconds. This prevents participants \u2014 such as high-frequency traders \u2014 from being able to trade on IEX in reaction to price movements that appear on other venues but that have not yet been recorded on the exchange.But because of the S.E.C.\u2019s delay on the IEX exchange application, the regulator is putting an innovator at a disadvantage that just doesn\u2019t seem right.Not only is the S.E.C.\u2019s foot-dragging preventing IEX from becoming an exchange, now it may let an established exchange copy IEX technology. Even worse, as a result of the delay, the Big Board would be able to attract customers using the IEX technology before IEX could, even if the S.E.C. approves it as an exchange.Some of the delay is attributable to changes IEX has made to its proposal in answer to criticisms. But not all.I raised the issue of fairness with the S.E.C. As is its custom, it declined to comment.All this frustrates Brad Katsuyama, who founded IEX with eight colleagues in 2013. \u201cIt\u2019s an innovator\u2019s dilemma when an incumbent like the New York Stock Exchange can lobby aggressively to delay a new entrant like IEX, while simultaneously copying our innovations,\u201d he said.For two years, IEX worked on a formula designed to predict, as accurately as possible, the price at which a stock was going to trade next. Having completed that work, it created a new order type using the formula that IEX says is accurate to within 90 percent.Essentially IEX\u2019s technology ensures that a customer whose buy or sell order has been placed at a certain price won\u2019t lose out by having his or her trade executed at a price that is not yet reflected in the rapidly changing market.Institutional customers on IEX\u2019s existing trading platform are using this technology and applaud it.One is Mehmet Kinak, head of electronic trading at T. Rowe Price. \u201cIf the order book is changing,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019re not fast enough to see it. But a sophisticated high-frequency trader can dash to any place that is slow and try to take advantage of a move that\u2019s already happened.\u201dThat risk diminishes with IEX\u2019s D-peg. \u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic order type,\u201d he added, \u201cbecause it protects us but also allows the stock at times to move in my favor.\u201dThis is largely because the investors\u2019 orders were executed at prices that were closer to the actual market rather than at the midpoint between the bid and offer on a stock, known as the spread.\u201cWe saw a marked improvement in the midpoint orders offered by IEX,\u201d Mr. Suryawanshi said in an interview. \u201cAbsent D-Peg orders, customers would be giving up half the spread all the time. That may sound small but all these half-a-spread improvements over a large set of orders really make a big difference.\u201dMany investors are already benefiting from IEX\u2019s invention, and if the Big Board wins the right to create its new order type, those beneficiaries may increase. That\u2019s all to the good.Still, the S.E.C.\u2019s delay is hurting IEX in more ways than one. And as the regulatory deliberations drag on, that only adds to the puzzlement.An earlier version of this column gave an incorrect title for Jatin Suryawanshi of Jefferies & Company.

{"Headline": "Small-Cap Growth Funds: For Investors With Nerves of Steel", "Date": "2016-04-09", "News": "Supported byInvesting in small-cap growth funds requires a strong stomach because this part of the stock market tends to lurch wildly.Since 2000, the Russell 2000 Growth exchange-traded-fund index, which tracks small-cap growth stocks, has gone through three years with stomach-churning double-digit losses of 22 percent, 30 percent and 38 percent.During that period, small-cap growth stocks were more than 25 percent more volatile than large-cap stocks, according to Christopher Bennett, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. And some big moves have already occurred this year. The iShares Russell 2000 Growth E.T.F., which mirrors that Russell index, plunged nearly 19 percent in January and early February before rebounding to close the quarter down 4.6 percent.\u201cSmall-cap stocks tend to overreact to the news,\u201d said Ralph Bassett, portfolio co-manager for the Aberdeen US Small-Cap Equity fund.His fund has outperformed its peers in the last four years, according to Morningstar. This year it returned nearly 3.9 percent while small-cap growth funds over all finished the first quarter off 4.1 percent.In-depth talks with top management at scores of companies help Aberdeen avoid some investing mistakes, Mr. Bassett said. \u201cA lot of growth managers have overpaid for growth that wasn\u2019t realized,\u201d he said. This has been especially true in some areas of technology and in biotech, he added.But the risk inherent in the sector cannot be avoided. Mr. Bassett embraces it. He is not a big believer in diversification, despite its evident benefits in reducing the volatility of a portfolio. \u201cChoosing the right companies is more important than diversification for diversification\u2019s sake,\u201d he said. Winners this year include the G-III Apparel Group and the egg producer Cal-Maine Foods.Virtus Small-Cap Sustainable Growth also outperformed its peers in 2014, 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. \u201cA lot of managers are focused on finding companies with the highest rate of growth,\u201d Todd Beiley, a co-manager of the fund, said. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on finding companies with competitive advantages that will produce the longest-lasting growth.\u201dCompanies with \u201cvery strong and durable competitive advantages\u201d figure to have \u201cmuch higher earnings persistence and lower earnings volatility,\u201d Mr. Beiley said.The fund owns MarketAxess Holdings (MKTX), an electronic trading platform for bonds. MarketAxess has dominant market share among electronically traded high-grade corporate bonds. With more than 1,000 broker-dealers, pension funds, mutual funds and other participants on its platform, MarketAxess enjoys a \u201cnetwork effect\u201d advantage, Mr. Beiley said. The liquidity produced by so many buyers and sellers keeps attracting new traders to the platform. \u201cTheir success feeds on itself,\u201d he said.Copart, another Virtus holding, also benefits from a network effect, he said. Copart auctions used vehicles online, including those that have been severely damaged in crashes. The insurance companies that use Copart want the largest number of potential buyers for those wrecks, and Copart has \u201cthe biggest auctions,\u201d Mr. Beiley said. The company says more than 100,000 vehicles are available for bidding daily.Heico, which sells more than 10,000 types of aircraft replacement parts, has an advantage of another sort, Mr. Beiley said. Replacement parts are subject to approval by the Federal Aviation Administration. The complex approval process and the inclination of buyers to go with established sources make this a tough market for others to crack, Mr. Beiley said.Timing the sale of securities is especially important for mutual funds in this volatile category. For example, the Needham Small-Cap Growth fund was hit hard last year and early this year. In 2015, the fund lost nearly 9 percent. But since Feb. 12 it has rebounded and ended the quarter with a return of 7.5 percent.Chris Retzler, portfolio manager, resisted the impulse to unload some positions with heavy losses and has been rewarded. \u201cWe like to sell at certain valuation points relative to historical valuation,\u201d he said. By January, for example, TTM Technologies, which manufactures printed circuit boards, had fallen to about $5 a share from a 2015 high near $11. But shares stood at multiyear lows in their price-to-sales and price-to-earnings ratios, so Mr. Retzler did not sell. TTM rebounded, rising more than 30 percent through the quarter since bottoming.It is impossible to predict the market accurately and consistently, but one thing is quite likely: Small-cap growth stocks should continue to be especially volatile.Laura Lallos, a Morningstar analyst, noted that the category often leads the way in speculative rallies but tends to \u201cunderperform in down markets.\u201dNancy Tooke, manager of the Eaton Vance Small-Cap fund, which holds growth and value stocks, put it this way: \u201c In a downwardly biased market, growth stocks, which have high valuations, tend to do the worst.\u201dInvestors should be prepared for a rough ride.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Dwindling Fish Stocks Got a Reprieve", "Date": "2016-04-19", "News": "\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy wife told me to sell the boats,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Brad Pettinger, a longtime trawl fisherman in the Pacific Northwest. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I said, honey, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gonna buy them? At that time we just didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have anything.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe \u00e2\u0080\u009canything\u00e2\u0080\u009d was fish to catch. Fifteen years ago, America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vast $50 million Pacific groundfish fishery, which stretches some 1,200 miles from Southern California to the Canadian border, collapsed.Several critical species \u00e2\u0080\u0094 from the spiky, orange canary rockfish to the large lingcod \u00e2\u0080\u0094 had dropped to below one-quarter of their natural, un-fished levels. Sharp restrictions were brought in, and the fishery was officially declared an economic disaster. Many  fishermen found themselves stranded and facing bankruptcy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was a perfect example of too many trawlers chasing too few fish,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Pettinger, who is now director of the Oregon Trawl Commission. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was a dark time.\u00e2\u0080\u009dYet since the turn of the 21st century, something remarkable has happened in United States waters. After decades of shrinking fish populations, some trends have begun to shift.What brought this change? According to Jane Lubchenco, the former head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (N.O.A.A.), the first piece of the puzzle was a new law \u00e2\u0080\u009cwith teeth and timetables.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099d had legislation with good language about ending overfishing for decades,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she says. But fears about the economic impact of greater restrictions on fishing kept the legislation ineffective. So the problem kept getting worse.An amendment in 2007 to the 30-year-old Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act marked a big departure from this. It mandated that by 2011 every federally managed fishery had to have a scientifically determined, legally enforced annual catch limit, and a management plan for how it would stick to it.It was the culmination of years of work by dozens of groups inside and out of government. But according to Margaret Spring, who worked for Senator Daniel K. Inouye, a Democrat from Hawaii, at the time and is now chief conservation officer at the Monterey Bay Aquarium, an essential ingredient for success was strong bipartisan support and relationships \u00e2\u0080\u0094 particularly with the bill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sponsor, Senator Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work for Senator Stevens \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a Democrat, right?\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Spring. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I was practically staffing him; I was writing the bill.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe fact that the new catch limits were determined by science, rather than economics or politics, was a breakthrough, says Spring. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t skip the science. You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say \u00e2\u0080\u0098I know the science says this, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to allow a higher catch because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s convenient or I need it for my community.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009dHowever, good catch limits are only the start. The real challenge is for managers to devise a plan that allows them to stick to these limits, without sinking the fishing industry.One tool designed to fix this lose-lose situation is known as a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccatch share.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Under this system each boat is given a long-term share (say, 5 percent) of the total annual quota, to give the fleet a strong vested interest in rebuilding fish stocks. As Lubchenco explains: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you have 5 percent of the pie, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to see the pie grow.\u00e2\u0080\u009dSeveral fisheries, including the Pacific groundfish fleet, adopted catch share programs (also called Individual Fishing Quotas) as part of their plan to meet the new catch limits. The total number of federal fisheries using catch shares rose from five in 2000 to 16 in 2015.Giving fishermen a business incentive to fish sustainably can \u00e2\u0080\u009cunleash their creative capacity\u00e2\u0080\u009d to help solve the problem, says Shems Jud, Pacific regional director of oceans at the Environmental Defense Fund.On the West Coast, members of the groundfish trawler fleet have worked with universities, nongovernmental organizations and net makers to design and adopt more targeted trawl nets, volunteered to create protected \u00e2\u0080\u009cno take\u00e2\u0080\u009d zones, warn one another if an overfished species appears in a new area, and have independent observers monitoring their catch on every trip.The fleet has also become a valuable source of ecological knowledge, as part of an unusual collaboration between environmental groups and the trawling industry, which aims to improve vulnerable habitat protection while reopening some less-sensitive areas to fishing.Catch shares have also brought business benefits, by making fishers individually accountable for their annual catches, giving them the flexibility to trade their allowances, and allowing them to plan better. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo longer do we have to throw something over because we caught a little too much, only to try to catch it again next week,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Paul Kujala, a fisherman. He adds, however, that catch restrictions and high costs mean that much of the fleet has yet to see real increases in income.Read previous contributions to this series.Back on the West Coast, fishers and nongovernmental organizations are still working together on bringing the fish \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and the industry that relies on them \u00e2\u0080\u0094 back to health. Representatives from both groups would now like to see some outdated regulation scrapped, and are exploring the possibility of replacing human observers with electronic monitoring, which is less expensive.\u00e2\u0080\u009cFishermen are very good at looking at the problem and fixing it if they have the tools in the toolbox to do it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Pettinger. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have the potential to land 40 million pounds of rockfish next year. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something that hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happened in 20 years. It shows great promise.\u00e2\u0080\u009dSylvia Rowley is a freelance British journalist and filmmaker.

{"Headline": "Junk Bonds: Never Stodgy and Steadier Than You Might Think", "Date": "2016-04-09", "News": "Supported byAt first glance, high-yield bond funds had a strong start to 2016 with a first-quarter gain of 2 percent. But if you were paying closer attention, the ride was anything but smooth.In the first six weeks of the year, the largest high-yield bond fund, BlackRock High Yield Bond, lost 4.6 percent, and the biggest exchange-traded fund, iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond, shed more than 5 percent. During that time, the Vanguard Total Bond Market index fund, the largest fund that sticks with stodgy Treasuries and other high-grade bonds, gained 2.4 percent.The steep losses through mid-February were the latest illustration that high-yield bonds are an unequivocal failure when it comes to delivering on the classic role of fixed-income investments: ballast that steadies your portfolio when stocks are off on one of their depressive jags. While it makes perfect sense to shun high-yield bonds \u2014 also known as junk bonds \u2014 for the part of your portfolio that you rely on for stability and predictability, completely swearing off junk could be a failure of portfolio imagination.Junk bonds can play a useful role, as part of the riskier, stock side of your portfolio. In that context, junk bonds are fairly reliable, delivering higher income than dividend-paying stocks. For example, the Vanguard High-Yield Corporate bond fund has a current yield near 6 percent, compared with 3.2 percent for the Vanguard High Dividend Yield index fund. The lofty income payouts of high-yield bonds have been the major driver of equitylike total returns over long stretches.From 1983 through the end of 2015, the 8.8 percent annualized return of an index of high-yield bonds captured 80 percent of the gain for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, with about half the volatility of the stock index. An analysis by AllianceBernstein found that if you kept 75 percent in stocks over that stretch and moved the other 25 percent into high-yield bonds, the 10.4 percent annualized return trailed the all-stock return by less than a half a percentage point, while clocking in with 16 percent less volatility than the all-stock portfolio.\u201cThere\u2019s a pervasive attitude that high yield is scary, but that misses the big opportunity,\u201d said Gershon Distenfeld, director of high yield at AllianceBernstein. \u201cUsed in place of stocks it dampens your volatility without costing you much in return.\u201dOne way to measure value is to compare interest payouts. The long-term trend is that junk yields are on average 5.25 percentage points higher than yields from Treasuries. Right now this so-called spread is seven percentage points, meaning investors are getting paid more than the historical norm to dip a toe into the junk bond market. Mr. Swaffield found that in the two dozen times since the late 1980s when the spread was that wide, the annualized total return for high yield over the next three years ranged from 8 to 16 percent.Robust economic growth could in turn spur solid earnings growth, which would help stocks post strong returns from today\u2019s lofty levels, but that isn\u2019t expected. S&P Capital IQ, a research firm that serves the financial industry, projects that the S.&P. 500 will post 1 percent earnings growth this year.\u201cAn economy that feels like it is running through mud doesn\u2019t look good for stocks at current valuations,\u201d said Raymond Kennedy, a portfolio manager of the Hotchkis & Wiley High Yield fund. \u201cBut high yield can do well in a slow-growth economy.\u201d As long as cash flow remains positive, high-yield issuers can make interest payments even if earnings growth slows to a crawl.While junk bonds are generally less volatile than stocks, don\u2019t presume this will be a placid cruise.Defaults are always a front-and-center concern. In a recent analysis that made the case for junk being one of the better asset values in the market, Ben Inker, co-head of asset allocation at GMO, noted that the 4.6 percent average default rate for the bonds since 1988 ranges from a high of 15 percent to a low of less than 1 percent.Defaults are expected to rise this year from 2015\u2019s 3.5 percent pace. Junk issues tied to energy, metals and mining represent about 18 percent of the value of outstanding junk debt. Mr. Swaffield of Eaton Vance said the entire junk market is currently trading at a level that prices in a default rate of about 18 percent \u2014 as if everything linked to the battered commodities market were doomed. Moody\u2019s forecasts an overall default rate of 4.7 percent over the next 12 months, a bit lower than the 6 percent projected by Eaton Vance.With a hypothetical 6 percent default rate, the damage to a broad junk portfolio would be about 3.6 percentage points based on typical net losses on defaulted high-yield bonds. If you\u2019re starting at a yield of 7 or 8 percent, a 3.6 percentage point cut still leaves you with a return of around 4 percent. And there\u2019s the potential for actively managed funds backed by a team of credit analysts to sidestep some of the carnage. Last year as junk came under pressure from commodity-related defaults and investors running for the exits, two-thirds of actively managed junk funds did better than their benchmark index, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.There\u2019s also the \u201claw of small numbers\u201d to contend with, said Carl Kaufman, a manager of the Osterweis Strategic Income fund. \u201cWith growth already anemic, any disappointing news, no matter how small, will trigger an amazing amount of volatility,\u201d he added.A shift in the trading mechanics of the junk market is also fueling volatility. The role of banks as middlemen in the bond market has diminished since the financial crisis. That has made bond trading a choppier endeavor. For example, after falling 4.5 percent in the first six weeks of this year, high-yield bonds then rallied to a near 7 percent gain over the next four weeks. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen whipping around like this,\u201d said Mr. Kennedy, who has been running portfolios with high-yield bonds for 30 years. \u201cVolatility is here to stay,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you\u2019re willing to close your eyes for a few years you are going to do well.\u201dAn article in the Mutual Fund Quarterly last Sunday about the role of junk bonds in an investment portfolio miscalculated the effect a 6 percent default rate would have on a broad junk bond portfolio. The loss would be 3.6 percentage points, not 2.4 percentage points. A further calculation based on that number misstated the return that would be left after that loss. It would be around 4 percent, not 5 percent or more.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tech Companies May Face a New Cost to Paying in Shares", "Date": "2016-04-18", "News": "Supported byBitsTech companies may have to take stock of giving stock.LinkedIn, the popular careers site, has projected lower growth for this year, but for the last two years has awarded an increasing amount of stock to its employees. In 2014 it gave them an amount equal to 14 percent of its revenue; last year that figure rose to 17 percent of revenue.It is not known how much LinkedIn will award this year, though the question may come up when the company reports its earnings next week.LinkedIn is hardly alone. Twitter, Yahoo and Workday all appear to be particularly generous with stock to workers, even in cases where revenue is sliding.It is a knotty problem in Silicon Valley, where the value of a company is so often tied up in the intellectual firepower that walks through the door each morning. It has become increasingly important, too, as tech companies primarily make online software subject to continual change and upgrades.Lose your people, and you\u2019ll lose your future: This is the common fear. Giving them stock is thought to be a particularly useful way to get them to hang around and make more and better products.Presumably, most investors in these companies know what is going on and buy shares with their eyes open. But the issue could do with revisiting, particularly when the stocks of many of these companies have fallen. Compared with the average U.S. company, tech companies award about 80 percent more restricted stock to employees.Tech companies may feel like this is simply the cost of doing business in this industry, but it\u2019s a price they do not fully pay.In one notable example, Salesforce.com reported a $574 million operating profit in fiscal 2015, which excluded $565 million of stock grants.How long this continues is, of course, up to the company shareholders, who can vote to force management to stop these large awards, which tend to go especially to top management. That usually happens when times get really tough and stock prices are under significant pressure.Perhaps by that time, however, the employees will have so many grants that they\u2019ll be the chief shareholders, too.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "BlackRock, Hurt by Volatile Markets, Reports Slide in Profit", "Date": "2016-04-14", "News": "Supported byVolatile global markets had their effect on BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset management firm, as its earnings for the first quarter of this year declined by 14 percent.Bonds and stocks rallied in March, but persistent selling rattled the markets in the first two months of the year, as oil prices slid and concerns mounted over China\u2019s slowing economy.For the quarter, BlackRock said on Thursday, its net earnings declined to $711 million, compared with $830 million in the quarter a year ago. The firm\u2019s assets under management, the most critical gauge of an investment managers success, declined by only 1 percent, to $4.7 trillion.\u201cIn a volatile quarter, we only had a 1 percent drop in assets under management,\u201d Laurence D. Fink, BlackRock\u2019s chief executive, said in an interview on Thursday. \u201cGrowth in E.T.F.s helped, and we continue to see strong flows into our funds from institutional investors.\u201dCompared with other less diversified asset managers that have been experiencing pronounced investor withdrawals more several years now, BlackRock was buoyed by its exchange-traded funds division, which was responsible for $24 billion of the firm\u2019s $36 billion net inflow for the quarter.Some $27 billion of the inflows came from passive, index-based strategies, which continue to attract more funds than higher-priced actively managed approaches. Exchange-traded funds are low-priced funds that track a variety of different indexes and investment strategies.So even in a quarter when investor sentiment swung from negative to positive, BlackRock\u2019s iShares unit was able to lure investors into its defensive Treasury bill funds in the beginning of the year and its riskier high-yield and emerging market funds last month.It is shaping up to be another grim year for the nation\u2019s biggest banks. They were hit hard by a bad environment for trading and deal-making.BlackRock Solutions, the firm\u2019 advisory practice, also bucked the down quarter, increasing revenue 16 percent from the quarter a year ago.Growth was driven by the Aladdin risk management platform, which acts like a central nervous system of sorts, allowing an investment manager to assess the risk and liquidity of its assets at any given moment.BlackRock uses the platform itself and has become increasingly successful in selling this service to its institutional clients who are under persistent pressure from regulators to disclose the risk of the securities they own and their ability to sell them in a pinch.As to the future, Mr. Fink said he expected equity markets to remain robust on the expectation that there would not be a hard economic landing in China. He did caution, though, that there could be a number of political surprises in the months ahead that could influence investor sentiment \u2014 including worries over Britain leaving the European Union and the uncertainties of the United States presidential race.\u201cWe are living in a world of political uncertainty,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misstated the amount of net investments that BlackRock reported for its exchange traded funds division for the first quarter. It was $24 billion, not $26 billion.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "JPMorgan Chase Reports Lower Quarterly Profit", "Date": "2016-04-13", "News": "Supported byWith investors expecting a weak first quarter for the banks, JPMorgan Chase delivered results that were slightly better than the forecasts.JPMorgan, the first of the major banks to report its financial results for the first three months of the year, said on Wednesday that both revenue and profit slid in the first quarter, from a year earlier, largely as a result of bad conditions in the financial markets.The bank\u2019s overall revenue fell 3 percent from the quarter a year earlier, while profit fell 7 percent. The bank earned $5.2 billion in the first quarter, or $1.35 a share. Analysts had been expecting profit to fall to $1.26 a share, according to Thomson Reuters.\u201cDespite challenging market conditions we delivered really quite good performance in the quarter with diversification allowing us to perform well in difficult environments,\u201d the firm\u2019s chief financial officer, Marianne Lake, said in a call with investors Wednesday morning.JPMorgan\u2019s success in beating expectations helped push up its stock price 4.2 percent on Wednesday. The stocks of other big banks, which will report their earnings over the next week, also rose.The first quarter is typically a strong time for global banks, as clients prepare to put their money to use \u2014 but this year has not followed that trend because of all the volatility in the global markets.The falling prices of oil and stocks pushed down results in JPMorgan\u2019s Wall Street division. Revenue from both stock and bond trading were down, depressing overall market revenue by 13 percent from a year earlier. The volatile markets also put a damper on mergers and acquisitions. Revenue in that business fell 19 percent.It is shaping up to be another grim year for the nation\u2019s biggest banks. They were hit hard by a bad environment for trading and deal-making.JPMorgan put aside another $529 million to cover for potential losses on loans it has made to oil and natural gas companies, which have been hurt by the falling cost of oil. It put aside another $162 million for metals and mining companies.The numbers looked better in JPMorgan\u2019s consumer bank.Consumers took out more mortgages and credit card loans, suggesting some optimism in the economy. Profit in the consumer division rose 12 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier.The firm\u2019s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, said in a statement: \u201cWhile challenging markets impacted the industry, we maintained our leadership positions and market share in the corporate and investment bank and asset management, reflecting the strength of our platform.

{"Headline": "Investors Look for Solid Footing After Market Recovery", "Date": "2016-04-09", "News": "Supported byStocks went nowhere fast in the first quarter, plunging into an abyss and rocketing right back out to end modestly above where they began. It\u2019s as if traders concluded first that economic and corporate conditions were profoundly disappointing, and then, with equal certainty, that conditions were much better than they had come to expect.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index finished the quarter with a gain of 0.8 percent after falling more than 10 percent. The benchmark index ended March at 2,059.74.The quarter had two halves for other assets, too, often taking investors on even wilder rides. The Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks, down 16 percent at one point, ended down 1.7 percent; emerging-market stocks lost almost as much before ending up nearly 7 percent; crude oil fell about 30 percent, then recouped all of the deficit and more to finish up 3 percent.Investment advisers make persuasive cases that stocks will trade as they did in the first quarter \u2014 either the first part or the second, maybe both. Likewise they contend that oil, emerging markets and the other dead cats may have been given a second life or are just bouncing. It\u2019s hard to know what to prepare for, because while sentiment clearly changed in February, economic indicators and prospects for corporate results remain murky.\u201cEarnings beats are being done through buybacks and lower tax rates,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a quality way to beat expectations.\u201dBuying back stock increases earnings per share by dividing profits over a smaller number of shares. There may be no gain in real earnings.Yet as earnings expectations continue to be cut, stocks get more expensive, even with the market going nowhere. The S.&P. 500 ended the first quarter at roughly 17 times estimated 2016 earnings. With valuations high and profit growth hard to come by, Mr. Wilhelm said, \u201cWe\u2019re pretty cautious on the market.\u201d\u201cThere is no margin for safety for any kind of bad news,\u201d he warned.\u201cYou have to have everything working positively\u201d for the market to be worth its present valuation, he said, \u201cbut that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening. The economy is weak relative to history, and revenue growth is not there, as well, relative to expectations.\u201dThe move off the lows has been striking in assets that had the largest declines, including value stocks, emerging markets and commodities. That signals an attitude adjustment that persuades Mr. Turnill that the rally will persist.\u201cIn the last six weeks, we\u2019ve had a V-shaped rebound in risk assets accompanied by a change in market leadership,\u201d he said. That indicates to him that the economy and markets have entered \u201ca sweet spot where growth is good enough and fears of recession have diminished, but there\u2019s still no material evidence of renewed inflation.\u201dThe sugar rush late in the first quarter helped domestic stock funds tracked by Morningstar to erase most of their earlier losses, but not all. They fell 0.1 percent on average, eroded by declines of 13.7 percent in portfolios that specialize in health care, 5.9 percent in financial sector funds, 4.1 percent in small-company growth and 2.9 percent in technology.Utility funds bucked the trend, rising 11.4 percent. Portfolios devoted to natural resources were up 6.1 percent, and specialists in precious-metals mining stocks rose 38.9 percent.Bond funds were uniformly solid. The average taxable one rose 2.1 percent. High-yield funds were up 2 percent and municipal funds 0.6 percent.Central banks in Europe and Japan have been even more accommodating, keeping rates at historically low \u2014 even negative \u2014 levels and supporting markets through the asset purchases called quantitative easing.\u201cPart of the reason that the risk of recession is lower is the coordinated policy response globally,\u201d Mr. Turnill said. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the story of why markets are in better shape.\u201dHe cautioned that they might drop out of their sweet spot if a deflationary threat emerged. Energy prices could reverse recent gains, for instance, or Chinese authorities could make a misstep in managing their currency. A danger in the opposite direction could occur, he said, if \u201cinflation risk picks up and the Fed looks like it\u2019s behind the curve.\u201d\u201cYou can see the improvement,\u201d he said. \u201cInflation is better,\u201d meaning the risk of deflation is diminishing, \u201cand unemployment is steadily falling.\u201dFunds that own foreign stocks were down 1.1 percent in the first quarter, held back by losses in Europe and India portfolios and supported by a 16 percent gain in Latin America funds that helped the average diversified emerging-market fund return 4 percent. Emerging-market bond funds were also strong, rising 5.9 percent.Mr. Crooke finds good investment opportunities in Britain, where stocks and the pound have suffered from worries about the outcome of a June 23 referendum on continued membership in the European Union. He expects that \u201cpeople will vote for their jobs and to stay in the second-largest trading bloc in the world.\u201dHe likes \u201cquality names listed in London that do business around the world\u201d and also favors stocks of companies in core European countries such as France, the Netherlands and Switzerland that engage in activities in ordinarily stable sectors like health care and consumer staples.Mr. Crooke added that he was not buying into the rally in the most beaten-down market segments.\u201cI\u2019m not getting sucked into this commodity updraft\u201d or the rally in emerging markets, he said. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot that\u2019s telling us conditions are getting better.\u201d\u201cCommodities have recovered, emerging markets have outperformed the developed world for the first time\u201d in quite a while, \u201cand value has outperformed growth,\u201d Mr. Hallett said. \u201cIt looks to us that there\u2019s at least a possibility that more cyclicality is coming back into favor. Whether it lasts the whole year remains to be seen, but it seems to be a little more than a dead-cat bounce.\u201dIn his view, oil prices, which ended the first quarter above $35 a barrel, should stabilize between $40 and $60 rather than \u201ccrash back down.\u201d As for emerging markets, he anticipates strong returns, especially for banks and industrial companies, as stock prices rise and local currencies, which also have been hit hard, revive.Mr. Turnill agrees that the rebound in commodities and emerging markets has further to run.\u201cIn a world where there are very few cheap assets, these are areas where there\u2019s real value,\u201d he said. He also finds good value in Europe and in stocks generally over bonds.Mr. Wilhelm is emphasizing large businesses with low debt and low fixed costs in Touchstone Focused. He tends to find them in traditionally defensive sectors like health and consumer staples and in industrial companies that sell large amounts of services with their products.It can take some time for a market to reach its peak, he said. \u201cIt takes a while for people to wake up and realize that things are a little tougher than they thought. With each retest of the highs, more people become aware that we might have a problem.\u201dIt\u2019s one that central banks might not be able to solve, he warned.\u201cThe Fed often creates excitement through monetary policy, but at some point the fundamentals have to be there,\u201d Mr. Wilhelm said.Mr. Freeman at Westwood has a similar affinity for high-quality companies in the same sectors and industries, and for the same reasons. But he also recommends energy stocks for anyone with a large appetite for risk and lots of patience. Echoing Mr. Wilhelm\u2019s misgivings, he suggested that his own patience with the Fed might be running low.\u201cWhen we\u2019re in this extremely low-nominal-growth and earnings-challenged environment, investors are looking for someone else to provide support,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only game in town is central banks, but that\u2019s not something we can hang our hat on. We need to get some stability in the earnings outlook.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Billionaire Who\u2019s Building a Davos of His Own", "Date": "2016-04-16", "News": "Supported byIn a wood-paneled conference room at Stanford University, a score of scholars, many of them eminent and some from as far away as Johannesburg and Beijing, gathered last month to compare philosophical notions of hierarchy and equality.The gathering itself had no overt hierarchy, though one participant seemed a little more equal than the others. When Nicolas Berggruen spoke, no one interrupted. Only he occasionally checked his phone. And at dinner, the guests received fruit tarts for dessert \u2014 except for Mr. Berggruen, who was served chocolate mousse.\u201cThere is a generation of new donors who have huge assets, and their own ideas, and think traditional think tanks are old-fashioned,\u201d said James G. McGann, the director of the Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program at the University of Pennsylvania \u2014 a think tank that thinks about think tanks. In a money-fueled culture where tweets, not position papers, shape the national conversation, these kinds of philosopher-kingpins \u201care likely to be more influential than we are,\u201d Mr. McGann said.Mr. Berggruen stands out because he is a little-known but well-connected player at the nexus of wealth and rumination who is also a bit mysterious \u2014 a Gatsby who shows up at his own parties.\u201cI am a person who likes to engage in learning,\u201d Mr. Berggruen said, in an accent reflecting his Parisian upbringing and dual German and American citizenship. The next step was \u201cto see if I can produce some ideas,\u201d he said.There are conflicting views about this kind of endeavor.\u201cOf course there is a high percentage of waste,\u201d Mr. Zinsmeister said, \u201cbut that\u2019s how discovery works.\u201dOthers worry, though, that at least some of these initiatives are vanity projects. Mr. Berggruen\u2019s institute \u201cseems like a mini-Davos of his creation,\u201d McGann said, referring to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland \u2014 the Ascot of conferences for the global elite.Mr. McGann publishes an annual report on the world\u2019s top think tanks, ranking them in more than 50 categories. The Berggruen Institute is not included in any of them.Mr. Berggruen happens to be a Davos habitu\u00e9, but his institute has a more eclectic mandate. Besides philosophy, he has spent time and money on efforts to reform the California budget. He has established councils to study European integration and China.The Berggruen Institute will award an annual $1 million prize in philosophy beginning this year. It is presently funding six Berggruen academic fellowships to China and other places, and it has selected 16 others for the 2016-17 academic year.Mr. Berggruen says he bought more than 400 acres in Brentwood, Calif., and has commissioned the renowned Swiss architecture firm Herzog & de Meuron to design his institute\u2019s headquarters. Craig Calhoun, who is leaving the directorship of the London School of Economics this summer, was appointed president. Mr. Calhoun said his mandate was to \u201cdeepen the conversation.\u201dMr. Berggruen has a gift for networking. \u201cHe knows everyone,\u201d said his friend Stefan Simchowitz, an art dealer. At the philosophy conference in Stanford, he hosted a conversation about artificial intelligence with Antonio Damasio, a neuroscientist who heads the Brain and Creativity Institute at the University of Southern California, and Reid Hoffman, a co-founder of LinkedIn.Mr. Hoffman met Mr. Berggruen through a mutual friend who mentioned Mr. Berggruen\u2019s interests in California governance and Chinese philosophy. \u201cI said, \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s interesting. Let me meet him,\u2019\u201d Mr. Hoffman recalled.The luminaries listed on the institute\u2019s advisory boards are the kind who pop up at White House state dinners or on Barry Diller\u2019s yacht: Arianna Huffington, co-founder of The Huffington Post; the SpaceX founder Elon Musk; Tony Blair, the former British prime minister; Francis Fukuyama, the Stanford professor; and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.\u201cI\u2019m not really involved anymore, but I like Nicolas,\u201d Ms. Rice said in a phone interview. She served on the Think Long Committee for California, a brain trust Mr. Berggruen assembled in 2010 to address the state\u2019s budget crisis.Mr. Berggruen makes it easy for even very busy people to lend their prestige. He foots the bills, booking guests in luxury hotels and sometimes ferrying them on his private jet. In workshops, he asks the kind of big-picture questions that politicians, intellectuals and billionaires like to answer.Orville Schell, a China scholar at the Asia Society in New York and an adviser to the Berggruen Institute, said that Mr. Berggruen gained access to Chinese leaders because he focused on philosophy and culture, not politics and human rights, and noted that his approach was \u201castute.\u201dIt also helped that Mr. Berggruen did not appear to have a business agenda. \u201cIn some ways he is a thinking man\u2019s Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Schell said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want anything from anybody, except to be of consequence.\u201dWhile Mr. Berggruen has arrived, even in his early days he wasn\u2019t exactly an arriviste. His father, Heinz Berggruen, was an art dealer who fled the Nazis in 1936, romanced Frida Kahlo in New York and befriended Picasso in Paris.The younger Mr. Berggruen attended Le Rosey, an exclusive Swiss boarding school, and studied finance at New York University, but he says he began investing as a teenager, borrowing a few thousand pounds from a friend to buy stocks. Forbes estimates his fortune to be about $1.5 billion. Last year, Town & Country magazine named him one of the world\u2019s 50 most eligible bachelors.And last month, he became a bachelor father. Or, as he put it when asked who the mother is: \u201cMe. I am the mother and the father.\u201d Mr. Berggruen has two newborns, a boy and a girl, born three weeks apart to different surrogates and conceived using eggs from two donors.Single fatherhood has now tethered him to Los Angeles, he said, but not too tightly: He bought the apartment one floor down for the children and their nannies.Since 2015, his institute has been funded by his Bermuda-registered charitable trust. He says it has a $1 billion endowment. Foreign status means that Mr. Berggruen forfeits United States tax breaks but can give away money as he chooses. Bermuda has almost none of the restrictions or disclosure rules that bind American nonprofits.In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, Mr. Berggruen said, he began to question his life\u2019s purpose. That led him, in 2010, to hire professors from the University of California, Los Angeles, to tutor him in philosophy.Brian Walker, a political science professor and expert in Chinese philosophy, was one of those. Professor Walker would discuss Plato and Confucius with Mr. Berggruen over lunch in his suite at the Peninsula Hotel. \u201cIt was sort of a surreal setting, but he always did the reading and asked good questions,\u201d Mr. Walker said. \u201cI found him a little mysterious. He didn\u2019t invite personal confidences.\u201dMr. Berggruen is courteous and even courtly: In restaurants, he stands when his date leaves the table. But he isn\u2019t a schmoozer. His Stanford conference ran from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. with little time for small talk.At the philosophy dinner, he asked that his guests discuss harmony and freedom in the East and West. He was playful, but only on topic. \u201cI am going to say something that will make all of you want to kill me,\u201d he said, bringing conversation and forks to a halt. \u201cThe West is absolutist, India is pluralist, and China is \u2014 and I don\u2019t mean this in a negative way \u2014 conformist.\u201dMr. Berggruen spoke proudly of the work his Think Long Committee did to address California\u2019s deficit, including supporting Proposition 31, which among other things would have barred lawmakers from creating expenditures over $25 million without finding the money for them. Mr. Berggruen spent more than $1 million to get the proposition on the ballot. The initiative was voted down in 2012.In 2010, Mr. Berggruen took the Giving Pledge \u2014 which has become a kind of social register for big-time philanthropists \u2014 joining billionaires who have promised to give away more than half of their fortunes. But he is not a spendthrift. He is a trustee of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and tax records show that in 2014 he gave the museum $100,000, the minimum annual gift required; many give double that amount, or more, according to two trustees. That year, Mr. Berggruen gave U.C.L.A. $4,750.Mr. Berggruen says he wants to nurture innovative thinking, not just donate to causes. His institute, he said, is \u201cnot just a money-giving operation; it\u2019s an ideas and energy-producing operation.\u201dSeveral scholars say that Mr. Berggruen\u2019s interdisciplinary approach to philosophy is refreshing in an academic world that can be siloed. Kwame Anthony Appiah, a philosopher at New York University, said he attended a Berggruen event because it gave him a chance to talk to experts about Confucianism, which is not his primary field of study.\u201cI can\u2019t say whether it\u2019s the best use of his money,\u201d Professor Appiah said. \u201cI can only consider whether he is making the world better or worse, and in this case I would have to say, better.\u201dAn article last Sunday about the Berggruen Institute, the think tank operated by the billionaire investor Nicolas Berggruen, misstated, using information from the institute, the number of scholars it is currently funding. There are six scholars, not five.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Doha, Major Oil Exporters Fail to Agree on Production Freeze", "Date": "2016-04-17", "News": "Supported byDOHA, Qatar \u2014 Officials from 18 oil-producing nations failed on Sunday to reach a deal to freeze oil production at current levels.A sharp fall in oil prices could also feed into equity prices, which have recently tended to rise and fall along with oil prices.Oil fell sharply in early trading on Monday in Asia, at one point dropping nearly 6 percent to fall below $38 a barrel. Asian stock markets were mixed. Japanese shares were down nearly 3 percent in morning trading, but stocks across the rest of Asia saw more modest declines. Markets in Shanghai and Hong Kong opened around 1 percent lower.\u201cThere will be a lot of people who they have disappointed,\u201d said Bill Farren-Price, chief executive of Petroleum Policy Intelligence, a British firm that advises hedge funds and other businesses on the oil markets. The oil exporters, he said, \u201craised expectations.\u201dA major stumbling block in the talks appears to have been pressure from Saudi Arabia for Iran to participate in the freeze, a measure to address the current global oversupply of oil. The Iranians, who are rapidly increasing production after the end of most sanctions over their nuclear program, have refused to cap production at current low levels.The oil producers seemed to head into the meeting full of confidence that a deal to stabilize oil markets could be reached. In fact, a draft agreement calling for a freeze at January levels through October was circulated Saturday.Talk of a potential freeze had already helped lift the oil markets from their January lows below $30 per barrel to about $43 per barrel for Brent crude. \u201cI think at least the discussion and expectations around the Doha meeting have contributed to higher prices,\u201d Eric Lascelles, chief economist at RBC Global Asset Management, said in an interview before the meeting.A deal was unlikely to quickly change the amount of oil on the market because most participants in the freeze were pumping at high levels. And the failure is unlikely to have much of an impact on supply and demand balances.What might limit the reaction is a strike on Sunday by Kuwaiti oil workers. That has cut into the country\u2019s oil production by what appears to be a substantial amount. \u201cYou would expect the market to sell off but the downside might be limited, \u201c said Mr. Farren-Price, who was observing the Doha meeting.Analysts on Sunday also raised the question of how Saudi Arabia and the other countries could have scheduled the meeting if they knew it was doomed to failure. After all, the idea was to calm the markets, not roil them.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.\u201cThis implies really poor communication by the lead members of the group,\u201d particularly Saudi Arabia and Russia, said Richard Mallinson, an oil analyst at Energy Aspects, a London-based market research firm. \u201cWhy even schedule this meeting if you did not have a compromise agreed over Iran.\u201dSaudi Arabia, Russia, Qatar and Venezuela agreed in principle on a freeze at a meeting in February, but made it contingent on participation by other major producers. The idea of a freeze gained favor because it would involve little or no sacrifice for anyone.Analysts and some OPEC officials thought that a way could be found to accommodate Iran\u2019s desire to make up ground lost under sanctions.Either they misread the Saudis or the kingdom\u2019s leadership hardened its position. Saudi Arabia and Iran are bitter rivals in the Middle East, clashing over Yemen and Syria. The competition increasingly extends to oil, where a resurgent Iran is vying with the Saudis for market share among customers in Asia and Europe.In the days before this meeting, a mixed message emerged from Saudi Arabia. Its oil officials, led by Ali al-Naimi, an 80-year-old veteran oil minister, evidently sought accommodation with other big producers, including Iran, while, the deputy crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, who has become the kingdom\u2019s chief policy maker, indicated that Saudi Arabia might not go along with a freeze if Iran did not also comply.\u201cIf all major producers don\u2019t freeze production, we will not freeze production,\u201d Prince Mohammed told Bloomberg News recently.The deal was scuppered by Saudi Arabia\u2019s insistence that language requiring that all OPEC members participate in the freeze be inserted in the draft. There was little question that Iran, which was not represented at the meeting, would agree. After lengthy negotiations among Saudi Arabia, Russia, Venezuela and Qatar, which convened the meeting, the talks broke up on Sunday.Saudi tactics on the freeze appear to be a part of a shift in the kingdom\u2019s oil policy, analysts say.The Saudis, analysts say, increasingly seem to accept that they can no longer control oil prices through OPEC, in part because the huge increases in supply from the United States in recent years have undercut OPEC\u2019s leverage.\u201cThis is the new world of oil,\u201d said Jim Burkhard, head of oil markets and scenarios research at IHS, who was also observing the meeting. \u201cThe oil market is a reflection of the world. Power is more decentralized.\u201dThe Saudis are shifting instead toward producing whatever oil they need to supply their growing network of domestic refineries and petrochemical plants and their expanding body of overseas customers.A glut of crude oil on the markets is pushing the price of oil down to levels not seen since the global financial crisis.Prince Mohammed, who has authority over the Saudi oil industry, warned that the kingdom could increase production by a million barrels per day in the coming months if it chose.With low production costs, estimated at $3.50 to $5 per barrel, Saudi Arabia can compete on price with any producer. So can Russia, which can produce oil for about $4 per barrel, according to IHS. While Saudi Arabia and its Persian Gulf allies, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, are feeling the pinch of lower revenues, they are in far less immediate trouble than OPEC members like Venezuela and Algeria, analysts say.Some of the less well-off oil producers clearly wanted a deal in hopes that it would raise prices and revenues. \u201cThis is something that affects the whole oil industry whether you are in OPEC or not,\u201d Ecuador\u2019s oil minister, Carlos Pareja Yannuzzelli, told reporters on Sunday.While plans are far from fully delineated, Prince Mohammed appears to be charting a more independent course for the Saudi oil industry. For instance, he has said he plans a public listing of the national oil company, Saudi Aramco, the world\u2019s largest oil-producing company. A public listing might require the company to pay more attention to the requirements of outside investors than to other OPEC members.Prince Mohammed increasingly seems to see oil as a potential political instrument \u2014 an approach that Mr. Naimi eschewed.\u201cThere is a lot of change happening in Riyadh,\u201d Mr. Mallinson said. Oil policy is becoming \u201cless insulated from politics.\u201dSome analysts speculate that Mr. Naimi \u2014 who has long been skeptical that other producers, including Russia, would honor production ceilings \u2014 is going along with the idea of a freeze to help insulate Saudi Arabia from criticism.The Saudis might have been \u201ccovering their backs,\u201d said Paul Stevens, an analyst at Chatham House, a London-based research firm. \u201cThey can say, \u2018We tried.\u2019\u201dRussia had reason to go along with a freeze. Russia\u2019s economy, which depends heavily on oil revenues, is in recession. The Kremlin\u2019s desperation for higher prices is palpable; the country is committed to two wars, in Ukraine and Syria. At home, wages are being cut, bringing signs of social unrest ahead of a parliamentary election in September.Russia\u2019s energy minister, Alexander Novak, who attended the Doha meeting, has been a crucial supporter of a freeze. A role assigned to Mr. Novak was to bring in Iran, but he has failed so far.Russia and Saudi Arabia trade places for the top spot among oil producers. Russia has been in the lead of late, pumping 10.9 million barrels of oil a day in January compared with Saudi Arabia\u2019s 10.2 million. But because of Russia\u2019s larger population and industrial base, it consumes more oil at home, leaving Saudi Arabia the leader in exports.Since the Soviet period, OPEC has looked on Russia as a freeloader on price-boosting production cuts: Russia benefited but never joined in.Analysts say that OPEC\u2019s efforts to involve Russia and other outsiders underlines its diminished clout. Joining with Russia is \u201cwhat is left for an organization that has lost its core reason for being, at least for now and possibly for the longer term,\u201d said Bhushan Bahree, an OPEC analyst at the market research firm IHS, who was observing the meeting.Stanley Reed reported from Doha, and Andrew E. Kramer from Moscow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Taking Shelter in Old-School Dividend Stocks", "Date": "2016-04-09", "News": "Supported byOver the last several years, growth stocks, like Amazon and Netflix, have brought much momentum to the market. But in the first quarter, those kinds of stocks lost some of their sizzle, as old-school dividend payers came back into favor.That is where three of the quarter\u2019s top-performing mutual funds found some of their better stock picks.Cheapness is not enough, though. A company must also have a durable, defensible business and a burly balance sheet. That is not to say they avoid wading into situations that some investors might consider scary. Part of their strategy is to hunt in sectors where \u201cfear and anxiety\u201d have depressed prices, Mr. Sertl said.Thus, a couple of years ago, they bought gold-mining stocks \u2014 a first for their 10-year-old fund. \u201cGold and gold stocks went into a horrific bear market, and that\u2019s when we got involved,\u201d he said. \u201cGoldcorp peaked at $55 in 2011 and bottomed out in January at under $10.\u201d The stock ended up being one of the fund\u2019s better-performing holdings in the first quarter.A period of disfavor for media companies likewise drew the fund\u2019s managers into CBS and Time Warner shares, which also have done well lately. Some consumers have been dropping cable TV in favor of online video streaming, and media companies have responded by offering \u201cskinnier bundles\u201d of services and channels, Mr. Sertl said. That could mean less revenue, which has prompted some investors to scurry away. But Mr. Sertl said he and his colleagues believed that companies with popular programming, like CBS\u2019s sports broadcasts and the Time Warner division HBO, would continue to thrive.\u201cSome people say, \u2018Content is king,\u2019 and we believe that,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you have good content, you\u2019ll be able to monetize it.\u201dThe Artisan fund, whose investor shares have an expense ratio of 1 percent, returned 6.38 percent in the first quarter, compared with 1.35 percent for the S.&P. 500.The managers assemble the portfolio annually and replace a stock in the interim only if its yield falls below the median yield of the S.&P. 500 or if a company is taken over, Mr. Pettee said. Otherwise, they leave the holdings alone.\u201cA big part of our success is the fact that we reconstitute the fund only once a year,\u201d he said. \u201cThat cuts down on our opportunities to make mistakes.\u201dThe strategy has led to the fund owning an abundance of companies in traditional sectors like industrials and energy, and fewer in higher-flying ones like health care and information technology. But as tech companies mature, more of them are finding their way into the fund \u2014 and even more will most likely end up there in the future, Mr. Pettee said.\u201cThink about Apple,\u201d he said. \u201cIt declared a dividend in 2012, so it\u2019s now in my world. It didn\u2019t score well in our model \u2014 the valuation was too rich \u2014 so it\u2019s not in the portfolio. But I\u2019m looking forward to the day when I own Apple as a Dog of the Dow.\u201cMicrosoft was the Apple of the \u201980s, and in 2013, we bought it as a Dog of the Dow.\u201dThe SunAmerica fund, whose A shares have an expense ratio of 1.07 percent, returned 6.29 percent in the first quarter.Croci (pronounced \u201ccroaky\u201d) stands for \u201ccash return on capital invested,\u201d she said. That is a measure that Deutsche Asset Management, a division of Deutsche Bank, developed to compare stocks across industries and countries. It was conceived as an improvement over traditional measures like the price-to-earnings ratio, Ms. Kumble said.\u201cEarnings are based on accounting numbers,\u201d she said. But accounting rules can vary across industries and countries, making earnings and thus P/E ratios tough to compare. \u201cWith Croci, we make adjustments to transform accounting reports into economic values,\u201d she said.The fund\u2019s managers apply a series of screens to winnow their potential holdings from among large-cap domestic stocks.\u201cWe start with the S.&P. 500 and exclude financials and any stock that pays no dividend,\u201d Ms. Kumble said. The managers then seek stocks with low financial leverage and low price volatility as well as above-average dividend yields and low prices based on their proprietary calculations. All of the stocks they buy are given an equal weight in the portfolio, and they are rebalanced and, as needed, replaced quarterly.The methodology produces a portfolio that can yield picks that might seem surprising when viewed via traditional metrics.Consider Exxon Mobil and Coca-Cola, Ms. Kumble said. Back in 2013, Coke had a price-to-earnings ratio of 19, while Exxon\u2019s was 12. \u201cSo on the surface, Exxon was cheap,\u201d she said. \u201cBut our Croci economic P/E was higher for Exxon Mobil than Coke. So our methodology said Coke was actually the cheaper stock.\u201d The Croci approach made a number of adjustments, including, for example, counting Coke\u2019s advertising and brand as assets, which differs from the traditional approach, Ms. Kumble said.Coke was also among the fund\u2019s most recent reported holdings, though Exxon Mobil was not. Apple, too, was a holding.The Deutsche fund, with a net expense ratio of 1.08 percent, returned 6.45 percent in the first quarter.Advertisement"}

His Tiger cubs have also struck gold. Many of them have ventured away from betting on publicly listed companies to taking stakes in private start-ups.Other investment firms, too, are pouring tens of millions of dollars into Silicon Valley. Much of that money is going to companies that focus on financial technology \u2014 called fintech \u2014 which includes new ways to replace traditional banking using the Internet and automation. Last year, funding for fintech start-ups more than doubled, reaching $12.2 billion, compared with $5.6 billion in 2014, according to a report from PricewaterhouseCoopers.\u201cThere was a huge wave in 2013\u201d of hedge funds and other alternative investment firms shifting into the fintech space, said Fiona Grandi, a financial services fintech leader at KPMG. After the 2008 financial crisis, banks around the world reduced lending and other services. The Internet and smartphones have allowed new players to step in and provide those services directly to consumers without using traditional banking platforms.Investor enthusiasm for the fintech sector has helped push valuations higher, with several start-ups reaching the milestone \u201cunicorn\u201d status, referring to valuations of $1 billion or more.\u201cIf you were to step back and just look at what has happened in terms of banking \u2014 with the unbundling of the banks, we\u2019ve watched venture capitalists pour in money and we\u2019re seeing the number of \u2018unicorns\u2019 marching towards going public increase,\u201d Ms. Grandi said. \u201cThere is tremendous movement in this space, and it\u2019s not surprising that hedge fund managers want to capitalize on this.\u201dThird Point Ventures, the venture capital arm of Daniel S. Loeb\u2019s $16 billion hedge fund Third Point, has made 38 investments in United States tech start-ups since 2000. One of the three fintech start-ups it has backed is SoFi \u2014 short for Social Finance \u2014 an online provider of loans, mortgages and student loan refinancing.Passport Capital, the $4.4 billion hedge fund run by John Burbank, has made a dozen investments in United States tech start-ups, according to the research firm CB Insights. Passport\u2019s fintech investments include CashStar, the maker of prepaid cards for retailers and restaurants, and Prosper, the online marketplace lender.The pace of fintech investments by hedge funds picked up in 2014, said Matthew Wong, a data analyst and researcher for CB Insights. The initial flood of money into Silicon Valley fintech start-ups from hedge funds started two years earlier and was focused on marketplace lending. Now, this money is starting to move into other fintech areas like insurance and management systems for small businesses.Tiger Global, a major investor in Silicon Valley, has also ventured overseas to make bets on fintech companies. In Australia, it has backed Tyro Payments, a company that provides banking solutions for small businesses. In India, it has investments in Razorpay Software, which offers secure online payments systems for businesses, as well as Policybazaar, a website that compares insurance options. In addition to Nubank, in Brazil it has backed ContaAzul, a management system for small businesses to control their finances and sales.A booming Silicon Valley has allowed many hedge funds to shift their focus away from traditional investing strategies that in recent years have resulted in disappointing performance.But with so much money rushing into the space, some observers warn that some companies might be getting more credit than they deserve.\u201cI think there\u2019s the short-term cycle and then there is the long-term shift that\u2019s happening,\u201d said Nick Shalek, a partner at Ribbit Capital, a venture capital firm that has focused on fintech since its founding in 2012. \u201cFintech has been one of the shiniest objects around in recent years. Some of these investors will get spooked in the next year or two, but the bigger trend is that companies are changing their behavior and transforming how financial services are delivered.\u201dHedge funds with little experience or expertise in venture investing risk getting burned, said David Snow, chief executive of Privcap.\u201cThe last time hedge funds were encroaching on private equity territory in a big way was in 2006 and 2007, just before the financial collapse,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "BlackRock Wields Its Big Stick Like a Wet Noodle on C.E.O. Pay", "Date": "2016-04-15", "News": "Supported byFair GameIt\u2019s an admirable argument that has won Mr. Fink wise-man status on Wall Street and accolades in the press. Hillary Clinton has echoed his ideas on the campaign trail.But if Mr. Fink really wants to get the attention of company executives on stock buybacks and other corporate governance issues, why doesn\u2019t BlackRock vote more often against C.E.O. pay packages of companies that play the short-term game?Executive compensation is inextricably linked to the shareholder-unfriendly actions Mr. Fink has identified; voting against pay packages infected by short-termism would help curb the problem.On pay issues, anyway, Mr. Fink\u2019s big stick is more like a wet noodle.Public pension funds are also big on rejecting pay policies, Proxy Insight said. Since 2011, the State Universities Retirement System of Illinois has voted no 63 percent of the time while the city of Philadelphia rejected 52 percent of pay policies it voted on.\u201cThis is especially true,\u201d Mr. Stringer added, \u201cwhen it comes to votes on executive pay, political spending disclosure and climate risk.\u201dIt\u2019s true that BlackRock\u2019s voting record is not much of an outlier compared with some other big money managers\u2019. Fidelity Funds, known for keenly supporting corporate management in its proxy voting, said yes on pay 96 percent of the time, Proxy Insight said. Vanguard\u2019s most recent record was to support 95 percent of pay practices; Putnam Investments did a bit better, voting yes on 93 percent.But none of these firms\u2019 chief executives have taken up the public fight against short-termism that Mr. Fink has.Even at companies that have made big repurchases of their shares in recent years, including Yahoo, General Electric, Home Depot and IBM, BlackRock has voted yes on pay. BlackRock also supported the pay policy under fire at Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, the crippled drug maker.Ed Sweeney, a BlackRock spokesman, provided this statement: \u201cExecutive compensation that is disconnected from company performance is a symptom of broader governance failures. When governance issues are identified in companies, we\u2019ve found that engaging with senior management and directors is the most effective way to catalyze change.\u201dLast year, he added, the firm \u201cengaged with approximately 700 companies in the U.S. and executive compensation was a focus of 45 percent of those meetings. If we determine that issues will not be remediated through engagement, we vote against specific proposals as well as the directors on related committees.\u201dBut Stephen Silberstein, a retired software company founder and a BlackRock investor, isn\u2019t buying this argument. So he wrote a shareholder proposal addressing BlackRock\u2019s record on pay that the firm\u2019s stockholders will vote on at their annual meeting on May 26.The proposal would require BlackRock\u2019s board to issue a report to shareholders by December that \u201cevaluates options for bringing its voting practices in line with its stated principle of linking executive compensation and performance, including adopting changes to proxy voting guidelines, adopting best practices of other asset managers and independent rating agencies, and including a broader range of research sources and principles for interpreting compensation data.\u201dIn an interview, Mr. Silberstein told me why he focused on BlackRock: because it\u2019s huge, its record on pay votes is bad and he is a shareholder. \u201cI\u2019ve been interested in income inequality for quite some time,\u201d Mr. Silberstein said. \u201cOn the bottom end, it\u2019s raising the minimum wage and on top end, it\u2019s reducing the pay of C.E.O.s.\u201dPerhaps BlackRock hesitates to call out other chief executives on their pay because of Mr. Fink\u2019s own compensation, which is lush. In 2015, he received $26 million, an 8 percent increase from the previous year; BlackRock\u2019s net income, meanwhile, rose just 2.7 percent during that period.Mr. Silberstein says he knows his is an uphill battle. Nevertheless, he is hopeful that shareholders will vote for his proposal. \u201cI\u2019m going and talking to every pension fund financial manager I can see,\u201d he said.Mr. Fink has done a service by highlighting corporate activities that compromise the potential for long-term shareholders\u2019 prosperity. This is an important conversation to have.But talking the talk is one thing, walking the walk another. Why not lead the parade, BlackRock, instead of merely waving from the sidelines?Twitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Shrunken Citigroup Illustrates a Trend in Big U.S. Banks", "Date": "2016-04-15", "News": "Supported byCitigroup became the nation\u2019s first megabank some two decades ago by expanding into new businesses while pushing to knock down barriers that limited its size.A much different Citigroup was evident on Friday as it reported its quarterly results. Business lines like subprime lending, which used to define the company, have all but disappeared.Over the last seven years, Citigroup has sold more than 60 businesses, shedding retail bank branches from Boston to Pakistan. In all, the bank\u2019s holdings have shrunk by $700 billion \u2014 an amount roughly equivalent to Switzerland\u2019s economic output. The bank\u2019s chief executive said on Friday that since he took over in 2012, the company\u2019s work force had declined by 40,000 jobs, through layoffs or selling businesses.On the campaign trail, and in the Democratic debate Thursday, the conversation has often returned to an assumption that very little has changed in the nation\u2019s banking system since the 2008 financial crisis. But Citigroup\u2019s financial results were one of many reminders this week of just how much success the government has already had in pushing banks to become simpler and safer, if not always smaller.Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, in their own earnings announcements this week, emphasized how much more of a financial cushion they had built up to protect themselves in a crisis, and how many risky businesses they had jettisoned.The bank presentations this week also indicated that even if Senator Bernie Sanders, Democrat of Vermont, does not win the White House \u2014 and is thwarted in his wish to break up the big banks \u2014 the companies will still face intense pressure from their regulators and their shareholders to shed more employees and business lines.On Thursday, Bank of America talked about the likelihood of further reductions, while Goldman Sachs is said to be embarking on its biggest cost-cutting campaign in years.All of these moves are a testament to the power of the tools that the regulators have already used, and appear intent to continue using, to change the profile of the biggest American banks.Rather than simply telling the banks to shrink, regulators have used a set of sometimes arcane instruments \u2014 like capital requirements \u2014 that have quietly but significantly penalized the banks for their size and complexity, and required them to find ways to shrink on their own.Just this week, the top bank regulators wielded a relatively new tool when they told five of the eight largest banks that they needed to develop better plans for winding themselves down in case of a crisis. If the banks do not do so, the regulators threatened to force the banks to shrink even more.Citigroup was the only one of the eight largest banks to have its plan, or so-called living will, approved by the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, in large part because of the steps the bank has already taken to slim down.Like the other big banks, it is not yet out of the woods, however. Because of the regulatory penalties for being large, some on Wall Street are questioning whether even in its diminished state, Citigroup is still too large.\u201cYou should be selling the silverware in the dining rooms or the paper clips from the desk or the desk chairs or the whole desk,\u201d the banking analyst Mike Mayo told Citigroup\u2019s top executives in a conference call Friday morning.Mr. Mayo\u2019s frustration is a response to the struggles of Citigroup and other banking giants to increase profits under the new regulatory burden they are facing. The results in the first quarter were among the weakest the big banks have reported since the financial crisis, as they struggled with a sluggish global economy and persistently low interest rates.The challenges have pushed bank stocks down this year to their lowest level since 2012. That in turn, has forced bank executives to cut salaries and bonuses, and thousands of jobs, across their business lines.Financial services nonetheless is still among the highest-paying sectors in the country. And more important, the big banks remain behemoths. JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo are bigger than they were before the financial crisis. At all the big banks, the risk-taking Wall Street operations still provide a major proportion of revenue and profit.But all of that is being squeezed by the \u201cvise that is the current regulatory environment,\u201d said Brian Kleinhanzl, an analyst with Keefe Bruyette & Woods, an investment bank.It is shaping up to be another grim year for the nation\u2019s biggest banks. They were hit hard by a bad environment for trading and deal-making.Mr. Kleinhanzl has said that Citigroup will probably have to eventually break into smaller pieces if it wants to increase growth under current regulations.Until now, many of the assets that large banks like Citigroup have sold have included a hodgepodge of businesses \u2014 student loans, an insurance unit and retail operations in far-flung corners or the developing world.Mr. Kleinhanzl says the bank needs to take more drastic steps, making the case for Citigroup to split its consumer and corporate businesses into two separate companies or sell parts of its profitable Mexican unit.Still, the banks could get a reprieve from many of these pressures if a Republican wins the White House in November. All of the top Republican candidates have called for a reversal of the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul that has guided many of the recent regulatory actions.Citigroup and the other big banks continue to defend the economic importance of global banks with a wide array of business lines.\u201cWe don\u2019t think it\u2019s the time to start selling the furniture,\u201d Citigroup\u2019s chief financial officer, John C. Gerspach, said in response to Mr. Mayo.But at more than a few points, hints of resignation crept into the presentations of the top bank executives as they spoke of the need to submit to the tightening regulatory vise.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to meet all the regulations, all the rules and all the requirements,\u201d JPMorgan\u2019s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, said on Thursday, after announcing one of the bank\u2019s worst quarters in years.\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing that now for five or six years. It\u2019s six years since Dodd-Frank was passed; they have their job to do, and we have to conform to it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Politics Influences the Stock Market: Not Very Much", "Date": "2016-04-25", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsBefore long, someone is going to call this the Hillary rally.As the chances of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s nomination have strengthened, the Dow Jones industrial average has soared, rising 2,344 points, or 15 percent, from its recent low on Feb. 11.Other factors could have helped drive stocks higher. They had fallen a long way before the rally, the outlook for company earnings has improved slightly, and fears about the strength of the world economy have subsided a bit.It wouldn\u2019t be wise to also call it a Trump rally, though he is leading on the Republican side. During this period, as Mrs. Clinton\u2019s grasp on the nomination tightened considerably, the polls show her beating Mr. Trump in November.But here\u2019s some advice for anyone in the Clinton camp who might want to point to the market\u2019s jump as evidence that investors would be happy with her winning in November: Don\u2019t.Time and time again, political partisans have tried to recruit the stock market to their side. Most of the time it backfires.One of the most famous examples of this occurred in the months after Barack Obama was elected in 2008. The stock market, still roiled by the financial crisis and a horrible global economy, was plunging. Right wingers said investors were selling because they were fearful of the new president\u2019s policies, and called the rout \u201cthe Obama bear market.\u201dThe article contained plenty of caveats about not slavishly reading too much into the markets. But Mr. Summers also contended that markets \u201care like canaries in coal mines: very valuable in giving warning when conditions change.\u201d But the same markets are rising and appear to be signaling optimism. Were they right then but wrong now?In an email exchange, Mr. Summers said that the thesis of his column was that policy makers should have been more worried than they seemed to be at the time about the outlook for the global economy. Since then, Mr. Summers said, the Federal Reserve has significantly modulated expectations of monetary tightening.As a result, he contended, the upswing in the markets \u201cwas in significant part the result of policy doing what I urged \u2014 \u2018heeding market warnings.\u2019 \u201dMore broadly, he added, \u201cThink of markets as a mediocre but not hopeless weatherman making probabilistic forecasts.\u201d (His comments came after publication because I overlooked his initial response to my query.)The market does contain important signals that can tell a bigger story, but it\u2019s a job to separate them from the noise and pure speculation. Sometimes markets react to specific political events. If Mr. Trump were to start polling strongly against Mrs. Clinton shortly before the presidential election, while still pledging to introduce tough protectionist trade policies, the stock market would most likely sell off on fears of what those policies might do to the economy.But you could reach the same economic conclusions without ever looking at the stock market. Most of what the markets appear to be saying can already be guessed at by looking at other sources.Markets also misread what\u2019s going on in the wider world. They don\u2019t have a special clairvoyance. They also don\u2019t always say what we think they are saying. The recent rally may indeed be a sign that investors would be O.K. with Mrs. Clinton winning, and the rally may even signal that she will win.But would her chances be any lower if the markets plunged for purely economic reasons? They could be higher.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Seymour Lazar, 88, Dies; Flamboyant Entertainment Lawyer, and More", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported bySeymour M. Lazar, a swashbuckling entertainment lawyer, stock trader and serial litigator whose lifetime of adventures took him from the legal tangle surrounding the estate of Howard Hughes to involvement in a colossal fraud case that threatened to bring down one of the biggest shareholder class-action law firms in the United States, died on March 30 at his home in Palm Springs, Calif. He was 88.His death was confirmed by his daughter, Tara Lazar.Mr. Lazar was a flamboyant renegade. As a hip young lawyer in Los Angeles in the 1950s and \u201960s he represented a colorful list of clients that included the comedian Lenny Bruce, the jazz musicians Miles Davis and Cannonball Adderley, and emerging pop stars like Johnny Rivers.He took LSD with Timothy Leary. He strolled through Haight-Ashbury with Allen Ginsberg. He offered career advice to Maya Angelou, then a struggling young cabaret singer whom, he said, he dated for a time.\u201cI was very shapely and nice to look at, but Seymour saw more than that,\u201d Ms. Angelou told The Wall Street Journal in 2006. \u201cHe knew I was always writing and encouraged me to be more than a cocktail singer.\u201d On the acknowledgments page of her book \u201cAll God\u2019s Children Need Traveling Shoes,\u201d she thanked him \u201cfor belief in my youthful ambition.\u201dBored with the law, Mr. Lazar jumped headfirst into the stock market. He became one of the largest independent traders in the United States, buying and selling more than $300 million in stocks in 1967, most of it related to mergers and acquisitions.\u201cI was an in-and-out trader,\u201d he told New York magazine in 1976. \u201cIf I bought a stock in the morning, and still owned it at noon, that was a long-term investment.\u201dHis wild deals and even wilder personal style \u2014 he had a long ponytail, refused to wear socks and was on occasion seen in a Pierre Cardin leather suit with no shirt \u2014 earned him a walk-on role as Seymour the Head in \u201cSupermoney,\u201d George Goodman\u2019s 1972 account of the global financial game, written under the pen name Adam Smith.Working with the celebrity lawyer Marvin Mitchelson, Mr. Lazar invested $250,000 in efforts to prove that a mysterious document discovered in the headquarters of the Church of Latter-day Saints in Salt Lake City represented the final wishes of the reclusive tycoon Howard Hughes, who died in 1976.The Mormon Will, as it was known, left millions to an unusual collection of beneficiaries, most peculiarly to a gas station owner named Melvin Dummar. Mr. Dummar said he had earned Hughes\u2019s gratitude after giving him a ride when he was wandering in the desert. A Nevada jury pronounced the will a fake.\u201cIf I lose, I\u2019ll just go on to something else,\u201d Mr. Lazar said at the time.The something else was class-action lawsuits, filed scattershot against companies large and small, claiming offenses large and small. In 1980 he filed suit against Hertz, claiming that it had overcharged him for gas on a rental car, to the tune of $11.15. That claim was denied, but others, often connected to the poor performance of stocks he owned, succeeded.Mr. Lazar eventually pushed his luck too far. In 2005 a federal grand jury in Los Angeles indicted him on multiple counts, including mail fraud and money laundering. He was accused of taking $2.6 million in kickbacks over 25 years from the law firm of Milberg Weiss to initiate suits on its behalf in his own name and the names of relatives.In 2007, as part of a plea bargain, he pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice, filing a false tax return and making a false declaration. He was sentenced to six months in home detention and ordered to pay a $600,000 fine, on top of a previously ordered $1.5 million forfeiture.\u201cSeymour was living in an unregulated age,\u201d Sheridan Hill, who is completing a biography of Mr. Lazar, said in an interview on Tuesday. \u201cHe was engaging in arbitrage before anyone called it arbitrage. The same with entertainment law. He was doing deals because he saw they were there to be done.\u201dSeymour Manuel Lazar was born on June 14, 1927, in Brooklyn and grew up on a ranch in the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles. His father, Nathan, an accountant, moved the family west in 1933. His mother, the former Rita Tannenbaum, came from a family that ran a wholesale meat business in Beverly Hills.By the time he was 12, Seymour was keeping the books for his father\u2019s accounting business. After graduating from Los Angeles High School in 1943, he took a job at Lockheed, which trained him as an electrical engineer, before enrolling in the pre-law program at the University of California, Berkeley.Drafted into the Army Air Corps, he served two years before resuming his studies. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in economics from Berkeley in 1949 and a law degree from the University of Southern California in 1951.After setting up in private practice, Mr. Lazar found his niche when a Hollywood producer walked into his office and asked if he specialized in entertainment law. He did not, but he said yes and played catch-up. He also bought the Caf\u00e9 Gala, just off the Sunset Strip, which generated a stream of clients.In the 1960s he somehow managed to combine two personas: Wall Street shark and dharma bum. He drove a Rolls-Royce and pushed vast sums through offshore accounts in the Bahamas. His gains and losses were staggering. When a proposed merger between Armour and General Host fell through in 1969, he took a $10 million hit.At the same time, while soaking up the sun in the expatriate community in Cuernavaca, Mexico, he amassed a serious collection of pre-Columbian art. He later collected African and Oceanic art as well. He financed an ashram in Arizona and a monastery in Nepal.It was in Cuernavaca that Mr. Goodman, quite skeptical of the Lazar lore he had heard so much of, met the man behind the myth. \u201cSeymour was real,\u201d he wrote, describing him as a \u201cformerly respectable lawyer with a respectable wife and child, who discovered arbitrage, mind-blowing chemicals and a new lifestyle all at the same time.\u201dMr. Lazar\u2019s first marriage ended in divorce. In addition to his daughter, he is survived by his wife, Alyce Lou; two sons, Job and Adam; a sister, Eileen Russell; and six grandchildren.Mr. Lazar remained defiant after being indicted and in the stressful period that ensued. He languished for months at his home in Palm Springs, wearing an ankle bracelet that he was allowed to remove only when he had to undergo triple-bypass surgery. The so-called kickbacks, he insisted, were referral fees and perfectly legal.The court disagreed. It rankled.\u201cI swear, they treated me like an absolute thug,\u201d he complained to The Wall Street Journal. \u201cDid I hurt anybody? Who did I cheat? Did anybody get screwed?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ackman Defends Pershing Square\u2019s Large Stake in Valeant", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported byThe billionaire investor William A. Ackman defended his large holding in Valeant Pharmaceuticals International in a conference call on Wednesday, arguing that the stock was drastically undervalued after its sharp decline last quarter.Yet while he aggressively promoted the operational potential of the troubled drug company, he acknowledged that he had underestimated the political and regulatory complexities in making the initial investment and that the recent turmoil surrounding the company had had an effect on the reputation of his firm, Pershing Square Capital Management.\u201cAnytime you have a large investment decline, by 80 percent \u2014 that is damaging to our track record as investors,\u201d Mr. Ackman said.The initial stake in Valeant was passive, he noted. Now, with his joining the board, Pershing Square\u2019s involvement will become active \u2014 in the style of a number of the fund\u2019s activist-oriented positions, he said.\u201cIt is a disastrous decline in value,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there is enormous upside for us if the company recovers.\u201dMr. Ackman\u2019s main fund was down 25 percent this year through March, with most of the swoon driven by the collapse in Valeant\u2019s stock. Pershing Square is one of the pharmaceutical company\u2019s largest investors, holding a 9 percent stake.The terrible year comes on the back of a poor record in 2015, when Pershing Square\u2019s main fund lost 20 percent. Like many hedge funds, Pershing Square imposes restrictions that make it difficult for investors to withdraw large amounts of cash in a rush. The company\u2019s assets under management stand at around $11 billion.Mr. Ackman conceded during the call that Pershing had paid too much for its initial stake, missing how vulnerable the fast-growing company could be to broader political questions over how it priced its drugs.He also said that there would be some soul-searching within his company.\u201cWe have made a lot of mistakes in Valeant \u2014 there is a lot of learning here,\u201d he said.The most pressing task, he said, was to restore confidence in the company\u2019s accounting and governance practices. In that regard, finding a chief executive to succeed J. Michael Pearson would be a crucial step for the company. In March, Valeant announced a search for a chief executive and said Mr. Pearson would serve until a successor was appointed.Mr. Ackman said there was no shortage of qualified candidates, many of whom were attracted by Valeant\u2019s potential as a turnaround story.\u201cI think it\u2019s a matter of weeks, not months, in terms of identifying new management,\u201d he said.Valeant is not Mr. Ackman\u2019s only troubled investment. Pershing has also made a large bet against Herbalife, the nutrition company that has attracted scrutiny from regulators, who accuse it of being a pyramid scheme. By shorting the stock, he would make money if the share price falls.The stock, however, has risen in recent months on expectations that regulators will not come down too hard on the company.Other stocks such as Mondelez, a snack and beverage company, and Canadian Pacific, the railroad company, have been only modest performers over the last quarter.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Buy or Rent a Home? Weighing Which Is Better", "Date": "2016-04-01", "News": "Supported byYour MoneyRob Austin and his wife, Natalia, have a 10-month-old son, healthy incomes and plenty of cash in the bank for a down payment on a house. But they are happily renting a townhouse in Pasadena, Calif., with no plans to buy for now, given the frothy prices in their area.\u201cAs long as there is such a disconnect, where a couple like my wife and me have to put down a gargantuan down payment and still have a large monthly payment to get into a decent, and not necessarily nice, house, that is a game we don\u2019t wish to play,\u201d said Mr. Austin, a 39-year-old business manager at a biotechnology company. \u201cWhen home price-to-income levels come back to a more normal level, when that happens, then we will be the first to jump in. If that never happens, that is O.K.\u201dMore American households are renting, across all income levels and generations, for different reasons. But when homeownership is the centerpiece of the American dream, most of us have internalized certain ideals: Buying a home builds equity, putting you on the fast track to building wealth. Renting, by contrast, is essentially throwing money to the wind.The arguments in favor of ownership are persuasive, particularly for people who expect to stay in place for at least five to seven years but probably more. A mortgage acts like a forced savings plan, even if you\u2019re paying the bank hundreds of thousands of dollars in interest for the privilege of building equity. Call it the cost of enforcing a positive behavior.Buying also generally protects consumers from rising rents, while traditional mortgage payments remain constant. Then, there is the fact that buyers are using borrowed money to purchase an asset that is likely to appreciate over a long period, though that can backfire as well (see housing market plunge, millions of underwater borrowers, circa 2008). Being able to call a place your own has a real, albeit intangible, value too.How well any household will fare financially by buying or renting really depends on factors no one can predict. Other studies have found that renters who invest their down payment and any savings from renting as opposed to owning often come out ahead.Either way, most financial professionals would caution against viewing a home purchase as an investment, particularly after factoring in the cost of maintenance, taxes, insurance and the high costs of buying and selling, though it\u2019s difficult not to.\u201cDisregarding the special amenities that many people value in homeownership,\u201d Professor Shiller said, \u201cit would be hugely better invested in the stock market.\u201dThe choice between buying a home and renting one is among the biggest financial decisions that many adults make.There may also be something about many people who buy. As Mr. Benningfield pointed out, they may have other attributes that may contribute to their economic success.The authors\u2019 point, however, is that people often blindly believe that buying is usually the smarter option. \u201cMost of the public drive to buy is without looking under the hood,\u201d Professor Johnson said.But any number of variables can quickly shift that calculus, including the price of the home relative to the rent, whether the family is affluent enough to benefit from tax savings, and the time spent in the home.\u201cThe longer you stay, the stronger the argument is for buying, all else equal,\u201d said Aron Szapiro, who conducted the analysis. But he also contends that the tax advantages of homeownership are often oversold, particularly to moderate-income households.If you\u2019re trying to determine the right option, some guideposts may help. Mr. Szapiro, for example, found that in households with about $100,000 in earnings, net wealth typically rose more 10 years after buying a home than if they had rented \u2014 but only if the annual rent was 6 percent or more of the purchase price. So it would pay to buy a $600,000 home when rent in the area was about $3,000 a month or more. (In a couple of places, including New York and Washington, he found that it made sense to buy when the cost of renting was a bit lower relative to home prices.)Why 15 years? By his calculations, someone paying more than 180 months of rent might potentially do better by investing in the market, after considering the costs of owning.So if an apartment would rent for $4,000 a month, that means you shouldn\u2019t pay more than $720,000 ($4,000 x 180) for an equivalent property.Then there\u2019s what you feel in the pit of your stomach. To Mr. Austin, house prices in the enclave where he lives in Los Angeles feel as if they are in a bubble, the housing downturn a faded memory. \u201cMany people we know,\u201d he added, \u201care tripping over themselves to buy right now.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated, in one instance, the surname of a financial planner in San Francisco. He is Milo M. Benningfield, not Bennigfield.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ramapo Town Supervisor Arrested in Federal Fraud Case", "Date": "2016-04-14", "News": "Supported byAfter Ramapo voters resoundingly rejected a $16.5 million plan to finance the construction of the ballpark in 2010, Mr. St. Lawrence said the project would be built with private funds. The 4,500-seat stadium, Provident Bank Park, opened in June 2011.But Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, said that while assuring the public that no town money would be used to build the stadium, Mr. St. Lawrence and a co-defendant, \u201cthrough lies and accounting manipulations, found a way for the town to fund more than half of the $58 million it cost to build that stadium.\u201d\u201cThe defendants then filled the big hole opened up by these costs in the town\u2019s general fund with a series of fake accounting entries,\u201d Mr. Bharara added.Mr. Bharara said the prosecution was believed to be the first criminal securities fraud case brought against city officials in the United States for accounting fraud in connection with the sale of municipal bonds. \u201cBut I suspect that it will not be the last,\u201d he said.His remark underscored an eccentricity of America\u2019s $3.7 trillion municipal bond market, which state and local governments routinely tap to raise money for public works. It is lightly regulated, operating on a level of faith that can seem quaint, even out of date, in an age of increasingly sophisticated global markets.While the Securities and Exchange Commission is an active watchdog of companies that issue stocks and bonds, it has largely left state and local governments to police themselves. But as concerns about fraud and deceptive accounting have mounted, the agency has filed lawsuits against municipalities and states like New Jersey and Illinois, which have typically been resolved with cease-and-desist orders. The S.E.C. filed a lawsuit against Ramapo on Thursday, but the bringing of criminal charges by federal prosecutors suggested a change in the government\u2019s approach.The co-defendant, N. Aaron Troodler, was the executive director of the Ramapo Local Development Corporation, a nonprofit organization that undertook development initiatives in Ramapo.Each man was charged with securities fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy in connection with municipal bonds, according to an indictment unsealed in Federal District Court in White Plains.In one instance in 2013, the indictment said, Mr. St. Lawrence, after making a false statement to the town\u2019s bond rating service, urged town employees to carry out a refinancing of short-term debt as quickly as possible: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to all be magicians to get to some of those numbers.\u201dMr. St. Lawrence, 65, who was arrested at his home by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Mr. Troodler, 42, were each released on bond after court appearances on Thursday. Both men pleaded not guilty. A lawyer for Mr. St. Lawrence did not return a message seeking comment. Joseph G. Poluka, a lawyer for Mr. Troodler, declined to comment.Mr. St. Lawrence, Mr. Troodler, the town of Ramapo, the development corporation and two other defendants were also named in the lawsuit filed by the S.E.C.\u201cThe object of the fraud was to mask the deterioration of the town\u2019s primary operating fund,\u201d the lawsuit said.The stadium project was the subject of harsh criticism in 2012, when the state comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli, issued an audit that said town officials had \u201cinappropriately mingled the activities of the town\u201d and the development corporation.\u201cAn already stressed and struggling town will end up being harmed even more,\u201d Mr. Bharara said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Chobani, Now It\u2019s Not Just the Yogurt That\u2019s Rich", "Date": "2016-04-26", "News": "Supported byNEW BERLIN, N.Y. \u2014 The 2,000 full-time employees of the yogurt company Chobani were handed quite the surprise on Tuesday: an ownership stake that could make some of them millionaires.Hamdi Ulukaya, the Turkish immigrant who founded Chobani in 2005, told workers at the company\u2019s plant here in upstate New York that he would be giving them shares worth up to 10 percent of the company when it goes public or is sold.The goal, he said, is to pass along the wealth they have helped build in the decade since the company started. Chobani is now widely considered to be worth several billion dollars.\u201cI\u2019ve built something I never thought would be such a success, but I cannot think of Chobani being built without all these people,\u201d Mr. Ulukaya said in an interview in his Manhattan office that was granted on the condition that no details of the program would be disclosed before the announcement.\u201cNow they\u2019ll be working to build the company even more and building their future at the same time,\u201d he said.Chobani employees received the news on Tuesday morning. Each worker received a white packet; inside was information about how many Chobani shares they were given. The number of shares given to each person is based on tenure, so the longer an employee has been at the company, the bigger the stake.Rich Lake, lead project manager, was one of the original group of five employees Mr. Ulukaya hired for the plant in New Berlin. Mr. Lake said on Tuesday that he did not expect Chobani shares to change his life much. \u201cI\u2019m not one for living outside my means,\u201d he said.Rather, he said, the shares are an acknowledgment of what he and the other employees have put into Chobani.\u201cIt\u2019s better than a bonus or a raise,\u201d Mr. Lake said. \u201cIt\u2019s the best thing because you\u2019re getting a piece of this thing you helped build.\u201dThe transfer of money by Mr. Ulukaya touches on a hot-button economic issue: the rapidly expanding gap in pay between executives and average workers. The United States has one of the widest pay gaps, and the topic has played a prominent role in this year\u2019s presidential race, particularly among the Democrats.The shares given to Chobani employees are coming directly from Mr. Ulukaya. The shares can be sold if the company goes public or is bought by another business, neither of which seems imminent. Employees can hang onto the shares if they leave or retire, or the company will buy them back.The unusual announcement comes before TPG Capital, whose $750 million loan helped bail out Chobani, can buy a stake in the company. Tension between Mr. Ulukaya and TPG about the direction of the company emerged shortly after the loan deal.TPG has warrants to buy 20 percent or more of Chobani\u2019s shares, depending on targets set in the original deal it struck. But that percentage would now be calculated from the 90 percent of the remaining shares, after the 10 percent given to the employees, essentially diluting TPG\u2019s potential stake.TPG declined to comment on Tuesday.In addition, a year ago Mr. Ulukaya settled a lawsuit with his ex-wife, who had sought a stake in the company. The terms of the settlement were not released.Technology start-ups often pay employees partly in shares to help recruit them or to compete in a company\u2019s early days for in-demand workers. Early employees of Google and Facebook became overnight multimillionaires thanks to such compensation.But unlike many of those tech companies, Mr. Ulukaya is giving his employees a piece of the company after its value is firmly established.\u201cIt\u2019s very uncommon and rare, especially in this industry, for these kinds of programs to be rolled out,\u201d said Jessica Kennedy, a principal at Mercer, the large human resources consulting firm that worked with Chobani on the new program.Mr. Ulukaya has played a hands-on role in the company since 2005, when he bought a defunct Kraft yogurt plant here with an $800,000 loan from the Small Business Administration. Two years later, he began selling Greek yogurt, setting off a heated competition in what had been one of the sleepier refrigerated cases in grocery stores.Chobani pays employees above the minimum wage and offers full-time employees health benefits and other benefits. Early on, Mr. Ulukaya established a 401(k) plan for employees and pushed them to participate.\u201cI preached and nagged and tried to force them to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, not all did, and I\u2019ve continued to worry about them in retirement.\u201dA few years ago, though, the company ran into financial problems after spending almost half a billion dollars to build the largest yogurt processing plant in the world, a one-million-square-foot facility in Idaho. The new plant allowed the company to expand into new products, like a children\u2019s yogurt packed in a tube and tiny cups of dessert-like yogurts.But the company struggled to get lines up and running smoothly, and public health officials identified mold contamination in some products.\u201cIt was a wake-up call for us,\u201d Mr. Ulukaya said soberly. \u201cIt made me realize that I needed to get this right, and so I\u2019m glad it happened.\u201dThe company had to close lines and invest in improving its food safety regimens. It also took the loan from TPG Capital to help build operations better suited to the billion-dollar business Chobani had become.In a presentation to investors, though, TPG boasted about how it had waited until the last minute to come to Chobani\u2019s rescue with the loan, thus allowing it to negotiate better terms in a deal that it estimated could increase the company\u2019s value to as much as $7 billion. In addition, rumors circulated that TPG wanted to replace Mr. Ulukaya with a new chief executive, which rankled him.But in the last year or so, business has rebounded, thanks in large part to new products made at the Idaho plant.Mr. Ulukaya will still own the vast majority of the company, though his portion will be diluted as well. He said that giving his employees a stake in the company\u2019s success was among the terms he demanded when the deal with TPG was struck.\u201cTo me, there are two kinds of people in this world,\u201d he said on Tuesday. \u201cThe people who work at Chobani and the people who don\u2019t.\u201dMichael J. de la Merced contributed reporting from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

If successful, the I.P.O. would be, by far, the biggest this year.In a market that has scared away other companies, BATS received strong demand from investors nonetheless. It priced at the high end of the range it had been marketing and increased the number of shares to be sold in the offering.On Thursday, the company\u2019s investors, who include Bank of America and Knight Capital Group, sold $252.7 million worth of shares at a price of $19 apiece.The shares, listed on BATS\u2019s own exchange, which is based in Lenexa, Kan., are expected to begin trading on Friday under the ticker symbol BATS.This time around, BATS has streamlined its servers and conducted 50,000 tests (at least once a day since December) for its auction system to handle the volume.Despite the 2012 fiasco, BATS has grown to become the second-largest exchange for equities in the United States by market share, according to the I.P.O. filing. Last year, the company captured 21.1 percent share, it said. The company said it also has the most share of trading in exchange-traded products, the prospectus showed.The company generated $1.78 billion in revenue last year, more than double the amount from four years ago. Founded 11 years ago, BATS, which stands for \u201cBetter Alternative Trading System,\u201d soon received backing from dozens of Wall Street firms as it sought to compete against the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.BATS has participated in acquisitions of its own, purchasing Chi-X Europe in 2011, Direct Edge Holdings in January 2014 and Hotspot FX Holdings last year. These deals allowed the company to expand into Europe, scale its exchange business and delve into new products.The company is taking a more demure approach to its I.P.O. than typical deals that list on either the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq.Chris Concannon, the chief executive, will be in the Kansas City area for the opening, without TV cameras or the ringing of a bell to open the market. Mr. Concannon joined BATS as president in December 2014, after spending five years at Virtu Financial, a high-frequency trading firm.BATS\u2019s investors sold 13.3 million shares in the offering.

{"Headline": "For Bill Gross, Besting Pimco Is the Best Revenge", "Date": "2016-04-25", "News": "Supported byNEWPORT BEACH, Calif. \u2014 Sitting in the conference room of his empty office suite, with its floor-to-ceiling wall of windows, William H. Gross cannot help noticing the sleek office tower that the bond giant Pimco moved into in early 2014.Just a short walk up the road, the 20-story building looms large in the Southern California sun \u2014 a potent symbol of the riches and might that Pimco came to represent during Mr. Gross\u2019s long reign there as the bond king.Although he was forced out nearly two years ago and has moved on to a rival, Janus Capital Group, Pimco remains very, very close \u2014 both physically and, it would appear, psychologically.\u201cWe were a family: Everything I did was for them,\u201d Mr. Gross said in his whispery, high-pitched voice. \u201cThat is the most disappointing thing \u2014 it just didn\u2019t make business sense.\u201dPimco would disagree, even though $376 billion has walked out the door since it was decided in late 2014 that the firm would be better off without the man who was the public face of the franchise.The trouble for Pimco does not stop there. Mr. Gross has filed a lawsuit asserting that he was wrongfully terminated, and he is seeking $200 million \u2014 which he said he plans to donate to charity. And, as he is only too happy to point out, his new vehicle, the Janus Global Unconstrained Fund, is handily beating its counterpart at Pimco.William H. Gross is suing the company to repair the damage that was done to his reputation in the year before and after he was fired.In a world where a portfolio manager\u2019s ability to outperform represents the truest measure of worth, these results have invigorated Mr. Gross.\u201cI am fixated on proving that they were wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like \u2014 no, you shouldn\u2019t have done that and the numbers will prove it.\u201dPimco is no less fixated on him. This month, Pimco filed a legal response to Mr. Gross\u2019s suit, rebutting his allegations.The turmoil was tied to the abrupt departure in 2014 of Mohamed El-Erian, who had been set to succeed Mr. Gross.The accounts of Mr. Gross\u2019s conduct were described by people who have worked with him at the firm, but who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Furious at the betrayal, Mr. Gross wanted to dock Mr. El-Erian\u2019s pay and provoke him into suing Pimco, which, he believed, would hurt his chances of getting another job, those people said. Pimco executives rejected the idea \u2014 as well as a demand that they lie to a newspaper reporter to present him in a better light, they said.Even with the punishing toll of that turmoil \u2014 outflows, layoffs and a battered reputation \u2014 firm leaders say they have no regrets.Still, while they have strived to assure concerned clients that Pimco is moving on, Mr. Gross\u2019s ability to remain squarely in the public eye, via the legal fight and now a campaign to promote his superior performance, is driving them to distraction.Michael Reid, a spokesman, said, \u201cThe entire 240-member portfolio management team competes in the financial markets every day with the goal of generating strong risk-managed returns on behalf of our clients.\u201dPatricia Glaser, Mr. Gross\u2019s lawyer, said the assertions were untrue: \u201cPimco seems to have a problem getting their story straight. It is now acknowledging they pushed Bill out, instead of their previous claim that Bill walked away from the company.\u201dThat the dispute has become a mind game of sorts does not seem to bother Mr. Gross.Unlike any other fund manager, Mr. Gross, who majored in psychology at Duke, puts himself on the couch for the world to see. In his investment letters, he has revealed such intimacies as the erotic pleasure of a good sneeze, his failure in college to get a girl into the back seat of his car and how sad he was when his cat died.Convention bores him: That is why he will stand on his head when the urge hits and wear a silk tie as a scarf, draped loosely around his neck.Mohamed El-Erian was set to succeed William Gross at Pimco but left abruptly in 2014.So it is no revelation for him to own up to obsessive behavior in terms of how his $1.3 billion fund is faring against its Pimco counterpart.Mr. Gross, 71, is not tethered to his phone, so when Bloomberg publishes the daily result of his fund at 3 p.m. California time, he will drop his golf clubs and rush to the office to get the news.The first thing he says he does when arriving home (after kissing his wife, Sue, of course): Check the Bloomberg. At night he will wake up as many as three times to check on global markets, he says.He is not above poking fun at himself, though. At a recent golf tournament he was paired \u2014 to his surprise \u2014 against Michael Gomez, a young Pimco executive known to be close to his nemesis, Mr. El-Erian.\u201cI really wanted to win \u2014 but yeah, they killed us,\u201d he said, laughing loudly.Since Mr. Gross officially took control of his fund on Oct. 6, 2014, he is up 1.8 percent, compared with Pimco Unconstrained, which is down 1.64 percent, according to Morningstar.Making it all the sweeter is the fact that Daniel J. Ivascyn, one of the executives who led the effort to oust him and then took over as chief investment officer, is an executive of the fund. Mr. Ivascyn, who manages the better-performing Pimco Income Fund, is not a primary manager on the vehicle.\u201cMy whole evening is dependent on whether I beat them,\u201d Mr. Gross said. \u201cYou see, I have to prove it all over again. Every day.\u201dDespite this favorable run, money has not flooded in. One of his larger investors, George Soros, last year removed $490 million from his oversight.Of the $1.3 billion in the fund, about half is Mr. Gross\u2019s own money.\u201cMoney is holding out,\u201d said Todd Rosenbluth, a mutual fund specialist at Standard & Poor\u2019s Global Market Intelligence. \u201cI think there is legitimate market skepticism that he can do this on his own \u2014 without a Pimco team supporting him.\u201dMr. Gross contends the main reason that his bond fund has been winning the day is that Pimco has been making bold plays on emerging market bonds and inflation-linked securities, wagering that central bank activism will stimulate global growth.For some time now, he has been arguing that with rates at zero or negative, central banks have virtually no ability to spur growth.\u201cThey are betting on reflation, while I am skeptical of it,\u201d he said.Mr. Gross, has, in effect, taken the opposite side of this wager by building a portfolio that pays off if there are no global market shocks, like interest rate increases or a large country going bust.Of course, such a strategy carries dangers. Mr. Gross has made some big bets that Brazil and Mexico will not default by selling investors credit-default swaps, derivative instruments that would force him to disburse large sums if these countries go belly up.Such derivative-fueled bets on financial stability can backfire when markets go haywire. Last year, his Janus fund experienced several sharp drops in price, which preceded Mr. Soros\u2019s decision to withdraw his funds.\u201cThis is not a riskless strategy,\u201d Mr. Gross acknowledged.He is also under no illusion that his good run is permanent.So he is enjoying its fruits while they last. And if he has become fanatical about beating the guys across the street, so what? He is convinced that fealty to the screen, not to mention daily yoga stretches, is what keeps him feeling youthful.In fact, over the years, Mr. Gross has consistently asked one question of prospective employees: What drives you?The twist is that they must pick one of three answers: money, power or fame.Strangely to him, no one has ever picked fame.\u201cIt is the one thing I have always wanted,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I was starting out at Pimco in 1972, I told my mother and father that I was going to become the most famous bond manager in the world.\u201dThat he did, but then came the fall.\u201cWhen you write my obituary I don\u2019t want you to mention that I was fired by Pimco,\u201d he said. \u201cI want you to write that I was a great investor \u2014 so maybe I am not over it.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Tuesday about the bond investor William H. Gross overstated what is known about his exit from Pimco. The nature of his departure is the subject of litigation between Mr. Gross and Pimco; it has not been determined that \u201che was fired nearly two years ago.\u201d (Mr. Gross contends that he was wrongfully terminated; the company says that Mr. Gross resigned and was not fired.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Winds From Washington Chill Wall Street\u2019s Deal Making", "Date": "2016-04-14", "News": "Supported byOn Wall Street, the phones have been a little quieter. The workload has been a little lighter. The happy hours have been starting earlier.For most people, that would be a good thing. But not for deal-hungry lawyers and bankers, who are experiencing a recent slowdown in megadeals. A series of broken transactions and stock-market volatility have shaken the confidence of some in the boardroom to tackle their next big acquisition.The value of abandoned deals has been higher than that of newly signed deals in the United States so far this year. Almost $340 billion worth of mergers have been withdrawn in 2016, while $282 billion worth of newly signed deals were announced, according to data compiled by Dealogic. The cancellations are skewed toward megadeals, defined as those worth $10 billion or more.The divergence in the deal market comes largely as a result of a regulatory clampdown.Over the last year, with shareholder encouragement, companies ventured into large, complex and risky deals. Last week, the government fought back, in a lawsuit by the Justice Department and new rules from the Treasury Department, to stop many of the transactions.One lawyer described a depression that set over mergers and acquisitions as a result of those two actions. A banker said that Wall Street had come to a grinding halt. These deal makers requested anonymity, so as not to be seen at odds with the government\u2019s decisions.During an election year, advisers say, the big, politically unpopular deals may just have to wait.\u201cCompanies were concerned that their large deals would draw political focus and be criticized as part of the campaigning,\u201d Marc-Anthony Hourihan, co-head of Americas mergers and acquisitions at UBS, said.Robert A. Profusek, who heads Jones Day\u2019s global mergers and acquisitions practice, said, \u201cThe gargantuan deals, they\u2019re harder; there\u2019s no question in my mind.\u201d\u201cThe government has been tougher, but they would say: \u2018That\u2019s because you guys have been jamming these giant deals at us. What do you expect us to do?\u2019\u201d Mr. Profusek said.There is plenty of blame to go around. Bankers and executives would argue that with little global economic growth, mergers have been the best way for companies to jump-start their businesses. Lately, though, they say there has been more uncertainty about what the government will and will not approve, resulting in an abatement in activity.That has been a concern for months, some say, and last week\u2019s government actions, and subsequent deal terminations, merely provided validation.The law firm Kirkland & Ellis said in a note on Wednesday, \u201cThe proposed regulations are so far-reaching that, if finalized in their current form, they likely will affect the way every multinational corporate group with a U.S. presence does business.\u201dThe firm was referring to new rules regarding so-called earnings stripping, in which an American subsidiary borrows from its foreign parent and uses interest costs from the loan to help shrink its United States tax bill.The drug makers Pfizer and Allergan called off their merger as a result of the new rules, which also essentially disqualified Allergan as a merger partner for Pfizer because it had made a few too many inversions.But ever-optimistic bankers say there is opportunity to be had in all of this. After Pfizer\u2019s and Allergan\u2019s deal was terminated, pharmaceutical stocks rallied as investors speculated which companies would become the next targets. And the factors that led to such rampant deal making last year \u2014 slower growth and cheap financing \u2014 have not gone away.It just may be the smaller companies that feel more confident in pulling the trigger.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it a day yet on the M.&A. wave,\u201d said Mr. Profusek of Jones Day.Advertisement"}

Both she and her husband have full-time jobs, so where had the little girl gotten the idea that Daddy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work mattered more?Ms. Palmer didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know, but she took it as a call to action. Although she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s written about the topic of money management for a living for many years, she wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t handling many of the money management tasks in her own household.Many couples will bristle at the idea that any family task other than breast-feeding should be assigned on the basis of anatomy, even if they are often self-selecting in this manner by choice.In many households, men tend to manage family investments and taxes, and women, if they get involved in money issues, tend to focus only on everyday expenses and charitable donations.Same-sex couples often have separate investment accounts and make individual decisions, which is probably a legacy of the fact that it was hard for them to marry and combine accounts until recently.Or perhaps men simply like handling this task more. Does it really make sense to take it away from them? Ms. Palmer pushes back against concerns over prescribed gender roles in three ways.Divorce happens, too, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good for both spouses to know where the money is (and if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been moved around recently) in the event of a surprise separation.While Ms. Palmer wants women to be the financial captains of the family, she is not advocating a dictatorship. A couple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial discussions should be collaborative, whether the person executing the decisions is male or female. So you sit down at least once a year and remind yourselves of the answers to the following questions: Where is our money now? How do we get to it? Has our willingness to take risks with our investments changed? What are the most important goals for the next year? And what do we want to change?Reading \u00e2\u0080\u009cSmart Mom, Rich Mom\u00e2\u0080\u009d made me acutely uncomfortable, precisely because I could not shake the feeling that I was doing it wrong. At the very least, my wife should be making all the moves for 12 months at a time, once every few years.As for Ms. Palmer, she now has the password to the Excel spreadsheet her husband made that contains all of their financial information. And she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s started bringing her wallet along most everywhere she goes, even if it is a bit bulky.That way, she hopes, her daughter will understand that her mom is just as invested in the money that gets made and spent in their family as her father is.Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "Rise of Institutional Investors Raises Questions of Collusion", "Date": "2016-04-12", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorBlackRock, Vanguard and other big institutional investors own roughly 70 percent of the public stock market, according to some reports. People are starting to ask whether this allows companies \u2014 now having the same owners \u2014 to compete less and raise prices.Take, for example, the airline industry. Across all of its funds, BlackRock held 8.3 percent of United, 6.6 percent of JetBlue, 4.7 percent of Delta and 4.5 percent of Southwest, as of March 31, 2013. Mr. Baer said the Justice Department was exploring whether such cross-ownership either explicitly or implicitly pushed companies to compete less.After all, if there is less competition in the airline industry and higher fares result, it will arguably benefit BlackRock over all, because it holds shares in not just one company but several in the industry. Less competition may mean higher costs for consumers but more profits for the airlines and BlackRock\u2019s investors.Let\u2019s just stop here and note why this is interesting.These are not the typical antitrust violations where one company buys a rival and is able to squeeze out competition and raise prices. Instead, these institutional shareholder positions are minority holdings that are pervasive throughout the public stock market. If these holdings diminish competition and result in higher prices, it is an attack on the way shares are held. And it also means that the public is suffering under our capital markets arrangement.This is why the Justice Department\u2019s interest is more than academic. It has the potential to be an attack on the entire system of mutual fund holdings.The paper on airline ownership is likely to spawn a whole field of study, and the authors deserve kudos, but it is important to put it in perspective.The problem is that the Justice Department will not find anything in its investigation because the study does not capture how shareholders interact with the companies they invest in, particularly those like BlackRock that are full of passive index funds.First, during the time of the airline study, the airline industry was undergoing sweeping consolidation, with bankruptcies and mergers galore. At the same time, shareholders were concentrating their holdings. The paper may just be finding a symptom of industry movement, with shareholders flocking to more concentrated industries but not causing them to be concentrated.The theory is that the holdings of the two fund managers combined were so large it gave them pricing power. But the authors do not report what Barclays and BlackRock held before or after the acquisition.In response to an email inquiry, Mr. Azar provided the numbers they used for the four airlines they studied for this part of the test. Barclays held 2.2 percent of Delta, 4.6 percent of US Airways, 5.6 percent of AirTran and 4.1 percent of JetBlue. BlackRock held 1.5 percent of Delta, 1.2 percent of US Airways, 1.2 percent of AirTran and 1.3 percent of JetBlue.In the appendix, the authors illustrate this phenomenon by looking at the route from Rochester, N.Y., to West Palm Beach, Fla., flown by Jet Blue and AirTran.After the acquisition of B.G.I., BlackRock\u2019s holdings in JetBlue increased to 5.4 percent and its holdings in AirTran rose to 6.9 percent, but did that result in less competition on a secondary route?It is hard to believe that these smaller changes in ownership at these four airlines among two asset managers actually led fares to rise across the board by such a large amount. Instead, the authors seem to be picking up large price rises on routes that had smaller carriers like AirTran and JetBlue. If a modest increase in holdings caused this type of reduction in competitiveness, we would expect to see this happen with other asset managers or acquisitions.And that\u2019s the other problem with this cross-holding theory. It simply does not reflect how shareholders act and think in today\u2019s environment.Even in an age of activist shareholders, institutional shareholders vote only on directors and \u201csay on pay\u201d advisory issues, as well as other corporate governance initiatives. How they vote is decided in an office that is usually separate from the fund managers.Institutional investors may engage with management on their business, but it is not extensive and it is done at the fund level, not globally from each asset manager.Instead, funds engage in quasi-passive governance, often herding toward activist investors that do not have these cross-holdings. BlackRock, which is known for not challenging management, just ran its first activist campaign in Hong Kong.It is hard to believe that these shareholders are influencing pricing at these smaller levels without engagement with the company.A counterexplanation is that management seems safe not to compete with all of this cross-ownership because it knows it will not be challenged. Yet, this seems to ignore another aspect of the story \u2014 growing consolidation and the natural tendency of some industries toward collusion.This does not mean that we should not do some hard thinking about what it means when a handful of shareholders own a majority of shares on the public markets, even though most of it is through passive index funds. Is that too much influence? What are the effects of this ownership?And it does not mean this is not an excellent paper \u2014 it is clearly picking up some effect of cross-ownership, but it is not certain yet what causes that effect.It could be that the Justice Department proves me wrong and finds extensive collusion between shareholders and airlines. But more likely, it will find that the opposite is true. Institutional investors do not necessarily push for less competition, but they do fulfill the conventional wisdom that shareholders do not do enough to challenge failing companies.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Valeant Tumbles, So Does Bill Ackman\u2019s Hedge Fund Herd", "Date": "2016-04-27", "News": "Supported byThe billionaire investor William A. Ackman has become the unofficial leader of a thundering herd that has lost billions of dollars betting on Valeant Pharmaceuticals over the past year.Mr. Ackman\u2019s firm has lost billions of dollars on Valeant. Shares of the Canadian drug maker have plummeted 85 percent since he first pitched the company as one of his best investment ideas at a hedge fund charity event last year.Not coincidentally, big names like Paulson & Company, Viking Global Investors and Brahman Capital have also lost billions, collectively, by betting on Valeant \u2014 underscoring a growing phenomenon of hedge fund groupthink. It is a reflection of big-dollar investors chasing too few ideas and getting tripped up when things turn poorly for a company they have set big markers on.\u201cThe bottom line is, hedge fund herding is not going away anytime soon,\u201d said Andrew Karolyi, a professor of finance at Cornell University. \u201cIf anything, we are now seeing the early signs that this type of hedge fund herding is spilling over into herding of large institutional investors. To the extent that that spillover grows and expands, then we will be concerned.\u201dHedge funds piled into Valeant as the stock soared more than $200 a share last year, even as warning signs about the company\u2019s leadership and business practices began to appear. The stock is now trading around $36 a share, as Valeant prepares to install a new chief executive and races to meet a deadline to file a delayed financial report.Big hedge funds employ teams of analysts to conduct research on companies, and they also spend tens of millions of dollars on outside research. But managers are also influenced by the big bets of their counterparts: So-called best ideas get exchanged at charitable events and exclusive industry dinners attended by traders and managers.\u201cWhy do people believe it?\u201d asked David Maris, an analyst at Wells Fargo. \u201cThey follow Valeant because they want to follow it. They want to believe they have found a new way to make money in pharmaceuticals without investing in new drugs \u2014 it sounds like a magic money box.\u201dThe crowding of hedge funds into Valeant was not an isolated event.SunEdison, a renewable energy company, was once a hedge fund darling. Big investors included Omega Advisors, Glenview Capital Management and Greenlight Capital Management. David Einhorn, the founder of Greenlight and one of the industry\u2019s most closely followed investors, emerged as SunEdison\u2019s head cheerleader when he gave a presentation promoting it in October 2014 at a Manhattan charity event. He called his presentation: \u201cHere Comes the Sun-E,\u201d playing of SunEdison\u2019s stock ticker name.Mr. Einhorn, 47, whose fund at its peak owned 6.8 percent of the company\u2019s shares, remained bullish on SunEdison\u2019s prospects even as the stock, which was trading at about $31 a share last summer plunged during the remainder of the year. In early January, as SunEdison shares were trading at $3, Mr. Einhorn got a representative appointed to the company\u2019s board.Then on April 21, the company filed for bankruptcy. Shares now trade for around 24 cents.Calculating specific losses for a hedge fund is difficult without knowing the prices which a firm purchased its shares. But Valeant\u2019s and SunEdison\u2019s plunging share prices have caused considerable carnage.It is a time of turbulence for the hedge fund industry, where some of the biggest names have reported double-digit losses. Last year, firms fell deeply into the red after wide swings in certain so-called hedge fund hotel stocks, leading what Daniel S. Loeb of Third Point Management called a \u201chedge fund killing field\u201d in a recent investor letter.The total value of hedge fund positions in SunEdison, which once accounted for 66 percent of the company\u2019s shares, is now worth just $15 million after its bankruptcy filing, according to FactSet, the financial research firm. Before hedge funds began selling their SunEdison shares last year, the value of all of those firms\u2019 holdings was $3.5 billion.The losses are worse with Valeant. At the beginning of 2015, hedge funds owned about 23 percent of the company\u2019s shares. Today, the market value of the industry\u2019s holdings in Valeant have fallen by $7.3 billion even as hedge funds bought more, according to FactSet.Firms have until mid-May to disclose whether they sold or bought shares in the fourth quarter.That so many hedge funds remained bullish on Valeant despite months of turmoil \u2014 as questions were raised repeatedly about its accounting practices \u2014 reflects the difficulty managers sometimes have with changing course.\u201cWe all get lazy and when an idea seems to be working \u2014 inertia tends to take over and you stop paying attention,\u201d said James Chanos, the founder of Kynikos Associates and one of Wall Street\u2019s best-known bearish investors. \u201cThat\u2019s on full evidence with Valeant and SunEdison too,\u201d he added.Mr. Chanos\u2019s firm began researching Valeant in late 2013. The company was a classic corporate roll-up that was growing because of serial acquisitions, piling on the debt at the same time. His short thesis focused on the fact that Wall Street was giving the company too much credit for future growth that would continue only as long as Valeant could keep acquiring bigger companies.In February 2014, Mr. Chanos presented Valeant as a stock to short at his annual \u201cBears in Hibernation\u201d retreat in Miami, which some three dozen of his friends and like-minded bearish investors in the hedge fund industry routinely attend.Mr. Ackman reached out to Mr. Chanos a month later to learn about his short bet and Mr. Chanos offered to share his research. Mr. Ackman appeared not to be persuaded and by February of the next year, he began to build what is today a 9 percent stake in Valeant.Now, as a recently appointed member of Valeant\u2019s board, Mr. Ackman is not only one of the biggest investors in the company, but has also positioned himself as an architect of its potential comeback as well. His most recent investor letter on April 26, emphasizes his role in stepping in to stabilize the company earlier this year, gaining two seats on the board.But much work remains. Valeant still has a debt pile of $31 billion to manage. It continues to wrestle with the fallout from a now shuttered mail-order drug distribution company, Philidor Rx Services, which led to an internal review of its accounting for revenue from that channel. It may have to restate earlier earnings.Mr. Ackman, in his opening statement on Wednesday to the Senate Special Committee on Aging, tried to strike a conciliatory tone when it came to the uproar over Valeant\u2019s history of increasing prices on drugs it acquired through acquisitions. He said Valeant will institute a process to ensure it considers \u201call appropriate factors and patient access in particular, when setting prices for its drugs.\u201dScolded by one senator for not looking closely enough into Valeant\u2019s drug pricing, a somewhat flustered Mr. Ackman said, \u201cI regret that we didn\u2019t do more due diligence.\u201dFor Mr. Einhorn and SunEdison, the path forward is more uncertain. Normally, equity holders get little to nothing in a bankruptcy reorganization. Mr. Einhorn\u2019s Greenlight firm cut its stake in the company nearly in half a few days before the bankruptcy filing, but by then, the damage was done.Mr. Einhorn has not said anything since the bankruptcy filing and has said little to his investors this year about his bet on SunEdison.But in a letter to investors in January, Mr. Einhorn quoted David Bowie, in what now seems like a prescient statement, \u201cI don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going from here, but I promise it won\u2019t be boring.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Sues ValueAct, Saying Hedge Fund Violated Antitrust Law", "Date": "2016-04-04", "News": "Supported byNot long after Baker Hughes and Halliburton announced a merger agreement in November 2014, ValueAct, led by Jeffrey W. Ubben, started acquiring stakes in both energy giants.The prominent hedge fund came up with a plan if the $35 billion deal turned messy: to push the chief executives to do what it took to ensure the deal went through.That strategy (and when ValueAct came up with it) is at the heart of a $19 million antitrust lawsuit filed on Monday by the Justice Department.Regulators require active investors \u2014 or those who plan to influence business decisions of management teams \u2014 to alert the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department and wait for a period of time before acquiring securities above a certain threshold. Passive investments below 10 percent of a company are exempt from these filings.The line between passive and active can be murky, especially for a firm that calls itself an activist investor.Upon acquiring about $2.5 billion worth of stock in both Baker Hughes and Halliburton, ValueAct failed to notify regulators, violating the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, the government said in the complaint. The purpose of the act is to give regulators a chance to block any investment that might thwart competition.But ValueAct argues that it acted in compliance with the law.\u201cValueAct strongly believes in the most basic principles of shareholder rights,\u201d the firm said in a statement Monday. \u201cThis includes having a relationship with company management, conducting due diligence on investments and engaging in ordinary course communications with other shareholders.\u201dValueAct added that it planned to \u201ccontest the Department of Justice\u2019s action\u201d and \u201cvigorously defend our position.\u201dEven though it has been 16 months since the deal between Halliburton and Baker Hughes was announced, regulators are still scrutinizing it.In an attempt to prove ValueAct\u2019s intent to provoke the two companies, regulators dug up emails and calendars. From December 2014 to January 2016, ValueAct met with senior management at both companies more than 15 times, according to the complaint. In emails, executives at ValueAct wrote about owning both stocks to \u201cdrive new terms to get the deal done.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Financial Fables: All the Better to Teach You With, My Dear", "Date": "2016-04-09", "News": "Supported byEssayThose people over at the National Rifle Association have some great ideas.That gives me an idea for some stories of my own \u2014 fairy tales about money. But let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves.Nobody actually gets blown away in these stories \u2014 mayhem is averted, not committed, by an armed citizenry.Oh, you can get all liberal and say that these stories play down the risks of firearms. You might even say that if the wolf and the witch had guns of their own \u2014 say, rifles with sights \u2014 these would have been much shorter stories, with full bellies for the bad guys.I got in touch with Professor Tatar, because how often do you get an excuse to talk with a professor of Germanic folklore and mythology? She said that one of the problems with these gun-toting, sanitized tales was that they missed the point of Grimm. Success in fairy tales, she explained, comes down to more than tight shot grouping. \u201cThey are very much about problem-solving, using your wits and courage to get out of trouble,\u201d she said. \u201cUnfortunately, because they take up very basic cultural contradictions and are supremely malleable, they can also be harnessed for almost any purpose. The Nazis recast Little Red Riding Hood as the innocent Aryan victim of a Jewish wolf.\u201dYikes.Still, these stories intrigued me. I, myself, have written things for money. I have even written books, which is, in my experience, the least fun you can have in your underwear. It seemed to me there might be an opportunity here for me to write things for money that serve a greater purpose \u2014 just like the N.R.A.So here is my brilliant plan: If we can update fairy tales for pedagogical purposes, why not use them to teach children the value of investing? Mutual funds might not be as fascinating to children as firearms, but I love a challenge. And my finances are certainly Grimm.I sought advice. I sent an email to Ms. Hamilton, who has a master\u2019s degree in English and 18th-century history from the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. She responded, \u201cI love the idea, but I\u2019m not available for comment at this time.\u201dSo I struck out on my own and tried a couple of test runs.Cinderella? A fabulous example of outsourcing. Her animal friends did all the work. Or are they unpaid interns? Still working on this one.The possibilities are endless. Business is, after all, built on fairy tales. What\u2019s an S-1 filing for an initial public offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission, if not corporate storytelling? And look at Theranos, the health tech phenomenon whose blood tests from the prick of a finger are starting to look as if they have more to do with fantasy than reality. That could be a model for an updated Sleeping Beauty: Pricking her finger didn\u2019t go well for her, either.Our politicians understand the ways that business really is a Grimm tale. If you listen to Bernie Sanders, big, bad Wall Street bankers are scarier than any wolf.I explained my bold new storytelling idea to Professor Tatar. She listened politely. And then she shocked me by saying \u2026 she liked it. \u201cYou can\u2019t teach kids investing principles per se, but if you put it in a story, it becomes instructive in a way the dry, abstract stuff will not,\u201d she said. \u201cI trust you,\u201d she said, \u201cand think you would create a work that would do more good than harm.\u201dThat trust might be misplaced. Still, great things might await me. As Jack said after climbing the beanstalk: Show me the money.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The High Fees You Don\u2019t See Can Hurt You", "Date": "2016-04-23", "News": "Supported byStrategiesHigh fees, often hidden from view, are still enriching many advisers and financial services companies at the expense of ordinary people who are struggling to salt away savings. The problem has persisted year after year. A new analysis of mutual fund data confirms its severity.But don\u2019t rejoice just yet: It is only a step.First, the Labor Department\u2019s new rules are not yet in place. They are scheduled to take effect in 2017 and 2018 but are opposed by much of the financial services industry. They could easily be changed, weakened or blocked.For now, even for retirement accounts that are to be covered by the rules, many advisers are not required to act in their clients\u2019 best interests. This means that they are legally entitled to look out for themselves first and recommend investments with higher fees, to the detriment of those who have asked for help.The rules say that, with some exceptions, advisers will be required to make reasonable recommendations based on an examination of industry norms and practices. But the rules don\u2019t detail which specific investments or fee levels are acceptable.As a consequence, I\u2019ve been reviewing data on the performance and fees charged by mutual funds, which are the primary investing vehicle for many Americans.Fund performance records are of limited predictive value: History does not guarantee future performance, as the S.E.C. requires mutual fund companies to say in advertisements and fund documents.To the contrary, even when fund managers succeed in outperforming their peers in one year, they cannot easily repeat the feat in successive years, as many studies have shown. That\u2019s why low-cost index funds, which merely mirror the performance of the market and don\u2019t try to beat it, make a great deal of sense as a core investment.But whether you choose an index fund or one that is actively managed, commissions and fees provide important clues about future performance.Low fees won\u2019t turn intrinsically bad investments into profitable ones, of course, but they make a big difference. Aye M. Soe, senior director of index research and design for S&P Dow Jones Indices, performed a custom analysis at my request. Using the data in her report on mutual fund performance, \u201cThe Spiva Scorecard\u201d (Spiva is an acronym for S.&P. Indices Versus Active), she separated out the effects of fees and commissions. This may seem to be dry stuff, but bear with me. Some of Ms. Soe\u2019s new findings are important.Mutual fund commissions, also known as sales loads, are a big drag on performance. They are often difficult to justify if an adviser is truly working in an investor\u2019s best interest. I\u2019ll turn to them in another column.For now, let\u2019s briefly consider the range of fees contained in mutual fund expense ratios, which include payments made to fund managers and distribution companies as well as many miscellaneous expenses. These expenses are stated in fund prospectuses, by requirement of the S.E.C.With fees included, the average actively managed fund in each of 29 asset categories \u2014 from those that invest in various sizes and styles of stocks to those that hold fixed-income instruments like government or municipal bonds \u2014 underperformed its benchmark over the decade through December. In other words, index funds outperformed the average actively managed fund in every single category.But part of the problem for actively managed funds is their fees. When Ms. Soe eliminated the impact of fees, more funds managed to beat their benchmarks. For example, in the real world, more than 80 percent of large-cap funds trailed their benchmarks. But when Ms. Soe\u2019s calculations removed the negative effect of fees from fund returns, only 69 percent underperformed. That\u2019s still a poor record \u2014 and still argues for cheap index funds \u2014 but it\u2019s much better.What was striking, though, was that in some categories, fees were responsible for the actively managed funds\u2019 mediocrity. This was true for large-cap value stock funds and international small-cap stock funds, as well as for global, general municipal, California municipal and New York municipal fixed-income funds. The average fund in these categories actually beat its benchmark when the impact of fees was removed from fund returns.In other words, over the long run, the odds that a talented manager will beat an index fund improve when fees are low \u2014 though those odds are still quite low, and a low-cost index fund remains a safer bet.One outcome of this analysis is very clear, Ms. Soe said. \u201cFees matter a great deal,\u201d she said. \u201cHigh fees should be avoided, and investors need to have enough information to understand that.\u201dWhat is a reasonable benchmark for fees? Note that according to Morningstar, the median expense ratio for actively managed mutual funds is 1.2 percent. For index funds it is about 0.5 percent. The data suggests that, for the most part, the less you pay the better off you will be.Investors who believe they have found honest and skillful advisers may still want to understand all of this. Not everyone truly has your best interest at heart.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Target-Date Funds Are Simple, but They Still Require Careful Aim", "Date": "2016-04-09", "News": "Supported byTarget-date funds are intended to be all-in-one investing solutions capable of getting you all the way to retirement. They typically don\u2019t try to produce market-beating returns, but can provide an appropriate mix of stocks and bonds based on your age and planned retirement date.That may be enough for you. Yet you still may want to scrutinize these vehicles, because they don\u2019t guarantee returns and may not provide the precise blend of investments that you want.Target-date funds have been popular for a good reason. They keep things simple: You designate the approximate year that you think you will be leaving the work force, and fund managers will provide a preset portfolio, gradually increasing the proportion of bonds and cash as you age, while reducing stock fund holdings.One key to divining risk in a target-date fund is understanding its \u201cglide path,\u201d the changing proportion of stocks, bonds and other investments held in the fund from year to year. For individual investors, there may be too much or too little risk. It\u2019s also worth knowing whether you have a \u201cto\u201d or \u201cthrough\u201d fund. The former will take you to a retirement date and hold a majority of investments in bonds and cash when that time nears. A \u201cthrough\u201d fund, on the other hand, will keep investing in stocks after retirement, which may help you manage inflation and longevity risk.Target-date funds don\u2019t necessarily mirror the performance of the larger stock and bond markets. Instead, their returns depend on the mix of their individual portfolios, and in some years, their returns may be disappointing. Last year was a case in point: In every date range, the average target-date fund produced a negative return, according to Morningstar.In better years, such as 2014 when the S.&P. 500 rose nearly 14 percent, target-date funds outperformed actively managed funds, and did so over longer periods as well, according to Morningstar.What\u2019s more, investors in target-date funds tend to buy and hold them for long periods. That has produced better results than those for people who try to time the markets by jumping in and out of funds.Yet because target-date funds are diverse, there can be wide variation in returns, depending on the company that operates them, the portfolio mix and internal expenses. Only two companies scored top \u201cgold\u201d ratings in Morningstar\u2019s overall evaluation of 25 target date groups: BlackRock\u2019s LifePath Index Series and Vanguard\u2019s Target Retirement Series, according to Holt.These two companies provided some of the lowest-cost target-date funds. In December, the average asset-weighted expense ratio for BlackRock\u2019s funds was 0.18 percent, according to Morningstar; for Vanguard it was 0.17 percent. That compares with 0.73 percent for the overall category.Of course, you don\u2019t need to restrict yourself to target-date funds. If you want to go further afield, you can pick other funds from your employer\u2019s 401(k) line, or make investments outside your plan, either on your own or with an adviser\u2019s help.Francesca Federico, an investment adviser and fiduciary in Boston, says that while target-date funds may be fine, some people \u201cmay be better off in alternatives.\u201d That may mean a portfolio that includes downside protection on stock and bond losses, managed futures, precious metals and emerging markets \u2014 investments typically not found in most target-date funds.Customized portfolios can be expensive, though, and that could hurt your returns. Conventional money managers typically receive 1 percent annually of assets under management. And individual fund expenses need to be factored in on top of that.For many people, target-date funds remain a comfortable and intelligent choice. Whether you stick with them exclusively or as part of a broader mix, you may want to do some homework. Customizing a portfolio might help you better address specific risks and needs but if you do mix investments, you will need to calculate your overall asset allocation carefully, something that an exclusively target-date fund portfolio will do automatically.In any case, lives, careers and even retirement realities can be as volatile as markets. A target-date fund may be fine for you but, as always with investing, the final responsibility remains with you.Advertisement"}

Starboard was spun off from the financial firm Ramius five years ago. It started off pressuring the Internet company AOL, demanding that it shut its Patch local news arm and sell off its patents. AOL eventually did exactly that, though Starboard did not gain any board seats. It managed in 2014 to oust the entire board of Darden Restaurants using a campaign that involved a 300-page presentation castigating the company for a host of sins, including profligate breadstick distribution. Not all of its campaigns have been that successful though. In 2013, Starboard sought to block the $4.7 billion sale of Smithfield Foods to a Chinese meat processor, but failed to put together a rival offer. The Canadian drug maker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shares have plunged 85 percent since he first pitched the company as one of his best investment ideas last year. Paulson & Company, Viking Global Investors, Brahman Capital, and his own firm Pershing Square Capital Management have all lost billions betting on Valeant. Hedge funds spend tens of millions of dollars on outside research as well as their own teams of analysts, but they are also influenced by their counterparts, exchanging ideas at charity events and industry dinners. Company founders often reign supreme in Silicon Valley and corporate structures have shifted to accommodate that philosophy. More tech companies have been adopting different stock classes to allow their founders to cement their voting power. The new C shares allow Mr. Zuckerberg to maintain 60 percent of voting power while still giving away large amounts of stock. Mr. Zuckerberg would obtain a large amount of C shares that he can donate without diluting his voting power in the company. Most investors currently hold A shares, which only have about a quarter of the overall shareholders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 voting power so they may not be forgoing much if they choose to sell their A shares versus their C shares. The social network also reported robust earnings for the first quarter, surpassing Wall Street expectations.

Griesa of the United States District Court in Manhattan to lift an injunction that had barred Argentina from paying its creditors and eventually led the country to default in 2014.The ruling caps years of bitter legal wrangling that goes back to 2001, when Argentina defaulted on nearly $100 billion of bonds. A small group of holdout investors, including the hedge fund billionaire Paul E. Singer, refused to take part in two debt restructurings by Argentina since then.Argentina is now poised to raise more than $12 billion through bond sales, the proceeds of which will pay its holdout creditors.

{"Headline": "As Obama Hosts Nuclear Security Summit, the Focus Is on China", "Date": "2016-03-31", "News": "Supported byThe leaders announced that the United States and China would sign a climate change accord later in April, a show of unity on an issue that has become a bright spot in the tangled relationship between the two countries. But they quickly moved on to more contentious issues, with Mr. Obama pressing Mr. Xi on China\u2019s construction of military facilities in the South China Sea, actions that a White House official said belied a pledge the Chinese president had made last fall not to militarize those waters.\u201cLike China and other countries, the United States has significant interests in the Asia-Pacific region,\u201d Mr. Obama said to Mr. Xi before the meeting, his only extended encounter with a visiting leader at the Nuclear Security Summit, which will conclude on Friday.\u201cOur two countries have some disputes and disagreements,\u201d Mr. Xi replied. He called for both sides to \u201cavoid misunderstanding and misperceptions,\u201d and to respect each other\u2019s core interests \u2014 a polite warning not to meddle in the South China Sea, which Beijing regards as a core interest.China\u2019s neighbors dispute its claims to reefs and shoals, and fear that it is colonizing one of the world\u2019s most strategic waterways. The United States has dispatched Navy ships to guarantee that the sea lanes remain unobstructed, but that has raised the risk of a confrontation with Chinese warships.During a visit to Washington in September, Mr. Xi declared that China would not \u201cpursue militarization\u201d of the South China Sea. But since then, it has installed surface-to-air missile batteries and military radar on reefs and newly reclaimed islands hundreds of miles from the Chinese mainland.\u201cWe have seen developments and reports that are not consistent with the commitment not to militarize the South China Sea,\u201d said Benjamin J. Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser.Mr. Xi and Mr. Obama found more common ground on confronting the nuclear threat posed by North Korea. China supported a new round of United Nations sanctions against the Pyongyang government after it tested a nuclear device and fired ballistic missiles.To reassure America\u2019s allies in the face of their rogue neighbor, Mr. Obama also met with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan and South Korea\u2019s president, Park Geun-hye.Those countries were thrust into the American political campaign in recent days after the Republican front-runner, Donald J. Trump, proposed they acquire nuclear weapons to deter the threat from North Korea. A senior Japanese official quickly reaffirmed Japan\u2019s commitment to remain nuclear-free.Mr. Trump\u2019s comments did not come up in the three-way meeting with Mr. Obama, according to American officials. But Mr. Rhodes issued a withering response to the proposal, saying it would undercut decades of nonproliferation policy.\u201cIt would be catastrophic were the United States to shift its position and indicate that we somehow support the proliferation of nuclear weapons,\u201d he said.\u201cThe entire premise of American foreign policy as it relates to nuclear weapons for the last 70 years has been focused on preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat has been the position of bipartisan administrations, of everybody who has occupied the Oval Office.\u201dDomestic politics and regional concerns both seemed to crowd out any discussion of global efforts to secure nuclear materials. And for all the hubbub \u2014 the intense security; the motorcades snarling traffic in downtown Washington \u2014 the meeting opened on a subdued note.Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, was a no-show, which made breakthroughs on security unlikely, given his country\u2019s vast nuclear stockpile. The terrorist attack in Belgium last week also cast a shadow over the gathering, particularly after reports that fighters for the Islamic State were seeking to penetrate a nuclear facility to obtain material for a so-called radioactive dirty bomb.Mr. Obama has added a session to discuss the campaign against the Islamic State, in which the administration continues to claim gains. He met on Thursday with President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France, his only one-on-one session with a leader aside from Mr. Xi. Mr. Obama praised Mr. Hollande for \u201cgalvanizing the European community\u201d in the fight against terrorism.The president\u2019s refusal to meet with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey roiled the diplomatic waters, suggesting that Mr. Obama was displeased with Mr. Erdogan\u2019s authoritarian bent. But the White House said Mr. Obama met briefly with him on Thursday evening. \u201cYou want Russia at the table on issues of nuclear security,\u201d Mr. Rhodes said. \u201cThey only isolate themselves by not attending summits like this.\u201dThis was the fourth and final Nuclear Security Summit of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency, and with Mr. Obama \u2014 who conceived and championed these meetings \u2014 leaving office next year, several experts said this was likely to be the last.When Mr. Obama departs in January, it is not clear who will keep the momentum going. While the Democratic front-runner, Hillary Clinton, supports Mr. Obama\u2019s nonproliferation policies, she has evinced little of his fervor for a nuclear-free world.But as the leaders arrived for a dinner at the White House past an honor guard lined up along the South Lawn, Mr. Obama could claim one achievement: An amendment to a treaty that stiffens standards for protecting nuclear materials was signed by 102 nations.The original protection agreement dates to 1987, but it has long been considered weak. The amendment, proposed after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, specifies minimum requirements for physical protection of civilian nuclear stocks, and for securing them when they are transported.As part of an effort to be more open about its nuclear inventory, the United States announced that its stockpile of highly enriched uranium declined 20 percent, to 585.6 metric tons in 2013 from 740.7 metric tons in 1996. The decline was modest, but it was the first time in 15 years that the government released these numbers.A senior administration official, who declined to speak on the record ahead of the president\u2019s announcement, said that the amendments to the physical protection agreement are \u201cthe closest thing we have to legally binding standards for nuclear security.\u201dDavid E. Sanger contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fantasy Math Is Helping Companies Spin Losses Into Profits", "Date": "2016-04-22", "News": "Supported byFair GameCompanies, if granted the leeway, will surely present their financial results in the best possible light. And of course they will try to persuade investors that the calculations they prefer, in which certain costs are excluded, best represent the reality in their operations.Call it accentuating the positive, accounting-style.What\u2019s surprising, though, is how willing regulators have been to allow the proliferation of phony-baloney financial reports and how keenly investors have embraced them. As a result, major public companies reporting results that are not based on generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, has grown from a modest problem into a mammoth one.Regulations still require corporations to report their financial results under accounting rules. But companies often steer investors instead to massaged calculations that produce a better outcome.I know, I know \u2014 eyes glaze over when the subject is accounting. But the gulf between reality and make-believe in these companies\u2019 operations is so wide that it raises critical questions about whether investors truly understand the businesses they own.Among 380 companies that were in existence both last year and in 2009, the study showed, non-GAAP net income was up 6.6 percent in 2015 compared with the previous year.Under generally accepted accounting principles, net income at the same 380 companies in 2015 actually declined almost 11 percent from 2014.Another striking fact: Thirty companies in the study generated losses under accounting rules in 2015 but magically produced profits when they did the math their own way. Most were in the energy sector, which has been devastated by plummeting oil prices, but health care companies and information technology businesses were also in this group.How can a company turn losses into profits? By excluding some of its costs of doing business. Among the more common expenses that companies remove from their calculations are restructuring and acquisition costs, stock-based compensation and write-downs of impaired assets.Creativity abounds in today\u2019s freewheeling accounting world. And the study found that almost 10 percent of the companies in the S.&P. 500 that used made-up figures took out expenses that fell into a category known as \u201cother.\u201d These include expenses for a data breach (Home Depot), dividends on preferred stock (Frontier Communications) and severance (H&R Block).But these are actual costs, notes Jack T. Ciesielski, publisher of The Analyst\u2019s Accounting Observer. \u201cSelectively ignoring facts can lead to investor carelessness in evaluating a company\u2019s performance and lead to sloppy investment decisions,\u201d he wrote. More important, he added, when investors ignore costs related to acquisitions or stock-based compensation, they are \u201cgiving managers a free pass on their effectiveness in managing all shareholder resources.\u201dIt puzzles some accounting experts that the Securities and Exchange Commission has not been more aggressive about reining in this practice.Lynn E. Turner was the chief accountant of the S.E.C. during the late 1990s, a period when pro forma figures really started to bloom. New rules were put in place to combat the practice, he said in an interview, but the agency isn\u2019t enforcing them.\u201cThey just need to go do an enforcement case,\u201d Mr. Turner said of the S.E.C. \u201cThey are almost creating a culture where it\u2019s better to beg forgiveness than to ask for permission, and that\u2019s always really bad.\u201dThis would seem to be a great opportunity to tackle the problem of fake figures. But such work does not appear to rank high on the S.E.C.\u2019s agenda.With the presidential election looming, Mr. Ciesielski said it was unlikely that any meaningful rule changes on these types of disclosures would emerge anytime soon. That means investors will remain in the dark when companies don\u2019t disclose the specifics on what they are deducting from their earnings or cash flow calculations.Consider restructuring costs, the most common expense excluded by companies from their results nowadays.\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t companies say, \u2018This is a restructuring program that is going to take us four years to complete, and here are the numbers,\u2019\u201d Mr. Ciesielski said in an interview. \u201cRestructuring programs cost cash. Why not face up to it and be real about what you\u2019re forecasting? If everybody did that consistently, that would be a dose of reality.\u201dMr. Turner, the former S.E.C. chief accountant, agreed. What investors need, he said, is a clearer picture of all items \u2014 both costs and revenues \u2014 that companies consider unusual or nonrecurring in their operations. These details should appear in a footnote to the financial statements, he said.\u201cWe need to require the disclosure of both the good and the bad,\u201d Mr. Turner said. \u201cIf you have a large nonrecurring revenue item, you need to disclose that as well as a nonrecurring expense. Then you should require auditors to have some audit liability for these items.\u201dOf course, some of the fantasy figures highlighted by companies are worse than others. Excluding the impairment of an asset, Mr. Ciesielski said, is \u201cnot the worst crime being committed. But when you\u2019re backing out litigation expenses that go on every quarter, that\u2019s a low-quality kind of adjustment, and those are pretty abhorrent.\u201dThe bottom line for investors, according to Mr. Ciesielski and Mr. Turner, is to ignore the allure of the make-believe. Real-world numbers may be less heartening, but they are also less likely to generate those ugly surprises that can come from accentuating the positive.Twitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Companies Face Greater Scrutiny for Paying Workers With Stock", "Date": "2016-04-17", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For the last few years, LinkedIn, the professional social networking company, has doled out increasingly large amounts of stock to pay its workers.In 2014, LinkedIn paid employees $319 million in stock, or 14 percent of revenue; in 2015, that rose to $510 million, or 17 percent of revenue. At the time, those figures were largely met with shrugs from Wall Street.Now that attitude may be changing.The Silicon Valley company\u2019s stock-based compensation \u201cprovides additional reason to remain cautious\u201d on LinkedIn, Mark May, an Internet analyst at Citigroup, wrote in a research note.The issue is not limited to LinkedIn. With tech earnings season kicking off on Monday, investors are paying more attention to stock-based compensation at many tech companies.Paying employees with stock is largely unquestioned when times are good, since the move theoretically aligns the interests of the workers with company performance. The practice is technically a corporate expense, but during boom periods, Wall Street typically focuses on a company\u2019s operating results that exclude that expense.Tech companies stand out as some of the most generous givers of shares to employees. While the median number of restricted shares granted at Standard & Poor\u2019s 1500 companies to executives and employees in 2014 equaled 450,198 shares, tech companies granted a median 798,000 shares of restricted stock to workers, according to data from Equilar, a research firm that provides data on executives, boards and compensation.As a result, there has been a \u201cheightened investor focus on the level of stock-based compensation among the Internet companies,\u201d Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a recent note.In an interview, Mr. Mahaney said stock-based compensation could \u201cdistort the quality\u201d of a company\u2019s earnings and \u201cmake them look stronger than they are.\u201dMr. Mahaney has identified Twitter, LinkedIn, Yahoo and Alibaba as among the tech companies that are highly dependent on stock to pay their employees. In a report, he wrote that Twitter\u2019s stock-based compensation over the last two years accounted for 39 percent of the company\u2019s revenue, on average, the highest percentage of any Internet company.LinkedIn, whose share price is down about 48 percent this year, did not respond to requests for comment. Twitter, whose stock is down more than 20 percent this year, also did not respond to a request for comment.Another tech company that Wall Street analysts are examining for its stock-based compensation expenses is Workday, which sells human resources and financial management software. The company is expected to increase its stock compensation about 48 percent in its 2017 fiscal year, which is faster than its revenue is projected to grow, according to Sarah Hindlian, an analyst at Macquarie Group.In an illustration of how stock-based compensation expenses can affect a company\u2019s results, Ms. Hindlian says Workday\u2019s margins are projected to be around negative 25 percent for fiscal year 2017. But when the company\u2019s $370 million in stock-based compensation is excluded from results, its operating margins are much better, coming in around zero.Workday\u2019s heavy reliance on stock-based compensation has been a factor in Ms. Hindlian\u2019s projections for the company\u2019s share price. Last month, she forecast that Workday\u2019s stock would trade at $49, down from its current price of about $77. She has a sell recommendation on the stock.Ms. Hindlian says that while it can be reasonable for companies to pay workers a lot in stock, the practice can become scary when the stock starts to fall. \u201cParticularly with software companies, you run the risk of losing your leading salespeople, engineers and developers when the stock falls, because employees feel like they\u2019re getting a pay cut,\u201d said Ms. Hindlian, who also rang the alarm on LinkedIn\u2019s use of stock-based compensation over a year ago.\u201cSomewhere along the way a management team may feel pressure to increase their share price to avoid loss of employees,\u201d Ms. Hindlian said, \u201cwhich can ultimately mean management goals and shareholder interests become misaligned.\u201dWorkday declined to comment.When companies authorize additional shares to pay employees and management, that also creates \u201cdilution,\u201d or a decrease in how much of the company a shareholder owns when new stock is issued. That effect is starting to push others on Wall Street to lower their price projections for tech company stocks. Mr. May of Citigroup lowered his price targets this month on Google, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, eBay, Yahoo and Twitter to \u201cfully capture the likely ongoing dilution from future share grants as part of employee compensation,\u201d he said.The increased scrutiny of tech companies that rely heavily on stock to pay employees is just one of many places where investors are taking a harder look as markets soften, said John Roe, a managing director at ISS Corporate Solutions, a group that advises shareholders on corporate governance issues.He noted that some shareholders had also submitted proposals asking companies to consider the impact of share buybacks on earnings, to figure out whether executives delivered better earnings by improving performance or by reducing the number of shares outstanding.\u201cYou see a brighter focus on certain practices when there is more volatility and markets are going down,\u201d said Mr. Roe. \u201cThe reliance on equity compensation is one of those things that you might always worry about, but recent events have amplified that concern.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Vote to Impeach Rousseff Prompted Cheers, But Won\u2019t End Turmoil in Brazil", "Date": "2016-04-18", "News": "Supported byBRAS\u00cdLIA \u2014 To those unfamiliar with the cacophonous tenor of Brazilian politics, the legislative session on Sunday night that approved the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff could have been mistaken for a soccer match.As the outcome of the vote became clear, deputies in the lower house of Congress hooted, pumped their fists and hoisted onto their shoulders the man who had cast the pivotal vote.One lawmaker, wearing a flag as a cape, fired a gun that shot confetti.The unrestrained merriment was mirrored on the streets of cities across Brazil, where thousands of people celebrated what they hope will be the ouster of Ms. Rousseff on charges that she illegally used money from state-owned banks to hide a catastrophic budget deficit and bolster her chances of re-election.But on Monday, Brazilians awoke to the sobering reality that the political and economic turmoil that has consumed their country, Latin America\u2019s largest, for the past two years is far from over.Inflation is running at 10 percent, unemployment is at a seven-year high and the economy is expected to contract by as much as 3.8 percent for a second year in a row.A Zika epidemic is coursing through the northeast, and a cash-strapped local government in Rio de Janeiro is racing to prepare for the Summer Olympics. If the impeachment process moves forward as many experts predict, Brazilian televisions this August are likely to feature a split-screen spectacle of sporting events and their president on trial.\u201cWe may be witnessing the end of Dilma but not the end of the Brazilian crisis,\u201d Sylvio Costa, the founder of Congresso em Foco, an anticorruption watchdog group.And the political paralysis that has hobbled the government is not likely to ease anytime soon. Ms. Rousseff will have to step down temporarily next month if the Senate votes by a simple majority to take on her impeachment trial, an outcome that many analysts say is all but assured.Ms. Rousseff, whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9 includes a stint as a Marxist guerrilla, has vowed to fight on. \u201cDespite much sadness, I have sufficient spirit, strength and courage to confront this injustice,\u201d she said in a televised news conference on Monday. \u201cI won\u2019t be taken down.\u201dThe man who is expected to replace her, Vice President Michel Temer, is not exactly a knight in shining armor. Mr. Temer, 75, a career politician whose Brazilian Democratic Movement Party has been ensnared in the nation\u2019s ever-expanding corruption scandal, is almost as unpopular as Ms. Rousseff.A survey released on Monday by the polling firm Datafolha found that 68 percent of those who supported Ms. Rousseff\u2019s impeachment think Mr. Temer should not be president; more than half thought that he, too, should be impeached.Writing in the newspaper Folha de S. Paulo, the columnist Bernardo Mello Franco took stock of the troubling state of affairs, among them legislative gridlock and at least five leaderless ministries.\u201cIn the next weeks Brazil will be in an exotic predicament,\u201d he wrote on Monday. \u201cDilma is almost an ex-president and Temer is almost a future president. And because their relationship is broken, the sum of the two cannot give the country one head of government.\u201dThough a large majority of deputies voted for Ms. Rousseff\u2019s impeachment, this nation of 200 million remains deeply divided.Many of her supporters have promised to take to the streets in an effort to stave off her removal from office.In recent days, a growing number of officials have been calling for new elections, a process that would require the consent of Congress and the nation\u2019s highest court. \u201cIt is clear to society that the party of Vice President Temer is as responsible for the political, ethical and economic crisis as is the party of President Dilma,\u201d said Marina Silva, a former minister and outspoken critic of Ms. Rousseff.The vast majority of Brazilians also have little faith left in their leaders.A third of the deputies in the lower house have been charged or are being investigated for corruption, including its speaker, Eduardo Cunha, the man who orchestrated Ms. Rousseff\u2019s impeachment. Mr. Cunha, who faces charges that he accepted $40 million in bribes, is especially disliked, with nearly 90 percent of Brazilians calling for him to step down, according to Datafolha.Senate President Renan Calheiros has his own ethical challenges. He is under investigation on accusations of receiving bribes, evading taxes and allowing a lobbyist to pay child support for a daughter of his born from an extramarital affair.\u201cWe have two thieves leading our Congress and they should both be in prison,\u201d said Mr. Costa, the anticorruption activist.As he watched the balloting on Sunday night on television, Julio Barboza, 33, an environmental scientist from S\u00e3o Paulo, grew despondent as a stream of deputies cited God, clean government and democracy as they cast their votes against the president.He noted that just a handful used their brief speeches to mention the accusations Ms. Rousseff is facing. \u201cIt made me realize that the impeachment process has little to do with fiscal crimes,\u201d Mr. Barboza said.For the moment, all eyes are on Mr. Temer, the vice president, a taciturn man who has long preferred operating behind the scenes. Although he is also the subject of an impeachment petition, most experts believe the matter will be dropped in the interest of national stability.Despite his dismal popularity on the street, many business leaders believe Mr. Temer, a centrist, is the best hope for righting the Brazilian economy. Expectations that Mr. Temer would replace Ms. Rousseff have had one tangible effect on the nation\u2019s financial outlook: As the impeachment process moved forward in recent months, Brazilian stocks rallied 35 percent, though they lost two points on Monday.A former speaker of the lower house and an adroit deal maker, Mr. Temer will need to build a coalition to enact the economic reforms, tax increases and painful austerity required to contain a ballooning deficit.The road will be steep. Mr. Temer\u2019s party enjoys scant public support and members of Ms. Rousseff\u2019s Workers\u2019 Party, angry over his defection to the opposition last month, are likely to stymie his work in Congress. And any effort to pare back social spending and trim bloated public pensions will stir up fierce resistance from labor unions and left-leaning activists.\u201cThe economy is in disarray and most Brazilians are hopeless about the current political class,\u201d said Carlos Eduardo Lins da Silva, a senior consultant at the S\u00e3o Paulo Research Foundation. \u201cTemer is the personification of the old political class, so he will have a big challenge.\u201dAndrew Jacobs reported from Bras\u00edlia, and Vinod Sreeharsha from Rio de Janeiro.

{"Headline": "A Tough Year for Banking Takes Shape", "Date": "2016-04-14", "News": "Supported byIf this week is any indication, 2016 is shaping up to be another tough year for the nation\u2019s biggest banks.JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo said on Thursday that their profits slumped in the first quarter, weighed down by problems in the oil and gas industries, volatile trading markets and persistently low interest rates.The latest results came a day after regulators rejected the banks\u2019 \u201cliving wills,\u201d forcing the companies to revise their plans on how they would wind down in a future financial crisis, and spurring renewed debate over whether Wall Street is still too big to fail.Rather, the earnings results reinforce the mundane daily challenges of how banks are struggling to increase profit and revenue in a ho-hum economy and in an era of tighter regulation.\u201cIn quarters like this, revenue is going to be challenged,\u201d Bank of America\u2019s chief financial officer, Paul Donofrio, said in a conference call with reporters on Thursday.Bank of America\u2019s predicament is fairly stark. The bank, which is based in Charlotte, N.C., said it had increased its consumer loans \u2014 extending 1.2 million new credit cards in the quarter \u2014 while also releasing millions of dollars it had set aside to cover potential losses from defaulting consumers.Much of the good news that came from the banks\u2019 consumer businesses, however, was overshadowed by issues in their commercial loan portfolios, where persistently low oil and gas prices have put pressure on the highly indebted energy industry.Bank of America said it had set aside an additional $525 million for oil- and gas-related loan losses, bringing its total energy reserves up to about $1 billion, covering about 4.6 percent of its energy loans.Wells Fargo increased its oil- and gas-related reserves to $1.7 billion in the first quarter, covering 9.3 percent of its energy portfolio, and began to record losses on some of the loans.Trading in stocks and bonds was hurt by volatility in world markets, as the outlook for the global economy darkened and the direction of interest rates became uncertain.Overall market revenue at JPMorgan fell 13 percent from a year earlier. At Bank of America, sales and trading revenue dropped 16 percent after accounting for certain debt valuation adjustments.Wells was less affected by the rough market conditions because its Wall Street operations are smaller than those of its peers.It is shaping up to be another grim year for the nation\u2019s biggest banks. They were hit hard by a bad environment for trading and deal-making.As the fortunes of their investment and consumer banking units seesaw, banks might seem tempted to increase their the most profitable businesses and take more risks on the strength of American consumer.But bank executives vowed they would stay prudent. Mr. Donofrio said Bank of America was able to expand its credit card business without extending loans to people with less than stellar credit.John Shrewsberry, Wells Fargo\u2019s chief financial officer, said the bank had been willing to give up market share in the red-hot auto market to avoid taking too much risk. Wells said it has capped its subprime exposure at 10 percent of total auto loans.\u201cWe drew a line and lost some share,\u201d Mr. Shrewsberry said in an interview. \u201cWe have stuck with the approach not to take any more credit risk.\u201dDespite the challenges, the quarter was better than expected. All three big banks reported higher profit than analysts polled by Reuters had forecast.Bank of America said its profit declined 13 percent from a year ago to $2.7 billion, or 21 cents a share. Analysts expected profit of 20 cents a share.\u201cWe are running this company so we can be a source of stability and strength,\u201d Mr. Donofrio said. \u201cWe are not trying to earn all of our money in good times only to give it back in tough times.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Book Reviews: Behind a Powerful Portfolio, a Successful Career", "Date": "2016-04-09", "News": "Supported byOff the ShelfPersonal finance advice is often so focused on making sure our assets are properly diversified, taking every deduction we are entitled to and keeping investment costs low that it is easy to forget one important fact: When it comes to securing your financial future, the better you manage your career, the more money you are likely to have.Two new books about handling your family\u2019s finances stress that idea: The more money you make, the more you can save. Since raises are typically a percentage of what you currently earn, the higher the base, the greater the increase. Contributions that your employer makes to your retirement account are usually based on how much you put in. The higher your salary, the more you can invest. Your Social Security benefits are based on your earnings.For example, while she is all in favor of saving money on purchases, Ms. Palmer adds: \u201cThere\u2019s a dark side to penny-pinching. It keeps us focused on small, short-term savings instead of working on the far more significant strategies that can really build our family\u2019s wealth. We get a rush from saving $5 at checkout, while leaving $500 on the table because we didn\u2019t sign up for a flex-spending account at work to pay for child care expenses.\u201dHer general points \u2014 for example, that the spending and saving habits we develop in our 20s have a significant impact on our financial future \u2014 are solid. And she is occasionally very witty. \u201cI sometimes spend my lunch break texting with my younger sister, urging her to skip the $50 massage and instead learn to relax in less expensive ways after a bad day, in between offering her dating advice and career guidance. I am a full-service sister.\u201dStill, it would have been better if she had provided even more specific advice.Mr. McCormick, a managing partner of the private equity firm HCI Equity Partners, which invests in companies that generate about $20 million to $200 million in revenue, specifies his focus in his book\u2019s subtitle: \u201cUsing Business Principles to Maximize Your Family\u2019s Wealth.\u201dWhere Ms. Palmer is supportive, Mr. McCormick is hard-nosed, perhaps fitting for a graduate of both West Point and Harvard Business School.In talking about his recommendations, Mr. McCormick assumes \u201cyou have the discipline and intellectual honesty to act rationally.\u201d He adds, by way of example: \u201cMany advisers suggest you pay off your mortgage as quickly as possible. On the contrary, I recommend you pay off real estate debt last, even after making other investments, given the relatively low after-tax cost of this debt. But this assumes you actually save and reinvest this increased cash flow and don\u2019t blow it on a new flat screen or vacation.\u201dIf you own a home, having additional real estate investments, like shares of a real estate investment trust, or REIT, is not a good idea, he adds. But, he says, you probably want to own more international stocks.\u201cToday U.S. equities represent about half the global economy, a percentage that has been consistently decreasing. Basing your equity allocations on relative global market capitalization values will ensure your allocations change with the changing dynamics\u201d of the global economy.Conversely, he believes, you may have too much money in fixed-income investments. His recommendation, which strikes me as aggressive, is if you are three or more years away from retirement, you need to have only 36 months of total living expenses in bonds, Treasuries and money market funds. \u201cSo long as you are more than three years from retirement, there is no need for more fixed income exposure.\u201d Everything else, he says, should be in stocks.And those stocks should be in index funds. Active investing \u201cis analogous to the joke about how good the technology is on new airplanes these days,\u201d he writes. \u201cInstead of two pilots, these new airplanes require one pilot and one dog. The dog\u2019s job is to bite the pilot if he tries to touch the controls. Many of us would be better off if we had a dog around to bite us when we are tempted to \u2018actively manage\u2019 our investments.\u201dBut for all that investing advice, Mr. McCormick devotes the first 50 pages of his book to the need to \u201cmaximize the value of your single biggest asset \u2014 your labor,\u201d making points such as, \u201cInvestments in education are one of the surest ways to financial security and wealth creation.\u201dArmed with that education, he adds, you want to \u201cmake career choices that extend your possibilities.\u201d You want to gain skills in fields like finance or marketing that are transferable to other industries as opposed to learning everything about one industry that could end up being disrupted out of existence.The proven principles of personal investing are important. But if you want to have a secure financial future, it will certainly help if you manage your career well. Neither Mr. McCormick nor Ms. Palmer advises that you choose a career based solely on what it pays, but it is certainly one factor to keep in mind.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Growing Ardor for Overseas Shopping", "Date": "2016-04-14", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsNelson Peltz sat on the board of Legg Mason, the $3.7 billion asset management company, for five years while his hedge fund, Trian Partners, scooped up 10 percent of the company\u2019s stock.Mr. Peltz shook things up as he always does. He ousted the chief executive and got Legg to cut costs and return billions of dollars to shareholders. When it came time to exit the investment, Mr. Peltz sold his shares to the Shanda Group.Wait, what? You heard right. Shanda is a Chinese investment company that started out as an interactive-gaming company but now \u201cseeks global opportunities that offer business growth or unique breakthrough potential.\u201d On Tuesday, it spent $340 million to buy Mr. Peltz\u2019s stake in Legg, which got its start selling stocks out of a back office in the Baltimore Stock Exchange in 1899.The logic of this deal is hard to follow \u2013 not least because Shanda paid a premium to the market price for the Legg shares, something that almost nobody ever does for a passive minority stake. Yet such situations are hardly unique at a moment when Chinese companies and investors are going wild for assets of pretty much any color or stripe in the world\u2019s developed economies.Indeed, the Chinese ardor for overseas shopping has become so fervent that there\u2019s a new mantra making the rounds of Wall Street bankers who have an asset to sell anywhere in the world: \u201cWho\u2019s the Chinese buyer we\u2019ve never heard of?\u201dThe biggest advisory companies like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs routinely fly China specialists across the ocean when they pitch companies for the mandate to help sell a business.The surge in Chinese buyers, many of them unknown in the West \u2013 sometimes even in Hong Kong \u2014 requires a new level of due diligence and heightened vigilance, from banks, lawyers and accountants. As the curious case of Anbang Insurance\u2019s aborted \u2013 and inexplicable from the start \u2013 $14 billion bid for Starwood Hotels suggests, it\u2019s harder for investment banks to really understand their Chinese clients\u2019 motivations.The examples cross nearly every industry and region. Though head-scratchers abound, not all of them are as hard to fathom as Shanda\u2019s Legg investment. Some reflect the overarching ambitions of Chinese Communist Party leaders. Some, like Alibaba\u2019s purchase of Hong Kong\u2019s South China Morning Post, look like vanity plays. Others just take a creative stretch of industrial logic to justify. Underpinning them all seems to be a lack of confidence about prospects in the People\u2019s Republic.The China National Chemical Corporation\u2019s $43 billion takeover of the agrochemicals giant Syngenta falls squarely into the first category. The state-owned enterprise was set up by the country\u2019s former Ministry of Chemical Industry. Its chairman, Ren Jianxin, undoubtedly has a red phone linking his desk to the Communist Party\u2019s top brass in Beijing.The Syngenta deal looks like it is intended to satisfy China\u2019s goals to bolster food production in the world\u2019s largest agricultural market. Syngenta\u2019s chemicals and patent-protected seeds are a strategic asset for a nation that has a population of 1.4 billion. This deal, China\u2019s biggest foreign acquisition, is a relatively logical pairing.The same cannot be said of Shandong Ruyi\u2019s surprise $1.2 billion purchase last month of SMCP, the operator of the second-tier European fashion chains Sandro, Maje and Claudie Pierlot. It\u2019s hard to argue, as Shandong Ruyi does on its website, that \u201cbeing involved in rabbit-hair spinning, textile & clothing, cotton textile, cotton printing and dyeing, knitting, fiber, jeans and real estate\u201d has made it a \u201cwell-known textile-related pluralism group.\u201d Still, kudos to the enterprising banker who alerted the firm to the willingness of the owner, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, to part with the French retailer.At least Shandong Ruyi has a website. In the auction of Dah Sing Financial\u2019s insurance business, more than two dozen suitors showed up for the first round of bids, half of them from the mainland, and some so obscure that bankers involved in the process had never heard of them.That\u2019s not unusual. When the private equity firm EQT was selling a German company that generates energy from waste matter, eight interested parties from the mainland showed up. And unlike banks or insurers interested in Dah Sing, they weren\u2019t highly regulated entities. In the end, the business sold for 1.43 billion euros to Beijing Enterprises Holding, a conglomerate listed in Hong Kong with three business lines: gas, beer and sewage treatment.China\u2019s lunge for foreign assets has hit $92 billion so far this year, according to Thomson Reuters, nearly reaching last year\u2019s $103 billion record with eight and a half months to spare.At that pace, it won\u2019t be long before Mandarin solidly displaces money as the language of opportunity on Wall Street.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After a Rough Quarter, Goldman Faces Questions on Strategy", "Date": "2016-04-19", "News": "Supported byGoldman Sachs has been betting that it will again see around the next corner better than its competitors.As other large banks have been cutting back the trading and investing businesses that have long defined Wall Street, Goldman has fearlessly stuck to its guns.But after Goldman on Tuesday delivered the worst first-quarter results of any major bank \u2014 the latest of many challenging quarters \u2014 the firm faced some tough questions about whether a raft of changes in regulations and financial markets might be making its focus on Wall Street businesses the wrong bet.\u201cWhen does Goldman say the time has come for transformational change \u2014 that we must do something radically different because we\u2019re getting nowhere?\u201d the banking analyst Richard X. Bove, asked Goldman executives on a conference call after the company announced its financial results for the first three months of the year.Goldman has already taken several steps to recalibrate its mixture of businesses. Most significantly, it has been looking at offering banking services to ordinary Americans, moving beyond its traditional business serving big companies.None of the new businesses, however, have come close to outweighing the old revenues that Goldman has lost.The first-quarter financial results from all the big banks have underscored the challenges facing the financial industry as it grapples with volatile markets and a wide array of new regulations that raise the cost of doing business.Goldman is in a particularly difficult situation. It has again become a target during this election season, with the Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders using the bank as a symbol of Wall Street greed.At the same time, its reliance on trading and underwriting has made it more vulnerable than other big American banks to the new regulations and volatile markets. On Tuesday, the bank reported the lowest first-quarter profit and revenue since 2004, with declines across almost all of the bank\u2019s major business lines.The firm earned $1.1 billion, or $2.68 a share, down 55 percent from the same period a year earlier. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had been expecting earnings of $2.45 a share. Some analysts said that including certain one-time items, Goldman did worse than they expected.Goldman\u2019s chief financial officer, Harvey Schwartz, defended the company\u2019s approach \u2014 and suggested that analysts not focus too much on one quarter, particularly with the slide in the price of oil and the unstable outlook for interest rates.But Mr. Schwartz also argued that the bank had been cutting employees and expenses to deal with the difficult environment.\u201cThis has been \u2014 and I admit it \u2013 this has been a tough period,\u201d Mr. Schwartz said on Tuesday. \u201cBut we have a long history of managing our business across the cycle.\u201dInvestors appeared to give Goldman the benefit of the doubt on Tuesday. The bank\u2019s stock ended the day up 2.3 percent. But it is still down 25 percent from a high reached last summer, and is far from the peaks reached before the financial crisis.Goldman has developed a reputation for making smart moves ahead of its competitors. After the financial crisis, for instance, when bond trading was hot, Goldman made cuts to its operation, correctly anticipating that the good times would not last.More recently, though, Goldman has been betting that there would be a revival in the fixed income markets where bonds are traded, even as rivals have cut back.So far, the situation in the fixed income markets has only grown worse for Goldman. In the latest quarter, revenue from fixed income trading fell 48 percent from the same quarter a year earlier.The company\u2019s equities trading desks, where stocks are traded, have been a bright spot over the last year. But revenue there also fell 58 percent in the first quarter.Goldman has now bowed to the challenging environment, later than most of its rivals, by making significant cuts to its fixed income unit.Goldman is also laying the groundwork to cut salaries and bonuses across the firm in 2016. The firm slashed the amount put aside for compensation and by 40 percent in the first quarter.It is shaping up to be another grim year for the nation\u2019s biggest banks. They were hit hard by a bad environment for trading and deal-making.Mr. Schwartz hailed the bank\u2019s success in cutting costs, which has helped the bank remain profitable. But lowering salaries could ultimately make it hard to continue competing for the smartest young recruits from top American colleges and graduate schools \u2014 perhaps the most frequently cited factor behind Goldman\u2019s success.This week, analysts and investors expressed an even more basic concern that the business lines where Goldman is focused are likely to be much less profitable moving forward because of the array of new regulations phased in since the passage of the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul legislation.\u201cHave you considered the fact that there might not be any relief on the regulatory side in the context of your longer-term strategy for the business?\u201d Steven Chubak, a bank analyst with Nomura Securities, asked Mr. Schwartz on Tuesday.Mike Mayo, an analyst at CLSA, put it even more bluntly: \u201cYou danced pretty well the last three to four years without revenue growth. But it seems like you\u2019re getting to the end of what you can do.\u201dIn response, Mr. Schwartz cautioned that the worst problems in the first quarter came in the first two months of the year, and that the outlook had improved since then, which could improve results in the rest of the year. And he pointed to the moves to expand its retail business.Still, Mr. Bove chastised Goldman for not doing more.\u201cWhen do you get control of your destiny as opposed to sitting here for nine years, letting the world control who you are and what you\u2019re doing?\u201d he said on Tuesday morning.\u201cI certainly wouldn\u2019t agree with your statement that we\u2019re sitting here waiting for the world to do what it does,\u201d Mr. Schwartz countered.\u201cIf we felt there was a client segment or a transaction we could do that would benefit our shareholders and we could deliver to those clients, we would do it,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re open-minded.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Investors Should Get More I.P.O. Data Earlier, British Regulator Says", "Date": "2016-04-13", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Britain\u2019s markets regulator said on Wednesday that investors should have more information available to them earlier in the initial public offering process. The call came as the regulator considers whether to revamp the system for public listings of stocks in Britain.Because of a blackout period of up to two weeks imposed by the underwriters, investors often receive access to an initial prospectus only within two weeks of a company\u2019s I.P.O., the authority found, and do not receive a final, approved prospectus until the first day of trading.By comparison, the United States only allows the prospectus, which is updated throughout the process, to be used to market an offering, the British regulator said.The regulator also suggested that research analysts not connected to the underwriters be given access to a company\u2019s management as part of the process. Of 169 transactions examined by the agency, only one included research not connected with the underwriters being published during the I.P.O. process.The proposed changes come as London is becoming an increasingly popular market for public listings.The Financial Conduct Authority said that it would seek public input on possible changes through July 13, and that it would issue a further consultation paper if it decides to pursue any specific policy changes.A vast majority of I.P.O.s in Britain are carried out through private placements to institutional investors, such as insurance companies and pension funds, with a few offerings including the sale of a small percentage of shares to retail investors.From 2011 to 2015, 460 companies raised 53 billion pounds, or about $76 billion at current exchange rates, through new listings on the London Stock Exchange, according to the regulator. That included 199 I.P.O.s last year.During the typical I.P.O. process in Britain, connected research is published around the same time a company publicly announces its intention to pursue an offering, the Financial Conduct Authority said.Next comes a 10- to 14-day blackout period, followed by the circulation of the initial prospectus and price range to a select group of institutional investors, the regulator said.Company management teams conduct roadshows with investors, and a book of potential investors is then put together in the two weeks that precede the I.P.O., with the final, approved prospectus published on the first day of trading, the Financial Conduct Authority said.Under a series of possible models cited by the Financial Conduct Authority on Wednesday, an approved prospectus containing no price information \u2014 similar to what is done in the United States \u2014 would be circulated first.That would most likely be followed by a blackout period of up to seven days after the initial prospectus is circulated, before connected research could be distributed, the regulator said.The Financial Conduct Authority also suggested the possibility of giving unconnected analysts access to management, perhaps at the same time that analysts connected with the underwriters meet with the company early in the process.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Harrowing Trip for Chinese Trawler Before Bump in Territorial Tensions", "Date": "2016-04-09", "News": "Supported byBEIHAI, China \u2014 In the darkness of the tropical waters of the South China Sea, the shabby, blue-hulled Chinese fishing trawler edged closer to what was almost certain arrest for Zhang Deren, the boat\u2019s engineer. He was more than 1,000 miles from his home here in southern China.Earlier that day, the Indonesian maritime police had boarded his boat, accusing the crew of fishing illegally in Indonesian waters. After the rest of the crew was ordered onto the police vessel, the Indonesians instructed Mr. Zhang, a 53-year-old with a weather-beaten face, to follow in the trawler.At 2 a.m., after a 12-hour journey to the Indonesian shore, help suddenly arrived. A Chinese Coast Guard vessel, as big as a naval frigate, pulled alongside Mr. Zhang\u2019s boat, then rammed it, separating it from the Indonesian escort.\u201cAt that moment, I knew I was out of trouble,\u201d Mr. Zhang said, telling his tale after a weeklong voyage back to his home port here on the Gulf of Tonkin, close to Vietnam.China also claims to have the biggest fishing fleet in the world, about one million boats, the government says. Recently, China embarked on a massive fishing boat building program, accompanied by fuel subsidies for the fishermen, and the installation of free navigational systems that help the coast guard keep track of the vessels.Southeast Asian nations are also angry that China\u2019s fishing armada, supported by its vigilant coast guard, is plying waters that offer diminishing stocks of fish.Last month, about 100 Chinese fishing boats were found by the Malaysians inside their waters in the South China Sea, accompanied by two Chinese Coast Guard vessels, the Malaysian authorities said.The coast guard is responsible for rescuing Chinese fishing vessels when they are discovered in other countries\u2019 waters, Mr. Martinson said.Most of the disputes are inside the so-called nine dashes, an area drawn by China in the 1940s that covers more than 80 percent of the South China Sea, though it is not recognized by international law.Indonesia\u2019s fisheries minister, Susi Pudjiastuti, said Indonesia felt \u201csabotaged.\u201d The Chinese boat was well inside Indonesia\u2019s 200-mile exclusive economic zone, which is recognized by international law and overlaps with the nine-dash line.The members of the Chinese fishing crew were detained on the Natuna Islands, and the most senior members, including the captain, are likely to face charges, Ms. Pudjiastuti said.The Indonesians were justified in their irritation, Mr. Martinson said. \u201cChina\u2019s claim to jurisdiction over waters within Indonesia\u2019s exclusive economic zone on the basis of the nine-dash line is preposterous,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you add the aggressive pursuit to the territorial sea and the ramming, it is very easy to understand the Indonesian anger.\u201dIn Beijing, the Foreign Ministry defended the fishing trawler, saying it was operating in \u201ctraditional Chinese fishing grounds,\u201d the phrase China often uses in reference to the nine-dash line.Back home, Mr. Zhang has been called the \u201clucky fisherman\u201d who got away.He talked about his ordeal from the docks here in Beihai, where fishing vessels that travel all over the South China Sea bring back their hauls, including stingrays, baby sharks and squid.As the noontime sun was beating down on the fishing boat, and the crew was on deck cleaning the fishing nets of debris from the sea, someone called, \u201c \u2018A gunboat is coming,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Zhang said.\u201cIt took them about 30 minutes to get near,\u201d he said. \u201cI heard two shots \u2014 \u2018pa, pa\u2019 \u2014 and the sound of their vessel knocking on our ship. Their boat was too small to crash into a large ship like ours. Soon I heard more intensified shooting.\u201dMs. Pudjiastuti, the fisheries minister, said the men on the vessel had been lightly armed.Three Indonesians in dark green camouflage and helmets boarded the trawler and told the members of the crew to squat with their hands on their heads, Mr. Zhang said. They were ordered onto the Indonesian boat, but soon he and the captain were summoned back to their vessel to turn on the engines.By that time, he said, the captain had alerted the Chinese Coast Guard of their predicament. With the three Indonesians still on board, Mr. Zhang said, he drove the boat at less than maximum speed, hoping the coast guard would rescue them before they reached Indonesia.He was sleeping when the captain yelled that the Chinese Coast Guard had arrived. \u201cThe Chinese Coast Guard vessel was huge,\u201d Mr. Zhang said. \u201cThey were more than twice our size. They announced over a loudspeaker: \u2018This is the Chinese Coast Guard.\u2019\u201dWhen the coast guard cutter rammed the trawler to free it, the Indonesian police officers who had remained aboard with Mr. Zhang ramped up the engines to try to get away.In the commotion, one of the engines almost ran out of oil, sending up clouds of white smoke. The Indonesians fled, taking the Chinese captain with them and leaving Mr. Zhang all alone to fix the engine.The Chinese Coast Guard called out to him: \u201c\u2018Can you drive the boat?\u2019 I said, \u2018So-so.\u2019\u201dMr. Zhang said the two boats had then traveled together for about a week back to Beihai.At the dock, the boat owner, Chen Jifa, said he was confident the Chinese government had the power to arrange the return of the detained crew.When asked if the trawler had been fishing in Indonesian territorial waters, Mr. Zhang said: \u201cI\u2019m not quite sure. I\u2019m only an engineer.\u201d Then he added with a laugh, \u201cBut it is probable.\u201dAn article on April 10 about a ship engineer\u2019s account of a territorial dispute in the South China Sea in which a Chinese fishing trawler was seized by Indonesia and then taken back by the Chinese Coast Guard referred incorrectly in some editions to the Natuna Islands of Indonesia, where members of the Chinese fishing crew were detained. While they are the northernmost point of Indonesia in the South China Sea, they are not the northernmost point in the country.Joe Cochrane contributed reporting from Jakarta, Indonesia.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Customers First\u2019 to Become the Law in Retirement Investing", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported byThe government move is expected to encourage a shift of retirement funds into lower-cost investments \u2014 potentially saving billions of dollars for many ordinary investors \u2014 while setting off one of the biggest upheavals in the financial services industry in decades.\u201cThe marketing material that I see from many firms is, \u2018We put our customers first,\u2019\u201d Thomas E. Perez, the secretary of labor, said in an interview. \u201cThis is no longer a marketing slogan. It\u2019s the law.\u201dMany consumers assume the individuals and firms investing their money are operating under the same sort of ethical and legal standards as a family doctor \u2014 someone who is obliged to provide the very best advice.But brokers are generally required only to recommend \u201csuitable\u201d investments, which means, for example, that they can push a more expensive mutual fund that pays a higher commission when an otherwise identical, cheaper fund would have been an equal or better alternative.The Obama administration, relying on extensive academic research, estimated that conflicts of interest embedded in the way many investment professionals do business cost Americans about $17 billion a year, leading to annual returns that are about 1 percentage point lower.The so-called conflict-of-interest rule covers only tax-advantaged retirement accounts and does not apply to most other investments. But it could lead to more sweeping changes across the financial services industry, making it harder for some smaller firms to do business and perhaps encouraging a further consolidation into larger companies better able to handle the detailed rules of compliance.It is also expected to promote a shift away from commissions for individual transactions toward a greater reliance on flat annual fees for managing accounts, a move that would not benefit all investors equally.Critics of the rule in its earlier proposed form said they were still reviewing the specific details of the new regulations to determine its effect on investors.Jules Gaudreau, president of the National Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors, whose members include insurance agents and brokers, said the organization was pleased that the Labor Department had incorporated some of the changes it suggested.But he said his members still had reservations. \u201cWe remain concerned,\u201d Mr. Gaudreau said, \u201cthat the costs to implement such a complex rule will result in higher costs and reduced access to advice, service and products for retirement savers.\u201d\u201cWe heard the concerns. We listened. We acted,\u201d Secretary Perez said. \u201cAnd I think we improved the rule as a result.\u2019\u2019Generally speaking, the new rules \u2014 six years in the making \u2014 require a broader group of professionals to act as \u201cfiduciaries,\u201d the legal term for putting customers\u2019 interests first. They cannot accept compensation or payments that would create a conflict unless they qualify for an exemption that ensures the customer is protected.If brokers want to receive certain types of compensation that can pose a conflict, they will be required to offer an enforceable contract that promises to put the customer\u2019s interests first.The firms must also disclose any conflicts and direct consumers to a website that describes how they make money. Firms can charge only \u201creasonable compensation,\u201d and they cannot offer advisers financial incentives to act in a way that would hurt investors.In using the contract, brokers will still be permitted to charge commissions and engage in a practice known as revenue sharing, which allows a mutual fund company, for example, to share a slice of its revenue with the brokerage firm selling the fund. Companies that pay more, for example, may secure a spot on the firm\u2019s list of recommended funds.The rules also aim to protect investors when they roll over money from a 401(k) retirement plan to an I.R.A. Right now, because the recommendation provided is considered \u201cone-time\u201d advice, brokers do not necessarily have to act in the investor\u2019s best interest.There are piles of money at stake: Individual retirement accounts held $7.3 trillion at the end of 2015, according to the Investment Company Institute, while 401(k)-type plans had $6.7 trillion \u2014 money that may eventually be rolled over into I.R.A.s.Mr. Perez said that government rule makers had made several changes to their last proposal in an effort to respond to criticism and avoid creating a bias toward certain investment products. He said advisers would not be obliged to sell lowest-cost products if a more expensive product like a variable annuity made sense for a particular individual\u2019s situation.The industry was also concerned that simply providing educational information could set off the rule; regulators said that education would not be considered advice until a broker made a specific recommendation.Wall Street was worried that brokers would need to provide a contract even before they began talking with a potential client. Regulators said the contract can be signed at the same time as other account-opening documents, though any advice given before the signing must still be in the customer\u2019s best interest.The new rules also simplify disclosures. For example, firms will no longer be required to disclose performance projections for one, five- and 10-year periods.There are also allowances for small 401(k) plans. Under the final rules, advisers who provide advice to small businesses that sponsor 401(k) plans, or plans with less than $50 million, as well as advice to participants, can qualify for an exemption from the strictest rules.Consumer advocates and lawyers say that a robust fiduciary rule will help thwart more unscrupulous brokers, like the one encountered by Russell Kazda, a retired mechanic, and his wife, Christine, a fourth-grade teacher in Illinois.Their advisers took $172,000 of the Kazdas\u2019 I.R.A. savings and put it in illiquid real estate investment trusts and later invested money in an options strategy. They ended up losing about $125,000, which prompted the Kazdas to sue the advisers.\u201cI could have had my fourth graders do it and they would\u2019ve done a better job,\u201d Mrs. Kazda said.Andrew Stoltmann, a securities lawyer in Chicago who represented the Kazdas, applauded the changes.\u201cBy imposing a fiduciary duty standard, this will cause the brokerage firms to self-police,\u201d he said, protecting most people from often unsuitable investments like \u201cnontraded REITs, variable annuities in I.R.A.s and active trading of stocks and options.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Brexit\u2019 Vote Has Investment Experts Advising Caution in Europe", "Date": "2016-04-09", "News": "Supported byThe British are going! Maybe.A referendum to determine whether Britain will leave the European Union has been set for June 23. Until voters decide whether they would rather be in or out, investors will have to decide whether to be in or out of assets in Britain and other parts of Europe.Neither decision will be easy. The referendum outcome is a tossup in polls, and analysts are divided on whether the country would be better off in or out of the 28-nation bloc.As for the markets, British stocks have fallen in the last year, like those in many countries, and the currency, the pound, has declined against the dollar and euro. But both have been stable since Prime Minister David Cameron announced the referendum date in late February.The European Union probably could carry on without Greece, as some members of European officialdom made clear to the Greeks during negotiations on their debt. Whether the union would do as well without Britain is more questionable.It\u2019s difficult for investors in international stocks and bonds to prepare for the referendum because professionals have diverging opinions on the economic and political fallout of a pro-Brexit vote. Mr. Muldoon foresees a long, fairly benign aftermath in which \u201cthe E.U. and U.K. would negotiate favorable trade deals.\u201d\u201cThe \u2018out\u2019 people say there would be a smooth transition,\u201d he said, \u201cbut despite a lot of history together, I could see a difficult situation with pain and losses on both sides.\u201dA report by the French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale predicted that a Brexit would take 0.5 percent to 1 percent a year off British economic growth for 10 years and result in an annual drop in exports of 2.5 percent. Britain\u2019s economy grew 2.2 percent last year.\u201cIt would be in the mutual interest of the U.K. and the rest of the E.U. to strike a reasonable second-best solution which would maintain access to much of the single market,\u201d the report said. \u201cBut one should not forget the need to renegotiate the U.K.\u2019s trade relationships with the major non-European countries, as well, in particular the U.S. and China. That could be a long and painful process, with the balance of power being tilted against the U.K.\u201dThat prospect has made a further decline in the pound a rare Brexit forecast that is nearly universally held. A vote in favor of leaving the European Union would drive the pound below $1.30, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale predicted, compared with $1.44 on March 31. It also would propel a decline in the euro to less than $1 from about $1.14, the bank said.A soft pound would depress the dollar value of British assets, but it may be possible to more than recoup the losses in certain types of stocks. Mr. Muldoon predicted that the falling pound \u201cwould act as a stabilizer to any economic deterioration.\u201d Industries like tourism would improve as the weak currency drew visitors to Britain who otherwise might have traveled to the Continent, he said.Mr. Maxwell, though wary, pointed out that companies in the blue-chip FTSE 100 index derive 75 percent or more of their earnings from outside Britain. That would cushion the blow from a plunging pound. Shares of companies that could benefit from it by producing goods at home and selling them abroad might be worth an investment.\u201cOwning things with U.K. costs and foreign revenues is good, but there are not many of those,\u201d he said, offering the beverage maker Diageo as one example.For all their concerns about the British economy, the strategists at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale have a positive outlook over all for British stocks thanks to the expected further declines in the currency. Yet they caution that British banks would be especially hard-hit in a Brexit because competing financial centers on the Continent would take over many of their activities.Whatever their commercial prospects, Mr. Muldoon finds bank stocks worth a bet. They have been sold heavily, taking their prices to low multiples of earnings, he said.Another casualty of a Brexit, in the view of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, would be British bonds; their yields, the bank predicts, would rise relative to those of core European countries like Germany. Not that it would be much consolation to owners of British bonds, but Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale envisions yield spreads widening even further for bonds in the Continental European periphery, places like Italy and Spain with persistently shaky economies.The potential fragility of much of Europe recalls that apocryphal weather report from the 1930s: \u201cFog in channel, Continent cut off.\u201d The rest of Europe may need Britain more than Britain needs it.\u201cPeople would have more confidence in the U.K. doing the right thing in the medium term than Italy or Spain\u201d if the European Union began to fracture, Mr. Muldoon said. \u201cThe great thing about the U.K. is that it\u2019s a proper economy, with diversified sources of industry. The market structure is very strong, and corporations are very shareholder-friendly. For all of Europe, the U.K. is closest to the American model of capitalism.\u201dBritain may decide that it needs the European Union enough to want to stay put. If the vote goes that way, \u201cWe\u2019d expect markets to calm down quite quickly,\u201d Mr. Zahn said. \u201cWe\u2019d also expect investments that had sold off could subsequently rally, and there could likely be some good opportunities to realize value.\u201dWith so much riding on an outcome so much in doubt, any investment decision involving Britain, Europe and even points beyond should be made with great care. If the British do decide that they\u2019re going, \u201cthis will be negative for growth around the world,\u201d Mr. Muldoon warned, and \u201cwe\u2019re going to have volatility leading up to June 23. Given the uncertainty, you might want to invest elsewhere.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Robber Baron Recessions", "Date": "2016-04-18", "News": "Supported byBut why doesn\u2019t Verizon want to invest? Probably because it doesn\u2019t have to: many customers have no place else to go, so the company can treat its broadband business as a cash cow, with no need to spend money on providing better service (or, speaking from personal experience, on maintaining existing service).The argument begins with a seeming paradox about overall corporate behavior. You see, profits are at near-record highs, thanks to a substantial decline in the percentage of G.D.P. going to workers. You might think that these high profits imply high rates of return to investment. But corporations themselves clearly don\u2019t see it that way: their investment in plant, equipment, and technology (as opposed to mergers and acquisitions) hasn\u2019t taken off, even though they can raise money, whether by issuing bonds or by selling stocks, more cheaply than ever before.How can this paradox be resolved? Well, suppose that those high corporate profits don\u2019t represent returns on investment, but instead mainly reflect growing monopoly power. In that case many corporations would be in the position I just described: able to milk their businesses for cash, but with little reason to spend money on expanding capacity or improving service. The result would be what we see: an economy with high profits but low investment, even in the face of very low interest rates and high stock prices.The obvious next question is why competition has declined. The answer can be summed up in two words: Ronald Reagan.True, there was a limited revival of anti-monopoly efforts during the Clinton years, but these went away again under George W. Bush. The result was an economy with far too much concentration of economic power. And the Obama administration \u2014 preoccupied with the aftermath of financial crisis and the struggle with bitterly hostile Republicans \u2014 has only recently been in a position to grapple with competition policy.For we aren\u2019t just living in a second Gilded Age, we\u2019re also living in a second robber baron era. And only one party seems bothered by either of those observations.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Looking for Signs of Life in Emerging Markets", "Date": "2016-04-09", "News": "Supported byFor years, many investors have been pining for a rebound in emerging-market stocks, only to be frustrated by the slide in commodity prices, which still drive many developing economies.The situation appeared to improve in the first quarter.After surviving another scare in January, crude oil prices rebounded about 40 percent, pulling up other commodities and emerging-market equities. Since Jan. 20, shares of companies based in rapidly growing economies like Brazil, the Philippines and Thailand have soared more than 20 percent, double the gains of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index of domestic equities during that time.Is the bear market in commodities and emerging-market stocks coming to an end?Not quite.Most economists say it could take years before a commodity \u201csupercycle,\u201d like the one that drove emerging-market stocks in the early 2000s, kicks in. Even if China, the world\u2019s biggest consumer of industrial commodities, were to regain momentum \u2014 a big if \u2014 the global economy would still require years to work through excess capacity, many market strategists say.Although commodities continue to be a drag, there are signs of subtle changes that make emerging-market stocks more appealing \u2014 at least more so than a year ago.\u201cComing into the year, there was this attitude: \u2018Why take on additional volatility with emerging-market stocks when you can get better returns for less volatility in the developed world?\u2019\u201d said Laurence Taylor, a portfolio specialist who works with global equities at T. Rowe Price.As it turned out, concerns about the slowing economy hit the developed markets harder than the developing world, as European stock funds lost 3.4 percent in the quarter versus a 4 percent average gain for diversified emerging market funds.\u201cThat, perhaps, would be a catalyst for people to reassess their emerging-world thesis,\u201d Mr. Taylor said.So too would the surprising advances seen in many of the most worrisome economies \u2014 the so-called fragile five nations of Turkey, India, Indonesia, South Africa and Brazil \u2014 which have improved their budget deficits, balance of trade and inflation outlook, he added.And the Federal Reserve\u2019s less aggressive stance on interest rates this year may reduce a major headwind for the emerging markets. At the end of last year, expectations were that the Fed would lift short-term interest rates four times in 2016, even as central banks abroad were still trying to stimulate growth.Because higher rates curb risk-taking and strengthen the dollar, this was expected to have a negative effect on emerging-market shares.\u201cThe change in tone represents more synchronicity with central banks in Japan, Europe and around the world,\u201d said Michael Kass, manager of the Baron Emerging Markets fund.That could represent an opportunity in the developing world, money managers say, though this risky asset would merit caution.Even assuming that emerging-market stocks will go back to being one of the best-performing asset classes, as was the case a decade ago, the countries that led the past rally might not lead a resurgence.Consider that the so-called BRIC countries \u2014 Brazil, Russia, India and China, which dominated emerging market funds a decade ago \u2014 gained more than 770 percent from 1999 through 2007. That\u2019s more than double the returns for other emerging-market stocks. Yet since the financial crisis of 2008, BRIC stocks have lost a third of their value while the rest of the emerging markets have held their ground.Then there is a valuation problem. \u201cYou can put emerging-markets stocks into a couple of buckets,\u201d said Jonas M. Krumplys, co-manager of the Ivy Emerging Markets Equity fund. In one bucket are the commodity-driven economies of Latin America and Russia. In the other bucket are stocks based in economies that are increasingly being driven by domestic growth and rising consumer spending. This includes markets like India, Indonesia, Mexico and the Philippines.The problem is, stocks in the latter bucket \u2014 which investors favor \u2014 are trading at price-to-earnings ratios that are typically 50 percent or greater than shares based in the commodity bucket.\u201cIn the aggregate, the emerging markets look cheap relative to history,\u201d said Scott Crawshaw, co-manager of the Harding Loevner Emerging Markets Portfolio fund. \u201cBut higher-quality areas of the market are trading at very different valuations to those stocks that are more caught up in the commodities downdraft.\u201dSome money managers say they are being very selective.Within that domestic growth-oriented bucket, for instance, \u201cyou\u2019re trying to find the gems left behind,\u201d said Charles Wilson, co-manager of the Thornburg Developing World fund.An example, he said, is Kweichow Moutai, a leading spirits maker, which produces a major brand of baijiu, a distilled Chinese liquor.\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most well-known brands in general in China,\u201d Mr. Wilson said. He notes that the company trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of just 15, based on this year\u2019s estimated profits. \u201cThat\u2019s five or six points cheaper compared to its European liquor peers,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it has a 2.5 percent dividend yield.\u201dMr. Kass at Baron has also been looking for companies with domestic growth potential that are trading at attractive prices.He said he had been focusing on growth companies that were affected by \u2014 but not directly participating in \u2014 the commodities business.These are companies like BM&F Bovespa, the Brazilian stock and derivatives exchange. Because equity-trading volumes are affected by the health of Brazil\u2019s commodity-driven economy, shares sank nearly 18 percent from November to January. But Mr. Kass said the company has a good balance sheet and attractive long-term growth prospects.And since late January, the stock has soared more than 50 percent.Arjun Divecha, who oversees emerging market equities at the asset management firm GMO, notes that even within faster-growing sectors in the developing world, like technology, there are still pockets of attractively priced stocks.\u201cChinese tech is all the Internet stuff, which is expensive,\u201d Mr. Divecha said. \u201cTaiwanese tech is filled with middlemen \u2014 suppliers who make parts and are cheaper.\u201dAn example is Hon Hai Precision Industry, also known as Foxconn, which manufactures component parts for information technology and wireless communications companies. Earnings per share at the company, based in Taipei, have climbed 15 percent a year for the last four years. Yet the stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of just 9, based on forecast profits.Yet another strategy is to seek out overlooked countries \u2014 and companies benefiting from domestic growth, rather than exports.For example, investors have identified plenty of economies helped by low commodity prices because those nations are net buyers of raw materials. This includes places like India and the Philippines.Yet also in that group is Thailand, which has been plagued by political instability, enduring a dozen coups since 1932 \u2014 the most recent one in 2014.\u201cWhen you think of a place like Thailand, you think, \u2018Oh man, another military coup,\u2019\u201d said Scott Klimo, co-manager of the Amana Developing World fund. \u201cBut the fact is, the country has been pretty well managed from a macro perspective.\u201dOne of his fund\u2019s top holdings is Bangkok Dusit Medical Services, which operates hospitals in Thailand. Mr. Klimo said that roughly 75 percent of the company\u2019s business was done with Thai residents, which means it reflects the health of the Thai economy, not global trade.At the same time, he said, \u201cHousehold spending on health care is a fraction of what it is in other economies.\u201d Such spending will increase as more families enter the middle class.Ultimately, that kind of demographic advantage has been fueling the developing-market theme for decades. And strategists say it will support an eventual rebound in emerging-market stocks, whenever that comes to pass.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Plans New Stock Class to Solidify Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Control", "Date": "2016-04-27", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Mark Zuckerberg nurtured Facebook from a dorm room idea into the world\u2019s biggest social network. Now the company is taking steps to ensure its founder remains in charge.Mr. Zuckerberg on Wednesday cited the Silicon Valley mantra of founders in explaining the new class of stock, calling Facebook a \u201cfounder-led company.\u201d In a conference call, he added, \u201cFacebook has been built on a series of bold moves. When I look out on the future, I see more bold moves ahead of us, not behind us.\u201dFacebook\u2019s shares, which are up more than 33 percent over the past year, soared 9 percent in after-hours trading.The new C shares effectively allow Mr. Zuckerberg to maintain 60 percent of voting power while still giving away large amounts of stock. Under the proposal, all holders of Facebook stock will get two C shares for each A or B share that they own. Importantly, the C shares come with no voting power. Holders of A shares are entitled to one vote per share, while holder of B shares have 10 votes a share.That means Mr. Zuckerberg, as the majority owner of Facebook shares, will obtain a large amount C shares that he can then donate without diluting his voting power in the company.\u201cIt is a rational, if somewhat eyebrow-raising way, for founders to distribute wealth without giving up operating control of the company,\u201d said Lise Buyer, founder of the Class V Group, which advises start-ups on initial public offerings. \u201cThis structure will continue to allow Facebook to make decisions that may not always look great in the short term, but may pay off for investors over time.\u201dFacebook\u2019s C shares may trade at a slight discount to A shares, which would still have one vote. Most investors currently hold A shares, which only have about a quarter of the overall shareholders\u2019 voting power, so they may not be forgoing much if they choose to sell their A shares versus their C shares.\u201cIt\u2019s almost like voting Republican in Massachusetts \u2014 you can do it, but it won\u2019t affect the outcome,\u201d said Rick Kline, a partner in the technology and capital markets practice of law firm Goodwin Procter.Investors getting new C shares will not gain economically because the same proportion of new stock will be given to all holders.Facebook, in contrast, has figured out how to wring billions of dollars from its members on mobile devices and other platforms, making the company\u2019s revenue-generation machine unstoppable.And while growth in new users on Facebook has slowed in recent years, the total is still getting larger. Facebook said 1.65 billion people visited the site on a monthly basis in the first quarter, up from 1.44 billion a year earlier. More than 1.5 billion people are monthly mobile-only users, up from 1.25 billion a year ago.Facebook\u2019s other big bets like WhatsApp, the messaging service, and Oculus, its virtual reality play, have yet to pay off with immense new revenue streams. But Facebook is comfortable gathering a critical mass of users \u2014 nearly a billion in WhatsApp\u2019s case \u2014 and then introducing advertising later on when it makes more sense.\u201cTo me, this is like Google 10 years ago,\u201d said Mark Mahaney, an Internet analyst at RBC Capital. \u201cThey really had such momentum, and they\u2019re proving how valuable they are to both advertisers and consumers.\u201dMike Isaac reported from San Francisco and Leslie Picker from New York.

{"Headline": "New Financial Investment Rules May Aid Robo Advisers", "Date": "2016-04-07", "News": "Supported byThe new rules, announced on Wednesday, are expected to encourage a rush of retirement savings money to low-cost investments, something the robo advisers claim as their hallmark.The rules may also hasten formal match-ups between traditional banks and brokerage firms and the financial technology firms that have built robo-investing platforms.On Thursday, the robo-firm SigFig Wealth Management, which is based in San Francisco, will announce what it says will be its first agreement with a bank to offer its digital investment service to the bank\u2019s customers. The agreement, with the $3.2 billion Cambridge Savings Bank outside Boston, will make SigFig\u2019s robo-advice offering available to the bank\u2019s depositors through the Cambridge\u2019s online banking services.SigFig\u2019s chief executive and one of its founders, Mike Sha, says the firm will have more agreements with even larger banks in the near future as it shifts its business strategy from bringing robo-advice directly to consumers to a model that works with other financial providers.\u201cI think it\u2019s part of a broader trend where banks are partnering more and more with fintech firms to create faster innovation,\u201d he said in an interview.Earlier this week, the Detroit auto lender Ally Financial announced its plans to buy the online brokerage firm the TradeKing Group, which has built its own robo-advising operation.In January, BBVA Compass, the American division of the Spanish banking giant, announced that it had brought on the robo-firm FutureAdvisor to offer its banking customers digital investing services. FutureAdvisor was acquired by the large asset manager BlackRock last year.Robo-advisers use sophisticated technology and digital platforms that sort customers by their investment and risk preferences into baskets of low-cost exchange traded funds. Some, including SigFig, make advisers available online or by phone, while others are purely automated.They are shaking up the wealth management industry with significantly lower account management fees, with the potential to draw in much larger groups of investors who don\u2019t have enough money to qualify for high-end brokerage services.As banks build up their wealth management divisions, many have talked about developing robo-advising businesses. Bank of America\u2019s Merrill Lynch is expected to introduce an offering in the coming months, and executives from Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo have talked about developing or acquiring the capability.In a twist, last year, JPMorgan Chase said it would offer retail investors a chance to buy into initial public offerings of stock on which it acts as lead adviser through the digital brokerage firm Motif Investing, for as little as $250 an order. The way Wall Street typically works, access to a bank\u2019s I.P.O. deals is restricted to the wealthiest or best customers.Cambridge Savings Bank is calling its SigFig offering Connect Invest. It is available for bank customers with a minimum of $2,000 to invest.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "When Feelings of Comfort Trump Spreadsheet Math", "Date": "2016-04-04", "News": "Supported bySketch Guy\u201cCarl,\u201d my friend told me, in a heated moment of financial debate, \u201cYou need a new truck like you need a bullet in the head.\u201dI fired something back about how off base she was, how it would be a sound purchase, and who was she to say anyway?We went back and forth. It was very unproductive, and we let our tempers get the better of us before we finally walked away to cool off.With the benefit of some time and space, however, we figured out that it wasn\u2019t so much that she was wrong. And it wasn\u2019t so much that I was wrong. What we argued about boiled down to a matter of personal preference.Truth is a pretty rare thing in personal finance. More often than not, what we call truth is simply a state of mind or an opinion. Even when the math points at what seems to obvious truth, feelings can get in the way.For instance, take the common advice from some investment professionals to borrow as much as you can for your house at the lowest possible interest rate for the longest length of time. Then, take every extra dollar you have and invest it in the stock market instead of paying down your mortgage.The sales pitch goes like this. The overall stock market earns roughly 10 percent annually over long periods if you reinvest the dividends and don\u2019t trade. Let\u2019s say your mortgage only costs you around 4 percent. As long as you stick with your investment plan for the 30-year term of your mortgage, you\u2019ll end up with more money in your pocket than if you just paid off your home as quickly as possible.If that\u2019s true though, why have I been to way more mortgage-burning parties than portfolio celebrations? For many people, the cognitive comfort of having the home paid off as soon as possible is worth it \u2014 even if the spreadsheet says otherwise. There is security in being free of their largest debt, and that good feeling has real value.And before you jump on the rationalist bandwagon and criticize emotion-driven, illogical behavior, ask yourself a simple question: What is money for? In the end, isn\u2019t the point of money to make us feel more comfortable, more secure, more at ease and happier? If so, it may not make a lot of sense for us to try to talk our friends (or ourselves) out of mathematically incorrect behavior.We tend to forget that money is about feelings, and feelings don\u2019t always fit neatly into the \u201ctruth.\u201d So the next time you find yourself in a heated debate about money, feeling like a crusader for truth, put the sword down and remind yourself that what you\u2019re debating is probably not a matter of right or wrong, but one of personal preference.Take a step back, breathe and try again. But this time, leave the truth out of it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Calpers Rethinking Policy Banning Investment in Tobacco Stocks", "Date": "2016-04-05", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsCalpers is learning that social responsibility can have a cost.The $290 billion California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System, or Calpers, may reinvest in tobacco stocks after a report found that exiting the sector cost it $3 billion in potential investment gains over 15 years. There\u2019s more to the idea than higher returns, though. Engaging financially with controversial companies can be a better way to effect change.Getting rid of any stake in the tobacco industry looked like the right thing to do back in 2001. It also seemed a smart investment move: The share prices of cigarette manufacturers were listless, and the sector\u2019s prospects looked grim. A wave of health-related litigation was cresting, and it would ultimately cost the industry billions of dollars.Tobacco groups have been adept at managing decline, however. Aggressive cost-cutting, overseas growth and higher prices have helped the likes of Altria and Reynolds American increase their stock prices some 400 percent \u2013 including reinvested dividends \u2013 since Calpers kicked the habit, according to Thomson Reuters data. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index returned just 60 percent over the same period.The cost of lost opportunity is all the more painful given the pension fund\u2019s recent lackluster performance. Calpers generated a mere 2.4 percent return in the fiscal year ended last June, far short of its 7.5 percent target.That highlights how hard it can be to square the desire to do good with the duty to serve clients\u2019 best interests. There are other reasons, however, for fund managers to rethink policies banning investments in tobacco makers, gun manufacturers, fossil-fuel companies and the like.Divestment just isn\u2019t very effective. For every socially minded seller, there\u2019s usually a buyer willing to put aside scruples and gain the influence that can come with a financial stake. As a result, companies in suspect industries may feel free to resist calls for reform.Calpers is considering changes to its divestment policies across the board, and has not yet made any final decisions. It seems, though, to have realized that staying invested is often a good way to maximize both social and financial gains.Advertisement"}

But new clusters are growing in a third of the country\u2019s provinces, and cases have turned up in Kenya and the Democratic Republic of Congo, and in China.
