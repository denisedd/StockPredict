{"Headline": "A Mindful Path to Environmental Progress in a Noisy Media Environment", "Date": "2016-04-22", "News": "Below you can read a recent conversation I had with Siegel about communication with the planet in mind in a time of information overload.How are all of these new ways we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re communicating with each other changing not only our relationships with each other, but with our whole environment and the planet?How does this relate to the environment and our relationship with the planet? I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if there are any studies on that, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s certainly an interesting question, because the further away we get from feeling what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on inside of ourselves, the further away we get also from feeling like this home we live in is real. It starts to feel like more of like an artificial thing, almost a computer graphic that we live in.When you bring people out into nature, they start experiencing awe. And through the experience of awe, we connect with other people and the world around us. So, if awe is not happening in the digital world that would decrease our ability to reach out to other people and the natural world.But then we went to an area where there were some herons nesting in the mangroves, deep inside the shrubbery. I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see them at all, but he had the capacity to see them. He zoomed in and got this really cool moment of seeing these baby herons. I posted it on YouTube and put it on my blog.You could hear his voice when he zoomed in and caught the image of the bird. It was a great moment, where you could hear his breath. He had that awe moment you were just talking about. But he was then sharing it digitally. He told the story in a way that was facilitated by digital media.If those stories can evoke this sense of connecting to something larger than our personal, separate selves, I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just fantastic. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be the challenge, I think, for all of us in the immediate future.I remember once talking to a photographer who would go out to these wild places, like the North Pole. I asked him, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat are you feeling when you do that? Not just what it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like to be on the North Pole, but what is your drive?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get the next generation to fall in love with our planet, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no way that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to take any kind of time to protect it, because you only protect something you love.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why he put together his photographs. When I think about the Dot Earth work you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing, Andrew, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like inviting people to fall in love with our world.Yes, but in a world with limited resources\u00e2\u0080\u0094or in countries with limited resources\u00e2\u0080\u0094what can we do? Especially in areas where you have the high numbers of educated youth, but not a lot of opportunity, what tools or mechanisms or practices might be beneficial?Well, if we start with the premise that you really need to be in love with what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to protect, then it needs to be a top priority to get adolescents in nature more. Otherwise they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to think, for example, that food actually is created in a supermarket. And so they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, my market\u00e2\u0080\u0099s okay.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It may seem simple, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the hidden unknown of all of this, that kids are just not feeling like the planet is really something that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s real. So that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the first layer of this.Another layer is that a lot of us feel a sense of helplessness. And then all you do is go through this emotional set of reactions, which are studied in brain scanners. If you feel helpless, then all you do is you go, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, this feeling is really terrible. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing I can do about it, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to change my focus of attention and not pay attention to this thing that makes me feel so helpless. Let me just go get a beer and go to watch TV and forget about this stuff.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a pathway that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s understandable but preventable.Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another aspect of what you were just laying out: In the new media environment we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in\u00e2\u0080\u0094which is no longer the Walter Cronkite, communitarian, authoritative giver of information\u00e2\u0080\u0094but this sort of landscape where if you put in the words \u00e2\u0080\u009cglobal warming\u00e2\u0080\u009d in Google News, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find everything from \u00e2\u0080\u009cit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a hoax\u00e2\u0080\u009d to \u00e2\u0080\u009cit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the end of the world.\u00e2\u0080\u009dOne thing I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been trying to teach students at Pace University, is some methods for navigating so you become, to some extent, your own authority. Or at least you can find, amid all that noise, where reality lies. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of a first step towards having the capacity to be mindful and compassionate and instructive.To do this we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to need to have inner reflection to understand the way the mind works. This will allow us to respond to the call of the day, which is how to keep yourself aware and then also allow yourself to feel the equanimity so that you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t burn out.One exercise I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been doing with my students in this course I teach\u00e2\u0080\u0094it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s basically a course in online communication\u00e2\u0080\u0094is to have them think about how they knew something that day. How did it get into their consciousness? Trace it back. Where did this factoid come from?This is more about news information than about some of the things you were just talking about feeling. But I think it gets people into the mode of stopping and thinking about how they thought something. Did the Yankees win or lose? How did I learn that fact today? Where did it come from? Tracing these things back to their source is helpful. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interesting. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a way to learn how the web works. Someone tweeted something, and that was blogged by someone else, and then it goes somewhere else. You can actually trace things pretty far back if you take a few minutes. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a way to become aware of how ideas are moving around.It would be interesting to do that with a feeling the same way. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m bummed out. Where did that come from? I assume that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s partially what some of the practices you do accomplish.What we would say about that from the field I work in, interpersonal neurobiology, is that this backtracking practice you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing, is really a form of what you would call integration. Integration is how we make sense of our lives. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re linking different aspects of your life across time, different aspects of your relational life, and even different aspects of your brain together. And that linkage of differentiated parts across all those levels, not just in the brain, is called integration.Integration creates, basically, equanimity. It creates a sense of well-being. It creates all sorts of improvements in the way your physiology works.This relates to something I write about at the end of the\u00c2\u00a0Brainstorm, which is the notion of a \u00e2\u0080\u009cmwe.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mwe is the combination of an individual \u00e2\u0080\u009cme,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also equally, just differentially, a connected person. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re connected to other people, your family, your friends, your teachers, the larger human family\u00e2\u0080\u0094in fact, the family of all living beings, the whole Earth. These relational connections are part of a \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe.\u00e2\u0080\u009dTo embrace the two of them, you could say \u00e2\u0080\u009cmwe.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been so interesting about that is that it helps resolve a kind of conflict where you can think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s either one or the other. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to be one or the other. An integrated identity would be both a \u00e2\u0080\u009cme\u00e2\u0080\u009d and a \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It allows you to enjoy this body and really love the world in which you live.Kind of a hybrid approach to things. One of the things you pursued or explained when I saw you at the Garrison was something you described as the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe map.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Two aspects of that struck me as valuable to a broader sustainability discussion. One is, maybe with intentionality, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where you could see the upside of social networks online. There are social networks that are physical, of course, but the idea of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe map\u00e2\u0080\u009d seems compatible with a constructive use of social media to build that sense of you that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not within your body. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your sense of community.I think there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s untapped potential to use these tools to have a bigger potential of \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe-ness,\u00e2\u0080\u009d to make sure that ideas are shared and shaped where they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re needed most, or to build collaborative conversations. But there are so many competing uses of the same portals, such as selling stuff and saying mean things. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to know which will win out.There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s huge potential for it. If we can start to expand our conversations about what the self is, then I think people will be using all of their incredible creative potential, especially the adolescents coming up, to realize that you can find all sorts of ways of changing the relationality that we have to the planet to make it more robust for the well-being of the whole community. If you just think about this atmosphere we all share, the air we breathe, the water we drink, the soil that we share\u00e2\u0080\u0094all of these things\u00e2\u0080\u0094and realize the shared nature of our living experience.That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something you can embed right into our vocabulary in media, in blogs, in schools, what teachers learn and what parents can do. I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be a win/win situation. I think people are going to feel better, because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really more about the truth. And all of the studies show a sense of well-being comes when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really a part of something larger than your private bodily self. We just need to work collaboratively to make it happen.In the climate arena, I think for too long, people have used numbers like \u00e2\u0080\u009ctwo degrees\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009c350\u00e2\u0080\u009d to give a kind of mechanistic determinant to what needs to be done, when, in fact, when you look behind those numbers, it really is much more about choices. Our choices are moral and their functions are feelings as much as facts. So I think what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re describing sort of fits with the idea that the mechanistic, quantitative approach to problems like climate change or sustainable development generally aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to get you there alone.Absolutely. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how to say this without sounding too optimistic, but I think there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a huge potential for good out of this sense of urgency, where people put their divisions down, where we start realizing: This is the time to do it.FollowAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S. Adds China\u2019s Internet Controls to List of Trade Barriers", "Date": "2016-04-07", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 China\u2019s notorious online controls have long been criticized as censorship by human rights groups, businesses, Chinese Internet users and others.Now they have earned a new label from the American government: trade barrier.United States trade officials have for the first time added China\u2019s system of Internet filters and blocks \u2014 broadly known as the Great Firewall \u2014 to an annual list of trade impediments. The entry says that over the last decade, the limits have \u201cposed a significant burden to foreign suppliers, hurting both Internet sites themselves and users who often depend on them for business.\u201dThe move, which isn\u2019t likely to have immediate repercussions, speaks to the American government\u2019s growing concern over Chinese Internet regulations and could foreshadow more aggressive actions. It also underscores the opposing visions the world\u2019s two largest economies have on how the Internet should work and be managed.The United States argues against overt censorship and policies that block the flow of data across borders. China has been pushing its agenda that each state should have the right to closely control what websites are available within its borders.The report from the Office of the United States Trade Representative said that over the last year, the \u201coutright blocking of websites appears to have worsened,\u201d noting that eight of the top 25 most popular global sites are blocked in China.\u201cMuch of the blocking appears arbitrary; for example, a major home improvement site in the United States, which would appear wholly innocuous, is typical of sites likely swept up by the Great Firewall,\u201d the report said.Officials at China\u2019s commerce and foreign affairs ministries, as well as at its top Internet regulatory agency, did not respond to requests for comment.In recent years, China and the United States have clashed over trade in the technology industry. Last year, the Obama administration responded to lobbying from American companies against a number of Chinese laws that the companies said were devised to push them out of China. Beijing toned down language in an antiterrorism law, and it scrapped a regulation restricting what foreign hardware could be sold to Chinese banks.Still, any effort by the United States to persuade China to reduce its Internet censorship would most likely be a nonstarter. The Chinese government considers the close control of online discourse a matter of national security, largely out of concerns about the Internet\u2019s power to aid the organization of protests and the spread of dissent. As a result, Beijing has shown little flexibility on issues of censorship, and it tends to block any Internet media it feels it does not have complete control over.Scott Kennedy, deputy director of the Freeman Chair in China Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the move by the United States trade office illustrated the gulf between the attitude represented by China\u2019s heavy regulation of the Internet and the one put forward by the United States through trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\u201cChina is far less willing to separate commercial and national security concerns,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cThis difference in approach is unlikely to disappear anytime soon, no matter how much the U.S. highlights the issue.\u201dChina cites the threat of online espionage, pointing to disclosures by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, that showed American intelligence efforts to use American hardware abroad to gather information.Online filters in China create an Internet largely walled off from the rest of the world, violating the fundamental idea of the web as an open channel of communication among people across the globe. Detractors say that the practice is anticompetitive, prohibits freedom of expression and ultimately damages Chinese economic growth by limiting access to information. Supporters of China\u2019s policies say that the rules have allowed the country to foster a thriving set of domestic Internet companies.The United States trade office added China\u2019s Internet censorship policies to its annual National Trade Estimate Report, released on March 31. The insertion was reported on April 1 by Inside U.S. Trade, a trade publication.Cao Li contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s Cloud Business Lifts Its Profit to a Record", "Date": "2016-04-28", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 Amazon delivered a blowout quarter on Thursday, joining Facebook as one of the rare bright spots in a technology sector that has recently produced a string of disappointing earnings reports.Helped by its fast-growing Amazon Web Services business, the company jumped to the most profitable quarter in its nearly 22-year history.Amazon often flip-flops between showing profits and losses, depending on how aggressively it decides to plow money into big new business bets. Investors have granted the company much wider leeway to do so than other technology companies of its size often receive, because of its history of delivering outsize growth.Revenue at the company rose to $29.13 billion from $22.72 billion a year ago.\u201cThe fact that they\u2019re profitable is a big deal,\u201d said Christian Magoon, chief executive of Amplify Investments, a fund manager that counts Amazon as a top holding. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a big deal after some of the disappointing numbers from Apple and others.\u201dThe results were well above the average estimates of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters for earnings of 58 cents a share and revenue of $27.98 billion.\u201cI saw the number, and I thought, \u2018O.K., did I read this wrong?\u2019\u201d Mr. Magoon added. \u201cThe beat was big. On the income side, it was fantastic.\u201dFor the last four quarters, Amazon has run in the black, even if it is still not quite as profitable as some technology companies. Facebook, by contrast, reported that its net income for the first three months of the year tripled to $1.5 billion from a year earlier.The biggest source of the company\u2019s profits is Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing business that started just over a decade ago and is now on track to bring in more than $10 billion a year in revenue. A.W.S., as the business is known, is the most popular cloud service for start-ups and for a growing number of big companies that want to rent computing capacity, rather than run their own hardware and software.Cloud computing is also much more profitable than Amazon\u2019s North American retail business, which runs on thinner margins, and its international retail business, which runs at a loss. The operating income for A.W.S. more than tripled in the quarter to $604 million.The profits from A.W.S. represented 56 percent of Amazon\u2019s total operating income, even though the $2.57 billion in revenue from A.W.S. \u2014 up 64 percent from a year earlier \u2014 amounted to less than 9 percent of total revenue.On a conference call, Brian Olsavsky, Amazon\u2019s chief financial officer, said the company continued to make hefty long-term investments in initiatives, singling out original content for its Prime video service.In a statement announcing the earnings, Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, highlighted the performance of another growing area of investment \u2014 hardware devices \u2014 though with the lack of detail that has often characterized Amazon disclosures. He said customers bought twice as many Fire tablets during the first quarter as they did a year earlier, and he said the company could not keep its Echo intelligent speaker in stock.Last year, Amazon reached $100 billion in annual sales. Investors believe that even at that size, the company can become a lot bigger because online commerce still represents a relatively small portion of total retail sales. Online sales in 2016 are expected to reach about $385 billion in the United States, or 8 percent of total retail sales, according to eMarketer, a technology research firm.Amazon is the rare technology company of its size to still deliver double-digit revenue growth. The company\u2019s retail sales in North America jumped 27 percent to almost $17 billion for the quarter, while its international retail sales rose 24 percent to $9.57 billion.Amazon said revenue in the current quarter is expected to be between $28 billion and $30.5 billion, with operating income between $375 million and $975 million.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: \u2018The Vanishing Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019 Tells of Art Obsession", "Date": "2016-04-10", "News": "Supported byBooks of The TimesThere was never any proof the painting was even a Vel\u00e1zquez.Whatever it is, it\u2019s extremely accomplished \u2014 a gleaming work of someone at the peak of her craft.Perhaps one of the most profound questions the book asks is: What on earth about a painting could so thoroughly rob a man of his senses that he\u2019d forsake his livelihood, his family, his most precious worldly stakes?\u201cI have looked at this portrait till my sight has become dazzled,\u201d Snare wrote in 1847. \u201cI have thought of it till my mind has grown confused. My life has been spent trying to discover the proofs of its originality to the neglect of all other pursuits.\u201dSnare\u2019s faith in his painting is astounding. He bought it at a time when there were very few resources for authenticating works of art. The museum age had barely begun, which meant he couldn\u2019t just pop into one to compare his painting to another; there were no photographs of these portraits; reproductions were rare and often dreadful. And Vel\u00e1zquez almost never signed his paintings. Throughout history, his very name was a source of intense graphological confusion.\u201cHe was Velasco, Valasky, Valasca, Valesques,\u201d Ms. Cumming writes, \u201clike the conjugations of an irregular verb.\u201dYet from almost the first time Snare laid eyes on the painting, he knew it was unusual. So the bookseller buried himself in books. He discovered a passing reference to a portrait of Charles painted by Vel\u00e1zquez in 1623. He showed his prized portrait at 21 Old Bond Street in London, \u201cthe very squeak of chic,\u201d as Ms. Cumming puts it, and became the darling of society and the press. An eminent Spaniard, the Count of Montemolin, came along and offered his verdict: It was a Vel\u00e1zquez. The bookseller was elated.But not everyone agreed with this assessment. Critics eventually argued; the painting was seized through no fault of Snare\u2019s own (and he paid a king\u2019s ransom to get it back); he took it to Edinburgh, hoping to tour it through Britain, only to be derailed by the Trustees of the Second Earl of Fife, who claimed the painting had been stolen from the aristocrat\u2019s estate.But the book soon works loose from its rut. We learn that the trial bankrupted Snare (the authorities sold off all of his possessions in 12 days, the last item to go being a \u201cpolished brass doorknob\u201d). Only his beloved painting remained. Between the summer of 1849 and the fall of 1850, he abandoned his wife and four children and headed for New York, where he would show the painting at various venues along Broadway until it was no longer novel.

The painting\u2019s last unconfirmed sighting was in 1898.\u201cHis paintings make small people large, and large people tiny,\u201d she writes, adding, \u201che doesn\u2019t truckle to either.\u201dShe marvels at the spontaneity of his paintings, which he did without preliminary sketches. She tells fabulous stories about how lifelike they were \u2014 probably well-known to students of art history, but news to me. (King Philip IV supposedly barked \u201cWhat, are you still here?\u201d at one of the portraits in his palace, mistaking its subject for the actual person.) She makes sure that readers understand one of his most extraordinary gifts: \u201cCreating the illusion that the people you see are equally aware of your presence.\u201dIn Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s hands, painting becomes a kind of theater, in which we, the bewitched spectators, are playing a vital and almost supernatural part.And Ms. Cumming revels in the miracle of his technique, noting how the slickness of a fellow in one of his portraits \u2014 who may or may not have been his barber \u2014 is conveyed solely \u201cby a mark about the size of this little letter i\u201d on his left eyelid. \u201cSomething in that mark suggests recoil,\u201d she writes. \u201cVel\u00e1zquez doesn\u2019t trust his sitter.\u201dBut that\u2019s the most this self-effacing painter will ever do to convey his mistrust. He\u2019s modest to the point of self-annihilation. One comes to realize that the \u201cVanishing\u201d of Ms. Cumming\u2019s title could just as easily refer to the painter as Snare\u2019s lost work of art.And John Snare, too, proves elusive. After all her years of research \u2014 combing through thousands of images, reading every strip and scrap of text that she could \u2014 the author never once comes across a picture of him.

{"Headline": "Every Day\u2019s a Holiday (or Two)", "Date": "2016-04-14", "News": "Supported byCultural StudiesHolidays have always been occasion for angst, ambivalence and sometimes, despite everything, genuine celebration. The greeting card industry has long mastered the art of amplifying holidays to tug at our impulses, whether generous or guilty. But the Internet and its social media accomplices have upped the ante, fabricating new holidays and ushering other time-honored rituals, solemn observations and family quarrels into the ether, where they are louder than ever.Private rituals are now public. Communal events are worldwide. Everyone is invited, and please bring a smartphone.Some of this leads to a genuine expansion of the holiday spirit. But given the multitude of noteworthy occasions, it\u2019s hard to keep up with all the celebrating.In this socially aware holidaysphere, not only are you meant to post an image of your own Passover plate, you\u2019re to scroll through everyone else\u2019s buffet and like it. With all the sharing and hearting, if you don\u2019t hop on the holiday bandwagon, you feel as if you\u2019re violating some kind of invisible social contract.\u201cThere\u2019s always been Thanksgiving and Halloween and Christmas, but suddenly this year, it seemed like there were all these photos of Easter dinner,\u201d said Whitney Joiner, a senior features editor at Hearst Digital Media. \u201cThere were people celebrating boozy Easter brunches! It made it seem like Easter was this big national holiday we were all supposed to be celebrating.\u201dAnd there\u2019s so much more to celebrate. Sure, some of the latest holidays exist purely in the confines of the cloud. No reasonable person is going to grab the nearest vegan because of Hug a Vegetarian Day. But other \u201cmicroholidays\u201d or hashtag holidays have crossed over into the real world.Susan McPherson, 51, a corporate responsibility consultant, was invited last year for the first time to a pie party in observation of Pi Day. \u201cThere were tons of pies,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course, I posted a picture; the pies were so beautiful.\u201dWhether they originated as public relations opportunities or alleviators of boredom, these gratuitous celebrations can stir some of the same emotions the old stalwarts do. And just like traditional holidays, the new ones can manage to make you feel full and empty at the same time. \u201cHolidays online can be a wonderful way to feel like you\u2019re not alone in the world,\u201d Ms. McPherson said. \u201cBut it can also make you feel like the loneliest person in the world.\u201dAt the same time, social media celebrations can be a boon to the lonesome. \u201cHolidays online are a way for me to take the air out of how lonely it can be,\u201d said Tim Federle, an author and co-writer of the Broadway musical \u201cTuck Everlasting.\u201d \u201cOne Valentine\u2019s Day, I saw a heart-shaped balloon sticking out of a garbage can, and I took a photo and posted it on Facebook with the caption \u2018Too soon!\u2019 It got so many likes, it really bolstered me.\u201dIn some cases, offline holidays have migrated into the ether. Andrea Schneider, a director of product management at the Internal Revenue Service who lives in Bethesda, Md., recently started observing Rosh Hashana online. She, her husband and their two children curl up on the sofa and stream a service they like at a synagogue in Ohio. \u201cAt services around here, I always felt a little lonely without my entire extended family,\u201d Ms. Schneider said. \u201cWatching online with my kids, I feel like I get back some of the feeling of togetherness I was looking for.\u201d Friends of hers have set up a Google Hangout where they light Sabbath candles together.On the Internet, all are included: distant relatives and friends, elderly aunts and sick grandparents can be virtually drawn into a physical gathering they may otherwise miss. This used to happen post facto, when photographs were mailed; now celebrants keep cellphones by their side throughout dinner, posting images as they eat. But it can take away some of the intimacy and informality.Jen Nedeau, director of strategic communications at Bully Pulpit Interactive, said, \u201cSocial media brings us to a community table where we get to experience holidays in the same room.\u201d As she sees it, social media functions the way Hallmark used to, helping us figure out which holidays matter to us, and fostering communities that mimic the experience of small towns where everyone can digitally laugh together at what Grandma just said.Pamela Paul is the editor of The New York Times Book Review.Advertisement"}

An 11 percent drop in revenue for the first three months of the year puts an exclamation point on the lack of progress in almost four years with Marissa Mayer as chief executive. Google and Facebook are cleaning up in digital advertising, especially mobile. It\u2019s time to offload Yahoo\u2019s core business before bidders like Verizon lose interest.Ms. Mayer\u2019s enthusiasm is unflagging. Even after the poor showing reported on Tuesday, which included an operating loss of $167 million, she keeps talking about her ability to kick-start growth while considering other alternatives. It\u2019s hard to see what options are left.Yahoo\u2019s so-called mavens are moving at an analog pace. This Mayer-named collection of mobile, social, native and video ads represent a little more than a third of Yahoo\u2019s top line and grew only 7 percent in the first quarter. By comparison, Facebook\u2019s mobile-ad revenue increased 81 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier and accounted for nearly the entire $5.8 billion generated.Most companies put a gloss on themselves when they are up for sale to woo suitors. Yahoo, a $35 billion company that has lurched from strategy to strategy, is struggling to manage even that. Ms. Mayer is making potential bidders listen to prerecorded messages while providing little financial detail, according to media reports. It suggests that there may be something messy inside or that the chief executive isn\u2019t especially keen to sell.Despite having to press for the pitch book, suitors are showing interest nonetheless. The telecom titan Verizon Communications signaled it would bid in an attempt to marry Yahoo with AOL, which it acquired last year for $4 billion. The private-equity firm TPG Capital and the digital-advertising remains of the phone-book publisher Yellow Pages also may be in the mix.Some potential bidders have already hung up on Yahoo. Comcast, AT&T, Time and Barry Diller\u2019s Internet hodgepodge IAC are among those that media reports say considered making offers but did not.Yahoo expects the second quarter to be even worse, with at least a 12 percent decline in sales from a year ago. Given that outlook, Ms. Mayer has only one last job to do at Yahoo. She may be running short on time, however, to get this one right.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Privacy Watchdogs Call for Changes to U.S. Data-Transfer Deal", "Date": "2016-04-13", "News": "Supported byThe agreement, the so-called E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield, which would allow companies to continue sending personal data back and forth across the Atlantic, is still widely expected to be ratified by early summer. But by sounding the alarm over the current deal, national privacy watchdogs from France, Germany and other European Union member states have served notice that American companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon could face protracted country-by-country legal battles.The regulators say they worry that companies could misuse data, including information from search engine queries and social media posts. They also say they fear that American law enforcement and intelligence agencies might gain access to European citizens\u2019 personal information without sufficient safeguards in place.\u201cFrom the outside, it must look like Europe can\u2019t speak with one voice on privacy,\u201d said Patrick van Eecke, a data protection lawyer at DLA Piper in Brussels. \u201cThis is becoming kind of a circus.\u201dAnd the protest from the regulators signals that they could open cases and levy fines on companies that rely on moving data such as employees\u2019 financial information or social media posts across the Atlantic.As part of their announcement on Wednesday, European national privacy regulators said the data-transfer agreement was an improvement on previous rules. But they added that they remained concerned over American intelligence agencies\u2019 seemingly indiscriminate access to citizens\u2019 personal data when it is transferred to the United States.That access, according to the privacy watchdogs, is not subject to protections that match those currently offered in Europe. The regulators also said that new legal mechanisms to allow Europeans to monitor how their data is used in the United States needed to be strengthened.Ms. Falque-Pierrotin called on the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union that negotiated the data-transfer pact, to make further changes to the deal to meet the regulators\u2019 concerns.Those included fears that the indiscriminate bulk collection of Europeans\u2019 data by United States and European intelligence agencies failed to comply with the region\u2019s data protection rules. The privacy agencies also said the independence of a United States ombudsman reviewing European data protection complaints had to be strengthened.Vera Jourova, the European justice commissioner, said in a statement on Wednesday that she would try to incorporate the regulators\u2019 views into the final Privacy Shield pact, though she did not say which of the proposals would be included.But Ms. Jourova also emphasized that attention should now turn to getting European countries\u2019 approval for the data-transfer agreement by next month.\u201cI count on data protection authorities to help ensure that the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield works well in practice,\u201d she said.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.American officials contend that new oversight mechanisms \u2014 including an ombudsman in the State Department to handle European data queries \u2014 sufficiently protect privacy. They also say that American safeguards over how national intelligence agencies gain access to personal data go beyond what is available in many countries in the European Union.Despite Europe\u2019s national regulators raising concerns over Privacy Shield, legal experts and policy makers still expect the agreement to be approved by European countries by early summer.That is because the European Commission has the sole power to agree to the new rules, and because some countries, particularly the likes of Britain and Ireland, where many American technology companies have headquarters, have given their support to the trans-Atlantic deal.It remains unclear how the European Commission will alter Privacy Shield to answer national regulators\u2019 concerns, though it is unlikely that European officials will reopen negotiations with their American counterparts.\u201cNo national regulator wants to put companies in a legal limbo,\u201d said Alexander Whalen, a senior policy manager at Digital Europe, an industry body whose members include Google and Microsoft. \u201cWe\u2019re now in a waiting game.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the surname of a senior policy manager at Digital Europe.

{"Headline": "The Next Generation of Artists\u2019 Studios", "Date": "2016-04-12", "News": "Supported byOnce, an artist holed up in her paint-spattered loft and created in solitude. These days, the idea of where an artist makes her work has changed \u2014 and so, too, the very nature of art itself.Amalia Ulman, 27, works in a bland, ready-\u00adfurnished office on the 17th floor of a 21-story building filled primarily with lawyers and accountants. She admits that collectors and artist friends \u2014 who mostly work in shared warehouses \u2014 find her setup a little odd. And yet Ulman likes her studio in downtown L.A. for the same reason she likes hotel rooms: She can\u2019t get distracted by trying to personalize the space. She feels obliged to keep the office tidy, to avoid potential awkwardness when the cleaner comes at 6 p.m. And she feels pressured to keep her schedule. \u201cEveryone is working,\u201d she explains, \u201cso I feel like I have to do the same thing.\u201dThe office itself has become an important character in the new photographs, in which she exaggerates, among other traits, her workaholic tendencies. (In one short Instagram video, she films her reflection in the building\u2019s elevator doors as she chants, exhausted, \u201cIt\u2019s been a long day,\u201d until the doors open.) She makes these videos and photos spontaneously as she works. \u201cInstead of planning the photograph, I plan the whole scene, and just spend some time there,\u201d she explains. \u201cThey\u2019re always better if they\u2019re actually selfies,\u201d she continues, \u201cand if I\u2019m like, actually tired.\u201dJared Madere\u2019s studio \u2014 a large garage filled with free Craigslist furniture and curious artifacts opposite a building site in the Bronx \u2014 is, in some ways, exactly what one might expect for a young artist trying to make it in New York City. And yet the space is also a rebellion for Madere, 29, whose entire career has been spent fleeing the very idea of permanence and stability, both in the materials he uses and the spaces in which he lives and works \u2014 which, until recently, included the RV that is now parked inside, awaiting its next adventure.Madere bought the van in 2014 after he learned his Bed-Stuy landlord might raise the rent on his apartment, and it became not only his home, but a kind of trademark: He drove it to Miami Basel in 2013 and, for a party at the Whitney last year, parked it outside the museum, inviting visitors inside a mobile exhibition space.The Bronx space represents a maturation for the artist, who has since moved on to more conventional living quarters, and who has been working on a series of metal figures. Still, there are signs everywhere of Madere\u2019s love of things that move, decompose and shine: a TV set playing a looping tournament of the hoversled game Wipeout, a rolling projection of medieval manuscripts on the wall, flowers in glittery vases. \u201cMy friend recently told me that the reason why humans like shiny stuff is because they\u2019re always trying to locate a water source,\u201d Madere says, and points to a back wall, where shimmering Mylar drapes ripple under an electric fan, a waterfall of fabric.Beloufa is known for sculptures that employ technological devices such as surveillance cameras and videos, and for films that merge documentary and fiction, often starring nonactors. \u201cOccidental,\u201d his first real feature, is different, starring professionals and made with a bigger budget. The film\u2019s complex narrative begins when a hotel receptionist becomes suspicious of two men who present themselves as an Italian couple but who seem neither Italian nor gay. For this Hitchcockian thriller of identity politics, Beloufa wanted the d\u00e9cor to be \u201970s and drab, evoking the look of what he calls \u201cpostcolonial tourism.\u201dThe juxtapositions of old and new media and spaces are a result of Bajagic\u2019s splintered artistic influences. In her first months as a student at Yale, Bajagic made formally disciplined, near-monochromatic paintings in grays and whites and hyperlink blue, works so muted that her tutors repeatedly asked her what they were all about. At the same time, almost as a hobby, Bajagic was collecting images she found online of women \u2014 a habit she had developed as a lonely teenager, using them to create false profiles to chat to men online. Her solution to the problem of how to animate her paintings was to combine her two interests, literally pasting images from her online research on top of the canvases she had been working on. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to annihilate the history behind the pictures that I use,\u201d she explains. \u201cI\u2019m trying to recontextualize them.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Or perhaps there is a bicycle leaning against a wall in your apartment, waiting, but the idea of joining those fixed-gear daredevils on city streets makes your stomach drop.

{"Headline": "Yahoo Agrees to Give 4 Board Seats to Starboard Value", "Date": "2016-04-27", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For over a year and a half, Yahoo has been tormented by a prominent activist investor who has criticized virtually everything about the company, from its business strategy to its efforts to sell major assets.Now that hedge fund, Starboard Value, is finally getting a seat at the embattled Internet company\u2019s table, heading off a potentially distracting fight and perhaps easing the way for a potential sale of its core business.\u201cWe look forward to getting started right away and working closely with management and our fellow board members with the common goal of maximizing value for all shareholders,\u201d Mr. Smith said in a statement.The move may let Yahoo focus more on its sales efforts while also quieting one of the company\u2019s biggest and most persistent gadflies, since Starboard must now refrain from public criticism. The company had engaged two sets of bankers over the last several months: some to run defense against Starboard, others to supervise the auction.Giving those seats to Starboard may also remove some additional doubts about the seriousness of Yahoo\u2019s intent in exploring a sale, a process that several people involved have described as messy and confusing. The hedge fund had latched on to those concerns as part of its activism campaign.As part of the settlement, two existing directors will step down, leaving the board at 11 members. Coupled with the two new directors appointed by Yahoo last month, more than half of the company\u2019s board will be new this year.The other new additions to the board are Tor R. Braham, a former technology investment banker at Deutsche Bank; Eddy W. Hartenstein, a director of Tribune Publishing and former chief executive of The Los Angeles Times; and Richard S. Hill, chairman of Tessera Technologies.At the same time that a settlement has been reached, Yahoo and its board are still combing through the preliminary bids received last week. Among them were proposals from Verizon Communications, seen as the early leader in the sales process, and from investment firms like TPG Capital, Silver Lake and a consortium led by Bain Capital and Vista Equity Partners.Removing Starboard\u2019s threat of a board fight might mean that Yahoo no longer feels compelled to complete its sales process before its next annual shareholder meeting. The agreement with Starboard says Yahoo must hold its meeting by June 30. Still, company executives have expressed confidence in the speed of the process, and Mr. Smith is likely to keep pressing for a timely conclusion.Hopes for a deal have helped lift Yahoo\u2019s stock price more than 11 percent so far this year. But investors largely shrugged off the agreement on Wednesday, and shares closed down 0.43 percent.For investors, little matters more now than whether Yahoo can find a buyer for its core Internet business, including its huge sports, finance and mail arms. A weak quarterly earnings report last week, in which sales fell 11 percent, underscored the continuing troubles that have plagued the company.Despite its huge presence in the early days of the web, Yahoo has steadily lost ground to newer competitors like Google and Facebook, leaving it to grasp for solutions to turn around its business. A succession of chief executives, the latest being the Google veteran Marissa Mayer, have failed to find an effective answer.That has drawn a number of activist investors over the years that have sought to shake up the company. Before Starboard it was Third Point, the firm run by the billionaire Daniel S. Loeb, who successfully ousted Ms. Mayer\u2019s predecessor and called for the hiring of the Google engineer.But Ms. Mayer\u2019s various initiatives have not panned out. In September 2014, Starboard \u2014 a roughly five-year-old firm with a growing reputation as a successful activist investor \u2014 emerged, leading with criticism of the company\u2019s strategy.Starboard and Mr. Smith later added criticism of how Yahoo planned to sell its remaining stake in the Alibaba Group of China and, eventually, Ms. Mayer\u2019s overall performance, to their complaints.Little love has been lost between the two sides in the last year and a half, with Ms. Mayer believing Starboard to be a nuisance and disrespectful and Mr. Smith publicly calling for the ouster of Yahoo\u2019s board. The relationship took a further hit last month when Yahoo filled two board seats hours before the company was set to sit down with Starboard.But both sides continued to work on reaching a settlement, which has become more and more common in corporate America as companies and activists alike seek to avoid the expense and uncertainty of running a full-blown proxy fight.While corporate boards initially viewed such rabble-rousers as threats to be fought, they have increasingly opened up and offered director seats to end hostilities.Starboard won seats on Wednesday not only at Yahoo but also at Marvell Technologies, a chip maker that the hedge fund had fought against for only a few months. At Marvell, the activist investor won four board seats and will have a say in the selection of the company\u2019s next chief executive.Some on the receiving end of Starboard\u2019s campaigns have eventually formed cordial relationships with the hedge fund. One of the new Yahoo directors who had been proposed by Starboard, Mr. Hill, was on Tessera\u2019s board when that company battled against the activist investor three years ago.The alternative could be far worse. Starboard, for instance, ousted the entire board of Darden Restaurants, the parent of the Olive Garden chain, after rallying fellow investors unhappy with the company\u2019s financial performance.\u201cThis constructive resolution will allow management and the board to keep our focus on our extremely important objectives,\u201d Ms. Mayer said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cManagement is looking forward to working with the entire board, including the new directors, to maximize shareholder value.\u201dGiving activist investors a role in the boardroom also helps to silence them, since such settlements \u2014 like the one at Yahoo \u2014 include nondisparagement clauses that prohibit these firms from publicly criticizing their companies.Advertisement"}

At the same time, such a compilation of carefully chosen music could be a kind of heraldic device that announced its maker\u2019s allegiance and cultural pedigree.On Thursday the composer-pianist Timo Andres and Gabriel Kahane, the composer, singer and songwriter, gave a delightfully rangy and often moving concert at Zankel Hall that was centered around a sequence of short songs and piano pieces described in the program as a mixtape. The recital was born out of the two musicians\u2019 friendship and featured new material, commissioned by Carnegie Hall, that each had written for the other.But for all the seeming spontaneity with which Mr. Andres and Mr. Kahane linked works by Schumann, Schubert, Britten and Ives with their own compositions, the underlying message of continuity across time and genres was carefully considered. The quicksilver lyricism of Mr. Andres\u2019s playing cleared a path from the narrative instrumental genius of a selection from Schumann\u2019s \u201cWaldszenen\u201d to the uncompromising but freely communicative music of Thomas Ad\u00e8s\u2019s Three Mazurkas.Three \u201cWorks on Paper\u201d by Mr. Kahane showed off different facets of Mr. Andres\u2019s artistry. There was the playfully competitive counterpoint of \u201cDeath to Advertising,\u201d the liquid arpeggios in \u201cVeda (Paraphrase)\u201d and a virtuosically set faux folk tune in \u201cThe New Sincerity Auld Reel.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Billing by Millionths of Pennies, Cloud Computing\u2019s Giants Take In Billions", "Date": "2016-04-10", "News": "Supported byBitsSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Imagine building an enormous beach resort, maybe the best in the world. Instead of renting the rooms, you charge guests based on the grains of sand they touch. You charge very little per grain, but if they lie on enough of them, it adds up.That is one way to think about what is going on at the world\u2019s biggest cloud-computing companies. Instead of grains of sand, think about computing cycles, the activity that goes on in a computer server that is running software. For a price, think about one line of software code for two one-millionths of a penny.When tolls that tiny are paid often enough, they can make a billion-dollar business. At Amazon Web Services, which pioneered this method late last year, there is no charge for the first million times a customer runs code. Thereafter, A.W.S. charges by the million times, or for the hundreds of milliseconds the computer is used.\u201cThe scale at which we operate allows us to do innovative things,\u201d said Matt Wood, general manager of product strategy at A.W.S. \u201cWhen we get better economies of scale, we\u2019ll use that to our advantage.\u201dThis economics of tiny things demonstrates the global power of the few companies, including Microsoft and Google, that can make fortunes counting this small and often. In other words, you have to be really big to worry about making money off things that are really tiny.Google charges pennies for search ads and spends $9.9 billion annually building out a global computing business. Given enough software, in the realm of millionths of pennies, it could do even better. Good luck to any new entrant without the scale of these tech giants, however, as customers come to expect that sort of cheap metering.Cloud-computing companies are not the only ones focused on the small. Banks, of course, have for years been content taking a sliver of big transactions, so long as there are many of them. Uber, which enables private cars to temporarily become taxis, can monitor drivers and riders to adjust prices and routes, changing the value of things throughout the day. An auto insurance company called Metromile charges customers based on how many miles they drive a year.As tech companies get better at measuring things, other businesses can pick up on the techniques, and the fine counting at the big clouds augurs for more precise measurements and pricing everywhere. Mitch Hedberg\u2019s joke about rice being a good meal when you are hungry for 2,000 of something may turn out to be a prophecy.A.W.S. was an early leader in public cloud computing, or renting access to computing equipment or software over an Internet connection. It started in 2006 as a barely noted fluke by Amazon. It now has over two million computer servers and a million customers, including Netflix, Shell and Brooks Brothers.The per-millionth pricing began last November, in the A.W.S. product Lambda. Lambda runs a customer\u2019s line of code in response to a request, like looking up a ZIP code when given an address. Customers never rent servers, but pay for the moments of computing.Microsoft last month announced that it would have its own \u201cserverless\u201d product. Google has something similar in early release, which is likely to be a product by the third quarter of this year.Microsoft is even trying to do A.W.S. one better by microslicing the cost to rent some of its software licenses into the minutes of actual use. \u201cWe\u2019re renting the sand and charging for the sun\u2019s UV rays that hit you,\u201d said Scott Guthrie, who runs Microsoft\u2019s cloud.For the big clouds, microslicing is also a way of coping with a tough task: Customers have to feel like they can rent all the computing they want, and the providers must always run at near full capacity. If someone is using cycles, and not whole machines, more people can be packed in.\u201cThe secret to cloud economics is utilization \u2014 every minute unsold is money you don\u2019t get back,\u201d said Greg DeMichillie, the head of product for Google\u2019s cloud. \u201cThere are very few of us who can work at this scale.\u201dLike any important new tech trend, the microsliced, serverless model is already attracting investors and start-ups eager to work in the new world \u2014 and in this case, wary of what the giants will do next.An Oakland, Calif., company called Serverless makes software that other engineers can use to develop products for computing in Lambda and its ilk. \u201cWe think this could be the focal point of A.W.S., even though I have no idea how they make money charging this little,\u201d said Austen Collins, the founder of Serverless.One way they make money is by adding on other products and servers. So does Mr. Collins think A.W.S. could thwart his business? \u201cIt\u2019s a mistake to think Amazon won\u2019t be in everything,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t say, \u2018What if Amazon does it?\u2019 We assume they will, and try to do something a little better and faster.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Sonja Trauss, a local activist, thinks the city should tackle this problem by building more housing.This may not sound like a controversial idea. But this is San Francisco.Ms. Trauss is a self-described anarchist and the head of the SF Bay Area Renters\u2019 Federation, an upstart political group that is pushing for more development. Its platform is simple: Members want San Francisco and its suburbs to build more of every kind of housing. More subsidized affordable housing, more market-rate rentals, more high-end condominiums.Ms. Trauss supports all of it so long as it is built tall, and soon. \u201cYou have to support building, even when it\u2019s a type of building you hate,\u201d she said. \u201cIs it ugly? Get over yourself. Is it low-income housing? Get over yourself. Is it luxury housing? Get over yourself. We really need everything right now.\u201dThe organization also inflamed Sierra Club volunteers in San Francisco by trying to elect its own pro-development candidate to the environmental group\u2019s executive committee. That effort failed, and last week her candidate, Donald Dewsnup, was arrested and charged with voter fraud \u2014 a move that Ms. Trauss claims is political retaliation. \u201cThere\u2019s no other explanation for why the district attorney of a major city would investigate and charge one person for registering at an inaccurate address,\u201d she said.In an interview, Mr. Dewsnup said he was homeless and simply used an address near the place where he was sleeping at the time.Across the country, a reversal in urban flight has ignited debates over gentrification, wealth, generational change and the definition of the modern city. It\u2019s a familiar battle in suburbs, where not-in-my-backyard homeowners are an American archetype.In San Francisco, though, things get weird. Here the tech boom is clashing with tough development laws and resentment from established residents who want to choke off growth to prevent further change.Ms. Trauss is the result: a new generation of activist whose pro-market bent is the opposite of the San Francisco stereotypes \u2014 the lefties, the aging hippies and tolerance all around.Ms. Trauss\u2019s cause, more or less, is to make life easier for real estate developers by rolling back zoning regulations and environmental rules. Her opponents are a generally older group of progressives who worry that an influx of corporate techies is turning a city that nurtured the Beat Generation into a gilded resort for the rich.Those groups oppose almost every new development except those reserved for subsidized affordable housing. But for many young professionals who are too rich to qualify for affordable housing, but not rich enough to afford $5,000-a-month rents, this is the problem.Adding to the strangeness is that the typical San Francisco progressive and the typical mid-20s-to-early-30s member of Ms. Trauss\u2019s group are likely to have identical positions on every liberal touchstone, like same-sex marriage and climate change, and yet they have become bitter enemies on one very big issue: housing.\u201cWe have liberal Democrats, and very liberal Democrats, and yet we are as polarized as the rest of the country,\u201d said Tim Colen, executive director of the San Francisco Housing Action Coalition.Ms. Trauss is smart and energetic and unpolished. She called her group the Bay Area Renters\u2019 Federation because \u201cfederation\u201d reminds her of \u201cStar Trek\u201d and because her roommate thought it would be funny if her group\u2019s acronym spelled \u201cBARF.\u201dThis might make it tempting to dismiss Ms. Trauss as just another colorful activist in a place where activism is a local sport. But the anger she has tapped into is real, reflecting a generational break that pits cranky homeowners and the San Francisco political establishment against a cast of newcomers who are demanding the region make room for them, too.Every few weeks, when a company like Zillow puts out a new price report, both sides hold up the numbers as an example of how San Francisco has failed the middle class. Zillow puts the city\u2019s median home price at $1.1 million, neck and neck with Manhattan. The region\u2019s rent, at $3,500 a month for an average apartment, is the highest in the nation.\u201cBARF is an important voice in this housing debate, and that is the voice of young people who are asking the question: \u2018What is my future in this city?\u2019\u201d said Scott Wiener, a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. \u201cAnd you can agree or disagree with them, but they have activated a new generation of pro-housing activists.\u201dThe group\u2019s build-more platform may be politically contentious, but economically speaking, it is anything but controversial. The Bay Area was expensive even before the tech boom. And the supply of new projects, while increasing, remains decades behind population growth.Much of San Francisco\u2019s progressive establishment feels the city is building too much market-rate housing. Some go so far as to argue that the appetite for real estate here is so high that supply-and-demand rules don\u2019t really apply.To get prices down, \u201cYou\u2019d have to, like, build another city on top of the city,\u201d said David Campos, a progressive-wing member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. He thinks the city should focus the vast majority of future development on affordable housing limited to people making well below the city\u2019s median income.\u201cMany housing programs \u2014 vouchers, rent control and inclusionary housing \u2014 attempt to make housing more affordable without increasing the overall supply,\u201d the report said. \u201cThis approach does very little to address the underlying cause of California\u2019s high housing costs: a housing shortage.\u201dMs. Trauss, 34, is a born activist from Philadelphia whose father is a lawyer who defends low-income homeowners against foreclosure. She moved to the Bay Area in 2011, shortly after getting her master\u2019s degree in economics from Washington University in St. Louis, and taught math at local community colleges. She intended to live in San Francisco, but settled across the bay in Oakland.Today BARF is her full-time job, allowing her the financial wherewithal to become one of those strangely persistent people who speak regularly at City Hall. To an outside observer, this can feel like watching an obscure and slow-moving sport.This is a town with an app for everything and where people get fussy when an Uber driver takes more than five minutes to arrive. City Hall, with its Beaux-Arts architecture and government-grade wait times, can feel like an anachronism.Ms. Trauss may be a plugged-in millennial, but she loves it. \u201cEven in this modern era of, whatever, the Internet and people like interacting in a place that\u2019s no place at all, City Hall is still a center,\u201d she said.One recent afternoon, she spent an hour on the hard wooden benches in the chamber of the Board of Supervisors. She was there to make a two-minute public comment in favor of a dull-but-important proposal to streamline the permitting process for some affordable-housing projects.Three days later she was back, this time to support a \u201cdensity bonus\u201d \u2014 a proposal to let developers build taller buildings in exchange for including more affordable housing as well. When she arrived, Mr. Campos, from the Board of Supervisors, was blasting the proposal from the City Hall steps, surrounded by 70 or so supporters.Ms. Trauss and another member of her group stood opposite and held up signs that said \u201cStop Affordable Housing.\u201d This was meant to be ironic. Their point was that Mr. Campos was opposing legislation that would create more market-rate housing \u2014 but also more affordable housing.Nobody seemed to get it, so Ms. Trauss went inside City Hall to add her name to a list of people making public comments before the planning commission. Her chance to speak would be hours away, so she trekked around City Hall, past bronze busts and wedding parties, in search of a quiet place to take a lunch break. She was joined by a man whose legal name is Starchild.Starchild is the sort of only-in-San Francisco character you end up making friends with if you spend enough time at City Hall. He works nights as an \u201cerotic service provider.\u201d Asked if this meant he was a prostitute, he said, \u201c\u2018Prostitute\u2019 is O.K. as long as it\u2019s said in a respectful way.\u201d Starchild spends his days campaigning for libertarian causes and running doomed campaigns for office.\u201cThis is my life,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous.\u201dMany longtime San Franciscans view groups like BARF as yet another example of how the technology industry is robbing San Francisco of its San Francisco-ness. Far from the hippies of the 1960s, many of today\u2019s migrants lean libertarian \u2014 drawn by start-up dreams or to work for the likes of Google or Apple, two of the world\u2019s most valuable companies. They tend to share a belief, either idealistically or na\u00efvely, depending on who is judging, that corporations can be a force for social good and change.But BARF members are so single-minded about housing that they can be hard to label politically. They view San Francisco progressives as, in fact, fundamentally conservative. That is because, to the group members at least, progressive positions on housing seem less about building the city and more about keeping people like them out.On a drizzly Sunday in December, Ms. Trauss hosted the SF YIMBYParty Congress, a gathering of pro-housing groups held at a Market Street co-working space full of start-up touches like mismatched furniture, a foosball table and lots of white men. Toward the beginning, a debate broke out about whether they should call themselves moderates to distinguish themselves from progressives.Ms. Trauss joked that she liked moderate because you can shorten it to mod, and mod sounds cool. Mr. Wiener, the supervisor, disagreed, noting that in San Francisco, a moderate Democrat \u201cmight have a Bernie Sanders sticker on their car.\u201dOne man, who seemed exasperated by the discussion and the idea of using his Sunday to talk about politics, said, with more colorful language, that he did not give a hoot about progressives versus moderates \u2014 he just wanted some darn housing.The tech boom takes much of the blame for soaring housing prices. But the pro-development movement has less to do with tech as an industry, and everything to do with newcomers as a class.Brian Hanlon, a federation member who regularly attends Board of Supervisors meetings with Ms. Trauss, has a day job doing administrative work for the United States Forest Service. Two years ago, when he started worrying that his claim to an $835-a-month room in a rent-controlled apartment might be in jeopardy, he reacted in classic San Francisco fashion. He started marching in anti-eviction protests next to people beating drums and signs that said things like \u201cTech = Death.\u201dBut he quickly broke ranks. Many of his fellow protesters also opposed building new apartments \u2014 putting him at odds with them.\u201cThey want to be on the side of tenants, but they don\u2019t have any real plan for how do we become a welcoming metropolitan area for new people who don\u2019t have money,\u201d Mr. Hanlon said. \u201cTheir plans are only to allow current incumbent renters to stay in their place, presumably until they die and some rich person comes along.\u201dThe progressive movement has played a guiding role in creating the quirky and picturesque San Francisco that many people love today. Progressives battled plans to crisscross the city with freeways and opposed urban renewal programs that destroyed black neighborhoods. They have fought for, and won, rent-control protections and funding for affordable housing, along with various open-space amenities that many newcomers take for granted.The question is how to handle a long-run demographic reversal in which cities across the country have regained population following years of \u201cwhite flight\u201d to the suburbs. After losing population for two decades through the 1970s, San Francisco resumed growth in the \u201980s and has only accelerated from there.\u201cThere\u2019s that book, \u2018What\u2019s the Matter With Kansas?\u2019\u201d said Gabriel Metcalf, executive director of SPUR, an urban policy research organization. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with San Francisco? Why is it that in a city that\u2019s two-thirds renters we have adopted a housing policy that is horrible for renters?\u201dOf the 11 propositions on San Francisco\u2019s ballot in November, seven were either directly or indirectly related to high home prices and the influence of the technology industry. Michael Hankinson, a Harvard Ph.D. candidate who is studying land-use and housing prices, surveyed voters for his dissertation and found renters skeptical that new development would do anything other than raise prices.For instance, a recent proposal to temporarily stop market-rate development in the city\u2019s Mission District, a gentrifying neighborhood popular with technology workers, failed citywide. But Mr. Hankinson found that a majority of renters favored it because they did not think that new development would do anything for them \u2014 and feared that it might, somehow, get them evicted.\u201cBARF has to convince renters that neighborhood change will benefit them in the long run,\u201d he said. Today, when eviction is a hot party topic, most renters are unwilling to take that gamble.So Ms. Trauss is taking her campaign to the courts. In December she sued the city of Lafayette, Calif., an East Bay bedroom community, after it took a parcel that had been set aside for higher-density apartments and office buildings and rezoned it for single-family homes instead.She wrote the petition herself, saying the move violated the California Housing Accountability Act, a 1980s law and \u201canti-Nimby\u201d statute that limits cities\u2019 ability to downsize housing developments. Recently, she hired a lawyer to litigate the case.Asked about Ms. Trauss\u2019s lawsuit, Steven Falk, Lafayette\u2019s city manager, said the city actually faced another lawsuit over the same development. The second group is suing, he said, because they think it is too big.Advertisement"}

In the 21st century, it is not impossible to imagine an Internet revolution beginning in China.That possibility is, as with so many aspects of China, a function of scale. Alibaba, the sprawling Chinese digital marketplace, is already by some measures larger than Amazon. Its payment tool Alipay alone accounts for one-third of the $2.5 trillion global online payments market. The dizzying rise of the company is a crucial part of China\u2019s ascension as a global economic power, and if you\u2019ve never heard of the company, rest assured that you will. When the Alibaba founder Jack Ma appeared onstage last year at a summit in Manila with Barack Obama, Obama interviewed him.We often think of successful tech C.E.O.s climbing from the nerdy ranks of tinkering programmers, like Bill Gates, but as \u201cAlibaba,\u201d Duncan Clark\u2019s engaging biography explains, Ma\u2019s humble origins gave no clue to his future \u2014 then again, in 1970s China, the very idea of a homegrown technology business executive was inconceivable. Born in 1964 to a photographer and a factory worker, Ma grew up a mediocre student in the city of Hangzhou. About the only thing that set Ma apart was learning English, which he would practice by speaking to tourists passing through his hometown. One of these tourists, a vacationing Australian Communist, became a generous benefactor who even helped buy a house for young Ma and his wife.After a stint teaching English, Ma began running a tiny translation business, focused on Chinese companies \u2014 beginning to flourish under Deng Xiaoping \u2014 seeking to do business with the West. During his first visit to the United States in the mid-90s, a friend in Seattle logged Ma onto the Internet, and it occurred to him that listing Chinese companies online might be a good idea.If you think early American web pioneers had a tough time persuading investors and consumers to embrace the scary new world of e-commerce, imagine the challenge Ma\u2019s start-up faced: Most of China had no Internet, so his early clients were handing him thousands of dollars to create web services they themselves could not see. \u201cI was treated like a con man for three years,\u201d Ma said.Soon enough, though, his clients answered their phones to find curious Western customers on the line. In the late \u201990s, as the Chinese government began a delicate program of encouraging Internet growth without giving up state control, Ma\u2019s \u201cChina Pages\u201d and several other Chinese start-ups began to attract the attention of outside investors. That money, some of which came from the Japanese billionaire Masayosha Son, was rocket fuel for what became Alibaba, which has a massive shipping-logistics arm on top of its e-commerce services. When Alibaba went public in 2014, the $25 billion it raised made it the largest I.P.O. in world history (the next two, incidentally, were Chinese state-controlled enterprises).Clark is a China-based investment adviser and onetime consultant to Alibaba; he notes that his failure to exercise stock options he was given as payment became a $30-million mistake. The access he got to the company pushes his breezy account more toward the business than to Ma\u2019s personality. Still, Ma emerges as an unpretentious, self-deprecating leader, fond of quoting martial arts novels and \u201cForrest Gump.\u201d Yet he is clearly also shrewd and extremely driven. And his company has acquired enough wealth to begin to reshape the Western business world; he has announced a Netflix-style video streaming service and now has a movie division that invests in Hollywood blockbusters. The Chinese government\u2019s control over the Internet may still make political dissent difficult, but Ma and some others have demonstrated that there are few limits to building world-beating companies.James Ledbetter is the editor of Inc.

{"Headline": "Technology Transforms How Insurers Calculate Risk", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The world is a dangerous, unpredictable place \u2014 not a bad thing, perhaps, if you\u2019re in the business of selling insurance, making loans or figuring out ways to prevent mishaps.But these days, technology is changing some of the calculations around risk, whether for car insurance, life insurance, flood insurance or even vacation-related accident insurance, and slowly but surely disrupting the financial core of the insurance business.Take the old saw that younger drivers are always the riskiest to insure, for example. Is it always true?\u201cA 22-year-old driver who parties a lot and drives 10,000 miles a year, or a 40-year-old teetotaling mom who drives 40,000 miles? I might think the mom is riskier,\u201d said Dan Preston, the chief executive of Metromile. \u201cSpeeding a lot or braking hard, unless you\u2019re going 100 miles an hour, it doesn\u2019t make much difference.\u201dInstead, all those extra miles the mother is safely and soberly driving mean she is more often where the accidents are happening. Or, as Mr. Preston put it, \u201cSeventy percent of the variants around expected losses can be derived from mileage.\u201dFinancial technology is not just changed by faster computers with more powerful software. Technology also changes things like mobile computing, data collection and what people can measure. Put those together creatively and you change any business involved in calculating risk \u2014 in other words, most of the financial world.Customers fill out the usual information, like age and location \u2014 the things traditionally used to guess the likelihood a car will be wrecked or stolen. That data determines a Metromile base rate for insurance, and premiums rise based on miles driven. People who stay below the national average of about 12,000 miles annually can save substantially, compared with traditional insurance.People are, in effect, agreeing to be observed in exchange for the savings, which enables Metromile to add services. It has become a way for Uber drivers to stay insured while they are driving for money, something their traditional policies may not cover.Metromile\u2019s location-based knowledge lets it warn drivers to remove their cars from a street that will be swept soon, helping them avoid a ticket. The tracking device can hook into a car\u2019s computers, warning the driver when the car might need maintenance.While people may be uncertain about government monitoring, they seem to be willing to have companies looking over their shoulders \u2014 at least if it saves them money.It is something insurers want badly, said James Whittle, chief claims counsel for the American Insurance Association. \u201cLots of insurers are drilling down to the precise granularity of risk,\u201d he said.Expect more. Cellphones, sensors and cheap computing make it possible to value all sorts of objects, including cars, houses, cameras and skis, while gaining insight into how they are likely to be used next. That changes the betting for the risk industry.\u201cMetromile is the start of a broader shift,\u201d said Mark McLaughlin, global insurance director for IBM. Insurance companies \u201cwant to shift from paying when something bad happens to helping you prevent something bad happening to you,\u201d he said.He predicts a time when a car insurer might learn drivers\u2019 commuting routes and warn them if there is a chance of a hailstorm ahead, even text them a Starbucks coupon to encourage them to wait out the risk. Last October, IBM bought the digital assets of the Weather Channel, perhaps in anticipation of such a service. IBM declined to discuss future products.Many traditional insurers are already adopting this observational approach and using discounts to sway behavior. Some examples include Progressive Auto Insurance, which has a service similar to Metromile, called Snapshot.The company Vitality has united with several insurers to offer people lower rates in exchange for logging their health data. It gives people things like Fitbits and Apple Watches to automatically track their activities. State Farm Insurance, in conjunction with the home security company ADT, offers discounts for people who get home monitoring systems.Insurance, which is after all a business where people take money with a promise to maybe pay for something someday, is a highly regulated enterprise that historically favored slow-moving companies with lots of capital. In this case, however, Mr. Preston says he has an edge on established competition.\u201cThe challenge for the incumbents is that the low-mileage customers are most of their profits,\u201d he said at Metromile\u2019s headquarters here in a converted parking garage. \u201cThey are subsidizing the high-mileage drivers,\u201d he said. \u201cThose are the people we attract.\u201dMetromile\u2019s co-founder and board chairman is David Friedberg, an early employee at Google, who also founded what became the Climate Corporation. Climate, which used data on things like rainfall and soil quality to insure several types of crops, was bought by Monsanto for more than $900 million in 2013.\u201cThe next generation understands the atomization of everything,\u201d said Scott Walchek, the founder and chief executive of Trov. Atomization means slicing things to their smallest components, in this case not insuring a whole houseful of goods but individual objects. \u201cInsurers have to get ready for customers who expect to have their ownership of everything, how they use things, understood. On-demand everything is the zeitgeist.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The shift reflects a reprioritization of his time from managing the firm to grooming the next generation of leaders.While Mr. Doerr will continue to focus on the investments that he has already made and the board seats he currently holds, he is no longer responsible for the success of new investments made out of new funds.It\u2019s unclear who will replace Mr. Doerr as the person who oversees Kleiner Perkins, a 45-year-old investment firm that helped put the venture industry on the map and made Silicon Valley the center of the technology start-up world. Mr. Doerr raised the profile of the firm in the late 1990s and in the early 2000s with his hugely profitable investments in Amazon and Google.In his blog post, Mr. Doerr said his management duties will be split for now among several Kleiner partners \u2014 Ted Schlein, Beth Seidenberg and Mary Meeker. Mr. Doerr also highlighted the firm\u2019s younger generation, including Mike Abbott, Eric Feng, Wen Hsieh and Mood Rowghani.At the same time that Kleiner Perkins was focused on clean technology, rival firms including Accel Partners and Greylock Partners were betting on new Internet companies including Facebook, which ended up proving to be hugely successful. Kleiner Perkins has since de-emphasized its investing in green technology and has refocused on tech investments.Mr. Doerr did not refer to the case in his blog post.\u201cThe venture industry is changing all the time,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe must keep changing to better compete and serve entrepreneurs.\u201dAn article on April 1 about a changing of the guard at the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers described incorrectly a change in the role of John Doerr, who has been its day-to-day manager and will become its chairman. Mr. Doerr will continue to invest in new start-ups; it is not the case that he will not make such investments. However, he will no longer have fiduciary responsibility for the success of those investments.Advertisement"}

I didn\u2019t know Chinese people hated us [North Korean defectors] that much. A lot of Chinese people believe the Chinese government, and think I\u2019m a traitor. I thought China was the right place to deliver this talk.I don\u2019t hate the Chinese. We\u2019re brothers and we share a border. I just hate the government, politicians, policies, not the people. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here. I want to at least change some of the information they\u2019ve been given.Chinese policy is: If you report a North Korean defector, you\u2019ll get paid. The prices, I understand, are 3,000 to 5,000 renminbi [about $460 to $770] if you report defectors. There are Chinese in border towns who are reporting on them for the money. It\u2019s really sad.Last year, nine defectors were caught in Vietnam. They were returned to China. Why does China always want to support North Korea, even on defector issues? Why are you the savior of North Korea? Why do you ignore the international community\u2019s demands?The key is still China. That\u2019s why I\u2019m asking the big countries, like America, do whatever you can to change the Chinese government\u2019s mind.If they read my book, they\u2019d understand. I did my best to escape. I think it\u2019s all a miracle. It\u2019s not because Chinese policemen were stupid enough to believe my fake story. I think it was a miracle. That\u2019s why sometimes I think God exists.And it wasn\u2019t just me. Once I met a Chinese student who was studying in South Korea. When she saw the news in South Korea about her own country, she said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t my country. This isn\u2019t happening.\u2019\u2019 At that moment I realized we were all brainwashed.Living in South Korea, I can reach any website. But this time when I arrived in Beijing, I was shocked that you can\u2019t access Google, Facebook, Gmail. I\u2019d heard about this. But experiencing it, it\u2019s freaking me.One day, one of my best friends said, \u201cYou never talk about your family, you never visit your hometown at New Year\u2019s.\u201d She was Korean Chinese, from Yanji. I wanted to tell her the truth, but I couldn\u2019t trust anyone. It was really tiring always pretending to be someone else. Not my life, not my real name, nothing.China has such an important role.

{"Headline": "General Mills and 7-Eleven Join the Venture Capital Crowd", "Date": "2016-04-18", "News": "Supported byAt first glance, the maker of Cheerios and Cocoa Puffs might not fit the image of a cutting-edge venture capital investor.But with the food business moving to healthier offerings and online distribution, General Mills has created a venture capital unit that recently led a $3 million investment in Rhythm Superfoods, a specialty start-up that makes kale chips and broccoli crisps.General Mills, based in Minneapolis, is part of an increasing number of old-economy companies, including the convenience chain 7-Eleven and the Campbell Soup Company, that have joined a crowd of technology companies to create venture capital funds. Through them, they scout for new products or services and promising potential business partners.Their moves have accompanied a surge and recent crest in the valuations of many venture capital-backed start-ups. Critics say the corporate-run funds have contributed to inflated valuations for start-ups, and some funds have begun selling stakes even as they face reduced valuations on some holdings.Reports recently surfaced that Intel\u2019s fund, the largest of its kind, might sell up to $1 billion of its holdings as it narrows its strategy under its chief executive, Brian M. Krzanich.With valuations of many young, private companies faltering as interest in initial public offerings of stock has waned, corporate venture investing faces a test.\u201cI think some of the corporate V.C. will get a little less enamored as the venture market goes from euphoria into a little more normal period,\u201d said J. Sanford Miller, a general partner at Institutional Venture Partners in Menlo Park, Calif.Since 2011, the number of companies making venture capital investments has risen 79 percent, to 801 globally, according to Global Corporate Venturing, a data provider. The ranks include Verizon Ventures, Volvo Group Venture Capital, Chevron Venture Capital, Pfizer Venture Investments and Blue Cross Blue Shield Venture Partners.Even as total venture capital investment more than doubled from 2011 to 2015, to $58.8 billion, the amount invested by corporate venture funds quadrupled to $7.6 billion in the same period, according to the National Venture Capital Association. Corporate funds make up 12.9 percent share of the total, the highest since 2000.As a sign of how start-up valuations have waxed and waned, the size of the median late-stage fund-raising roughly tripled from 2012 to 2015, but it has fallen by 23 percent so far this year, according to Global Corporate Venturing.For many company funds, financial gain is less important than finding the next big idea.Arvind Sodhani, who led Intel\u2019s venture unit for 10 years, until mid-2015, said corporate venture investing has grown partly because of interest by chief executives. \u201cC.E.O.s who are worried they\u2019re going to get disrupted want to have an outpost in Silicon Valley to discern where the disruption is coming from,\u201d he said.Such corporate funds have \u201cclearly been driving up valuations,\u201d he added.For General Mills, which has also invested in the plant-based food maker Beyond Meat and two other start-ups, the venture capital fund is a way to keep pace with the growing number of small food brands that have found consumer success, especially online.\u201cThe traditional consumer packaged goods model of big advertising budgets, trade leverage and scale \u2014 a lot of those factors have been neutralized by these small brands,\u201d said John Haugen, who heads the General Mills venture fund after managing brands such as Nature Valley, Yoplait and Hamburger Helper. Emerging brands, he added, \u201chave alternative pathways to market online.\u201dTechnology companies pioneered corporate venture funds 30 years ago, followed by media, finance and health care companies. The two giants of the field are Intel, with stakes estimated by outsiders of more than $5 billion in more than 400 companies, and Google, now Alphabet, which has a $2.4 billion venture fund called GV with more than 300 investments.Comcast Ventures invests in companies it can later introduce to its cable and broadcast television customers. In 2009 and 2011, it took stakes in iControl Networks, a broadband home security and energy management service, and it later offered it to its customers through Xfinity Home.Comcast\u2019s portfolio also includes stakes in DocuSign, Birchbox and TiVo, as well as FanDuel, the fantasy sports betting site. Comcast introduced FanDuel to its NBC broadcast TV unit and its large customer base of sports fans.Other corporate venture funds acknowledge that their growing ranks have pushed up private company valuations. \u201cIn the last few years, there has been more and more corporate V.C. money coming in, and I do think that\u2019s had an impact on valuations,\u201d said Rob Salvagno, head of corporate development at Cisco Investments, which has $2 billion of stakes in 100 companies and 40 venture funds.Some funds have had bubble-style returns \u2014 as well as bubble-style losses. Qualcomm, a maker of chips for mobile phones, participated in a $25 million early-stage funding round for Waze, a crowd-sourced traffic application, in 2010. When Waze was acquired by Google for about $1 billion in 2013, Qualcomm\u2019s return was 10 times its investment.But some of Qualcomm\u2019s investments have struggled, too. It invested $5 million in the fitness device maker Fitbit in 2013 and had a paper profit of about 20 times its cost after Fitbit\u2019s initial public offering in mid-2015. However, Fitbit shares have since come back to earth, falling 67 percent from their post-I.P.O. peak in August.Qualcomm is prepared to invest through downturns because such stakes offer a ringside seat for \u201cthe next generation of disruptive innovation around our mobile core,\u201d said Brian Modoff, who oversees strategy, mergers and acquisitions and ventures for the company.Microsoft is renewing a venture investing push, hiring Nagraj Kashyap, the former head of Qualcomm Ventures, in January. The software giant was a big investor in tech and telecommunications companies in 1999 and 2000, but after losing about $5 billion from such investments in the three years that ended in mid-2003, it curtailed the effort in favor of more acquisitions.Venture investments have mushroomed recently at Salesforce, a maker of customer relations software, which began investing in 2009. Since 2011, Salesforce has increased its investments to $505 million, from $27 million. Five of its 150 companies have had I.P.O.s, and another seven or eight are waiting in the wings.Salesforce was one of five named participants in a $350 million investment in the cloud-storage start-up Dropbox in January 2014 that valued the company at $10 billion. Recently, however, one mutual fund investor that was part of the same investor group cut its valuation of Dropbox to less than $5 billion.John Somorjai, executive vice president of corporate development and Salesforce Ventures at Salesforce, said that he did not agree that corporate venture funds have helped inflate valuations. Prices for most investments are set by the traditional venture capital firms that lead the deals, not by the corporate participants, he said.As for Dropbox, Mr. Somorjai called it \u201ca very small investment.\u201d Salesforce does try to reflect such fluctuations in valuing its holdings, but \u201cno single investment is going to move the needle,\u201d he added.Sue Siegel, the chief executive General Electric\u2019s GE Ventures, said the company got into venture investing in 2013 to identify up-and-coming entrepreneurs in the health care and energy industries. She added that G.E. planned to stick with venture investing in the current valuation downturn. \u201cWhen you have these down cycles, it\u2019s a wonderful time for us to look.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Despite Strong Earnings, G.M. Has Much to Prove to Investors", "Date": "2016-04-21", "News": "Supported byWheelsDETROIT \u2014 SINCE going bankrupt in 2009 and needing a government bailout to survive, General Motors has methodically rebuilt itself as a profitable automaker that has capitalized on surging sales in the United States market.The company\u2019s stock price hardly budged from its recent level of $32 on the news that G.M. earned $1.95 billion in the quarter, compared to $945 million in the same period in 2015.Industry analysts have been generally impressed by G.M.\u2019s comeback from its financial problems and its recent safety crisis over faulty ignition switches linked to 124 deaths.Yet much of the credit for the healthy earnings is attributed to the strong market in the United States for new cars, rather than G.M.\u2019s improving balance sheet and new models.Now G.M., with its domestic rivals Ford Motor and Fiat Chrysler, is pushing hard to be a major player in the industry\u2019s high-technology revolution centered on autonomous vehicles and electric cars.And rather than try to develop all the technology itself, G.M. is spending freely to acquire and work with Silicon Valley companies that can accelerate its transformation from an old-line automaker into a leader in all aspects of personal mobility.\u201cThey are investing in companies that are further along than they are in new technology,\u201d said Karl Brauer, an analyst with Kelley Blue Book. \u201cAnd that\u2019s something G.M. would never have done back before its bankruptcy.\u201dInvesting in companies like the Lyft ride-hailing service is part of an effort by G.M. to shed its reputation as a plodding bureaucracy that is slow to keep up with the newest trends in the industry.The motivation to take more risks can be directly attributed to the emergence of Apple and Google as potential automakers, and the stunning success of Tesla Motors in electric cars.\u201cThe forces of change like Google and Tesla have motivated G.M. and other older automakers to defend their turf,\u201d Mr. Brauer said.Mary T. Barra, G.M.\u2019s chief, said on Thursday that the company intended to be a leader in autonomous cars and electric vehicles, even if that meant spending big for companies like Cruise Automation, a tiny software business that customizes cars with self-driving equipment.\u201cWe see a significant opportunity, and that\u2019s why we are moving so aggressively on all fronts,\u201d Ms. Barra said in a conference call with analysts.The company is also preparing to go head-to-head in competition with Tesla for customers for the first midpriced electric cars with a driving range of 200 miles.Tesla has garnered more than 325,000 orders for its Model 3, which will not be available until at least 2017. G.M. is set to begin production late this year on its Chevrolet Bolt, which has a comparable price and driving range as the new Tesla.Still, Tesla has a high-tech cachet from the success of its luxury cars. And G.M. is committed to selling the Bolt in Chevrolet showrooms that cater to mass-market consumers.\u201cThe electric car is integrated into the portfolio,\u201d Ms. Barra said.That strategy is counter to what some other big automakers are doing. Honda on Thursday said it would offer vehicles powered by fuel cells or batteries.Establishing a product line dedicated to advanced, low-emission models \u201cwill help create a new volume pillar for electrified vehicle sales,\u201d said John W. Mendel, of Honda\u2019s American division.As G.M. tries to carve out a larger business in electric cars, it is also acting to improve profit margins in its core North American business.The company is pulling back on less profitable sales of vehicles to rental fleets, and taking advantage of consumer demand for trucks by introducing variants such as its midsize pickup and a Chinese-built small sport utility vehicle.In the first quarter, G.M. increased its pretax profit in North America by 5 percent, from a year ago, to nearly $2.3 billion.It also improved in other regions, particularly in Europe, where it reduced losses to $6 million in the quarter, compared to a loss of $239 million in the same period in 2015.Still, analysts remain mixed on G.M.\u2019s outlook.Some are praising the company for its postbankruptcy restructuring that has left it in far better position to weather a slowing of domestic sales.\u201cThe great story about G.M. is that even if a sales slowdown occurs, the company is in position to still remain profitable due to an improved balance sheet, flexible production, and disciplined decision making,\u201d said David Kudla, chief executive of the investment firm Mainstay Capital Management.Other analysts said G.M. was vulnerable if the market began slipping below last year\u2019s record sales of 17.5 million vehicles in the United States.In a research note on Thursday, a Morgan Stanley analyst, Adam Jonas, warned that big profits in the American market were unsustainable in the long term because of an inevitable slowdown in consumer demand.Yet with another strong quarter behind it, G.M. may be starting to change some of the negative perceptions that have dogged it since its bankruptcy.\u201cA strong start to the year once again shows why G.M. is a fundamentally different company than it once was,\u201d the Citibank analyst Itay Michaeli said in a research note.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "European Union Calls for Big Companies to Disclose More Tax Data", "Date": "2016-04-12", "News": "Supported byBRUSSELS \u2014 European Union officials on Tuesday waded into the fight against international tax dodging, calling for the world\u2019s biggest companies to disclose more data about their tax arrangements with the bloc\u2019s member governments and to share information about offshore havens where they shelter money.A long political fight may lie ahead for the proposals to become law. The proposed rules will very likely meet resistance from some business groups and possibly even European governments that use tax inducements to attract companies and jobs.And the authorities in popular tax havens like the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands or the Channel Islands off Britain, might lobby to avoid being labeled \u201ctax jurisdictions which do not respect international tax good governance standards\u201d \u2014 as a European Union memo on the proposed rules stated, without naming any names. Deciding which jurisdictions end up on the European Union\u2019s blacklist could prove diplomatically sensitive.\u201cDrafting these lists, and pulling up the right names for tax havens, is a very political process, that\u2019s clear,\u201d said Guntram B. Wolff, the director of Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. \u201cBut the commission toughened up since the release of the Panama Papers, partly as the mood shifted and partly because of backing from France and Germany.\u201dCommission officials emphasized on Tuesday that no decisions had been made about which countries might be included on the blacklist. And they promised to hold open discussions with any country under scrutiny.But in a news conference on Tuesday in Strasbourg, France, Jonathan Hill, the European commissioner for financial services, hinted at one country that could receive a close look. \u201cIf large multinationals active in Europe are paying tax in somewhere like Panama, to take one example,\u201d Mr. Hill said, \u201cthey\u2019d need to make that public.\u201dRay Smith, a lawyer in London with Clyde & Company who advises large companies on their tax affairs, said the Panama Papers scandal had \u201cadded grist to the mill of E.U. politicians calling for urgent reform.\u201dBut he also urged caution. \u201cThe concern is, as with any populist reforms, that any new rules made in haste may overlook the fact that low-tax jurisdictions often play an important and legitimate role,\u201d Mr. Smith said.The proposals might also be brandished by groups in favor of Britain\u2019s leaving the European Union as evidence of \u201cthe strain of ever increasing E.U. regulation,\u201d he said.There also was immediate opposition to the proposals from one major lobbying group for European businesses, which said the initiative went too far by usurping the role of the national tax authorities and by forcing companies to reveal too much.The proposals would make the European Union \u201ca lone front-runner in terms of public disclosure\u201d and they \u201crisk undermining our attractiveness as a location for investment, particularly from overseas,\u201d said Markus J. Breyer, the director general for BusinessEurope in Brussels.To become law, the rules need the approval of the European Parliament and a majority of European Union governments. The rules would apply only to multinational companies with global revenue greater than 750 million euros a year, or about $855 million. That would include an estimated 6,000 companies doing business in Europe.Rather than establishing a central registry, the proposal would leave it to the bloc\u2019s member states to enforce rules requiring companies to publish tax information on their corporate websites.The information, which would be broken down by country, would include the number of employees; net revenue, including money exchanged between third parties and between business units of a group; profit before tax; and income tax due and paid each year.High levels of accumulated earnings, such as profits that are not distributed but are held in certain countries, could signal attempts to avoid taxes.The European Commission chose not to require the public releases of even more information after business groups warned against putting companies with European operations at a competitive disadvantage compared to other parts of the world.But for some advocates of tax overhauls, the rules do not go far enough because companies would mostly be allowed to publish aggregated data about their payments outside the European Union.\u201cWe still won\u2019t know anything about the activities, tax payments and potential tax agreements by multinationals across most of the world,\u201d said Elena Gaita, a policy officer in Brussels for Transparency International, which monitors corruption. \u201cAnother problem is that this environment is highly competitive,\u201d she said, \u201cso one country may not be a tax haven today but might become one tomorrow.\u201dBut the commission said the information would be sufficient to shame the companies that shift their profits mainly for tax purposes and would force them to consider changing their business practices.The overall transparency would \u201chelp the public see whether companies are acting in the best long-term interests of their shareholders from a reputational point of view,\u201d Mr. Hill said at the news conference.The European Union accelerated its efforts to curb tax avoidance after the financial crisis, which forced many governments to adopt austerity budgets, reduce public services and raise nominal tax rates.Critics contend that because tax engineering by big corporations allowed some multinationals to skirt taxes, small businesses and individual citizens bore the brunt of the impact. Politicians and policy makers sensitive to that criticism have called for banks and big corporations to pay more tax and to be less secretive about where their money goes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Drones Marshaled to Drop Lifesaving Supplies Over Rwandan Terrain", "Date": "2016-04-04", "News": "Supported byHALF MOON BAY, Calif. \u2014 From a bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean, a loud pop signals the catapult launch of a small fixed-wing drone that is designed to carry medical supplies to remote locations almost 40 miles away.\u201cThe concept of drone ports is something that a very small decision-making unit in the country decided they were going to do,\u201d said Michael Fairbanks, a member of the Rwandan president Paul Kagame\u2019s presidential advisory council. \u201cIt took a very short time. It\u2019s something that America could learn from.\u201d\u201cRwanda has a vision to become a technology hub for East Africa and ultimately the whole continent of Africa,\u201d said William Hetzler, a founder of Zipline, which is based in this seaside town. \u201cProjects like ours fit very well with that strategy.\u201dThe new drone system will initially be capable of making 50 to 150 daily deliveries of blood and emergency medicine to Rwanda\u2019s 21 transfusing facilities, mostly in hospitals and clinics in the western half of the nation.The drone system is based on a fleet of 15 small aircraft, each with twin electric motors, a 3.5-pound payload and an almost eight-foot wingspan. The system\u2019s speed makes it possible to maintain a \u201ccold chain\u201d \u2014 essentially a temperature-controlled supply chain needed to provide blood and vaccines \u2014 which is often not practical to establish in developing countries.The Zipline drones will use GPS receivers to navigate and communicate via the Rwandan cellular network. They will be able to fly in rough weather conditions, enduring winds up to 30 miles per hour.When they reach the hospitals, they will not land but will drop small packages from very low altitudes. The supplies will fall to earth suspended by simple paper parachutes. The planes will then return to a home base, where they will be prepared for a new mission by swapping in a new battery and snapping in a new flight plan stored in a SIM card.\u201cThis is the new face of the aerospace industry,\u201d said Jay Gundlach, president of FlightHouse Engineering, an Oregon-based aviation consulting firm. \u201cEstablished unmanned aircraft companies should learn from Zipline\u2019s agile and innovative culture.\u201dLike Zipline, others are trying to solve the problem of the autonomous distribution of medical supplies. Many other systems being developed, however, are based on less-efficient multicopter or quadcopter designs that have shorter range and less ability to fly in all-weather situations.Zipline began in 2014 when two of its founders, Keller Rinaudo and Mr. Hetzler, visited a young public health worker in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The worker had created a text-messaging system that enabled hospital workers to urgently request medical supplies in life-or-death situations.But Mr. Rinaudo said he realized that what he was looking at was a long list of death sentences. Today in many places worldwide, attempts are made to deliver medical supplies by motorcycle or pickup truck over roads that are frequently impassable.The public health worker \u201cshowed me the database that had entries every time someone texted, and it was thousands of names long,\u201d Mr. Rinaudo said. \u201cIt was mostly infants, and there was no response. The supply chain had no way of taking them into account.\u201dMr. Rinaudo and Mr. Hetzler set about to find an airborne alternative to automate a supply chain. They met Keenan Wyrobek, a Stanford-trained roboticist who was instrumental in the design of the PR1 robot, a pioneering general purpose mobile robot with arms, and later the more advanced PR2 robot developed by Willow Garage.The three technologists assembled an engineering team with aerospace industry experience, attracting talent from Space X, Aurora Flight Sciences, Boeing and Lockheed Martin, as well as Stanford and Google. The start-up has raised $18 million from investors including Sequoia Capital, GV (formerly Google Ventures), SV Angel, Subtraction Capital, Stanford University and individuals including Jerry Yang, a founder of Yahoo, and Paul Allen, a founder of Microsoft.Mr. Hetzler said that by placing engineers who have consumer electronics expertise in close collaboration with roboticists and aerospace engineers, it had been possible to rapidly build a highly automated system that would be operated by a staff of five to eight.In February, Zipline signed a contract with the Rwandan government to begin operating the drone service this summer. A small team will be based in a city near the Rwandan capital of Kigali to oversee the service.\u201cI always think of Peter Thiel, the venture capitalist, who said, \u2018They promised us flying cars and all we got was 140 characters,\u2019\u201d said Paul Willard, a former Boeing aerodynamics engineer who is now an investor in Zipline, referring to the social media service Twitter. \u201cThis feels a little bit more like flying cars.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Potential G.O.P. Convention Fight Puts Older Hands in Sudden Demand", "Date": "2016-04-18", "News": "Supported byThe last time Stuart Spencer courted delegates at a Republican National Convention, in 1976, he kept a roll of quarters in his pocket for when he had to run to the pay phones and call in reports to President Gerald R. Ford\u2019s campaign headquarters.This year there will be no running. Two hip replacements later, the closest Mr. Spencer plans to get to the convention floor in Cleveland is the deck of his Palm Desert, Calif., home, where he calls in advice to Gov. John Kasich\u2019s campaign almost every day.\u201cI\u2019m 89, man. I\u2019m lucky to be here,\u201d said Mr. Spencer, who last worked in politics 25 years ago.Political campaigns are often viewed as a young person\u2019s game, especially in an era in which digitally savvy, data-fixated strategists track the behavior of millions of voters nationwide and target them with increasing sophistication and precision.But this year, as Republicans face the prospect of a contested convention, the party is turning to its oldest hands, who learned how to fight over delegates using walkie-talkies, loose-leaf notebooks and quick-footed young pages.The graying delegate wranglers like Mr. Spencer have a rare and suddenly sought-after skill: They understand the arcane rules and complicated interpersonal dynamics that can persuade often unpredictable state delegates to back a candidate for president.Many of them were foot soldiers in the 1976 battle between President Ford and Ronald Reagan and find themselves unexpectedly pulled back into the game.Paul Manafort, 67, all but disappeared from American politics in recent decades to advise international leaders, including strongmen like Ferdinand E. Marcos, the former dictator of the Philippines, and Viktor F. Yanukovych, the deposed former president of Ukraine. Now, though, Mr. Manafort, who worked for the Ford campaign 40 years ago, is the lead convention strategist for Donald J. Trump. \u201cI wanted to do one more,\u201d he said.Charlie Black, 68, who is better known today as the chairman of a Washington lobbying firm that represents clients like Airbus and Google, is helping the convention operation for John Kasich, the Ohio governor. \u201cI thought I would sit in the bleachers,\u201d said Mr. Black, who worked on Reagan\u2019s behalf at the 1976 convention.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.As it happens, the Cleveland convention in July will be a reunion of sorts for Mr. Black. One of Mr. Black\u2019s field lieutenants in the Reagan delegate operation was a 24-year-old Mr. Kasich.Many Republican officials believe that a contested convention, one that begins without delegates knowing who the nominee will be, is all but certain this July. Though Mr. Trump has a lead of 744 delegates to 559 for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, neither man seems likely to secure an outright majority of 1,237 by the convention. And without a majority, the convention votes again \u2014 on second, third and subsequent ballots if necessary \u2014 until one candidate attains the 50 percent plus one that will make him the nominee. Most delegates are not required to support whomever their state\u2019s primary- or caucusgoers did after the initial ballots.Unlike the typical campaign effort, which involves trying to win over states or congressional districts or large blocs of voters, the convention involves a relatively tiny universe of people who will decide the candidates\u2019 fate \u2014 2,472 in all.When the Ford and Reagan campaigns were engaged in a delegate-by-delegate fight for the nomination, they mainly relied on thick paper dossiers stuffed with every knowable fact about their targets, from whom they married to whether they liked to play bridge or do needlepoint in their spare time.\u201cIt\u2019s literally in the trenches, one person at a time,\u201d said Mr. Black, who was just 28 at the 1976 convention. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to do it the old-fashioned way,\u201d he added, \u201cwhich is to make friends with people.\u201dIn many ways, the first contested convention of the 21st century could hark back to the 19th and early 20th centuries, when nominees were often picked after many rounds of balloting. Assets like money and media exposure will matter less than a candidate and his team\u2019s ability to connect on a human level with a few thousand delegates in a hall.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to know who they are, where they\u2019re from, what they eat, what their hobbies are, where they went to college and on and on and on,\u201d Mr. Spencer said in an interview by phone from Palm Desert. \u201cThat was true then. It\u2019s true now.\u201dIn an example of how small the elder strategists\u2019 circle is, Mr. Manafort and Mr. Black are also former business partners in a consulting firm they ran with Roger Stone, another 1976 alumnus who is also advising Mr. Trump this year, though in an informal capacity.Mr. Stone, who was a Reagan delegate wrangler at the time, said he especially admired how Mr. Manafort and the Ford team understood how to leverage the power and prestige of the White House in that battle. A state dinner with Queen Elizabeth, cocktails in the East Room, a personal visit from Vice President Nelson A. Rockefeller \u2014 the Ford campaign threw all the perks of the presidency it could at delegates.\u201cThese guys were masters at this,\u201d Mr. Stone recalled. Reagan, a former governor of California and Hollywood actor, tried to impress with his star power. He persuaded John Wayne and Jimmy Stewart to join him for dinners with delegates. But as he and his team learned, it was not the same as a call from the president.James A. Baker III, 85, who ran the Ford delegate operation and is staying neutral in this nomination fight, summed up the strategy of any effective delegate operation as: \u201cAcquire delegates, protect your delegates and steal other delegates.\u201dMr. Ford, he said, was uniquely advantaged because of \u201csomething we called \u2018the Maison Blanche.\u2019\u201d\u201cYou bring an uncommitted delegate to a dinner for the Queen of England, and it\u2019s a fairly persuasive argument,\u201d Mr. Baker added. While the Ford campaign had to be extremely sensitive to questions of corruption because scars from Watergate were still so fresh then, he said, \u201cthere are not a lot of rules about what you can and cannot do.\u201dA popular joke at the time about the patronage and favors dispensed by the White House was that when Ford stepped off Air Force One, the band did not know whether to play \u201cHail to the Chief\u201d or \u201cSanta Claus Is Coming to Town.\u201dMr. Manafort, who has known Mr. Trump for 30 years, is keeping his counsel as to what perks of the Trump world he might dole out. Lunches at his Mar-a-Lago club, rides on the Trump 757, perhaps? Those and the celebrity allure of Mr. Trump are definitely assets, Mr. Manafort said.\u201cWho would you want to sit in a room with if you were an undecided delegate? Do you want to sit with Ted Cruz or with Donald Trump?\u201d he said.Mr. Cruz\u2019s campaign, in keeping with its desire to seem as distant from Washington and the political establishment as possible, has hired mostly people with experience in internecine state convention battles.Mr. Spencer, who has been retired since 1993, said he was happy to be playing a role, even if at a distance.Although he cannot be in Cleveland \u2014 he had to give up campaign travel, just like golf and tennis, when moving around got too difficult \u2014 he said he could not resist the allure of one more race.\u201cI\u2019ll give it one last shot,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Campaigns Are Long, Expensive and Chaotic. Maybe That\u2019s a Good Thing.", "Date": "2016-04-18", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 RaceThe election of a president of the United States isn\u2019t just democracy in circuslike action. It also may be, at its core, the most elaborate and expensive recruitment and hiring process that mankind has ever created.You can think of a presidential election as being like a particularly large company\u2019s search for a chief executive. In this case, the search costs a couple of billion dollars (the amount that will be expended on campaigns), has a hiring committee of 127 million people (the number of voters last cycle), and is covered at every turn by virtually every media organization on earth.What, then, can the latest evidence about best hiring practices tell us about the election, in which hiring the best employee has particularly high stakes? Good news: The answers might just make you feel a little better about American democracy.In the last several years, there has been a lot of evidence, both from academic work and from companies that approach recruitment analytically, that traditional job interviews aren\u2019t particularly good tools for identifying the best employees.One conclusion: It\u2019s a bad idea to hire someone primarily based on a job interview, or on a manager\u2019s gut instinct. Some people perform better when being interviewed, but that seems to be a self-contained skill. It doesn\u2019t tell you much about whether a person would be a good software engineer or accountant.Major companies have come to the same conclusion. Google long had a reputation for putting job candidates through multiple interviews and asking potential employees brain-teaser-type questions to see how they responded. Not anymore.Maybe the search committee for the next president \u2014 that is, every American voter \u2014 shouldn\u2019t put too much weight on what they see in unstructured press interviews with candidates. I argue that speeches and debate performances fit the same pattern, in that they are performances that don\u2019t tell you a ton about how a person would perform in the vast portion of the presidency that takes place off-camera.So what does work? Google found that structured interviews, in which applicants are asked uniform, concrete questions, were helpful.And a large body of work suggests that tests and simulations can give particularly useful information about how a person will perform on the job.If tests and simulations are the way to go in picking an employee, what does that mean for picking a president?Perhaps the ideal scenario would be to put Ted Cruz and Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders through a simulation in which they must jump between persuading a member of Congress to vote for a highway bill and conducting an arms control negotiation.That won\u2019t happen anytime soon. But in a weird way, we might be seeing a version of exactly that simulation.What are the qualities it takes to be a successful president? He or she needs to be good at hiring and trusting the right people; making constant big decisions with limited information and often while exhausted; setting the right big picture strategy; and knowing when to stick with it as circumstances change and when to make tactical adjustments.If you look at it that way, running a presidential campaign starts to look like exactly the kind of simulation of being president that our search committee needs to pick a president!The leading candidates in this campaign come from very different backgrounds: two senators, a former secretary of state and a businessman, which makes it hard to judge them against one another. But right now we\u2019re seeing an apples-to-apples comparison in how they run a campaign.Is the campaign disciplined and well run, displaying the aforementioned mix of smart big-picture strategy and clever tactical choices? Does the candidate hire skilled employees and put trust in people who are competent? Does the candidate have the kind of stamina to put in the long hours of campaigning, or does that person get tired and say the wrong thing or make bad decisions?It\u2019s easy to criticize the length of American campaigns, and the complexity of the system by which delegates are selected to choose each party\u2019s nominee. But in a weird way, the duration and complexity of the task make campaigns an even better hiring test. Just as a daylong simulation was a better way to judge the competence of British doctors than a 90-minute test, a long campaign gives more time for a person to flunk the simulation by making bad strategic decisions, listening to bad advice or saying something stupid.In early 2008, a person would have had plenty of reason to be skeptical about whether Barack Obama, who had served in the Senate for about three years and had never run anything larger than his Senate office, had the leadership chops to run the entire federal government. The fact that he ran his primary campaign more effectively than Mrs. Clinton was one piece of evidence that he did.The American campaign system has evolved over the years without any master plan. But whenever you groan about yet another state primary or long debate, look at it this way: If you were on the search committee to hire a C.E.O., you would want the longest, hardest simulation you could get. And in your role on this very large search committee, that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re getting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Don\u2019t You Forget About Me! The Formerly Irredeemable \u201980s Return", "Date": "2016-04-20", "News": "Supported bySix nights and two afternoons a week, the synthesizers blare, the lights flash and the strains of Tears for Fears are heard over Broadway.In Los Angeles, both the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Getty are hosting major exhibitions of the work of Robert Mapplethorpe, the Ur-provocateur who shook the art world some three decades ago.What year is it, anyway?The 1980s, the more-is-more era, has never left us. It\u2019s been a touchstone for fashion, music and popular culture, remembered fondly but with a shudder, as the butt of jokes and youthful indiscretions with hairstyles and shoulder heights.But then, a strange thing has been happening. The formerly irredeemable 1980s, it seems, are creeping back to the fore.\u201cI do see that coming around again,\u201d said Duncan Sheik, who wrote the music and lyrics for \u201cAmerican Psycho,\u201d an \u201980s-set Broadway musical that opens Thursday, one that includes both original \u201980s-style compositions (written and scored using \u201980s synthesizers and equipment) and adaptations of decade hits by Tears for Fears, New Order and Phil Collins. It is likely the first Broadway musical in history whose bloody climax takes place to Huey Lewis and the News\u2019 \u201cHip to Be Square.\u201d\u201cI think for a long time people made fun of the \u201980s aesthetic, and it was something that was derided in Adam Sandler movies,\u201d Mr. Sheik said. \u201cBut in fact a lot of really cool stuff happened in the \u201980s. In some way, hopefully, \u2018American Psycho\u2019 does justice to the aesthetic of the era.\u201dIn the theater world, the arrival of \u201cAmerican Psycho\u201d on Broadway has been much anticipated (and long in coming, after a well-received run in London), but its ripples have been felt outside of it, too.The men\u2019s fashion e-tailer Mr Porter signed up as the men\u2019s wardrobe partner for the Broadway production, and \u201980s period piece or not, provided clothing from its stock to costume the cast and complement the vintage and custom \u201980s suits \u2014 an easier task circa 2016 than may be initially imagined.In women\u2019s fashion, too, the \u201980s are making a return. When, at Paris Fashion Week this March, shoulders began climbing up and out, it was an early warning sign, of sorts.Hedi Slimane, among the most imitated designers in fashion at the moment, swerved dramatically from the scruffy nonchalance of his recent, best-selling Saint Laurent collections into a high-gloss, high-drama register that screamed 1980s. It would be his final collection for Saint Laurent; the house announced his departure a month later.The change was noticed, not always with pleasure.Mr. Slimane was not alone. Eighties styles bubbled up throughout Paris Fashion Week: in new-direction looks from Lanvin, Kenzo and Isabel Marant, to name a few.For Ms. Marant, whose name is nearly synonymous with Parisian bohemians, the move toward oversize, pin-cinched coats, screaming prints and New Wave mash-up styling seemed especially pronounced \u2014 even if Ms. Marant didn\u2019t see the shift as seismic as her audience did.\u201cThings that I love, I will always love them,\u201d she said by phone from Paris, describing how the collection came about as a reaction to the death of David Bowie and the horror of the Paris terror attacks: a way to return to an earlier, more innocent time of club-hopping and flea-marketing.She keeps a large archive she said, not only of her collections but also of her own clothes, which she visited regularly while designing the fall looks. She used to pin her own huge Harris tweed overcoat (bought for a song from a \u201ckilo shop,\u201d where vintage clothes were sold by weight), just as she did for the show.She disputed the notion that there was one \u201980s style. For her, she said, the joy of the \u201980s was the freedom to dabble in many: rockabilly one day, new wave the next. Think of 1980s icons who piled on vintage and secondhand looks with reckless abandon, women like Cyndi Lauper (who, by the way, is still touring the nation, with Boy George in tow).\u201cI think that there are very strong different points of view, like we had in the \u201980s,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel that something of this spirit is coming back.\u201dThe Chelsea store closed in 1997, replaced by a Madison Avenue outpost. The Madison shop remains, but Barneys is back on Seventh Avenue. (A charity fashion show and auction of leather jackets, a callback to the 1986 original, was planned for the March opening, this time supporting White Columns gallery and the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender Community Center; when the fashion show was scuppered because of space constraints, the auction was held online instead.)Look around, and the spirit crops up everywhere. You can take your \u201980s at the movies, whether sporting, as in Richard Linklater\u2019s \u201cEverybody Wants Some!!\u201d or swooning, as in \u201cOnce\u201d director John Carney\u2019s \u201cSing Street,\u201d about would-be Dubliner rockers agog over Duran Duran.You can take it on TV (or whatever streaming device has replaced your TV): on CNN, a seven-part documentary series, \u201cThe Eighties,\u201d began on March 31; on Netflix, Winona Ryder (breakout star of \u201cBeetlejuice\u201d in 1988) stars in \u201cStranger Things,\u201d a thriller billed as \u201ca love letter to the \u201980s classics that captivated a generation,\u201d which will debut July 15.In Mr. Trump, the 21st century may have its first ascendant politician who seems beamed in from the decade.\u201cEverything that drives his candidacy is in the \u2018Art of the Deal,\u2019\u201d said Mike Berland of Berland Strategy & Analytics, who is a political strategist and pollster, referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s 1987 book.While still at the strategy firm Penn Schoen Berland, Mr. Berland advised Mr. Trump on various \u201980s-vintage projects, including the fabled Trump Shuttle airline. \u201cWhen he writes, \u2018I never get too attached to one deal or one approach,\u2019\u201d Mr. Berland said, \u201cand about the press\u2019s hunger for a good story, the more controversial the better: Those inform his core beliefs and way he operates. That\u2019s what I see in my social media conversation data \u2014 he has dominated coverage with so many ideas and controversial comments. Some good, some not as effective. That mentality, I think, comes from the \u201980s, a little bit more of a selfish, self-involved era.\u201dWhat\u2019s more, the second-highest demographic of \u201980s listeners on the platform are men from 18 to 24, according to the company \u2014 \u201990s babies who missed the decade entirely. Even some in the highest demographic of listeners, men 25 to 34, would have missed the \u201980s or enjoyed it in their infancy.\u201cI was just a baby in the \u201980s,\u201d said Ms. Prentiss, whose book contains portions set in 1980. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know much about it apart from \u2018Kids Incorporated.\u2019\u201dShe had not initially expected to focus on the decade. \u201cIt ended up being an \u201980s book, even though it wasn\u2019t intended to be,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting that it\u2019s sort of trending now, the late \u201970s, early \u201980s. I started the book seven years ago. I feel like it\u2019s lucky. People are interested in that right now.\u201dFenton Bailey, who, with his collaborator, Randy Barbato, directed \u201cMapplethorpe: Look at the Pictures,\u201d which premiered this month on HBO, agreed.\u201cYou could say, on the one hand, it\u2019s nostalgia,\u201d Mr. Bailey said in an interview. \u201cWhat is nostalgia other than a sufficient amount of time has passed that you can forget the reality of what it was like and romanticize it?\u201d (He cautioned against undue romance: His East Village, he said, \u201cwas shabby chic without the chic bit.\u201d)\u201cI think there\u2019s something more happening,\u201d he said. \u201cYou really need a generation before you can look back and put something in its proper context.\u201dThe generations have passed, though today\u2019s generation, Google-weaned, can quickly make a fetish of whatever decade the moment happens to favor. The \u201970s are never far from the popular imagination. The \u201990s are enjoying their own durable revival, too. (The O. J. Simpson case is once again a water-cooler obsession.)Then there are those classics that bridge the blurry \u201980s and \u201990s divide, like the treacle classic \u201cFull House\u201d (1987-95), reborn as \u201cFuller House,\u201d or Hulk Hogan, the wrestler, enjoying a very strange third act.But the \u201980s arrived again (not for the first nor, surely, the last time) with their own special victory, given the low esteem in which they are sometimes held.\u201cIt\u2019s a decade that gets harsh press,\u201d said Mr. Langmead, of Mr Porter, who looked back not entirely fondly on the styles of his own 1980s youth as a fashion student at Central Saint Martins in London.Nevertheless, there\u2019s a generation \u201cgrowing up looking back at it, and they\u2019ll think it\u2019s very cool and retro,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll be able to look on it with rosy-tinted spectacles, which will help it be picked up again.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Some Online Bargains May Only Look Like One", "Date": "2016-04-13", "News": "Supported byAmazon has some unbelievable bargains on its virtual shelves.You say you don\u2019t believe that a plastic cat pan could ever have been sold to anyone for a couple of thousand bucks? Or that a six-ounce bag of Zuke\u2019s Lil\u2019 Links pork and apple sausage bits ever cost more than dinner at a five-star restaurant?It\u2019s all part of the bizarre world of Internet \u201cdiscounts,\u201d which let retailers and brands assert that you are getting a stupendous deal because someone somewhere else \u2014 exactly where is never explained \u2014 is being charged much more.So if you are the sort of consumer who cares about such things, how can you guard against such pressure? When does e-commerce deliver on low prices, and when is it merely coasting on its reputation?These are particularly significant issues now, as Internet retail shifts from being mostly about price to being largely about convenience. That will make it much harder for customers to judge independently if they are getting a deal or merely being encouraged to think so.First, realize that the problem is at least as pervasive online as offline \u2014 and even less regulated. California, which has relatively strict laws about deceptive advertising, brought a successful case against Overstock.com for illusory discounts. But authorities elsewhere seem to have little interest.Over the last month, more research has been done on the shadowy world of Internet discounts that underline how random or even whimsical list prices are.Boomerang Commerce, a retail analytics firm, compared the list prices of dozens of pet items on Amazon and the specialist pet site Chewy.com. In only a handful of cases did the retailers even agree on what the list price was. So a 22-pound bag of Blue Buffalo Basics Limited Ingredient Grain-Free Duck and Potato dog food had a list price of $131 on Amazon and $84 on Chewy. Yet the retail price at both sites was the same: $49.49.\u201cA perceived deeper discount creates a higher conversion event \u2014 in other words, more buyers,\u201d said Boomerang\u2019s chief executive, Guru Hariharan, who previously worked at Amazon.Blue Buffalo declined to comment and Chewy did not respond to messages seeking comment. Amazon removed the $131 list price for the dog food and the 99 percent deals I asked about. An Amazon spokesman, Craig Berman, declined to answer any questions.A little over 44 percent of the products \u2014 some sold directly by Amazon, others by third parties \u2014 were billed as discounted, Ripen said. \u201cIt\u2019s less than I expected, actually,\u201d said Dave Rekuc, Ripen\u2019s director of marketing. \u201cConsidering you can basically name your own list price.\u201dSome e-commerce experts said nothing needed to be done about illusory discounts, because the merchants needed them so much.The process \u201ccan seem dishonest to consumers, but let\u2019s consider the retailer\u2019s side,\u201d said Daniel Green of CamelCamelCamel.com, an oddly named but useful site that tracks Amazon prices. \u201cIf they weren\u2019t using the list price as the benchmark, what would they use?\u201dRetailers could choose the most recent price as the comparison, Mr. Green said, but then \u201cthey would just jack the price way up before the sale. I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a good solution here, particularly as consumers apparently respond to large M.S.R.P.-based discounts.\u201d\u201cThe fact that plaintiff may have been manipulated into purchasing the items because she believed she was getting a bargain does not necessarily mean she suffered economic harm,\u201d United States District Judge F. Dennis Saylor IV wrote.For others, however, e-commerce is not living up to its promise of being transparent and pro-consumer.Her site tracks litigation against the retailers. Wayfair, an online furniture retailer, has been sued in a pricing case that is pending. A case against Amazon faltered because its customers waived their rights to sue in favor of arbitration.E-commerce is in flux. The selling point is increasingly getting something now rather than getting it cheap. Online shoppers are encouraged to live in an ecosystem where they buy as much as possible from one company. The pioneer of this, of course, is Amazon, with its annual Prime fee that covers shipping.In an ecosystem, prices are much harder to calculate, or perhaps even impossible. Customers have to trust the retailer, a problematic situation.\u201cPricing can be complex,\u201d said Mr. Hariharan of Boomerang Commerce. \u201cIn some places it\u2019s highly transparent. But there are others where you have to do the math. You have to check the impact of shipping costs, promotions, coupons and loyalty rewards.\u201dSome consumers feel manipulated. Charlie Allenson, a New Yorker who teaches business skills using improv comedy, was recently shopping for an audio interface that would turn his computer into a recording studio.On one e-commerce site, the list price was $170. At another, it was more. At a third, it was much less.\u201cI felt like someone was playing three-card monte with me,\u201d Mr. Allenson said. \u201cThere\u2019s a dishonesty factor with all those different list prices.\u201dEven though the final sale price was exactly the same \u2014 $100 \u2014 he did not buy any of them.Advertisement"}

If you click on demographics, one of the so-called data stories appears, based largely on data from the American Community Survey of the United States Census Bureau.Using colorful graphics and short sentences, it shows the median age of foreign-born residents of New York (44.7) and of residents born in the United States (28.6); the most common countries of origin for immigrants (the Dominican Republic, China and Mexico); and the percentage of residents who are American citizens (82.8 percent, compared with a national average of 93 percent).Data USA embodies an approach to data analysis that will most likely become increasingly common, said Kris Hammond, a computer science professor at Northwestern University. The site makes assumptions about its users and programs those assumptions into its software, he said.\u201cIt is driven by the idea that we can actually figure out what a user is going to want to know when they are looking at a data set,\u201d Mr. Hammond said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.U. Charges Dispute Google\u2019s Claims That Android Is Open to All", "Date": "2016-04-20", "News": "Supported byGoogle has long stressed that Android, its popular mobile software, is open for anyone to use, including its rivals.Margrethe Vestager, the European Union\u2019s antitrust chief, said Google had required some of the cellphone manufacturers to preinstall the company\u2019s services, including its Google Play smartphone application store, and had given them unfair financial incentives to favor Google\u2019s services on their mobile devices. Those practices undermined competition and consumer choice, she said.\u201cGoogle has abused its dominant position,\u201d Ms. Vestager said on Wednesday. The company\u2019s \u201cbehavior has harmed consumers by restricting innovation in the wider mobile space.\u201dThe company denies it has broken European competition rules, and the charges may not lead to financial or other penalties against Google, which now has three months to respond to the accusations.By taking aim at Android \u2014 the mobile software that holds more than 80 percent of the worldwide market share for smartphone operating systems \u2014 Europe has opened the latest chapter in its continuing battle with American technology companies.Europe\u2019s antitrust claims highlight Google\u2019s increasingly thorny relationships with smartphone manufacturers such as HTC and Samsung, among others. Ms. Vestager said Android\u2019s prominent role in the mobile market was not in question but that she was concerned the contracts the company signed with smartphone manufacturers had made it difficult, if not impossible, for rival search engines and smartphone app stores to compete in the European Union.\u201cIf a company is dominant, that\u2019s fine,\u201d Ms. Vestager told reporters. \u201cBut if that dominance is abused, then we have an issue.\u201d She declined to name which cellphone manufacturers might be affected, citing their right to privacy.The device makers, already struggling against cutthroat competition, have become reliant on Google\u2019s digital services available on Android, even as they have tried to persuade consumers to try their own mobile services or those of Google\u2019s competitors. Some, including Samsung, have backed rival operating systems to loosen Android\u2019s grip, but such efforts have so far proved unsuccessful.And while global cellphone manufacturers once profited from using Android to expand rapidly, particularly in emerging markets, their growth has since slowed.Analysts say these cellphone makers\u2019 inability to wean consumers off Google\u2019s popular mobile mapping, email and other services has potentially shut them out of billions of dollars in extra revenue as people\u2019s digital habits \u2014 including online search and e-commerce purchases \u2014 shift to mobile devices.\u201cTheir attempts at beating Google\u2019s services haven\u2019t worked,\u201d said Neil Mawston, a mobile analyst at the technology research group Strategy Analytics. \u201cFor most companies that want to operate in the smartphone market, there isn\u2019t another option but to use Google.\u201dRepresentatives from the leading smartphone manufacturers declined to comment on their relationship with Google.The dominance of Android, at least in Europe and the United States, is almost absolute.The basic Android software can be downloaded for free and modified by device makers and telecom operators.In total, Google\u2019s version of Android powers more than 98 percent of the Android-based smartphones in Europe and the United States, according to Ian Fogg, a senior director at IHS, a technology consultancy in London.Only in China, where Google is banned, and Russia, where the local search engine Yandex holds a significant market share, does Google not dominate in mobile.\u201cIf someone buys an Android device in Europe or the U.S., it\u2019s almost certainly Google\u2019s version,\u201d said David McQueen, research director at ABI Research in London.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.If Google is found to have broken European rules, the company may face fines of as much as 10 percent of its annual revenue. Given the company\u2019s recent annual revenue, that could be roughly $7 billion. Such a high financial penalty is unlikely, however, according to legal experts.The company could also be forced to alter its Android software to give competitors a greater position in its mobile software or to change its existing contracts with cellphone makers.That would potentially provide Europeans with a wider choice of mobile services than would be available to their American counterparts. Most people in the 28 member states of the European Union, though, still rely primarily on Google services for many daily activities.Paulo Trezentos, chief executive of Aptoide, a rival Portuguese Android app store that is one of the complainants in the European competition case against Google, said his company would welcome greater access to Android users.\u201cGoogle makes it difficult for people to install applications from rivals,\u201d Mr. Trezentos said. \u201cIt\u2019s actively making it harder to compete.\u201dIn the United States, some lawmakers on Wednesday called on the Federal Trade Commission to more closely scrutinize Google after Europe\u2019s charges. In 2013, the F.T.C. closed a two-year antitrust investigation into Google\u2019s search business, citing a lack of evidence for pursuing a case. The F.T.C. said it did not comment on or confirm investigations.Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, who is a member of the Judiciary Committee, said regulations and laws differed in Europe and the United States but \u201cthe spirit and goal of our laws is very similar.\u201d\u201cThere is now clearly a need for exacting and penetrating scrutiny,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal said in an interview. \u201cPerhaps it is overdue. But it is now clearly necessary.\u201dAn article on Thursday about European Union antitrust charges against Google misstated the process though which Google receives revenue related to its Android operating system. Google earns revenue from, among other sources, advertising generated from services like mobile search that are included in the software. It does not receive fees from device makers.Cecilia Kang and Farhad Manjoo contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

They say that American privacy safeguards \u2014 including the United States Constitution \u2014 often provide better protection than the rules in other jurisdictions, including those in Europe.\u201cWe care about Europeans\u2019 privacy,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Obama said in Hanover, \u201cnot just Americans\u2019 privacy.\u201d\u201cThe digital world is globalized,\u201d Giovanni Buttarelli, the European Union\u2019s data protection supervisor, said at the Berlin conference on Monday. \u201cSo data protection should also be globalized.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "An English Country House With a Grand History of Horse Racing", "Date": "2016-04-07", "News": "Supported byNEWMARKET, England \u2014 Overlooking Warren Hill Gallops and the open heath, where horses are trained daily in the celebrated British racing town of Newmarket, stands a house of notable architectural merit and great horse racing heritage.Mesnil Warren, which is on the market at 2.95 million pounds, or $4.2 million, was built in Newmarket, in the county of Suffolk, in the 1890s as a racing lodge and has been in the family of its current owner, George Lambton, since 1908.Mr. Lambton is the grandson of the Honorable George Lambton, a renowned thoroughbred racehorse trainer who was the fifth son of the second Earl of Durham and had a long career in the sport. As an amateur jockey he won the Grand Steeple-Chase de Paris in 1888, and working for Lord Derby he was the British flat racing champion trainer in 1906, 1911 and 1912. \u201cThe story goes that a long time after buying Mesnil Warren he made a good bet on one of his horses, Sansovino, winning the Epsom Derby in 1924, and that with the money he made he decided to build a large extension,\u201d Mr. Lambton said. \u201cWhether this actually happened we really don\u2019t know, but what is true is that my grandmother, Cicely Lambton, knew the architect, Sir Edwin Lutyens, and so he was commissioned to design the new wing.\u201dLutyens, who designed the Cenotaph war memorial in London\u2019s Whitehall, as well as much of New Delhi, India, was also a prolific furniture designer, and in the United States is perhaps best known for his teak garden bench. For a time he was also at the heart of the Arts and Crafts movement in Britain, which brought an emphasis on the use of quality materials and decorative design at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries.\u201cThe Lutyens wing was originally designed to provide extra guest bedrooms and further staff accommodation,\u201d Mr. Lambton said. \u201cIt does sit well with the original building and has some interesting features of its own, such as plastered parts of external guttering, which look rather like interior cornicing.\u201dMr. Lambton\u2019s grandfather died in 1945 and his wife, Cicely, continued to live at Mesnil Warren until 1972, when the 10,372-square-foot house was taken over by his son, Teddy Lambton, who was also a racehorse trainer.\u201cI pretty much grew up here from the age of 10 and remember my parents completely refurbishing it in the 1970s. My father died in 1983; then when my mother died in 1996, my wife, Lisa, and I, who were living in London at the time, decided to move up here with our family,\u201d said Mr. Lambton, who is a former lord mayor of Newmarket and is now training to be a psychotherapist.\u201cIt has been fun: We have enjoyed living somewhere that you can fill with family and friends and not even know they are there. The guest areas are all easy to maintain and to separate from the rest of the house if you wish to.\u201dRed brick-built Mesnil Warren sits in approximately two and a half acres of land and once included a stable yard. Today the grounds comprise areas of landscaped garden, as well as garaging and workshop areas, a tennis court and a summer house.The property has 11 bedrooms, as well as a self-contained two-bedroom apartment, across three stories of accommodation. The Lutyens wing, which was added to the north side of the house, has some typically Arts and Crafts features, including an upper floor under the roof and attractive dormer windows. The rest of the property retains its classic Victorian style.Four bedrooms, including the 414-square-foot master bedroom, which has its own bathroom and dressing room, are on the second floor of the original part of the building. Above, on the third floor, is the apartment, which has two bedrooms, a bathroom and a kitchen. There is also a sitting room of approximately 330 square feet, which opens onto a balcony.\u201cFrom here and from the master bedroom below you have the most amazing view out over the garden and on to the Gallops behind, where you can see the racehorses training every morning,\u201d Mr. Lambton said.The ground floor of the newer part of the house includes the 393-square-foot kitchen breakfast room, as well as a study, family room and various storage and utility areas. A rear staircase leads up to two guest bedrooms and a second-floor drawing room of approximately 480 square feet, which has exterior steps down to the garden. On the third floor there are five more guest bedrooms and two bathrooms.Among the most impressive rooms in the older part of the property is the grand drawing room of approximately 700 square feet. This has a high paneled ceiling, an elegant fireplace and an arch adorning a bay window. The 412-square-foot dining room is also a splendid space and, like the entrance hall to the house, is graced with paintings of some of the famous racehorses that were trained by Mr. Lambton\u2019s father and grandfather.\u201cWhile this house could suit all sorts of people, I expect that whoever buys it is likely to have more than a passing interest in racing,\u201d Mr. Lambton said. \u201cWhat they are buying into here is a part of the racing history of Newmarket.\u201dJames Barnett, head of country residential at Savills Cambridge, the real estate agent marketing the property, described Newmarket as \u201cthe home of English racing,\u201d but said it was also desirable for its proximity to Cambridge, about 13 miles away.\u201cCambridge continues to grow and many new companies are moving to the city, including biotech, pharmaceutical and technology companies, such as AstraZeneca, Apple and Google,\u201d he said.Noting the array of available properties in both Cambridge and Newmarket, Mr. Barnett called this one \u201cexceptional, in part because it has a Lutyens- designed wing.\u201d\u201cProperties built or modified by Lutyens are highly prized,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

But she also found herself stirred by the spirit of the event.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t about looking good or weight loss or fitting into a certain type of clothing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she recalled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Hey, you fat person, you need to do this or you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to die.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 It was, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I love you and I want you to love yourself enough to invest in 30 minutes a day, to walk yourself to freedom like Harriet Tubman did.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And that spoke deeply for me because my life work is showing up for other people, but I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t showing up for myself.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThames completed the 100-minute walk that day. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy body was in pain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she recalled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut it felt good to be out there with other women. It was really encouraging because it was something I could do. So I committed to walking every day.\u00e2\u0080\u009dShe kept that promise. Over the past three years, she has lost more than 230 pounds. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI gained mental clarity and the resolve to take care of myself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.In the Forest Hill section of Jackson, Miss., for example, 15 to 20 women meet every weekday at 4:30 a.m. for a brisk walk. They call their team \u00e2\u0080\u009cFour Dark Thirty\u00e2\u0080\u009d (they meet before sunrise).\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a chore, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not exercise, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just going for a walk, and having a moment to reflect,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Cynthia Thompson, an assistant director at Greater Bethlehem Temple Church, who is a volunteer city captain for GirlTrek in Jackson. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSome people in my church never had an in-depth conversation with each other until we started walking. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s amazing the conversations that come up when you walk.\u00e2\u0080\u009dEach week, thousands of trekkers participate in \u00e2\u0080\u009cSuperhero Saturday\u00e2\u0080\u009d walks. Groups of black women in bright blue T-shirts walking together have become regular features in hundreds of neighborhoods and parks.Bennett was so impressed that he joined GirlTrek\u00e2\u0080\u0099s board, as did Dr. Regina Benjamin, a former United States surgeon general. Together, they lead a committee focused on research and evaluation of GirlTrek\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impact on health.GirlTrek grew out of the experiences of its two founders, Vanessa Garrison and Morgan Dixon, friends from college days, and began as a simple act of self-care and love. Garrison grew up in Seattle. When she was 5, her mother started using heroin; she was an addict for 15 years and spent eight years in prison. Garrison was reared by her grandmother and aunt and recalls a lot of emotional pain in the household.\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo much was happening negatively for the women who raised me: depression, despair, sadness and loneliness,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI felt a lot of guilt, but I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t able to give back to them in any substantial way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She began walking as \u00e2\u0080\u009ca very personal way of how you can heal from childhood traumas.\u00e2\u0080\u009dDixon grew up in Sacramento. Her parents came from Oklahoma. Her grandparents had been sharecroppers; one of her grandmothers had 11 children while the other had nine. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy maternal grandmother gave birth to one of her kids on an abandoned school bus,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy mother desegregated her high school in 1958. She experienced lots of trauma and she still wears that.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAfter college, the two began successful careers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe had good jobs and husbands, but it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel good because so many of the women we knew weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t living the life we were living,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dixon recalled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe thought, \u00e2\u0080\u0098How do we start helping the women we know come along on this journey with us?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And being overweight was the outward manifestation of what we knew to be deeper themes.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn 2010, they got the idea for a 10-week walking challenge. They emailed 200 black women and asked them to forward the message. Six hundred responses came back from across the country. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt the end of 10 weeks, we weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t prepared for what happened,\u00e2\u0080\u009d recalled Garrison. Stories flooded in. People said they were amazed they had been able to stick with it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe heard: \u00e2\u0080\u0098This is changing my life. When are we going to do it again?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009dThey began to wonder: Was there a need for a health movement for black women, led by black women, grounded in their values and culture? They mined inspiration from black history, the poetry of Nikki Giovanni and Sonia Sanchez, hip-hop and gospel music. They created a Facebook page as a platform for sharing stories. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen we first Googled \u00e2\u0080\u0098healthy black women and girls,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 porno images came up,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dixon recalled. They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t any longer. Within two years, they had 100,000 followers and 12,000 trekkers who were reporting their walks every week and regularly posting pledges, testimonies and photos.Read previous contributions to this series.One problem is that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to inspire behavior by focusing on long-term goals. Behavioral scientists say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more effective to highlight near-term benefits embedded in an activity itself.That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what GirlTrek\u2019s members do. They emphasize the rewards of taking time for yourself, getting outside and connecting with others in a nonjudgmental and noncompetitive environment. They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t talk about hypertension or body mass index, but about feeling less anxious and having more energy. They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t talk about looking good, but about looking alive: having the \u00e2\u0080\u009cGirlTrek glow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They inspire women with images of courage and dignity. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey have lots of process motivators around black history \u00e2\u0080\u0094 walking as Harriet Tubman did or retracing the steps at Selma \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and they rapidly recycle them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bennett.They acknowledge the struggles and inequities that women face. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe mental act of saying every day, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to set aside time to do something that is healthy for myself even though I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m overwhelmed because I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pay my bills, my neighborhood is riddled with crime, and there are no sidewalks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that in itself is an act of resistance,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Garrison.One million is an audacious goal, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be following up to see how it goes. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s striking to consider how much change GirlTrek has already put in motion \u00e2\u0080\u0094 especially given that it has a full-time staff of six and a budget of $725,000. \u00e2\u0080\u009cInnovation doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t require a lot of money,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Garrison. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt requires a lot of passion. And we have that.\u00e2\u0080\u009dFor Thames, her weight loss has been just the beginning. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can lose the physical weight and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still carrying around the mental stuff,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are moments when I see a booth in a restaurant and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m still nervous if I can fit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m doing work on defining myself and my relationships with others,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis body renders me vulnerable in a way that I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t consider before. When you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in a \u00e2\u0080\u0098normal\u00e2\u0080\u0099 size body, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all this sexuality and fashion and consumerism that gets put on it. There are a lot of layers of perfectionism that get added to this body that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m in now.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAnd there are new pleasures. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI went out to Colorado with GirlTrek and we hiked up a mountain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBeing able to do that was overwhelming.

Their nights are still spent at the house, though, and by the third episode events point toward a possible return of operations to their Palo Alto garage.The season picks up where the previous one ended, repeating the moment when Richard Hendricks (Thomas Middleditch), the chief brain and chief executive of Pied Piper, tells his crew, \u201cI just got fired.\u201d The subsequent maneuvering, in which everyone but Richard \u2014 and his acolyte Jared (Zach Woods) \u2014 acknowledges that he\u2019s better suited for a different role, is a showcase for Mr. Middleditch\u2019s delineation of the ubergeek personality: strangled awkwardness that barely holds in check overpowering arrogance and rage. It also allows for the introduction of the fine comic actor Stephen Tobolowsky as Jack Barker, the fake-folksy new executive with whom Richard has to do battle for the soul of Pied Piper. (In a repeated gag, Richard tentatively gives his interpretations of how things are going, and Mr. Tobolowsky, as Barker, responds with variations on his trademarked, high-pitched \u201cOh, GOD no!\u201d)The show continues to score points off the real Silicon Valley\u2019s culture of unapologetic excess \u2014 forced to track down Jack, Richard finds him monitoring two of his thoroughbred horses engaging in some extremely graphic breeding \u2014 and to generate laughs from the interplay of the misanthropic Gilfoyle (Martin Starr) and the miserable Dinesh (Kumail Nanjiani), the show\u2019s Norm and Cliff. It also continues to demonstrate a knack for making business and technology strategies a comprehensible and effective component of its storytelling, as Richard encounters a sales force that wants to turn Pied Piper into a faceless commodity sold to soulless corporations. (Less admirably, it continues to indulge in lazy stereotyping and easy, unfunny jokes when it comes to Asian characters like Jimmy O. Yang\u2019s heavily accented Jian-Yang and occasionally even Dinesh.)\u201cSilicon Valley\u201d is, among other things, a morality play, with Richard and his crew endlessly battling the forces that would strip away the democratizing, world-changing features of Pied Piper (which are mostly obscure and swaddled in tech speak) and that sniff at the notion of five adult friends living, working and smoking together in a suburban ranch house. That insistence can get a little tedious, and it\u2019s worth noting that the smartest, funniest moments of Season 2 involved the craven Gavin Belson (wonderfully played by Matt Ross), chief executive of the evil Google-esque behemoth Hooli, as he fought to stave off ruin. That subplot is fainter but still present, as Gavin uses a loophole to dismiss an entire division and announces, \u201cIt is I who must remain and bear the heavy burden of their failure.\u201d In comedy as in life, the villains are usually the most fun.Advertisement"}

This week is a different matter.It might seem O.K. to sneer at the companies that increasingly run much of our lives, but a deeper reading of the reports shows an industry in transition, and perhaps getting ready to get even bigger.Of course, each unhappy company is unhappy in its own way, and Yahoo has a very particular form of sadness. For over a decade it has tried to figure out if it was a technology company or a media company, succeeding in neither while holding a sizable audience.The others, however, are each coping with transitions: All save Google are dealing with a transition to cloud computing, and the diminishing importance of personal computers at home and in the office.Even IBM counted on its software being consumed in a world where people used PCs. Now, the old services and hardware business are in trouble, but it showed progress in selling cloud and artificial intelligence services. The company also almost doubled its cash on hand, to $14 billion, in just one quarter.Microsoft has to adjust to selling fewer PC operating systems and making money off its cloud, and before Thursday\u2019s slip saw its shares near a 16-year high. It has $105 billion in cash, up $9 billion in the last three quarters.Wall Street appears to be worried that Google increased its head count over the last quarter, but net income per employee was $65,616 in the recent quarter, up from $63,426 a year ago. Earlier this week Goldman Sachs, considered pretty good at making money, had per-employee net earnings of $31,095. Google also bumped the cash it has on hand by about $2 billion over the quarter, to $75 billion.If the new hopefuls don\u2019t make it and have to sell at big markdowns compared with their once-lofty valuations, there are a few big tech companies that have gathered the cash to buy them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On Encryption Battle, Apple Has Advocates in Ex-National Security Officials", "Date": "2016-04-22", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In their years together as top national security officials, Michael V. Hayden and Michael Chertoff were fierce advocates of using the government\u2019s spying powers to pry into sensitive intelligence data.Mr. Hayden directed a secret domestic eavesdropping program at the National Security Agency that captured billions of phone records after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Mr. Chertoff pushed for additional wiretapping and surveillance powers from Congress both as a top prosecutor and as Homeland Security secretary.But today, their jobs have changed, and so, apparently, have their views on privacy. Both former officials now work with technology companies like Apple at a corporate consulting firm that Mr. Chertoff founded, and both are now backing Apple \u2014 and not the F.B.I., with which they once worked \u2014 in its fight to keep its iPhones encrypted and private.They are among more than a half-dozen prominent former national security officials who, to varying degrees, have supported Apple and the idea of impenetrable \u201cend-to-end encryption\u201d during a furious national debate over the balance between privacy and security in the digital age.In white papers, op-ed articles, conferences, newspaper and television interviews and elsewhere, the former officials have made their support for Apple clear. While their former jobs in the government are always featured prominently in their public appearances, their current business affiliations often go unmentioned.The barrage of support has given Apple a public relations boost in a fight it once seemed destined to lose, but it has surprised and angered some law enforcement officials.These officials question whether the business relationships that some of the former officials now have with Apple and other Silicon Valley companies \u2014 jobs that usually pay far above their former government salaries \u2014 are behind their enthusiastic advocacy of privacy and encryption.Among those who have voiced support for Apple\u2019s position are Mike McConnell, a former director of national intelligence; David H. Petraeus, a former director of the Central Intelligence Agency; R. James Woolsey, another former C.I.A. director; and Richard A. Clarke, a former top White House counterterrorism official. Like Mr. Chertoff and Mr. Hayden, they all now work with firms that have ties to the technology sector, records show.It is unclear how much money Apple and other technology firms involved in the F.B.I. litigation have paid to the firms where the former officials now work; most of the firms declined to discuss their private business dealings, calling them irrelevant.Mr. McConnell, who served as national intelligence director under President Obama and George W. Bush, argues that keeping the United States\u2019 computer systems safe from rival nations and rogue hackers should outweigh the F.B.I.\u2019s interests in unlocking smartphones in criminal cases.The technology company has been locked in a major legal battle against law enforcement officials over privacy and security.\u201cI believe ubiquitous encryption is something that the nation is going to have to embrace,\u201d Mr. McConnell, who is now a senior executive adviser at the consulting giant Booz Allen Hamilton, said in a telephone interview. \u201cApple has been leading the fight to go down that path, Google is right behind and Microsoft will be there before too long.\u201dBooz Allen\u2019s executive vice president, Thad W. Allen, a former Coast Guard commandant, has also voiced support for Apple\u2019s position on encryption, because, he said, American technology firms need to stay competitive in the international market.Booz Allen has made a recent push to form \u201cstrategic alliances\u201d with Apple and other technology companies, executives said.Mr. McConnell and other former national security officials said that their work in the private sector had no impact on their public support for Apple. Not everyone agrees.Some current law enforcement officials say they have been angered by the former officials\u2019 sharp and sometimes personal criticism of the F.B.I. (Mr. Hayden, for instance, said in an interview, \u201cI think Jim Comey\u2019s wrong,\u201d referring to the bureau\u2019s director.)The Justice Department and the F.B.I. declined to comment. But Stewart Baker, a former Homeland Security official who is one of the few former officials publicly backing the F.B.I. in the encryption debate, said it was frustrating to see old colleagues now echoing what he sees as erroneous assertions from Apple about the threat to its customers\u2019 privacy.Still, he conceded that the efforts had been effective. What started as a dispute over a locked iPhone used by a terrorist in San Bernardino, Calif., has instead become a broader one over privacy and computer security, Mr. Baker said, and \u201cthey\u2019re getting a lot of people to side with Apple.\u201dSo strong is their support that Apple has included comments from several of the former officials in its legal pleadings. One filing included a comment from Mr. Chertoff at a conference last month that if Apple were forced to create a \u201cback door\u201d to get around its encryption, it would be like creating \u201ca bacteriological weapon.\u201dAnother vote of support that Apple has included in its legal filings came from Mr. Hayden, who is one of the top executives at Mr. Chertoff\u2019s consulting firm, the Chertoff Group. \u201cAmerica is more secure \u2014 America is more safe \u2014 with unbreakable end-to-end encryption,\u201d Mr. Hayden, who led both the National Security Agency and the C.I.A., told a television interviewer a week after the Apple fight broke out.Mr. Chertoff\u2019s firm also produced a 28-page report this year on the value of encryption, and its dealings with technology companies on security issues are extensive. Apple was also a corporate sponsor of a cybersecurity conference it hosted in October.Mr. Hayden has acknowledged that he might have come down differently in the Apple dispute when he was the head of the N.S.A. If faced with an unbreakable device, he might have gone straight to the budget office and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to need another $500 million because I\u2019m going to kick my way in,\u201d he told the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.Still, Mr. Hayden said in a telephone interview that his strong stance on encryption dated back years and was not influenced by his post-government work at the Chertoff Group.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have any relevance to what I think about this,\u201d he said. \u201cI answered this on its merits.\u201dMr. Chertoff was traveling and unavailable for comment, the Chertoff Group said. The firm declined to discuss its financial dealings with Apple.But Mr. Chertoff acknowledged in a panel discussion last month that during his time inside the government, there were situations in which \u201cI knew I had to move heaven and earth\u201d to find out where a threat was coming from. His current focus on encryption, he said, is complementary to that previous stance on security and not contradictory.The encryption debate erupted in February after the F.B.I. said it needed Apple\u2019s technical help to get into the iPhone used by Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the San Bernardino attackers.Initially, the F.B.I. appeared poised to win the battle for public opinion. The attack, which killed 14 people, was the worst terrorist strike on American soil since the Sept. 11 attacks. Mr. Farook was dead; the phone\u2019s owner \u2014 the county of San Bernardino, where he worked \u2014 had consented to the search; and the Justice Department had a court order to do it.With the F.B.I. still pushing to open other locked phones, Apple\u2019s backers are preparing for a long fight.Mr. Hayden, the former N.S.A. director, warned listeners last month at the American Enterprise Institute that the flare-up in the San Bernardino case was \u201cnot a one-and-done.\u201dEncryption is at the root of Internet communications, Mr. Hayden said, and \u201cthere is nothing we can do to stop that.\u201d His advice to his onetime government colleagues on the other side of the fight was simple: \u201cGet over it,\u201d he said.Kitty Bennett, Matt Apuzzo and Michael S. Schmidt contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Gay, Latino Partner Tests Goldman\u2019s Button-Down Culture", "Date": "2016-04-01", "News": "Supported byR. Martin Chavez possesses the light-filled office of a Goldman Sachs partner, with a sweeping view of the Statue of Liberty. But what sets his office apart is the gallery of objects and books arrayed behind the desk.There is the rose-petal birthday present from his husband \u2014 a framed card that says \u201cI love you\u201d in Braille. Below that stands a picture of a wiry terrier named Galahad, acquired as a \u201csobriety dog\u201d when Mr. Chavez stopped drinking in the 1990s. A few feet down, a basketball perches on a shelf.\u201cBasketball is so not me that I decided to put it up there so people could say, \u2018What is Marty doing with a basketball in his office?\u2019\u201d he said, bursting into a peal of laughter.Mr. Chavez, who is 52 and has a thick beard, represents a departure from the button-down partners of Goldman lore \u2014 plutocrats who wore their power on their sleeves and turned the bank into the most vaunted, feared and secretive company on Wall Street.Today Goldman is trying to change not only that public image, but also some of the central tenets of its culture, like the secrecy and reliance on back-room dealings. The company\u2019s chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, has said he wants Goldman to be thought of as a tech company \u2014 putting it in direct competition for talent with the Googles and Facebooks of the world. No one is more central to these efforts than Mr. Chavez.Mr. Chavez, who was promoted just over two years ago to oversee the company\u2019s 9,000 or so computer engineers \u2014 nearly a third of the staff \u2014 is pushing the 147-year-old company to, among other things, share more of its data and software with clients. His centerpiece project, Marquee, gives clients access to sophisticated trading data previously available only by phoning a Goldman employee.Marquee is so closely associated with Mr. Chavez, in fact, that it was initially called \u201cMartee,\u201d a play on his first name. But it has faced internal resistance. Some colleagues complain that the company is handing out valuable information while paving the way for job cuts.Mr. Chavez has responded forcefully, according to people who witnessed some of these conversations. \u201cHe basically said something to the effect of: \u2018If your job is a purely manual job and you are just clicking buttons, you should look to upgrade your skills set now,\u2019\u201d said Adam Korn, a trading executive. \u201cHe was pretty direct.\u201dSome of Mr. Chavez\u2019s ideas about openness date to his early years in Silicon Valley, where sharing is a religion. They haven\u2019t always worked out: At one start-up, he proposed publicly posting everyone\u2019s salaries, an unpopular idea.For Mr. Chavez, transparency is a kind of personal credo. He displays his gay and Latino identities proudly, as well as the Japanese tattoos on his arms. Conversations with him routinely turn to the intricacies of marrying his husband, a Briton, and raising their baby son, who was born to a surrogate in California. He urges his colleagues to open up more as well, arguing that it can serve as an antidote to the negative public image of Goldman.Mr. Chavez represents broad pressures across the financial industry. The 2008 economic crisis and the regulations that followed it are forcing banks to become less opaque and more technologically savvy and efficient. This has shifted the center of power in the business away from the trading desks, where it was before the crisis, and toward the programmers and engineers \u2014 until recently dismissed as the geeks in the back office.Particularly at a place like Goldman, the changes can be an uncomfortable fit with business practices and a culture that have been built up over decades. Charles M. Elson, an expert on corporate governance at the University of Delaware, said that Goldman, born as an adviser to corporations, is not used to operating out in the open.\u201cFundamentally, it\u2019s trying to refit an old car,\u201d said Mr. Elson, who is the director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance, named for the man who ran Goldman in the 1980s. \u201cIt\u2019s not buffing that\u2019s going to do it,\u201d Mr. Elson said. \u201cIn this new environment you have to rethink the whole chassis.\u201dMr. Elson said that Goldman went through a similar change when it converted from a partnership to a publicly traded company. That led to mass departures and internal battles, though Goldman emerged more profitable. It\u2019s not clear that the current slimming-down and opening-up will lead to the same results.Mr. Chavez says that if efforts like his are successful, clients will see \u201ca very different configuration of the financial services industry than the one we have now.\u201d Goldman will still have the chief product of a bank \u2014 money to lend and invest \u2014 but he thinks that the ways in which customers get access to that money will rely more on software and less on the bankers who traditionally delivered Goldman\u2019s services.Mr. Chavez grew up in Albuquerque with two parents who had not graduated from college and four siblings. All five of the children went to Harvard. His mother, a court stenographer whose parents had come from Mexico and Spain to the United States as immigrants, told Mr. Chavez that, because he was Hispanic, \u201cTo get half as far, you have to work twice as hard.\u201dHe was the statistician for the basketball team and read the Encyclopaedia Britannica front to back. \u201cI have no idea how he did it,\u201d his mother, Rose Chavez, said recently. He earned the nickname \u201cmotormouth\u201d from an uncle.There was, though, at least one thing he didn\u2019t talk about: his sexuality. He only came out the day after he defended his doctoral dissertation, in medical information sciences, at Stanford.The difficulty of being in the closet is part of what convinced Mr. Chavez of the importance of transparency. \u201cIt can be hard to be out \u2014 or one can imagine that it might be hard, which is more often the case,\u201d he wrote in a memo to colleagues in 2011. \u201cBut if that imagination leads to holding back, manufacturing alternative stories of how you spent your weekend or where you spent your time off, that not only impacts your peace of mind, it also has negative consequences for your career.\u201dWhen a recruiter from Goldman contacted him in the early 1990s, he worried that Wall Street wouldn\u2019t take to his sexuality as kindly as Silicon Valley had. At the time he worked for a software start-up and had little notion of what Goldman even did.\u201cI didn\u2019t think much about Wall Street,\u201d he said recently. \u201cI thought I was being clever in getting a free trip to New York City.\u201dDuring interviews at the bank, he said, he was impressed by his interviewers\u2019 quick wits. And his future boss took it in stride when Mr. Chavez said he was gay.Soon Mr. Chavez was plunged into Goldman\u2019s early efforts to automate its trading business with a computer system, SecDB, which is still the spine of its operations. Within the elite trading division where Mr. Chavez was placed, the J. Aron & Company operation \u2014 a shop that groomed many of the company\u2019s leaders \u2014 he worked with Mr. Blankfein, now the chief executive, and Gary D. Cohn, now Goldman\u2019s president.Mr. Chavez struggled, though, with drinking, a vice he attributes to an overindulgence in New York\u2019s gay night life. While going through Alcoholics Anonymous in 1997, Mr. Chavez got Galahad, the dog, to try to help him stay sober.He also decided he wanted a change of scene \u2014 pulling a \u201cgeographic\u201d in the parlance of A.A. Over the protests of Mr. Cohn, he briefly took a job at another Wall Street company, Credit Suisse, then jumped back into the start-up world, building a company, Kiodex, that wrote software to evaluate energy-trading risks.Kiodex had a rough ride. First, the tech bubble burst. Then, Mr. Chavez decided to collaborate with Enron right before the energy company went bust.Sean Patrick Maloney, one of Mr. Chavez\u2019s deputies at Kiodex, said Mr. Chavez\u2019s outsider status gave him an unusual problem-solving creativity. \u201cWhen you cross lines of difference in life \u2014 and you embrace things that to others seem taboo \u2014 it absolutely changes the way your brain works,\u201d said Mr. Maloney, who is now a Democratic congressman from upstate New York. \u201cHe sees things that others miss.\u201dStill, his approach would occasionally go astray. It was at Kiodex where Mr. Chavez proposed making everyone\u2019s salary public. Tom Farley, then Kiodex\u2019s chief financial officer, says he talked Mr. Chavez out of that. \u201cThe type of transparency that Marty espouses isn\u2019t for everyone,\u201d said Mr. Farley, who is now in charge of the New York Stock Exchange.Mr. Chavez, for his part, says the episode helped teach him not to prize \u201cradical transparency for its own sake.\u201dKiodex eventually recovered. Mr. Chavez sold it and retired to his house on Fire Island. He was 40 years old.Mr. Chavez was back at Goldman when the financial crisis hit \u2014 at the center of the bank\u2019s efforts to calculate and track its health during those stressful times. Goldman made it through with better results than most rivals. But that success itself caused problems when government investigations uncovered instances in which Goldman profited from the country\u2019s economic pain.Mr. Chavez recalls friends and family asking: How can you work there? It was a message echoing across the world, with Wall Street under fire for driving the nation to the brink of disaster. Goldman began a charm offensive.The company hired a new public relations chief, Jake Siewert, who previously worked as a chief White House spokesman under Bill Clinton. Goldman also began advertising campaigns stressing its philanthropic work and the financing it provides for projects like a new basketball arena in Kentucky.The crisis gave Mr. Chavez an opening to adopt a more aggressive strategy in his day-to-day work. With Wall Street facing the prospect of declining revenue and rising costs, the company was receptive to his proposals to standardize and automate more of its trading operations. Part of the savings to Goldman came from job cuts, though the bank does not provide detailed numbers.He also pitched automation as a way to help Goldman comply with the Dodd-Frank financial reform, which aimed, in part, to make trading more transparent and easier for regulators to track.In the past, the elite trading-desk programmers \u2014 strategists, or \u201cstrats\u201d in Goldman lingo \u2014 had been in a different division from the traditional I.T. department. Mr. Chavez gained control of both units and unified them, causing some consternation on both sides. The strats worried about being dumbed down, employees say, while the I.T. engineers worried about being marginalized.Symphony is representative of Mr. Chavez\u2019s larger strategy. He gave up the opportunity to develop the software internally and turn it into a source of revenue in order to create something that everyone in the industry might use, and that might allow Goldman to communicate with all of its clients better, even if it is not making money off Symphony itself.But the software, like other programs Mr. Chavez is pushing, faces major hurdles to its success. It still needs to win over investment firms \u2014 the biggest clients of the banks \u2014 and many of them are hesitant to use software that, they worry, might give the banks a way to snoop on their communications.Mr. Chavez\u2019s efforts have also faced skepticism in the technology community, in no small part because of a prominent case in which the company accused a former employee and programmer, Sergey Aleynikov, of stealing Goldman\u2019s software upon leaving the company.Mr. Chavez was not involved in Mr. Aleynikov\u2019s case. And he has been trying to confront Wall Street\u2019s mixed reputation among programmers. He has gone to lead recruiting events at elite institutions like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where the number of students applying to Wall Street has fallen sharply, in part because of the perception of the industry as stuffy and slow-moving.Mr. Chavez has not been shy about pushing the company to embrace social issues as a selling point. He urged its human resources department to expand benefits to gay partners before the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage. He then encouraged Mr. Blankfein to speak out in support of gay marriage.Still, he acknowledges, there is much to do. At the Recode event last fall, he joked about Goldman\u2019s lack of diversity.He was in an office, he said, with a fellow Hispanic executive, when another executive stopped by. \u201cHe opens the door, he sticks his head in, and he says, \u201850 percent of the Hispanic partners of Goldman Sachs, right here, right now.\u2019\u201d The task now, he said, was to take Goldman \u201cto a different place.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The two men, now thousands of miles apart, had become closer than brothers in Iraq, serving shoulder-to-shoulder under mortar and rocket fire. Few words were needed.\u201cAll okay, Top!\u201d Mr. Bennett wrote.In interviews, many veterans said they turn primarily to social media sites for support, where former units are at their fingertips, and a lifeline is just a keystroke away.\u201cWe have certainly tasted the same dust,\u201d Mr. Bennett said.For decades now, American veterans have forged bonds on battlefields, sleeping in sand-blown tents, swallowing fear in concrete bunkers, or cramming into the bowels of tanks for a dozen hours. When deployments end, those ties are stretched as veterans fan out across the United States. For Mr. Bennett, 50, the online buddy checks are as important as the conventional therapy that he has used to adapt to civilian life.\u201cIt\u2019s me letting everyone know that I am there for them, and everyone letting me know they are there for me,\u201d he said.\u201cWe tried to convince him that there is absolutely nothing in the world that killing yourself can solve,\u201d Mr. Day said.\u201cI think that ultimately the responsibility for us as a community is to be an open ear,\u201d Mr. Day said.In the video, the father says that he had surgery on his shoulder, but would give the push-ups his all.

If you need to talk and your friends and family not close, contact me.\u201dDavid Woolery was in the Marine Corps in eastern Afghanistan in 2004 when a bomb exploded under a convoy he was in, injuring some of the men.

{"Headline": "Should You Hug Your Dog?", "Date": "2016-04-27", "News": "Supported byThe next time you want to hug a dog, consider this: You could be making the pooch miserable, an expert says.Dr. Coren\u2019s recommendation? \u201cSave your hugs for your two-footed family members and lovers. It is clearly better from the dog\u2019s point of view if you express your fondness for your pet with a pat, a kind word and maybe a treat.\u201dTo be sure, the post is not a peer-reviewed scientific study, but only his expert observation. But his advice ricocheted across social media, and dog lovers howled their reaction on Twitter.Dr. Coren looked at 250 images on Google and Flickr that show people hugging dogs. About 81 percent of the photos showed dogs giving off at least one sign of discomfort, stress or anxiety, he said. The rest of the photographs showed dogs that appeared comfortable with their hugs or exhibiting neutral or ambiguous responses.\u2022 Bared teeth is one key signal of anxiety, Dr. Coren wrote.\u2022 Turning its head away from whatever is worrisome, sometimes closing its eyes, at least partly. Dogs will often show what is called a \u201chalf-moon eye\u201d or \u201cwhale eye,\u201d where the white portion of the eyes at the corner or the rim is visible, he said.\u2022 Licking, yawning or raising a paw. The dog may also lower its ears or slick them back against the side of its head.Corey Cohen, a companion animal behavior therapist at A New Leash on Life in Pennsylvania, was unequivocal.\u201cMy dogs love being hugged,\u201d he said.Mr. Cohen said he believed dogs might look anxious in the hugging photos because they didn\u2019t like having their pictures taken, or because a person was trying to pose them or get their attention. But Mr. Cohen, who also does canine massages, said he thought dogs could be comfortable with a hug when there was familiarity and trust.We asked Times readers on many continents \u2013 both English and Spanish speakers \u2013 to share some of their experiences with street dogs, village dogs and other dogs sometimes called strays.How does he know his dog loves to cuddle? He said he could feel tension being released in certain muscle areas of the animal: The breathing slowed down and the gaze softened. In some dogs, he said, the edges of their mouths tilt up, like a smile.\"I can definitely tell,\u201d Mr. Cohen said. \u201cTheir facial expression changes: \u2018Oh, give me more!\u2019 \u201dThe trust bond also leads him to dismiss a common notion that people should not stare at dogs \u2014 that doing so is considered confrontational.\u201cThe truth is, if you have a decent relationship with your dog, it releases oxytocin,\u201d he said, referring to the so-called love hormone. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is any other creature on earth that will do this.\u201dBut Erica Lieberman, a dog trainer and behavior consultant with Pawsibilities Pets in New York City, said that in general, dogs should not be hugged \u2014 just to be on the safe side.For example, people who adopt a rescue dog may not know the animal\u2019s socialization history. It could have painful association with, say, a child giving it crushing or unintentionally painful hugs.Ms. Lieberman said dogs understand facial expressions and learn that hugging makes people happy. Therefore they may be putting up with something they do not really like.\u201cSo I like the message,\u201d she said, referring to the no-hugs credo. \u201cI believe people should err on the side of caution.\u201dShe said people should always look for \u201ccutoff signals.\u201d In addition to those Dr. Coren noted, Ms. Lieberman said dogs might \u201cshake off\u201d in displeasure after a hug, similar to what they do after a bath to rid themselves of excess water.\u201cIf you don\u2019t see any of that, there are plenty of dogs who not only don\u2019t mind, but they get that it is what makes it a human\u2019s companion,\u201d she said.Ms. Lieberman, who has also worked as a therapy dog evaluator, said another misconception is that it\u2019s O.K. to extend your hands into a dog\u2019s face as introduction.\u201cThat is incorrect because you are getting into a dog\u2019s face,\u201d she said. \u201cKeep your hands at your side and see if the dog approaches you. You have allowed it to be the dog\u2019s decision.\u201dMs. Lieberman said there are alternatives to hugs, like scratching or belly rubs. But for the dog-loving humans who can\u2019t live without their canine cuddles, Ms. Lieberman said you could always try \u201ccounter-conditioning\u201d until you are sure the dog is fine with it.That is: Hug your dog briefly and then give it a treat. Repeat as needed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A $700 Juicer for the Kitchen That Caught Silicon Valley\u2019s Eye", "Date": "2016-03-31", "News": "Supported byIn recent years, venture capitalists have funded all manner of improbable ideas. An app that lets random people call and wake you up. A bathroom scale that posts your weight on Twitter.And then there is Doug Evans\u2019s brainchild. With no experience running tech companies and a bungled juice-bar chain under his belt, he has extracted a remarkable $120 million in investments from Silicon Valley titans, including Google Ventures and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, and big companies like Campbell Soup.His pitch: a $700 machine that makes an eight-ounce glass of juice.Mr. Evans is a raw-food evangelist, although \u201coccasionally I eat steamed vegetables, to not be dogmatic,\u201d he said. He wears shoes made of hemp. But even as Silicon Valley retreats from its recent boom, this unlikely entrepreneur has persuaded top investors to throw their money at one of the most enigmatic start-ups in years.His company, Juicero, opens for business this week. But what is it?Is it a juice-ordering app? Is it just another kitchen-counter contraption? Or is it a 111,000-square-foot food-processing factory, staffed by dozens of hourly workers, washing and slicing up fruits and vegetables in Los Angeles?It is all of these things. \u201cIt\u2019s the most complicated business that I\u2019ve ever funded,\u201d said David Krane, a partner at GV, formerly Google Ventures. \u201cIt\u2019s software. It\u2019s consumer electronics. It\u2019s produce and packaging.\u201dMany of the tycoons who inhabit Silicon Valley are obsessed with health and longevity while harboring the conviction that technology can improve anything, even one of nature\u2019s most elementary foodstuffs \u2014 in this case, juice. And they believe that niche trends, if properly disrupted, can become billion-dollar markets. Juicero is the latest expression of these techno-utopian impulses.It is also the latest example of an unproven start-up raising enormous sums of money. Born in an earlier era in the Valley, the headier times of 18 months or so ago, Mr. Evans\u2019s idea captivated some of the industry\u2019s most ambitious investors. In today\u2019s more conservative financing environment, such a pitch might not get funded.No matter. In coming days, Juicero starts taking orders.The machine itself is a white plastic slab roughly the size of a food processor. To get some juice, you insert a pouch that resembles an IV bag and press a button. A couple of minutes later, a thin stream of vividly colored liquid squirts into a glass.For health nuts willing to pay a premium, Juicero promises the platonic ideal of juice. Plus, the machine never needs to be cleaned.But getting from farm to glass involves a daunting mix of hardware, code and food processing. The arrangement relies on a smartphone app, always-on Wi-Fi, QR codes, high-tech packaging and an army of workers slicing fruits and vegetables in very particular ways.Ultimately, however, what makes Juicero so special is not quantifiable by conventional science, said Mr. Evans, the founder and chief executive.\u201cNot all juice is equal,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do you measure life force? How do you measure chi?\u201dNearly as unlikely as Juicero itself is the man behind it. Mr. Evans trained as an Army paratrooper before joining a graphic design firm. His love affair with juice began in 1999, when he met Denise Mari, a vegan, at a nightclub. Soon he was dating Ms. Mari and converted to veganism, too.Hoping to create an eatery compatible with their strict dietary regimen, Mr. Evans and Ms. Mari bought some industrial-strength juicers and developed Organic Avenue, which sold $10 bottles of cold-pressed, unpasteurized juice and other vegan snacks.\u201cIt was a vision of a restaurant someone could go to where no animals were harmed, and no humans were harmed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was so magical to be able to have that. I was drinking several glasses of juice a day as my primary form of hydration.\u201dAfter the first store opened in 2006, the business grew quickly. But margins were persistently thin. New York real estate is expensive, and the inventory was perishable.\u201cWe were on the brink of insolvency,\u201d Mr. Evans said.In 2012, Mr. Evans and Ms. Mari, who are separated but remain friends, sold a majority interest in Organic Avenue to a private equity firm. Shortly after that, both were ousted. (The company was eventually sold to another private equity firm, which shuttered all the stores.)Upon being fired, Mr. Evans said, he had a problem. \u201cFor me, I was just wondering: How am I going to get my juice?\u201d he said.He bought every juicer he could find, but he was never satisfied. \u201cIt didn\u2019t have the magic that I was accustomed to.\u201dSo he resolved to create a miniaturized version of the industrial presses he had used at Organic Avenue. Working with freelance welders and machinists, he built prototypes in his Brooklyn kitchen. By 2013, he had a working model, albeit one that occasionally blew apart, sending pieces of metal and food scraps flying across the room.He approached Ms. Mari and some of the original backers of Organic Avenue, who invested enough money for him to keep going. \u201cThen I got an introduction to a partner at Kleiner Perkins through a vegan fashion designer who knew someone at the Humane Society who knew them,\u201d Mr. Evans said.The partner at Kleiner Perkins, Amol Deshpande, was a believer, and the firm agreed to invest an additional half-million dollars and incubate Juicero in Silicon Valley. Mr. Evans left Brooklyn, moved into temporary housing in a shopping center on Sand Hill Road and raised $16.5 million in Series A financing.With the extra money, Mr. Evans began hiring software engineers, mechanical engineers, food scientists and app developers. It wasn\u2019t long before Mr. Evans realized he needed still more money. The innards of the machine were complex but manageable. It was the software, the production facility, the electrical testing and a thousand other things that necessitated a bigger staff.\u201cI was just na\u00efve,\u201d Mr. Evans said. \u201cI was like Forrest Gump. I had no idea what it took to make a piece of hardware that could ship to consumers safely.\u201dSo in 2015, Juicero raised a $70 million Series B round. But even that was not enough. Mr. Evans is now raising more money, currently $28 million and counting.And cold-pressed juice, the variety that Mr. Evans is hoping to capitalize on, has had a minor renaissance in recent years. Suja, a San Diego company, is selling bottles across the country, including in Costco, for as little as $3.50 each. In 2011, Starbucks acquired Evolution Fresh, and now sells cold-pressed juice in its thousands of coffee shops.\u201cJust five years ago, cold-pressed juice was a niche trend, popular only with health fanatics,\u201d Andrew Alvarez, an analyst with IBISWorld, a market research firm, wrote in a recent report. Now though, it \u201chas hit the mainstream and given rise to hundreds of new juice bars, typically selling juice at higher price points.\u201dStill, there are signs that juice mania may have peaked. Last year, retail juice sales in the United States declined by 2 percent from 2014, according to Euromonitor International, another market research firm. Sales of home juicers were down 6 percent in the United States last year.There are also health concerns. One reason sales have been falling, analysts believe, is that people are increasingly worried about sugar, even the naturally occurring kinds.Finally, there are the environmental questions about the single-serve model pioneered by coffee companies such as Keurig and Nespresso, which creates a throwaway container with each serving. Every glass of Juicero juice needs its own pack, which is shipped from Los Angeles to the customer, although Mr. Evans said he was developing a compostable pack.To succeed, Juicero will have to buck these trends, and also clear a more pedestrian hurdle \u2014 persuading people to pay a premium for another kitchen doodad. \u201cSeven hundred dollars for a small cooking appliance is extremely high,\u201d said Virginia Lee, beverage analyst for Euromonitor. \u201cThere are a lot of appliances competing for counter space, never mind the wallet.\u201dExpensive as it is, what Mr. Evans has packed into that counter space is rather remarkable. Inside the machine is a series of gears and metal plates that exert 8,000 pounds of pressure on packs of chopped fruits and vegetables.To make a glass of juice, you insert a pack ($4 to $10 each) into the machine, close the door and press a button. There are five flavors, including Sweet Roots (carrot, beet, orange, lemon and apple) and Spicy Greens (pineapple, romaine, celery, cucumber, spinach, parsley and jalape\u00f1o).Each pack has a QR code on it. A camera in the machine scans the code on each pack and, using Wi-Fi, checks in with an online database. If the pack is no longer fresh, or has been deemed contaminated, the machine won\u2019t press it. If the pack is O.K., the gears start turning and out squirts the juice.So far, so complicated. But the real logistical feat is behind the scenes. To create those packs in the Los Angeles plant, workers receive truckloads of produce from nearby organic farms, triple-wash it, then chop it into specific shapes (carrots are finely diced, while beets are chunkier).A specialized machine then fills each pack. The packs are then sent by FedEx to users, who order them using Juicero\u2019s smartphone app.Mr. Evans and his investors speak of Juicero being a \u201cplatform\u201d for a new paradigm of food delivery. And they speak of commercial sales. Already, chain restaurants including Le Pain Quotidien have agreed to use Juicero. The hope is that bigger companies will put machines in their office kitchens, too.At this point, however, the investors betting millions don\u2019t have any sales data to reassure them. Instead, they have little more than Mr. Evans\u2019s enthusiasm for juice. He drinks it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. He is so committed to a largely liquid diet that he rarely consumes water.\u201cOrganic cold-pressed juice is rainwater filtered through the soil and the roots and the stems and the plants,\u201d he said. \u201cYou extract the water molecules, the chlorophyll, the anthocyanin and the flavonoids and the micronutrients. You\u2019re getting this living nutrition. It\u2019s like drinking the nectar of the earth.\u201dBut do other people have such refined palates when it comes to juice? Will those who don\u2019t subsist entirely on raw produce be able to tell a difference between organic and nonorganic fruit, as Mr. Evans claims to do? Even if they can, what will they be willing to pay for the privilege of consuming it in their own kitchens? After all, this is a machine that won\u2019t make a glass of carrot juice if your Wi-Fi is down.An article last Sunday about Juicero, a Silicon Valley company that has developed a $700 cold-press juicer as well as packaged ingredients for it, described the Tovala, another high-tech kitchen appliance, incorrectly. It is a programmable oven that can bake, broil, steam or heat by convection in any sequence. It is not a combination microwave/toaster.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Parental Leave Policies Are Changing", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported byHere, three reporters for The New York Times \u2014 Jodi Kantor, an enterprise reporter who has written about gender, politics and the workplace; Noam Scheiber, a labor reporter based in Washington, D.C., and Mr. Fuller, the San Francisco bureau chief \u2014 discuss their views on new family leave laws in California, New York and corporate America and what they might augur in terms of national policy.First up, Jodi Kantor.Dear Noam and Thomas,Here\u2019s a mashup of what I used to hear, as a reporter and parent, about the prospects for ever having state-mandated parental leave in the United States:Paid family leave may be desperately needed, but it\u2019s a political pipe dream. Democrats are unwilling to fight for it. The business world will never go for it. The United States just has terminally shoddy parental leave policies. (Cue dirgelike music and new parents giving longing glances to countries like Sweden, which grants 480 days of paid leave.)But now \u2014 every day \u2014 the statements above are becoming a little less true.To be clear, we\u2019re not talking about the arms race in the corporate and technology worlds to provide deluxe doses of paid parental leave \u2014 like the whole year that white-collar workers receive at Netflix. Those are voluntary corporate policies. We\u2019re discussing laws that will cover far more people: if you\u2019re a supermarket checkout clerk in Albany, your employer will for the first time be legally required to give you paid leave.So why is this finally happening now, and so fast? The push for paid parental leave has no clear leader. Aside from some long-dedicated activists and White House support, there\u2019s barely an organized movement at all. This isn\u2019t like the gay marriage effort, with a well-planned multiyear strategy and deep-pocketed financiers.One answer is demographics. Nearly 70 percent of mothers with children under 18 now work, according to the Labor Department. More than three-quarters of single mothers are sole breadwinners. The need for paid leave is more urgent and desperate than ever before.Another reason: generally speaking, workers are going to pay for the leave themselves, through small paycheck deductions similar to those taken out for familiar government programs like Medicare and Social Security. Most of the new programs are funded by tiny contributions, a dollar or two a week, that will be collected by the employer and paid out to the employee when the leave is taken. This is why opposition is pretty low \u2014 the government isn\u2019t footing the bill, and aside from possibly hiring temporary help to fill in for employees on leave, neither are businesses. The San Francisco law is an exception, requiring larger employers to fill in workers\u2019 paychecks beyond what the state-run system contributes.So, for the first time in United States history, we can start to see what a system of state-mandated parental leave might look like, beyond postpartum disability pay. By Swedish standards, it would still look like a messy patchwork, with wild swings in coverage depending on where you live and work, and plenty of gaps and exclusions. But we\u2019ve never had much of a system at all, so this is still a huge shift \u2014 especially since every one of the new laws covers paternity leave for men.Dear Jodi,I completely agree: the quick succession of the New York and San Francisco measures suggests we\u2019re on the verge of something big here. And the \u201cwhy now?\u201d question really does loom large.In fairness, there have been some well-organized efforts to build political momentum around this issue over the years. The Working Families Party, which was founded in New York in 1998 to pull Democrats to the left on economics, has made a concerted effort to elevate the issue since 2007, and the party is now active in a dozen states. The community organizing that party leaders and activists did back then \u2014 and the polling they consulted \u2014 identified paid leave as a cause that would excite both low-income and middle-class workers, especially women.That said, the movement seems more dispersed, organic, and generally leaderless than the effort to advance marriage equality, as you point out. So we can\u2019t chalk it all up to a vast left-wing conspiracy.I\u2019d argue that economics is a big part of the story. In particular, and maybe a bit paradoxically, I think we\u2019re seeing the result of a tight labor market for those near the top, coupled with wage stagnation and downward mobility in the middle and at the bottom.And why were hourly workers so exercised about this? Again, economics. In the middle and bottom of the income spectrum, you have a generation\u2019s worth of stagnating and even declining real wages (except for a brief period in the mid-to-late 1990s), making it more and more necessary for middle- and working-class households to send two earners into the work force. But with two adults at work and the family dependent on both of their incomes, it\u2019s extremely difficult to take time off to care for a baby or a parent.As the Working Families Party likes to put it, the manufacturing worker who once made $20 or $30 an hour could support his whole family on that income, making it possible for his wife to raise the children or care for a parent.Now that he and his wife both have to work at Wal-Mart \u2014 and still bring home less money combined than he once did alone \u2014 they\u2019re out of luck when that baby arrives.Long story short, when workers who are struggling thanks in part to the lack of paid leave see more affluent workers getting heaping portions of it, it\u2019s no surprise that they start to demand something similar. Consider it a uniquely American form of consciousness-raising.And Thomas FullerDear Noam and Jodi,Greetings from San Francisco! I suppose it\u2019s not that surprising that this was the first city in the United States to roll out fully paid parental leave. San Francisco is so proudly liberal that the label \u201cRepublican\u201d is a throw-down-the-gloves insult to some here.The vote on Tuesday in the board of supervisors was unanimous, and one of the supervisors talked about putting the city \u201con the level of European social democracies that have more forward-thinking policies.\u201d So there you have it, America in 2016: a socialist is winning primaries in the presidential race, and San Francisco is talking about emulating European welfare states.There was opposition to the parental leave measure, but it seemed to me quite muted. The city\u2019s Small Business Commission opposed it during the drafting process but didn\u2019t seem very enthusiastic in speaking out against it. The commission\u2019s executive director didn\u2019t return my call or email.Outside City Hall on Tuesday, the sponsor of the parental leave measure, Supervisor Scott Wiener, had organized some speeches by supporters. But inside the beautiful wood-paneled board of supervisors meeting room, everything was businesslike. The ordinance passed in an almost matter-of-fact, procedural way. One of the supervisors, David Campos, said he was disappointed the measure wasn\u2019t going to take effect faster \u2014 it\u2019s being phased in according to how many employees a company has and will be fully in force in January, 2018.I was interested to learn how the measure came about: a member of Mr. Wiener\u2019s staff is having a baby and looked into parental leave provisions across the country\u2026and a few months later an ordinance was born.Readers, can you tell us how this model will benefit you, or would have benefited you had it existed in the past? Is it enough or do you want more?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Honesty Tops Any Checklist When Looking for an Adviser", "Date": "2016-04-18", "News": "Supported bySketch GuyNow that more financial professionals are going to have to act in their customer\u2019s best interest, where can you actually find someone who will really, truly, for sure do that?It seems like a simple question, but it\u2019s not. I\u2019ve been around the financial planning industry for 20 years, and one of the hardest (and most common) questions I\u2019m asked is, \u201cHow do I find an adviser who I can trust?\u201dThere is no checklist that leads to \u201chonest.\u201dAll of this confusion leads me to joke about what I call the \u201cSecret Society of Real Financial Advisers.\u201d But every time I mention this secret society, investors ask me where they can find them. Advisers ask how they can join.The problem is that it\u2019s a secret society \u2014 emphasis on the \u201csecret\u201d part. There are no meetings, no annual dues and no T-shirts. There is no place to find a list of members. This tongue-in-cheek society does exist, but it\u2019s hard to find members because there is no real standard of training or care like we see in other professions. When you go to doctors, you can be reasonably sure they went to years of medical school. When you go to someone using the title financial adviser, you have no idea what you\u2019re getting.The bummer about this entire conversation is that you\u2019ll end up frustrated, because I still don\u2019t have a perfect checklist for finding a real financial adviser.Sorry.I wish I did.I wish I could tell you with confidence that if you just Google \u201creal financial adviser,\u201d then voil\u00e0, there will be your list. But I just tried it, and it didn\u2019t help. At all. This problem has gotten so bad that when I mention the existence of real financial advisers to some of my friends in the media, they react like I\u2019m referring to fictional characters in a quaint fairy tale, like the butcher, the baker or the candlestick maker.But I want to assure you that just because real advisers are hard to find doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t exist. There are indeed financial advisers who are real professionals. They do amazing work that absolutely changes people\u2019s lives for the better. I have seen it.So don\u2019t give up your search.Start by getting names from people you trust. Who do they work with? (And how do they know they are not being fooled themselves?) Meet with those people. Ask them many questions, including how they get paid, what training they have, what type of clients they work with. Then, ask them to please outline specifically what you will pay for the advice they give.Don\u2019t be bashful about these questions. Real advisers like them. This is not the time for you to worry about being rude or nosy. Remember: This person is going to be all up in your business when it comes to your money. It\u2019s fine to ask about how advisers make theirs.After all of that, remember to take your time. There is no hurry. Real advisers will respect this. In fact, they will be doing the same thing. It should feel like this is a mutual process, with both of you trying to determine if this relationship is a good fit. You are trying to find a place to get financial advice for the rest of your life (hopefully), and they are trying to make sure they can meet your expectations. It shouldn\u2019t feel like a trip to a car dealership.I hope at least some of this helps in your journey to find these mythical creatures that belong to the secret society of real financial advisers. Once you find one, you will understand why the search was worth it.Advertisement"}

Verizon Communications, which has publicly expressed interest in buying Yahoo\u2019s core Internet business and merging it with its AOL division, plans to press forward with a bid, some of these people said.The Daily Mail, a British tabloid newspaper and website, said publicly that it had considered joining with potential investors, including one or more private equity firm, for a bid. And the private equity firm TPG plans to make a bid in the first round on its own, according to a person briefed on the matter.Yet other huge companies plan to sit out the bidding. Google, which competes with Yahoo on search and display advertising and has a search partnership with the company, considered making an offer, but is unlikely to proceed because it fears any deal would draw stiff antitrust scrutiny, according to people briefed on the company\u2019s thinking.Other notable businesses, including AT&T, CBS and the investment firms Silver Lake, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and General Atlantic, are unlikely to bid, according to others briefed on their plans. And SoftBank, the Japanese telecommunications giant that controls Yahoo Japan, does not plan to bid despite press reports to the contrary.A 90-slide presentation shown to potential Yahoo bidders is dense with figures, but even people familiar with the company\u2019s operations have struggled to make sense of them. At the same time, Yahoo devoted just a couple of slides to important strategies, like its costly Hail Mary project to create an entirely new mobile search experience to leapfrog competitors like Google, Apple and Amazon.Representatives of Verizon, Google, AT&T and CBS declined to comment. A Yahoo spokeswoman also declined to comment on the sales process.Marissa Mayer, Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, is expected to face questions about the bidding on Tuesday, when the company reports its latest quarterly earnings. The report should offer a window into how Yahoo is weathering the upheaval caused by the layoff of 15 percent of its work force announced in February. The total value of Yahoo shares is now about $35 billion.The company may also disclose sales of patents and real estate, which it began shopping a couple of months ago in the hope of raising $1 billion to $3 billion.One reason for Yahoo\u2019s reluctance to share information may be that the business is worse than the company has publicly disclosed. That has added to confusion regarding the intentions of a board of directors that, just a few months ago, publicly said it had no intention of selling.Ms. Mayer has often said she wants to make Yahoo services a \u201cdaily habit\u201d for Internet users. But after nearly four years of effort, only about 10 percent of the one billion monthly visitors to Yahoo sites return every day, suggesting little attachment to the brand, according to people who have seen confidential internal data. At Facebook, by comparison, 65 percent of users visit daily.Yahoo is in a difficult position. Ms. Mayer\u2019s four-year turnaround effort has failed to deliver significant improvements at a company that has been in decline for a decade. Ms. Mayer argues that she is turning the tide with new investments in areas like video and native advertising.Activist investors, led by the Starboard Value hedge fund, have run out of patience and are pressing the board to sell the core business, separating it from the company\u2019s far more valuable investment stakes in Alibaba, China\u2019s leading e-commerce company, and Yahoo Japan, a separate, publicly traded company.Yahoo\u2019s board, which spent more than a year working on other plans to separate the investment stakes, reluctantly agreed to explore a sale of all or parts of the company and hired three investment banking firms to run the process. Starboard has formally threatened a proxy fight to replace the entire board at the next shareholder meeting if the directors do not follow through on a sale.Ms. Mayer has publicly laid out a path for an independent Yahoo and made the case to potential bidders that they should retain her as chief to carry out the plan.Abandoning previous forays into video and digital magazines, Ms. Mayer, who formerly headed search at Google, is now focused on returning Yahoo to its glory days as a search engine. Although comScore says that Yahoo is currently the No. 3 player in desktop searches, behind Google and Microsoft, Ms. Mayer argues that Yahoo can leap ahead through a \u201ccomplete reimagination of mobile search.\u201dMs. Mayer has assigned about 1,000 people to search products, or about 10 percent of the company\u2019s staff, according to people briefed on the business. The mobile effort, code-named Project Index, has officially been underway for two years and aims to create a search tool similar to Google Now on Android phones, Apple\u2019s Siri, Microsoft\u2019s Cortana and Amazon\u2019s Alexa.But the team has little to show for its work, and many at Yahoo wonder whether it is a hopeless quest. Industry experts as well as Yahoo insiders say that without the location and personal data that Apple and Google have, Yahoo will have a difficult time predicting what people want with enough accuracy to get them to switch from other services.As Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, Ms. Mayer acquired more than 20 companies, but ultimately struggled to turn around the web pioneer.\u201cThere is a massive opportunity for mobile search,\u201d said Keith Rabois, a partner at Khosla Ventures, who invests in search start-ups. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think Yahoo has the core assets or skills you would need to succeed or thrive right now.\u201dA Yahoo spokesman said that the company was exploring many search ideas, including the use of software bots that would fetch information on behalf of users.Ms. Mayer\u2019s vague plans for reversing Yahoo\u2019s decline, along with the lack of disclosure about the company\u2019s finances, have made prospective bidders nervous.Though several private equity firms have been looking at the company, people involved in the bidding process said that they were unlikely to prevail against a determined corporate buyer.Verizon is viewed by analysts as the leading bidder for Yahoo, but its likely offer comes despite trepidation among its executives, according to the people briefed on the bidding.Verizon is still struggling to digest its $4.4 billion acquisition last year of AOL, and some executives worry that buying Yahoo would simply be doubling down on integration troubles.Verizon could certainly combine the content properties and ad products and networks run by Yahoo and AOL.The company, with more than 112 million cellphone customers on top of its landline Internet subscribers, would have the ability to preinstall Yahoo services and distribute them widely.However, the contracts governing Apple iPhones and phones running Google\u2019s Android operating system generally restrict what phone carriers can do to promote alternatives for major services like search and email. So Yahoo would still need to build products good enough to persuade people to switch.Wall Street is hoping for a quick sale, to anybody, at any reasonable price.\u201cWe continue to believe that one of the greatest risks in the stock is the core being a \u2018melting ice cube,\u2019 as a prolonged sale process draws on, creating questions for employees, advertisers and partners,\u201d wrote Robert Peck, an analyst with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, on Wednesday.Because of an editing error, an article on Friday about Yahoo\u2019s reluctance to share financial details with prospective buyers misstated the amount the company hoped to raise by selling patents and real estate. The amount is $1 billion to $3 billion, not $1 billion to $35 billion.Conor Dougherty contributed reporting from San Francisco, and Emily Steel from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Microsoft and Google Agree to Drop Mutual Complaints", "Date": "2016-04-22", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 Microsoft and Google agreed on Friday to withdraw complaints against each other with regulators around the world, as the two American tech giants continued recent efforts to settle the once-bitter conflicts between them.The two companies also said they would try to resolve future squabbles before complaining to regulators, as they have in the past.\u201cMicrosoft has agreed to withdraw its regulatory complaints against Google, reflecting our changing legal priorities,\u201d said Jennifer Crider, a Microsoft spokeswoman. \u201cWe will continue to focus on competing vigorously for business and for customers.\u201d\u201cOur companies compete vigorously, but we want to do so on the merits of our products, not in legal proceedings,\u201d said Rob Shilkin, a Google spokesman.The move away from legal and regulatory confrontations followed changes in the senior leadership of both companies. Since taking over as chief executive of Microsoft in early 2014, Satya Nadella has shown a willingness to collaborate more closely with companies that were once bitter rivals.Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google, was named to that position last August, after a major reorganization that formed a new holding company, Alphabet, to oversee Google and other divisions.Despite the detente between the tech giants, Google still faces powerful adversaries, particularly in Europe where local publishers and telecom operators, among others, remain wary of its powerful role in how people in the 28-member bloc gain access to digital services.Some of those companies have filed complaints that have led to two formal documents of accusations against Google from Europe\u2019s competition authorities.Several American tech companies, including Oracle, Yelp and Expedia, also claim that Google has broken antitrust rules in Europe, the United States and elsewhere.At Microsoft, the previous target of multiple European regulatory investigations, the focus has shifted in the last 18 months from attacking Google to lobbying over privacy regulation \u2014 important rules that underpin its fast-growing cloud computing business.Microsoft has been a vocal supporter of Europe\u2019s tough privacy rules \u2014 often positioning itself in contrast to Google and Facebook \u2014 repeatedly highlighting how it has complied with the region\u2019s strict stance on data protection to a greater degree than its rivals.Nick Wingfield reported from Seattle and Mark Scott from Rome.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Anti-Gay Laws Bring Backlash in Mississippi and North Carolina", "Date": "2016-04-05", "News": "Supported byDURHAM, N.C. \u2014 The divide between social conservatives and diversity-minded corporations widened Tuesday with developments in Mississippi and North Carolina related to the rights of gay, lesbian bisexual and transgender people in both states.The measure signed by Gov. Phil Bryant of Mississippi allows churches, religious charities and privately held businesses to decline services to people if doing so would violate their religious beliefs on marriage and gender. Gov. Nathan Deal of Georgia, under pressure from business interests, two weeks ago vetoed a similar bill passed by the State Legislature.PayPal said it had dropped plans to put in global operations center in Charlotte, N.C., because of the state\u2019s recent passage of a law banning anti-discrimination protections based on sexual orientation and requiring transgender people in government buildings and public schools to use bathrooms that match the gender on their birth certificates. PayPal had pledged to bring 400 jobs and invest $3.6 million in the area by the end of 2017.The developments in Republican-controlled states reflected growing fissures between business interests and social conservatives, whose alliance has played a central role in the Republican coalition. Similar disputes have erupted in Indiana, Arkansas and other Republican-controlled states since the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage last year.The divide played out with particular force a year ago in Indiana after a national outcry over its adoption of what was billed as a religious liberty bill. After an uproar that included questions about whether Indianapolis should host the men\u2019s Final Four tournament, Indiana weakened the law somewhat. But that dispute and a continuing fight over whether the state should adopt anti-discrimination protections may have cost Indiana a dozen conferences and $60 million, a state visitors bureau estimated.The dispute was also a wake-up call, said Mark Fisher, the vice president of Indy Chamber, an Indianapolis business coalition. \u201cWe had opposed the law, but we didn\u2019t imagine the extent of the outcry,\u201d he said.In Mississippi, objections have been raised by companies such as Tyson Foods, MGM Resorts International, Nissan and Toyota, all of which are major employers in the state.But the biggest backlash has come in North Carolina, a deeply divided state with conservative, Republican-dominated rural areas and suburbs vying for influence with tech-savvy, Democratic-leaning urban centers like Charlotte and the Research Triangle area of Durham, Raleigh and Chapel Hill.With its announcement, PayPal became the first major company to announce it was pulling out of an existing project, saying that \u201cbecoming an employer in North Carolina, where members of our teams will not have equal rights under the law, is simply untenable.\u201dPayPal\u2019s president and chief executive, Dan Schulman, said that if the state repealed the law, \u201cwe will reconsider our decision.\u201d\u201cBut obviously there\u2019s a time frame,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are now in the process of talking to a number of other states.\u201dPayPal had already joined more than 120 other business leaders in signing a letter to Mr. McCrory objecting to the law.Some, like Google Ventures\u2019 chief executive, Bill Maris, pledged not to make any new investments in the state until the law was repealed. Other signatories included Apple, Facebook and Charlotte-based Bank of America, the largest corporation in North Carolina. Mayors and governors of other states, including New York, Vermont and Washington, have banned most state-sponsored travel there.Asked about PayPal\u2019s decision at a news conference on Tuesday, Mr. McCrory said, \u201cI respect disagreement.\u201dOpponents of the North Carolina law said Mr. McCrory\u2019s hand had been forced by more conservative elements of his party.\u201cHe\u2019s a moderate at heart, but he got rolled on this,\u201d said State Senator Jeff Jackson, a Democrat who represents Charlotte. \u201cThe Republicans in the General Assembly have enough votes to override all of his vetoes. His concern in vetoing this is that he would be overridden and his legislative agenda would be punished for even trying to stand firm on this issue.\u201dMr. McCrory also faces a tough re-election fight this fall against the state attorney general, Roy Cooper, who has said that he would not defend the law.Duke Energy, the state\u2019s largest power company \u2014 for which the governor worked, mostly in human relations, for 29 years, including while he was mayor of Charlotte \u2014 has come out strongly in opposition to discrimination against gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people, but has not taken a position on the law itself.The law\u2019s leading proponents, Speaker Tim Moore of the House and the Senate Republican leader, Phil Berger, issued a fiery news release on Tuesday laying blame for PayPal\u2019s pullout at the feet of Charlotte officials, whose anti-discrimination ordinance covering L.G.B.T. people had prompted the statewide action.The legislative leaders, who have framed the issue as an argument over whether access to bathrooms should be governed by gender identity or gender assignment at birth, accused Charlotte\u2019s mayor, Jennifer Roberts, of teaming \u201cup with a convicted child sexual predator to pass a radical bathroom policy allowing men to use girls\u2019 locker rooms and bathrooms.\u201d This was a reference to an L.G.B.T. advocate who resigned months ago as leader of a local gay-rights group because of controversy surrounding a 2000 conviction for committing a \u201clewd act\u201d with a 15-year-old boy while he was a youth minister in South Carolina, when he was 20.\u201cIf Jennifer Roberts, Roy Cooper and the far-left political correctness mob she\u2019s unleashed really care about the economic future of her city, they\u2019ll stop the misinformation campaign immediately and start telling the truth about this common-sense bathroom safety law before more damage is done,\u201d the Republican legislators concluded.Ms. Roberts responded, \u201cI urge the state to take responsibility for its harmful actions and to listen to its business constituency and quickly find a legislative remedy\u201d before more jobs are lost.Other companies reconsidering their business in North Carolina include Lionsgate, which is filming the musical \u201cDirty Dancing\u201d in the state but said in a recent statement that it would be \u201chard pressed to continue our relationship with North Carolina if this regressive law remains on the books.\u201d Braeburn Pharmaceuticals, which had announced plans for a $20 million expansion in Durham, said it was \u201cre-evaluating our options based on the recent, unjust legislation.\u201dThe irony is that the areas hit hardest by the backlash are cities with progressive mayors, including Charlotte. \u201cI think that was part of the political calculation behind this bill: that if North Carolina suffers as a result it will be the parts of the state that don\u2019t support the current Republican majority,\u201d said Mr. Jackson, the state senator.An article on Wednesday about a backlash in the South against anti-gay laws misstated Duke Energy\u2019s position regarding North Carolina\u2019s law banning anti-discrimination protections based on sexual orientation. While Duke came out strongly in opposition to discrimination against gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people, it did not take a position on the law itself.Jonathan M. Katz reported from Durham, and Erik Eckholm from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "BlackBerry Falls Short in Attempt at Android-Based Revival", "Date": "2016-04-01", "News": "Supported byOTTAWA \u2014 BlackBerry\u2019s attempt to revive its once-mighty smartphone business by using Google\u2019s Android operating system is off to a disappointing start.BlackBerry said on Friday that despite the move, it sold just 600,000 phones during its most recent quarter, which ended Feb. 29, a drop of about 100,000 phones from the previous quarter.It did not say how many of those phones were the new Android model, known as Priv. But during a conference call with analysts, John S. Chen, the chairman and chief executive of BlackBerry, acknowledged that Priv did not sell as well as he had hoped.Mr. Chen said that Priv sales suffered because of general slowness in sales of expensive phones, as well as delays in getting wireless carriers and stores to sell it. As he had done in the past, Mr. Chen vowed to stop making phones, the product that came to define the company, if that part of the business remained unprofitable.But Mr. Chen said that for now, at least, he remained confident that BlackBerry could find a way to continue making phones without losing money on them.\u201cI still believe we have a shot at it,\u201d Mr. Chen said during a conference call with analysts. \u201cHopefully I\u2019m not na\u00efve.\u201dThe announcement about phone sales came as the company reported a drop in revenue for both the quarter and the year, and a loss for both periods.Driven in part by the acquisition of a competitor, Good Technology, BlackBerry said its software revenue rose 113 percent in the year. But over all, annual revenue for the smartphone maker declined by one-third to $2.16 billion, and its net loss fell by a similar ratio, to $208 million.As Mr. Chen looks for answers on the phone side of the business, he has staked BlackBerry\u2019s future on selling software and services that allow businesses and governments to control their employees\u2019 smartphones and tablets and also increase their security.QNX, a branch of the company based in Ottawa, is trying to expand its business with about 250 automakers and auto-related companies. QNX produces operating systems and supplies them with software for things like in-car entertainment systems.

{"Headline": "Why We Are Still Reaching for Wallets, Not Phones, at the Checkout", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported bySammy Yuen, a graphic designer who lives on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, was standing in line at Whole Foods Market one morning waiting to pay. He used the Starbucks app on his phone to order coffee in advance and then bought his Whole Foods items with Apple Pay by holding the phone in front of the register.Using his phone in these ways has become a routine for Mr. Yuen. \u201cWherever I can use it, I do use it,\u201d he said.But Mr. Yuen is very much the exception.Banks, technology companies and retailers are spending large sums to build systems and apps so that people can pay for items with their phones in stores, where most retail spending still takes place. The hope is that phones will make payments more efficient and give banks and retailers new data on their customers\u2019 shopping habits. Phone and software makers, including Apple, Google and Samsung, are getting involved in mobile payments to make their products more useful and attractive to their owners.Behind all this is the belief that consumers will discover the benefits of paying with their phones \u2014 and then use them more often as a payment method.Yet this is happening slowly.A tiny percentage of in-store sales are made with phones. In the United States, an estimated $8.7 billion in purchases were made with phones in 2015, according to a survey by eMarketer, a research firm. That is a mere 0.2 percent of the estimated $4.35 trillion of in-store sales last year. Excluding purchases made with a wildly popular app by Starbucks, the amount of mobile payments would most likely be well below that $8.7 billion, payment industry experts say.Other customers coming out of Whole Foods that morning gave several reasons for not paying with their phones. Most were concerned about the security of the transactions \u2014 or of losing their phones and having other people get access to their financial data.They also doubted phones were much faster than credit or debit cards. Even Mr. Yuen said, \u201cI still think that swiping is faster.\u201dApple said the usage of Apple Pay accelerated significantly in the second half of 2015, compared with the first half of that year. The company did not define how it was measuring usage.Large numbers of consumers don\u2019t appear to be making frequent use of the other payment apps, either. Part of the problem may be that many apps are simultaneously vying for consumers\u2019 attention, keeping one from becoming dominant, at least for now.Confronted by the low enthusiasm for mobile payments, companies are looking for ways to generate some excitement.Samsung has taken a technological step that substantially increases the number of places where its service, Samsung Pay, can be used. Many phone payment methods require the technology near-field communication. But it does not exist on older payment terminals that read a card\u2019s magnetic strip. Samsung Pay, however, can be used on both types of terminals. Rival mobile payment services from Apple and Android do not work on the older technology.As a result, Samsung Pay can be used in more places, according to Thomas Ko, Samsung Pay\u2019s global co-general manager. \u201cTruly, you don\u2019t have to carry your wallet anymore,\u201d he said.But that advantage may not last, as the number of near-field communication terminals grows.Companies might also try to increase adoption by underscoring the ways in which paying by phone can be more secure than using a card. Thumbprint authentication and passcodes can make it almost impossible for a thief to use a stolen phone to pay for something.By contrast, a stolen credit card, or information from the card, can be easily misused until the theft is suspected or reported.But because card users generally do not have to pay fraudulent charges, the more secure nature of phones may not ultimately be the big draw that leads consumers to use them more for payments.Another way to increase use might be to make paying with a phone far quicker than using a card. Services like Apple Pay are designed to be fast. But at some stores, the customer still has to sign when using such services. And even when that isn\u2019t the case, taking out a phone and making a payment is probably not that much faster than using a card.Many payments specialists say they believe that for mobile payments systems to take off, they have to reduce costs for retailers. Seeing the savings, retailers may then offer their customers benefits for using their phones to pay, like rewards programs. Such a program has been one reason for the runaway popularity of the Starbucks payment app. And once consumers see real benefits from paying with their phones, they may finally turn to their phones a lot more at the checkout.That is why many payments experts are waiting to see what happens with JPMorgan Chase\u2019s digital wallet, called Chase Pay, which the bank aims to offer this year. JPMorgan has payments relationships with a wide range of merchants, which, the bank hopes, will give Chase Pay critical mass with both retailers and customers.Still, shoppers\u2019 infrequent use of mobile payments does not bode well. Credit and debit cards have drawbacks, but are easy to carry and generally quick to use. What\u2019s more, they don\u2019t have batteries that run out during a shopping trip. \u201cWhat happens if my phone dies?\u201d said Tyriek Good, a resident of Harlem, as he came out of Whole Foods last month. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get used to this.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the technology used by older payment terminals. Older terminals used magnetic strip readers, not magnetic secure transmission, which is recent technology that allows Samsung Pay to work with older payment terminals.Advertisement"}

Just stop everything else that you\u2019re doing.Mute your music. Turn off your television. Put down your sandwich and ignore that text message. While you\u2019re at it, put your phone away entirely. (Unless you\u2019re reading this on your phone. In which case, don\u2019t. But the other rules still apply.)Just read.You are now monotasking.Maybe this doesn\u2019t feel like a big deal. Doing one thing at a time isn\u2019t a new idea.So, in layman\u2019s terms, by doing more you\u2019re getting less done.But monotasking, also referred to as single-tasking or unitasking, isn\u2019t just about getting things done.Not the same as mindfulness, which focuses on emotional awareness, monotasking is a 21st-century term for what your high school English teacher probably just called \u201cpaying attention.\u201dMs. Zomorodi prefers the term \u201csingle-tasking\u201d: \u201c \u2018Monotasking\u2019 seemed boring to me. It sounds like \u2018monotonous.\u2019 \u201dKelly McGonigal, a psychologist, lecturer at Stanford and the author of \u201cThe Willpower Instinct,\u201d believes that monotasking is \u201csomething that needs to be practiced.\u201d She said: \u201cIt\u2019s an important ability and a form of self-awareness as opposed to a cognitive limitation.\u201dThis is great news for the self-identified monotaskers out there.Jon Pack, a 42-year-old photographer in Brooklyn, was happy to hear that his single-minded manner might be undergoing a rebrand. \u201cWhen I was looking for jobs and interviewing, they\u2019d always want me to say, \u2018I\u2019m a great multitasker,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cAnd I wouldn\u2019t. My inability to multitask was seen as a negative. Now I can just say, \u2018I am a monotasker. I am someone who works best when I focus on one thing at a time.\u2019 \u201dAnd the way we work can have effects that kick in long after we clock out.The term \u201cbrain dead\u201d suddenly takes on a whole new meaning.A good sign you\u2019ve task-switched yourself into a stupor: mindlessly scrolling Facebook at the end of the night or, as in Ms. Zomorodi\u2019s case, looking at couches on Pinterest. \u201cI just stuff my brain full of them because I can\u2019t manage to do anything else,\u201d she said. \u201cThe sad thing is that I don\u2019t get any closer to deciding which one I like.\u201dBut monotasking can also make work itself more enjoyable.\u201cI can multitask \u2014 and do, of course; it\u2019s kind of essential \u2014 but I prefer to do one thing at a time,\u201d Hayley Phelan, a 28-year-old writer, wrote in an email. \u201cIf I keep looking at my phone or my inbox or various websites, working feels a lot more tortuous. When I\u2019m focused and making progress, work is actually pleasurable.\u201dMs. Phelan isn\u2019t imagining things. \u201cAlmost any experience is improved by paying full attention to it,\u201d Ms. McGonigal said. \u201cAttention is one way your brain decides, \u2018Is this interesting? Is this worthwhile? Is this fun?\u2019 \u201dIt\u2019s the reason television shows we tweet through feel tiresome and books we pick up and put down and pick up again never seem to end. The more we allow ourselves to be distracted from a particular activity, the more we feel the need to be distracted. Paying attention pays dividends.This is why, according to Ms. McGonigal, the ability to monotask might be most valuable in social situations. \u201cResearch shows that just having a phone on the table is sufficiently distracting to reduce empathy and rapport between two people who are in conversation,\u201d she said.Twenty-five thousand people participated in Ms. Zomorodi\u2019s Infomagical project, which started the week with a single-tasking challenge. Upon completion, respondents agreed overwhelmingly that single-tasking was the No. 1 thing they wanted to carry into their post-Infomagical lives. \u201cBut they also said it was really, really hard,\u201d Ms. Zomorodi said.Parents of young children found it difficult for obvious reasons, as did people with jobs that permit them less control over their time. In those cases, try monotasking in areas where you can: conversations with your children, reading a book in bed before they go to sleep, dinner or drinks with friends. After all, monotasking is a good skill to incorporate into all aspects of your life, not just work.Even those with more flexibility can find themselves going to great lengths for a little bit of focus. Nick Pandolfi, who works in partnerships at Google, once traveled to northern Sweden in what he described as an \u201cextreme\u201d effort to monotask.\u201cI had to write my business school application essays, and I was having no luck spending an hour here and there after work and on the weekends,\u201d Mr. Pandolfi said. \u201cI just wasn\u2019t inspired.

{"Headline": "Airbnb Wants Travelers to \u2018Live Like a Local\u2019 With Its App", "Date": "2016-04-19", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The home-sharing app Airbnb is pushing into local reviews and recommendations, putting it increasingly into competition with services like Lonely Planet, Yelp and local tourism websites.The company, based in San Francisco, on Tuesday began offering Guidebooks, a feature that lets those who rent out their homes on Airbnb share information about their neighborhood\u2019s best restaurants, bars and attractions, including local spots that might not be found on travel websites or guides, all in the Airbnb app.Guidebooks\u2019 aim is to let people \u201clive like a local,\u201d Brian Chesky, the chief executive of Airbnb, said in an interview.People who use Airbnb previously had to leave the app to find local event and dining information using search engines, travel websites and local review services. But Airbnb\u2019s new feature means people can now eschew Yelp, Facebook, Google and other sites that have all longed to control the connection between consumers and local businesses.Personalization and matching are important because the Internet gives customers an overwhelming amount of information. \u201cThe importance of matching is even more specific to the travel industry, where people traveling to an entirely new destination are making particularly uninformed choices,\u201d Mr. Chesky said.The app clusters listings by neighborhood, and Guidebooks will characterize each area for people who may prefer a family-friendly neighborhood or one near a central business district to one that is filled with late-night revelers.Some Airbnb hosts, like Paul Schirmer in suburban Cincinnati, say they already provide guests with a binder that includes basics like the Wi-Fi password of their home, along with information on popular local restaurants, parks and shops.Mr. Schirmer said having that sort of information in the Airbnb app could make his listing more attractive because many people like to stay in an Airbnb \u201cto live in a neighborhood, relax, make dinner and not feel pressure to eat out every night.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Buy or Rent a Home? Weighing Which Is Better", "Date": "2016-04-01", "News": "Supported byYour MoneyRob Austin and his wife, Natalia, have a 10-month-old son, healthy incomes and plenty of cash in the bank for a down payment on a house. But they are happily renting a townhouse in Pasadena, Calif., with no plans to buy for now, given the frothy prices in their area.\u201cAs long as there is such a disconnect, where a couple like my wife and me have to put down a gargantuan down payment and still have a large monthly payment to get into a decent, and not necessarily nice, house, that is a game we don\u2019t wish to play,\u201d said Mr. Austin, a 39-year-old business manager at a biotechnology company. \u201cWhen home price-to-income levels come back to a more normal level, when that happens, then we will be the first to jump in. If that never happens, that is O.K.\u201dMore American households are renting, across all income levels and generations, for different reasons. But when homeownership is the centerpiece of the American dream, most of us have internalized certain ideals: Buying a home builds equity, putting you on the fast track to building wealth. Renting, by contrast, is essentially throwing money to the wind.The arguments in favor of ownership are persuasive, particularly for people who expect to stay in place for at least five to seven years but probably more. A mortgage acts like a forced savings plan, even if you\u2019re paying the bank hundreds of thousands of dollars in interest for the privilege of building equity. Call it the cost of enforcing a positive behavior.Buying also generally protects consumers from rising rents, while traditional mortgage payments remain constant. Then, there is the fact that buyers are using borrowed money to purchase an asset that is likely to appreciate over a long period, though that can backfire as well (see housing market plunge, millions of underwater borrowers, circa 2008). Being able to call a place your own has a real, albeit intangible, value too.How well any household will fare financially by buying or renting really depends on factors no one can predict. Other studies have found that renters who invest their down payment and any savings from renting as opposed to owning often come out ahead.Either way, most financial professionals would caution against viewing a home purchase as an investment, particularly after factoring in the cost of maintenance, taxes, insurance and the high costs of buying and selling, though it\u2019s difficult not to.\u201cDisregarding the special amenities that many people value in homeownership,\u201d Professor Shiller said, \u201cit would be hugely better invested in the stock market.\u201dThe choice between buying a home and renting one is among the biggest financial decisions that many adults make.There may also be something about many people who buy. As Mr. Benningfield pointed out, they may have other attributes that may contribute to their economic success.The authors\u2019 point, however, is that people often blindly believe that buying is usually the smarter option. \u201cMost of the public drive to buy is without looking under the hood,\u201d Professor Johnson said.But any number of variables can quickly shift that calculus, including the price of the home relative to the rent, whether the family is affluent enough to benefit from tax savings, and the time spent in the home.\u201cThe longer you stay, the stronger the argument is for buying, all else equal,\u201d said Aron Szapiro, who conducted the analysis. But he also contends that the tax advantages of homeownership are often oversold, particularly to moderate-income households.If you\u2019re trying to determine the right option, some guideposts may help. Mr. Szapiro, for example, found that in households with about $100,000 in earnings, net wealth typically rose more 10 years after buying a home than if they had rented \u2014 but only if the annual rent was 6 percent or more of the purchase price. So it would pay to buy a $600,000 home when rent in the area was about $3,000 a month or more. (In a couple of places, including New York and Washington, he found that it made sense to buy when the cost of renting was a bit lower relative to home prices.)Why 15 years? By his calculations, someone paying more than 180 months of rent might potentially do better by investing in the market, after considering the costs of owning.So if an apartment would rent for $4,000 a month, that means you shouldn\u2019t pay more than $720,000 ($4,000 x 180) for an equivalent property.Then there\u2019s what you feel in the pit of your stomach. To Mr. Austin, house prices in the enclave where he lives in Los Angeles feel as if they are in a bubble, the housing downturn a faded memory. \u201cMany people we know,\u201d he added, \u201care tripping over themselves to buy right now.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated, in one instance, the surname of a financial planner in San Francisco. He is Milo M. Benningfield, not Bennigfield.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Aims to Drive Down Tech Prices to Expand Its Reach", "Date": "2016-04-24", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, is clear about his vision for his company: He wants to triple the size of his social network, which now has 1.6 billion members.But to reach that new audience, he has to find a way to change telecommunications networks to make connecting to the Internet more affordable, since many of those would-be Facebook users live in developing countries.That could be bad news for the companies that make equipment for those networks, whether they are Silicon Valley giants like Cisco Systems or little widget makers that produce the parts to tie different pieces of the network together.\u201cThere is definitely going to be some pressure, some consolidation\u201d for many tech equipment suppliers, said Akshay Sharma, research director at the technology advisory firm Gartner. \u201cIf you\u2019re in hardware, you\u2019re going to reduce head count from thousands to maybe 10 people, a hundred at most.\u201dNo doubt, Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s grand \u2014 some would say grandiose \u2014 vision could take years to realize. But if he manages to make the way people connect to the Internet more affordable, it would be just the latest instance of how the company has quietly upended the traditional economics of the technology industry.Facebook has changed the way people interact with their friends on the Internet. But less understood outside tech circles is how the social network has come to be perhaps the most aggressive example of a growing number of companies that are unwilling to pay top dollar for products made by traditional technology suppliers.Mr. Zuckerberg has embraced so-called open-source concepts, which have helped him play catch-up with the giant computer networks of companies like Amazon and Google.Open source typically refers to freely shared code or even development plans that companies and people collectively create at a fraction of the price of traditional tech products. Bits of open-source technology can be found in all sorts of things, including Google\u2019s Android operating system and web browsers.Companies like Facebook often contribute to open-source projects since they don\u2019t make money selling products \u2014 instead, they have to buy products that help them offer their service. Keeping tech costs down helps the bottom line.When Facebook reveals the financial results for its most recent quarter on Wednesday, investors will no doubt scrutinize how much the company is spending, particularly since Mr. Zuckerberg has promised to invest more money in searching for new users. One big key to keeping those costs down has been open-source technology.It should not be surprising, then, that Mr. Zuckerberg is relying on open source to reduce the price of building and running the world\u2019s telecommunications networks, a business estimated to be worth about $150 billion a year.\u201cOur rule is 10 times faster or 10 times cheaper or both,\u201d said Jay Parikh, Facebook\u2019s vice president for engineering. \u201cWe want to get a full Facebook experience to every end user, whether that is video, or eventually virtual reality.\u201d\u201cThere is a new force in the system,\u201d said Dave Ward, Cisco\u2019s chief architect. \u201cWe\u2019d rather be on the train than in front of it.\u201dIn the future, Mr. Zuckerberg imagines that \u201ca physical thing, like a TV, will just be a $1 app\u201d inside virtual reality on Facebook, he recently told a conference of software developers building apps for Facebook. But that may be 10 years off, by Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s own admission. People who do not work at Facebook might say it is a fantasy.Facebook even appears willing to turn the price-crushing model on itself. To get virtual reality to every place in the world, Facebook\u2019s Oculus VR headsets, currently $600, may have to cost $5, said Mike Schroepfer, the company\u2019s chief technology officer.Is that another fantasy? For Facebook, getting those costs down could mean controlling the next big communications platform, since Mr. Zuckerberg believes virtual reality may eventually supplant smartphones as a primary connection to the online world.\u201cThe world is making enough phones. It\u2019s better for the world if there are fewer devices,\u201d Mr. Schroepfer said. \u201cIt\u2019s not totally obvious how all this shakes out \u2014 whether we\u2019ll have lots of consumer products, or it all disappears into a couple of VR headsets.\u201dHow much profit this new audience will yield Facebook is an open question. But Facebook would rather control a crucial technology than have to build on top of another company\u2019s products, as it has had to do with PCs and smartphones.\u201cIt\u2019s more opportunity to show ads,\u201d said Danny Sullivan, founder of the technology website Search Engine Land, who is a close watcher of the industry. \u201cIt\u2019s more opportunity to gather data on what we do or who we are connected with. It\u2019s more opportunity to build a new platform where Facebook serves as the broker of connectivity.\u201dAt the same Facebook developers\u2019 conference there were talks on the latest open-source efforts, including an urban wireless network that checks its performance 125,000 times a second, and a long-range wireless system that Facebook says can send a gigabit of data a second, about 10 times the rate of today\u2019s good-performing networks and enough for virtual reality.Both technologies, Mr. Parikh said, will be tested this year, with an eye to releasing them as open-source projects. \u201cWe\u2019ll be into all this stuff,\u201d he said. Facebook does not want to own or sell the gear, he added, but plans to work with \u201chundreds\u201d of local phone companies worldwide on cheaper high-speed connections.But others dismiss some of Facebook\u2019s efforts as hype. \u201cWe are connecting 700 million to 1.5 billion people a year via smartphones and tablets,\u201d said Ulf Ewaldsson, chief technical officer at Ericsson, one of the world\u2019s largest makers of telecommunications hardware.\u201cThey say they can do a 90 percent cost reduction, but that is from phone bills for high-cost customers,\u201d he said. \u201cPoor people need to be covered, and the industry is working on that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Companies Poised to Take Leap in Developing a Driverless Car", "Date": "2016-04-03", "News": "Supported byGansha Wu was a veteran engineering manager at Intel Corporation and director of Intel Labs China when two events upended his world last year.First, he listened to the veteran technology writer Michael Malone tell an audience of Intel employees that if they were too cautious they would fail. Then he attended a leadership training session for Intel executives. The trainer told them that \u201cto be a leader is to design a future that is unpredictable and which nobody bets on.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t sleep at night, thinking about his well-ordered, 16-year career at Intel. So he decided to take a risk. With four colleagues, he made the decision to take the uncertain path, which today is becoming more common in China than even in Silicon Valley: He quit his job to begin a start-up that specializes in autonomous, or self-driving, cars.In the process, Mr. Wu hit upon a rare moment when a tech sector in China is developing in lock step with a similar but separate market in the United States.In fact, some argue that conditions in China are actually more favorable for quick adoption of driverless cars, in part because of more aggressive support from the national and local governments. And, unlike in the United States, China never fully developed a romance with the open road and car ownership.Car ownership has spiked in China, of course. And in recent years, it has become a middle-class status symbol to own a car. For the ultrawealthy, there are clubs dedicated to Ferraris and Maseratis.But enormous traffic jams in China\u2019s largest cities can make driving a less-than-romantic experience. Why not let a machine built with artificial intelligence inside do the work for you?Research done by the Boston Consulting Group suggests that within 15 years China will be the largest market for autonomous vehicles, said Xavier Mosquet, a managing director at the firm. Automated taxis will most likely lead the trend.\u201cIt\u2019s not that people are more willing to use the cars in Beijing or Shanghai, it\u2019s that the economic value is much higher in China than in the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Mosquet said, adding that air pollution could be as much a catalyst as bad traffic.Even as American companies like Google and Tesla work on autonomous vehicles, a number of Chinese companies are working on driverless car technology. The Internet company Leshi Internet Information & Technology (better known as Letv) has a driverless car tech unit, and the Chinese carmaker Great Wall Motors has opened a research center in Silicon Valley. The assumed leader in the field in China is the search engine company Baidu, which has been at work on autonomous vehicles since 2013.Among the torrent of start-ups, however, Mr. Wu and his colleagues are unusual because of their experience.Mr. Wu\u2019s company, Uisee Technology, has yet to announce its financial backers, but it has significant ambitions. The team plans to have a technology demonstration ready in less than a year at the consumer electronics show in Las Vegas in 2017.\u201cHis team is an unusual collection of supertalent,\u201d said Kai-Fu Lee, a venture investor from Taiwan and former head of Google in China. \u201cThey combine a mechanical expert from a university, a top computer vision expert and machine learning from Google as well as Gansha and his team of semiconductor experts. Gansha is an excellent leader that binds these people together.\u201dThe founders of Uisee, which is an acronym for Utilization, Indiscriminate, Safety, Efficiency and Environment, say they believe the company will find a profitable niche between the poles of the driverless car debate that is raging in Silicon Valley.Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, has predicted that completely self-driving cars may be on the road in the United States in two to four years. Chris Urmson, the director of Google\u2019s self-driving-car program, has said his goal is to bring a self-driving car to market by 2019.Others are more cautious, and say they believe it may take a decade or longer for self-driving cars to hit the market. And among the biggest automakers like Toyota, the interest is less in cars that drive themselves than in cars that have artificial intelligence capabilities to assist drivers, like emergency braking.\u201cWe see a few stages toward fully autonomous driving,\u201d said Mr. Wu, adding that safety technologies are coming quickly. He said driver assistance systems will be followed by completely driverless cars in restricted circumstances, such as on private roads, fixed routes at low speed and in controlled environments. Uisee will begin by developing technologies that assist rather than replace drivers.Baidu has teamed up with BMW and recently said it was testing its technology in the United States. Baidu has said it is preparing to introduce automated public transportation services in China within the next two years.Unlike Google, which has had difficulty convincing regulators in its home state, California, that self-driving cars are ready for the road, Baidu already has the regulatory and infrastructure support of a number of local Chinese governments, which it will use to introduce small autonomous buses that will run set routes.The Chinese government is playing a major role in the overall driverless market. Along with empowering Baidu to run public transportation, in other cases central and local governments have been investing in research and development for driverless car projects.Mr. Wu also embodies a growing entrepreneurial movement in China. The Chinese government reported that 4.8 million new companies were registered from March 2014 to May 2015, a rate of 10,600 new businesses per day, or seven every minute. Even though venture investment has begun to dry up in China recently, the nation has clearly been infected with a Silicon Valley attitude.Although in some quarters it is still known as the land of copycat technology, China has long since moved on to copying the start-up ethos of the Valley, with more and more entrepreneurs creating their own companies.The Chinese government is encouraging the boom as a way to solve a number of economic problems, including unemployment and the transition of the economy from one centered on manufacturing to one based on services.\u201cThis year more than seven million people are entering the job market in China,\u201d said Haiyang Li, a professor at the Jesse H. Jones Graduate School of Business at Rice University in Houston. \u201cWhat are they going to do with these students? The government does not have any better way to solve the employment issue.\u201dEven as analysts and investors worry the government is over-investing in start-ups, the state support, along with China\u2019s engineering talent and the business need for self-driving cars, could help the nascent business in China.But there are obstacles. In China, roads often have poorly marked lanes and little signage. People, animals, three-wheel rickshaws and trucks are liable to veer in front of a car at any time. That makes for a more challenging engineering problem in China, said Junyi Zhang, a partner with the consulting firm Roland Berger.\u201cIt is harder in China, where many roads have pedestrians, bicycles, low-speed vehicles and high-speed vehicles all mixed together,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a very complicated environment, and many don\u2019t ride or drive to the same standard.\u201dCao Li contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}

This is a Margarita World. \u201cPeople are always shocked when they find out how big we\u2019ve gotten,\u201d Mr. Buffett said recently over lunch, grinning and splashing Tabasco on a modified Cobb salad. \u201cWe just kept quietly doing our thing. Not saying much. And now \u2014 bam! \u2014 here we are.\u201d\u201cThe stroke of genius was making Margaritaville a feeling, not a place,\u201d said Mindy Grossman, the chief executive of the home-shopping behemoths HSN and Frontgate, where 400-plus Margaritaville items include a $799 hammock and $159 penny loafers. \u201cIf you don\u2019t take the name so literally, growth could be endless.\u201dEndless?\u201cO.K., not endless,\u201d Ms. Grossman said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t suggest doing fake fur coats. But almost.\u201dMr. Buffett, patron saint of the untroubled, has long been known for his business acumen. In some ways, with his approach to concert merchandise and tour sponsorship in the 1980s, he created the model of musician-as-entrepreneur that managers for artists like Madonna and Dave Matthews have pursued more recently. Other singers have parlayed their personas into business empires \u2014 Dolly Parton, for instance, with her Dollywood theme park, Dixie Stampede dinner theaters, Dolly slot machines and \u201cCoat of Many Colors\u201d merchandise \u2014 but none are as singularly sprawling as Mr. Buffett\u2019s Margaritaville.\u201cHe understands his brand, which has a substantial reach,\u201d Warren E. Buffett, a friend (but not a relative), said by phone. \u201cOne of the secrets to his success is that he never really loses any fans.\u201dStill, a thriving brand needs to steadily recruit new devotees, and that may be Margaritaville\u2019s biggest challenge. While Mr. Buffett\u2019s fan base includes young people \u2014 drunkenly singing along to \u201cMargaritaville\u201d in a college bar is practically an American rite of passage \u2014 his core followers are baby boomers. How does Margaritaville make itself more relevant to people in their 30s? What fuels sales of those licensed products once Mr. Buffett, 69, has warbled his last warble?It\u2019s a subject that Mr. Cohlan, who is Margaritaville\u2019s chief executive, was not especially keen to discuss. Asked about how the company thinks about a future without its public face, Mr. Cohlan said, \u201cJimmy Buffett is an American treasure,\u201d and changed the subject.The goal is a fully formed ecosystem. Last year, an estimated 15 million people ate at one of Mr. Buffett\u2019s 67 restaurants or stayed at one of his seven hotels and time-share resorts. The company also wants the masses to buy Margaritaville food at their local grocery store (items like iced tea, frozen shrimp and tortilla chips are already on shelves), watch Margaritaville-produced videos on their phones (\u201cThe Best Beach Bars of the Caribbean\u201d is one idea in development) and maybe even sleep on Margaritaville bedsheets (in various designs, including \u201cStrawberry Daiquiri\u201d coral, starting at $19.98).Mr. Buffett and Mr. Cohlan are co-owners of the rest of Margaritaville.Mr. Schoen added, \u201cIt has the potential to be a major global brand.\u201dTo understand the evolving Margaritaville, consider the 349-room Margaritaville Hollywood Beach Resort (that\u2019s Hollywood, Fla.), which cost $190 million to build and held its grand opening in November. Relying almost entirely on word of mouth, the hotel has reached an occupancy rate of 93 percent, the lodging equivalent of a smash hit.\u201cI personally sweated every freaking detail of this place for eight years,\u201d said a beaming Mr. Cohlan in March, as he held court in the hotel\u2019s light-flooded lobby, which is accented with palm trees and a lime green and turquoise carpet. \u201cHey! Good to see you!\u201d he hollered to an employee as she stopped to tell him how proud she was to work at the hotel. \u201cThank you, doll,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means the world.\u201dLocated about 40 minutes north of Miami Beach, Hollywood is still Old Florida, land of grim souvenir shops, jai alai courts and low-slung cinder block motels. And some residents worried that Mr. Buffett\u2019s arrival would make it worse. \u201cWe don\u2019t need people being wasted away in Margaritaville,\u201d Audrey Joynt, a past president of the Hollywood Beach Business Association, told The Miami Herald in 2010, as Mr. Cohlan was pushing city managers to approve the project.But Margaritaville surprised critics by building a quite upscale resort.Rooms, decorated with white shutters, aqua blue accents and hardwood floors, start at nearly $300 and go up to $1,800 for oceanfront suites. The steakhouse, JWB Prime Steak and Seafood, could hold its own in Manhattan. \u201cHotel companies always make the same mistake when the budget gets tight at the end of a project,\u201d Mr. Cohlan said. \u201cThe last coat of paint gets cut. But guess what? That\u2019s what your guests see.\u201dThere is a boozy, Nascar-lovin\u2019, nacho-munchin\u2019 clientele, for sure. But there are also men and women in business suits \u2014 the hotel has 30,000 square feet of meeting space \u2014 and guests like Lynn and Pam Wilken, visitors in their 50s from Ashkum, Ill., where they farm soybeans and run a candle business.\u201cWe don\u2019t follow Jimmy Buffett\u2019s music, but his name gave me comfort about booking a hotel online that we didn\u2019t know anything about,\u201d Mrs. Wilken said, as she lounged poolside with her husband. The couple, finishing a weeklong stay at the resort, vowed to come back, despite a caveat or two. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to wander too far down the beach, particularly at night, but that\u2019s fine with us.\u201dMr. Wilken added: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to put your finger on, but there is something authentic about this place. It doesn\u2019t feel forced on you.\u201d\u201cWe somehow got it right,\u201d Mr. Buffett said of the Hollywood property. \u201cThank you, Baby Jesus and John Cohlan.\u201dFittingly, the Margaritaville empire started with a nap.The year was 1996, and Mr. Cohlan, then working for the corporate raider Nelson Peltz, known for targeting companies like Snapple and Arby\u2019s, had gotten to know Mr. Buffett\u2019s wife, Jane, on the Palm Beach, Fla., society circuit. One day, Mr. Cohlan turned up at the Buffetts\u2019 home to talk about the potential growth of Margaritaville, which was then just a popular song \u2014 released in 1977, it peaked at No. 8 on the pop charts \u2014 and a two-restaurant chainlet.But the singer was asleep.\u201cHad it not been for Jane, who went to wake Jimmy up, this extremely successful partnership might not have happened,\u201d said Richard Plepler, the chief executive of HBO, who knows both men. Asked about this anecdote, Mr. Buffett smiled sheepishly and said: \u201cI do like a good nap. That\u2019s true.\u201dMr. Buffett opened his first Margaritaville restaurant in 1987 in Key West, Fla. It found instant success \u2014 so much, in fact, that he opened a second location in New Orleans in 1993. But the sequel was a relative dud, and Mr. Buffett applied the brakes, rebuffing an offer from the Walt Disney Company to build a lavishly themed Margaritaville at a Walt Disney World shopping mall.Just before the Orlando opening, Mr. Cohlan played hardball with Seagram over a liquor matter and inadvertently started a new line of business. Seagram, which also owned Mr. Buffett\u2019s record company then, had introduced Parrot Bay rum, which Mr. Buffett felt co-opted his band\u2019s Parrot Head imagery.

Probably Not in Your Lifetime", "Date": "2016-04-07", "News": "Supported byMisconceptionsIn March when Alphago, the Go-playing software program designed by Google\u2019s DeepMind subsidiary defeated Lee Se-dol, the human Go champion, some in Silicon Valley proclaimed the event as a precursor of the imminent arrival of genuine thinking machines.The achievement was rooted in recent advances in pattern recognition technologies that have also yielded impressive results in speech recognition, computer vision and machine learning. The progress in artificial intelligence has become a flash point for converging fears that we feel about the smart machines that are increasingly surrounding us.However, most artificial intelligence researchers still discount the idea of an \u201cintelligence explosion.\u201dThe idea was formally described as the \u201cSingularity\u201d in 1993 by Vernor Vinge, a computer scientist and science fiction writer, who posited that accelerating technological change would inevitably lead to machine intelligence that would match and then surpass human intelligence. In his original essay, Dr. Vinge suggested that the point in time at which machines attained superhuman intelligence would happen sometime between 2005 and 2030.Ray Kurzweil, an artificial intelligence researcher, extended the idea in his 2006 book \u201cThe Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology,\u201d where he argues that machines will outstrip human capabilities in 2045. The idea was popularized in movies such as \u201cTranscendence\u201d and \u201cHer.\u201dWhat has not been shown, however, is scientific evidence for such an event. Indeed, the idea has been treated more skeptically by neuroscientists and a vast majority of artificial intelligence researchers.We\u2019re using the first week of April as an opportunity to debunk some of the misconceptions about health and science that circulate all year round.For starters, biologists acknowledge that the basic mechanisms for biological intelligence are still not completely understood, and as a result there is not a good model of human intelligence for computers to simulate.The notion of the Singularity is predicated on Moore\u2019s Law, the 1965 observation by the Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, that the number of transistors that can be etched onto a sliver of silicon doubles at roughly two year intervals. This has fostered the notion of exponential change, in which technology advances slowly at first and then with increasing rapidity with each succeeding technological generation.At this stage Moore\u2019s Law seems to be on the verge of stalling. Transistors will soon reach fundamental physical limits when they are made from just handfuls of atoms. It\u2019s further evidence that there will be no quick path to thinking machines.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "At Chobani, Now It\u2019s Not Just the Yogurt That\u2019s Rich", "Date": "2016-04-26", "News": "Supported byNEW BERLIN, N.Y. \u2014 The 2,000 full-time employees of the yogurt company Chobani were handed quite the surprise on Tuesday: an ownership stake that could make some of them millionaires.Hamdi Ulukaya, the Turkish immigrant who founded Chobani in 2005, told workers at the company\u2019s plant here in upstate New York that he would be giving them shares worth up to 10 percent of the company when it goes public or is sold.The goal, he said, is to pass along the wealth they have helped build in the decade since the company started. Chobani is now widely considered to be worth several billion dollars.\u201cI\u2019ve built something I never thought would be such a success, but I cannot think of Chobani being built without all these people,\u201d Mr. Ulukaya said in an interview in his Manhattan office that was granted on the condition that no details of the program would be disclosed before the announcement.\u201cNow they\u2019ll be working to build the company even more and building their future at the same time,\u201d he said.Chobani employees received the news on Tuesday morning. Each worker received a white packet; inside was information about how many Chobani shares they were given. The number of shares given to each person is based on tenure, so the longer an employee has been at the company, the bigger the stake.Rich Lake, lead project manager, was one of the original group of five employees Mr. Ulukaya hired for the plant in New Berlin. Mr. Lake said on Tuesday that he did not expect Chobani shares to change his life much. \u201cI\u2019m not one for living outside my means,\u201d he said.Rather, he said, the shares are an acknowledgment of what he and the other employees have put into Chobani.\u201cIt\u2019s better than a bonus or a raise,\u201d Mr. Lake said. \u201cIt\u2019s the best thing because you\u2019re getting a piece of this thing you helped build.\u201dThe transfer of money by Mr. Ulukaya touches on a hot-button economic issue: the rapidly expanding gap in pay between executives and average workers. The United States has one of the widest pay gaps, and the topic has played a prominent role in this year\u2019s presidential race, particularly among the Democrats.The shares given to Chobani employees are coming directly from Mr. Ulukaya. The shares can be sold if the company goes public or is bought by another business, neither of which seems imminent. Employees can hang onto the shares if they leave or retire, or the company will buy them back.The unusual announcement comes before TPG Capital, whose $750 million loan helped bail out Chobani, can buy a stake in the company. Tension between Mr. Ulukaya and TPG about the direction of the company emerged shortly after the loan deal.TPG has warrants to buy 20 percent or more of Chobani\u2019s shares, depending on targets set in the original deal it struck. But that percentage would now be calculated from the 90 percent of the remaining shares, after the 10 percent given to the employees, essentially diluting TPG\u2019s potential stake.TPG declined to comment on Tuesday.In addition, a year ago Mr. Ulukaya settled a lawsuit with his ex-wife, who had sought a stake in the company. The terms of the settlement were not released.Technology start-ups often pay employees partly in shares to help recruit them or to compete in a company\u2019s early days for in-demand workers. Early employees of Google and Facebook became overnight multimillionaires thanks to such compensation.But unlike many of those tech companies, Mr. Ulukaya is giving his employees a piece of the company after its value is firmly established.\u201cIt\u2019s very uncommon and rare, especially in this industry, for these kinds of programs to be rolled out,\u201d said Jessica Kennedy, a principal at Mercer, the large human resources consulting firm that worked with Chobani on the new program.Mr. Ulukaya has played a hands-on role in the company since 2005, when he bought a defunct Kraft yogurt plant here with an $800,000 loan from the Small Business Administration. Two years later, he began selling Greek yogurt, setting off a heated competition in what had been one of the sleepier refrigerated cases in grocery stores.Chobani pays employees above the minimum wage and offers full-time employees health benefits and other benefits. Early on, Mr. Ulukaya established a 401(k) plan for employees and pushed them to participate.\u201cI preached and nagged and tried to force them to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, not all did, and I\u2019ve continued to worry about them in retirement.\u201dA few years ago, though, the company ran into financial problems after spending almost half a billion dollars to build the largest yogurt processing plant in the world, a one-million-square-foot facility in Idaho. The new plant allowed the company to expand into new products, like a children\u2019s yogurt packed in a tube and tiny cups of dessert-like yogurts.But the company struggled to get lines up and running smoothly, and public health officials identified mold contamination in some products.\u201cIt was a wake-up call for us,\u201d Mr. Ulukaya said soberly. \u201cIt made me realize that I needed to get this right, and so I\u2019m glad it happened.\u201dThe company had to close lines and invest in improving its food safety regimens. It also took the loan from TPG Capital to help build operations better suited to the billion-dollar business Chobani had become.In a presentation to investors, though, TPG boasted about how it had waited until the last minute to come to Chobani\u2019s rescue with the loan, thus allowing it to negotiate better terms in a deal that it estimated could increase the company\u2019s value to as much as $7 billion. In addition, rumors circulated that TPG wanted to replace Mr. Ulukaya with a new chief executive, which rankled him.But in the last year or so, business has rebounded, thanks in large part to new products made at the Idaho plant.Mr. Ulukaya will still own the vast majority of the company, though his portion will be diluted as well. He said that giving his employees a stake in the company\u2019s success was among the terms he demanded when the deal with TPG was struck.\u201cTo me, there are two kinds of people in this world,\u201d he said on Tuesday. \u201cThe people who work at Chobani and the people who don\u2019t.\u201dMichael J. de la Merced contributed reporting from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

Even online behemoths like Zappos have made their live call centers a cornerstone of their business (their parent company, Amazon, less so).At least some forward-thinking proprietors prefer the online algorithms to handle the busywork \u2014 reservations, directions \u2014 so they can carve out time to run a restaurant.This shift from the phone to the Internet dovetails with a speakeasy-chic ethos that has long been a part of New York night life. Over the last decade or so, there was Milk & Honey, a temple of mixology hidden behind a Lower East Side storefront. Milk & Honey was almost impossible to find, and even harder to book with its unlisted phone number, exchanged like a secret handshake among in-the-know types.Even before that, in the \u201990s, Keith McNally\u2019s Balthazar \u2014 then a white-hot nexus of the celebrity class and the media elite \u2014 was known to have a secret insiders-only reservations number, which could actually help power brokers secure a table.Nowadays, withholding a phone altogether can still help foster, in some small way, a sense of clubby exclusivity.At Two Hands, the cafe on Mulberry Street that emphasizes its \u201ccommunity focus\u201d on its website, the lack of a phone functions as a velvet rope, allowing management to make sure it can accommodate neighborhood regulars before day-trippers looking to call ahead for reservations.\u201cWe have a lot of locals, we know their names, they say hi, we have a conversation,\u201d said Nick Duckworth, a surfer-ish young manager during a recent visit, as diners sampled dishes like ricotta toast with coconut and chia amid hanging lamps modeled after puffy clouds and walls covered with framed art.\u201cEveryone\u2019s welcome, and no one deserves to call ahead and reserve,\u201d he said. \u201cIt all comes back to community.\u201dAnd at Noah, in a space as coolly minimalist as a West Chelsea art gallery, shoppers never need fear a phone call violating their discerning appreciation of the Earth Uber Alles T-shirts and shoes trimmed with pony fur.\u201cPeople come in, they like the music we\u2019re playing, they have a nice conversation,\u201d Mr. Babenzien said. \u201cA ringing phone is really disruptive to the vibe.\u201dBesides, patrons have other options to connect. Many options. In addition to email, which itself seems old-fashioned these days, many restaurants, for example, now interact with customers continuously through Instagram and Twitter (say, exchanging snapshots of the latest specials).Unlike a phone or email, \u201cthose channels give people a feel of a person\u2019s presence,\u201d said Jason Wang, who tweets and \u2019grams with the fervor of a Kardashian in support of his buzzed-about regional Chinese restaurant chain, Xi\u2019an Famous Foods.This is not to say that dumping the phone always makes life easier. There are, after all, times when shoppers actually want to get someone on the phone quickly (say, to check if a certain item is in stock), instead of sending an email and praying for a response that may or may not come.Mr. Marazzo decided to go phone-free at Virgola, based on his experiences as a headwaiter at a prominent New York restaurant.\u201cEveryone calls with these crazy requests: \u2018I\u2019m coming with a group,\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m coming with a celebrity,\u2019\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cFifty percent of the time they don\u2019t show up.

There, it plans to showcase autonomous shuttles, electric bikes and other green modes of transportation.The project will take 10 years to complete and consolidate some 30,000 employees now housed in 70 buildings, the company said.\u201cThis is more than an investment in new buildings,\u201d Mark Fields, Ford\u2019s chief executive, said in a webcast.Donna Inch, who heads Ford\u2019s real estate arm, said the company hoped that the interconnected campuses and new buildings with new open work spaces would spur innovation.\u201cThe whole idea is to think differently,\u201d Ms. Inch said in an interview. Ford, she added, takes the view that automakers must \u201ckeep reinventing yourself if you\u2019re going to be relevant for the next 100 years.\u201dFord did not indicate how much it would spend on the makeover, except to say it is included in planned capital expenses. Ford has budgeted $7.7 billion for capital costs this year and is projecting to increase that to $9 billion by around 2020, a spokesman said.The headquarters plan reflects a broader struggle by automakers to shed their Rust Belt images and recast themselves as nimble, high-growth companies, said Akshay Anand, an analyst at with the research firm Kelley Blue Book.It is a move that is aimed at investors and potential employees as much as consumers of the future, Mr. Anand said. \u201cFord is now saying, \u2018We want to be the place everybody is talking about when you\u2019re working in these fields.\u2019\u201dHenry Ford founded his car company in Detroit, but in 1917 began building a factory in Dearborn, his hometown. As more facilities were moved there, the city became synonymous with the company.The first phase of Ford\u2019s project will begin this year and focus on the company\u2019s research and engineering facilities, which date to 1953. They will be renovated and linked with new green spaces, covered walkways and bike paths. The centerpiece will be a new design center. Work is supposed to be completed by 2023.A renovation of its \u201cGlass House\u201d headquarters building, which opened in 1956, is scheduled to begin in 2021. Over several more years, it will be connected to a series of new and existing buildings. They will be linked to parking decks, soccer fields and a nearby arboretum.Together, the two campuses will serve as a showcase for the future, with autonomous vehicles ferrying executives around and other people riding electric bikes.All of the buildings will be designed to minimize energy use. One of them will demonstrate sustainability by generating more energy than it consumes. It will rely on solar power as well as geothermal power for heating and cooling, Ford said.Advertisement"}

While Deep Blue had been trained and programmed by IBM with some knowledge about chess, its advantage lay primarily in what computer scientists call brute-force searching. At each step of the game Deep Blue would rapidly look ahead, exploring a maze of hypothetical moves and countermoves and counter-countermoves. Then it would make the choice that its algorithms ranked as the best. No living brain could possibly move so fast.But in Go, an ancient board game renowned for its complexity, the ever-forking space of possibilities is so much vaster that sheer electronic speed was not nearly enough. Capturing in a computer something closer to human intuition \u2014 the ability to seek and respond to meaningful patterns \u2014 seemed crucial and very far away.Other seemingly distant goals included the ability to translate automatically between two languages or to recognize speech with enough accuracy to be useful outside the laboratory. Computer scientists had already spent decades trying to crack these problems.For many, the aim was not just to make an artificial intelligence, but to understand deep principles of syntax, semantics and phonetics, and even what it means to think.Now anyone with a smartphone or laptop (communing by Internet with a supercomputing cloud) can get a rough translation of text in many languages. They can dictate instead of type. Photo software can sort not just by date and location but by the faces of the subjects.The results are imperfect and often clumsy, but they would have been mind-blowing in 1997. What happened between then and now?Of course, computers became ever more powerful. But even today\u2019s fastest aren\u2019t able to anticipate all of the permutations of a situation like playing Go. Success on this and other fronts has come from harnessing speed in other ways.The breakthrough in translation came from setting aside the question of what it means to understand a language and just finding a technology that works. The automated systems start with a text that has already been translated, by human brains. Then both versions are fed to a computer. By rapidly comparing the two, the machine compiles a thicket of statistical correlations, associating words and phrases with their likely foreign counterparts.Similar approaches, more artificial than intelligent, have led to surprisingly rapid improvements in recognizing speech and facial images, as well as with playing championship Go.In AlphaGo, learning algorithms, called deep neural nets, were trained using a database of millions of moves made in the past by human players. Then it refined this knowledge by playing one split-second game after another against itself.Tweak by algorithmic tweak, it became ever more adept at the game. By combining this insensate learning, which amounts to many human lifetimes of experience, with a technique called Monte Carlo tree search, named for the ability to randomly sample a universe of possible moves, AlphaGo prevailed.That was an enormous victory. But the glory goes not to the computer program but to the human brains that pulled it off. At the end of the tournament in Seoul, South Korea, 15 of them took the stage. They represented just a fraction of the number of people it took to invent and execute all of the technologies involved. Lee Se-dol was playing against an army.Back in 1997 I wrote, \u201cTo play a decent game of Go, a computer must be endowed with the ability to recognize subtle, complex patterns and to draw on the kind of intuitive knowledge that is the hallmark of human intelligence.\u201d Defeating a human Go champion, I wrote, \u201cwill be a sign that artificial intelligence is truly beginning to become as good as the real thing.\u201d\u201cAlso, it takes millions of training examples for AlphaGo to learn to recognize patterns,\u201d she continued, \u201cwhereas it only seems to take humans a few.\u201d\u201cIt was a regrettable game, but I enjoyed it,\u201d Mr. Lee said during the award ceremony. (Regret, enjoy \u2014 these words do not compute.) He added that the contest \u201cclearly showed my weaknesses, but not the weakness of humanity.\u201dPicking up the plaque and bouquet he had been given as consolation prizes, he laughed nervously and stumbled from the stage. Several days later, he said he would like a rematch.The Raw Data column on Tuesday about artificial intelligence and a Google computer program that defeated a Go champion, Lee Se-dol, referred incorrectly to the champion.

{"Headline": "The Digital Afterlife of Lost Family Photos", "Date": "2016-04-26", "News": "Supported byOn PhotographyThe photographs were Polaroids, taken between the 1970s and the 2000s. Zun Lee bought them at flea markets, at garage sales or on eBay. Most of them depicted African-Americans: people wearing stylish clothes, relaxing in the yard, celebrating birthdays. A few depicted people in prison uniforms. All the photographs had somehow been separated from their original owners and had become what Lee calls \u201corphaned Polaroids.\u201dFound photographs have long been important to artists like Lee. Photos taken by amateurs can sometimes acquire new value on account of their uniqueness, their age or simply the knowledge that they were once meaningful to a stranger. As part of a group, they can evoke a collector\u2019s sensibility or tell us something about a historical period in a way professional photographs might not. For Lee, collecting found photographs of African-\u00adAmericans \u2014 a project he called \u201cFade Resistance\u201d \u2014 had an additional and deeply personal meaning.Lee was raised in Germany by Korean parents. In his 30s, his mother told him that the man who raised him was not his biological father. But because her relationship with that man, who was black, had been fleeting, she refused to tell her son more about him. This revelation, at once momentous and limited, changed Lee\u2019s life. To make sense of his personal loss, and to explore his connectedness to black America, he took up photography. I became friends with Lee around the time he began making pictures of black fathers and their children in the Bronx and elsewhere; that project led to a book, \u201cFather Figure,\u201d for which I wrote a preface. Later, Lee began to collect the Polaroids \u2014 thousands of them \u2014 that ended up in \u201cFade Resistance.\u201dWho took these photos? Who do they depict? The basic contextual details we would usually expect from snapshots are missing here. The absence of this information is bittersweet: We are bewildered, but we are also ferried over from imagery into imagination. In Lee\u2019s case, the story of his orphaned Polaroids took a surprising turn. When he uploaded some of them to Facebook, the social network\u2019s facial-recognition technology immediately began to match them with real people. Lee was not sure who was doing the tagging. Intrigued and wary, he sent a message to one individual who was tagged in several of the pictures. There was no response. Then, several weeks later, he got a message from the same man: a curt request that he take the pictures down.Twenty-two of the pictures I bought that day featured the same woman at different stages in her life. She was sometimes alone and sometimes with family. But there she was, in picture after picture, from as far back as the late 1930s until at least 1980. She was dark-haired (was she Italian?) and had an unmistakable, toothy smile and cheeks that rose high on her face. A few of these photos had inscriptions, in pencil or pen, on the back or along the white border on the front. \u201cRock of Gibralter [sic] \u2014 Margaret, Kate & myself.\u201d \u201cLake Huntington, May 1939.\u201d I felt I was somehow rescuing these pictures from the anonymity of the pile. I named the woman Mrs. X.I didn\u2019t put my images of Mrs. X online, in part because I didn\u2019t want anyone to recognize her. I also felt a little guilty: \u201cmy\u201d images of Mrs. X? I had the sense that my possession of these pictures was not their ideal posterity. They should be in the keeping of people who knew this woman, who cared about her. (Imagine your own most precious family photos permanently in the hands of a complete stranger.) And yet, despite my doubts, I was also happy to have the pictures. Here she is in 1939 in her bathing suit, here she is with her husband (?), her son (?). Here she is abroad. We have color pictures now. Then she\u2019s noticeably older, and the husband (?) is no longer there, but there are friends (?) and relatives (?). I looked at each of the photographs through a mesh of question marks, sustained by Mrs. X\u2019s absolutely distinctive smile. From time to time, returning to the pictures, I am aware that I am touching a photograph that Mrs. X also touched. Is this woman still alive? It\u2019s possible, but I doubt it.The photos Zun Lee collected, digitally scanned and put out in public, have had a different life from the photos in my collection. He wrote back to the man who was tagged in some of them and suggested meeting. After all, he did not consider himself the owner of the photos, only their custodian. Perhaps, Lee offered, he might fly to Los Angeles and hand the photos over in person. The man said no. Lee was disappointed but sympathetic. He said he\u2019d already been thinking about how databases and tags are not neutral, how they can wind up being hostile toward communities of color. \u201cI completely understood,\u201d Lee told me. \u201cThis man was saying, \u2018We are not willing participants.\u2019 The black body is used as a commodity, as something that is surveilled. The man was telling me, \u2018No, you\u2019re not welcome, this is not art, get the hell out of our lives.\u2019 And I understood it.\u201dPeople have a right to be skeptical about the encounter between the analog experience of life and the futuristic algorithms that often prioritize what is possible over what it desirable. Already there are reports of churches scanning worshipers\u2019 faces to determine who attends regularly, the better to know whom to ask for donations. Shops match your face to a database so that they can greet you by name \u2014 or identify you as a potential shoplifter. Black people in particular, against the historical backdrop of surveillance and state hostility and corporate disregard, have a right to doubt these technologies. There was a recent report of Google\u2019s photo app automatically tagging a photo of two black people as \u201cgorillas\u201d \u2014 another instance of machines replicating the nastier prejudices of their human teachers.Lee\u2019s pleasure in the Polaroids he bought was also shadowed by questions: Why had so many families lost their things to secondhand dealers and estate sales? Behind these photos of bell-bottoms, Afros, birthday parties and interiors rich with period detail lay the invisible stories of evictions, dispossessions or separations. The Polaroids were evidence of joy, but the fate of the photographs themselves was unhappy. Lee acceded to his interlocutor\u2019s request and took the tagged photos down.In my collection, there is a picture from the late 19th or early 20th century, an image I think about as much as the entire series of Mrs. X pictures. This seated woman wears a long dark skirt, dark stockings and polished dark shoes. Her hair is a neatly parted mass of black, almost an Afro. She wears a pale jacket and is seated outside, next to a door and a brick wall. She looks off to her right. Below, not on the white border of the photograph but directly on the photograph itself, someone has written, in ink, the single word \u201cnigger.\u201dI doubt that the person responsible for this vandalism knew this woman personally. Perhaps it was written decades later. The word, after all, has been with us a long time, as has the spitefulness with which it is deployed. But whenever the defacement occurred, I feel it has something in common with both a contemporary form of aggression and a very old one. Black Americans, for most of their time in this country, were named, traded and collected against their will. They were branded \u2014 physically tagged \u2014 both to hurt and to control them. The woman in my photograph has been tagged, too, semantically. The written slur is like a brand.Lee sent me a screen shot of his Facebook page as it looked while he was uploading a batch of Polaroids. Several of the images are of men in prison. There are white rectangles framing the faces, and there is an instruction above each picture: \u201cClick Anywhere to Tag.\u201d That mild directive \u2014 an automated instruction from Facebook \u2014 suddenly seems sinister. What if these people don\u2019t wish to be tagged? What are their rights? These doubts have led Lee to focus more on an offline display of these images. I faced the more immediate conundrum of illustrating this column and decided not to show the faces of the people in my collection.American history has long struggled to believe the joys and intimacies of black American life. Social media, fortunately, makes those human realities visible to a much larger swath of the population than ever before. But there\u2019s also a paradox: To make intimacy public is often to render it less intimate. For all of us, but especially for those in communities of color, being digitally tracked does not solve the conundrums of inequality. Whatever else the machines learn, they\u2019ll have to learn about our sense of privacy too, the human necessity of leaving some things untagged and undeclared.Teju Cole is a photographer, essayist and the author of two works of fiction, \u201cOpen City\u201d and \u201cEvery Day Is for the Thief.\u201d He teaches at Bard College.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Selling Surfers on a New Way to Ride Waves", "Date": "2016-04-27", "News": "Supported byEntrepreneurs face many obstacles in starting a new business, but the founders of Slyde Handboards face a particularly daunting one: how to create a market for a product most people have never heard of, and for a sport they know nothing about.Yet over the course of five years, Slyde Handboards has grown into a robust company through the use of creative marketing tactics that tap into a world where GoPro videos celebrate unusual sports and start-ups can harness social media \u2014 and their fans \u2014 to spread the word.The idea for Slyde was born on a beach in Durban, South Africa, where Steve Watts spent his childhood surfing and swimming. He and his friends especially liked to bodysurf the coastline known for its challenging surf, with the help of flat, wave-riding objects like flip-flops, Frisbees and even fast-food trays.When their surfboards became too worn and waterlogged to use, they broke them apart, took off the fiberglass, and shaped the foam inside into five or six different hand-held boards. These handboards allowed users to move faster and have more control in the water.By the time he was 16, Mr. Watts wanted to create his own line of bodysurfing handboards.\u201cThere was no brand associated with them back then,\u201d he said. \u201cYou had to make your own if you wanted one.\u201dAfter studying product design in London and San Francisco, Mr. Watts eventually made his way to Los Angeles. In 2010, he won the green card lottery.The same week he signed the paperwork for United States residency, he also introduced Slyde, and was soon helped by a surfing student of his, Russell Ellers. Mr. Ellers had become a close friend and lent Mr. Watts both $130,000 and his Venice Beach garage to start the company. That investment converted to equity and Mr. Ellers is now a co-founder and 30 percent owner.Slyde released its first handboard, the Wedge, in 2011, a far more sophisticated version of the boards Mr. Watts, now 39, made as a teenager from the foam inside old surfboards.The company\u2019s third co-founder, Angela Ferendo, who is now Mr. Watts\u2019s wife, joined the company in 2013. Ms. Watts had worked for two other start-ups, one a food delivery service and the other a tech company, and understands the inherent challenges in introducing a new product to a market.But at Slyde, there was the added burden of inventing a market for a product and popularizing a sport.Few people know about handboarding because it has been a niche within surfing since the early 1990s, said Sean Smith, executive director of the Surf Industry Manufacturers Association, a nonprofit trade association. And bodysurfing as a sport tends to be \u201cvery cliquish and hard-core,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cIt\u2019s considered one of the purest forms of surfing.\u201dNew products in the surfing market generally must be perceived as \u201ccool\u201d to succeed. Although they are still a very small part of that market, in the last two years Mr. Smith has noticed increasing interest in bodysurfing handboards. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing them sold in mainstream surf shops now,\u201d he said.The Wattses also wanted to distance Slyde\u2019s products from the aura of exclusivity that often surrounds surfing in order to draw in participants of varying ages and experience levels.They did not set out to appeal to just the \u201cdie-hard surfer with the long beard and the VW bus.\u201d Ms. Watts said Slyde\u2019s handboards gave customers \u201ca surfing experience no matter what skill level or age and the brand behind it makes you feel cool.\u201dThose boards sell within 10 minutes, he said. But it\u2019s the company\u2019s \u201cambassador\u201d program that has been its most effective strategy, Ms. Watts said. This special category of customer combines the idea of a brand ambassador with a loyalty rewards program. Ambassadors are customers so passionate about the company\u2019s handboards \u2014 and so active on social media \u2014 that they gain access to a special Facebook group and a 30 percent discount on boards, which range in price from $119 to $199.The ambassadors, of which there are now about 50, are considered part of the Slyde team, Ms. Watts said. \u201cWe invite them around for brainstorm sessions and they are our first focus group. They post their videos and photos on social media and send them to us too.\u201d Slyde also has an employee dedicated to managing social media and staying connected to customers.Another big break for the company came after its appearance on the television show \u201cShark Tank\u201d in mid-April. There, too, the firm faced skeptical questions about its ability to break into the mainstream surf market.During the episode, the investor Robert Herjavec stressed the difficulties faced by a similar company in which he is invested, called Hamboards. That firm, which makes longboard skateboards and street stand-up paddleboards for \u201clandsurfing,\u201d spent a lot of time trying to get its products into independent surf shops, which is one way to sell to a broader audience while still maintaining a product\u2019s edge.\u201cWe\u2019re going to be old and gray by the time we make any real money doing this,\u201d said Mr. Herjavec, and he cautioned the couple not to go too wide too soon. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to build with the right stores, you\u2019ve got to be authentic,\u201d he said.But as a result of their pitch, the celebrity investor Mark Cuban and the actor Ashton Kutcher invested a combined $200,000, with each taking an 11 percent ownership in return.Mr. Cuban said Slyde could gain exposure through Tower Paddle Boards, the stand-up paddle board company in which he is an investor. \u201cYou\u2019d walk right into a huge customer base,\u201d he told the couple on the episode. Mr. Kutcher, who is also a co-founder of the Los Angeles venture capital firms A-Grade Investments and Sound Ventures, suggested that he could build out a Facebook marketing strategy for their online retailing operations.In 2011, when Slyde\u2019s first board hit the market, revenue was $20,000 and Mr. Watts was hand-shaping each board in Mr. Ellers\u2019s Venice Beach garage.Today, it has two other full time employees, and projects 2016 revenue will be about $1 million, in large part as a result of its success on \u201cShark Tank.\u201d (Without the exposure and investment, Ms. Watts estimated revenue would be closer to $295,000.) The boards are made in a family-run factory in Taiwan and Slyde has moved to San Clemente, Calif. Last year, revenue was $180,000.Mr. Kutcher said in an interview that Slyde was not his typical investment. He tends to focus on consumer software, and some of his previous investments include Skype, Uber, Airbnb and Spotify.But he was impressed that the couple put off their wedding and used the money to build their company instead. \u201cThey put their personal needs aside for the business and that showed me they have an absolute passion and drive for what they are building,\u201d Mr. Kutcher said. \u201cAnd I think at its core, every big company is built by founders that have that kind of passion.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Door to Door,\u2019 by Edward Humes", "Date": "2016-04-22", "News": "Supported byWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.In the 1920s, drivers plowed into oncoming traffic and bicyclists and trees just as they do now, but no one talked about \u00adautomobile accidents. Back then, notes Edward Humes in \u201cDoor to Door: The Magnificent, Maddening, Mysterious World of Transportation,\u201d these events were known as \u201cmotor killings.\u201d And citizens were outraged. They rioted and demanded reforms. They staged \u201cmassive parades\u201d in protest. It was the kind of civil unrest that would come to be associated with social injustice and the Vietnam War.As odd as that may sound to us now, it makes every kind of sense. Annual highway fatalities in the United States outnumber annual combat deaths throughout the Vietnam War (as well as the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and Korea). Cars currently kill 3,000 people every month. Humes compares the carnage to that of four airliners crashing every week \u2014 rarely making headlines or prompting investigations or fines or legal reforms.America fell hard for cars. They were novel and exciting. They conveyed status and independence, and until relatively recently they got us where we wanted to go with minimum hassle and time. Cities fell in line, dispensing with sidewalks and abandoning public transit projects. (Los Angeles freeways were originally planned with rail lines on the meridians.) Even the justice system succumbed to the sway, confining pedestrians to crosswalks and letting drivers who mowed them down get off with fines and community service. The language itself evolved to absolve the reckless driver. The term \u201cjaywalking\u201d was coined for the crime of crossing a street where you felt like it. \u201cMotor killings\u201d became \u201cfatal accidents.\u201dAs Humes makes clear, it is rarely an accident. When drivers go off the road, 89\u202fpercent of the time it is because they\u2019re distracted. (Interestingly, other passengers most often supply the distraction \u00ad\u2014 15 percent of the time versus 12 percent for smartphones. And 8 percent for \u201csinging/moving to music.\u201d) If they\u2019re not distracted, chances are they\u2019re drunk. During 2014, Humes notes, inebriates behind the wheel killed 12,000 people in the United States. Ebola? Two.In the rare instances in which the car itself is to blame, lawsuits, headlines and recalls result. Why, as Humes puts it, has there \u201cnever been a recall aimed at fixing cars so drunks cannot start them, or so drivers cannot exceed the speed limit or to prevent cellphones from being used while cars are in motion,\u201d especially given that the technology to do all of this has long existed? Employing any one element of that technology would, Humes says, prevent 30 deaths and 2,200 injuries every day.Statistics are a powerful ally, and Humes gathers and wields them masterfully. By my count, 73 percent of the pages in this book contain a statistic. They range in severity from the number of pounds Humes has lost by walking his greyhounds (20) to the number of possible routes for a U.P.S. driver with 120 stops (6,\u2009689,\u2009502,\u2009913,\u2009449,\u2009135,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000,\u2009000).\u201cDoor to Door\u201d covers more varied terrain than this review is making it sound. Four chapters focus on our overburdened ports and the huge global shipping lines they answer to. These sections I read with less enthusiasm, partly because for me, no one writing on marine shipping can ever match the heart and lyricism of Rose George\u2019s \u201cNinety Percent of Everything.\u201d Chapters on coffee and aluminum feel meandering \u2014 though perhaps only in comparison with the focus and heat of Humes\u2019s car chapters. Taken as a whole, they are a manifesto for a new order. The future is driverless, and Google and Uber are already deep into it. I thrilled to Humes\u2019s vision of the utopia that awaits us: driverless cars summoned with a smartphone app, the minutes or miles paid for with a simple subscription plan. It\u2019s not only doable, it\u2019s inevitable: efficient, nonlethal door-to-door transportation for all \u2014 including, not insignificantly, people with impaired vision or mobility.Humes takes us for a ride near the Google campus. Alas, the same things that make a driverless car safe also make it dull: It never speeds, never crashes or careens (well, almost never), and it enables its occupants to read or nap. But the excitement level is also to some extent a product of the author\u2019s style and \u00adchoices. Scenes are set but never fully \u00adinhabited. We are there, yet always somehow a few car lengths away. At one point on the Google drive there\u2019s a mention of the \u201cred team,\u201d staffers paid to drive erratically and throw up obstacles in an effort to flummox the vehicle. And I think: Why aren\u2019t we out and about with those guys?And while we\u2019re at it, why no more than a passing mention of package-delivering drones? And can we please have more than one sentence on the elevated wooden bicycle highway meant to connect \u00adPasadena and Los Angeles in the early 20th century? But that\u2019s not fair criticism.

{"Headline": "Dude, Where\u2019s My City?", "Date": "2016-04-01", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 I tend to ignore the usual measurements of what makes a city robust and healthy, the urban bragging points. Along the West Coast, these superlatives roll out with regularity. Seattle, two years ago, was proclaimed the fastest growing city in the United States. San Francisco usually tops the list of most expensive places to live. And Portland, Ore., just posted the highest percentage rise in home prices among major cities.This is great, for realtors and tax collectors. Hooray \u2014 we\u2019re shiny, new and less affordable than most cities of the world! Try the kale smoothie.I look for something else: Could Kramer still live in my city? Yeah, Kramer, the \u201cSeinfeld\u201d character who never held a real job, but had a fairly cool apartment. His source of income was suspect. His schemes were sitcom-absurd. His ambition was, I don\u2019t know, to publish a coffee-table book about coffee tables.Every town needs its Kramers. And in Seattle, where I was born and still live, where my grandmother spent her last days in subsidized housing with a view of Puget Sound, I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re losing ours.Job growth is steroidal. The big urban carnivore is Amazon.com, with its global headquarters now gobbling up enough office space in the formerly funky South Lake Union district to fill almost two skyscrapers the size of the city\u2019s tallest building, the 76-story Columbia Center. Twice that amount is in the pipeline, as Amazon seeks to become the world\u2019s largest retailer. Google just announced grand plans for the same neighborhood. A metro area of 3.5 million is adding 60,000 people a year.Growth, even the metastatic kind, is usually trumpeted with a lot of rah-rah. The opposite \u2014 the sad decline of a Detroit, a Cleveland or a Baltimore \u2014 is much worse. So who wouldn\u2019t want the fresh money and talent flowing into the vibrant urban centers of the West Coast? Well, this city. And Portland. And San Francisco as well.Rising rents threaten to push out the quirky and creative types who make these places eternally young and resilient. You saw the pattern in Brooklyn \u2014 that urban tipping point. An average wage earner living in Brooklyn would somehow have to spend 120 percent of his or her monthly income to make rent.In the Bay Area, there\u2019s a desperate effort to keep the last un-gentrified neighborhoods from being taken over by techies, a quixotic mission. In Portland, where young people go to retire, that Krameresque option is fading. What\u2019s next: homeless hipsters in \u201cPortlandia\u201d? It\u2019s already happening. And here in Seattle, it can seem like Amazon is a large foreign presence growing inside of us \u2014 a transplant that has yet to take.During a laser-vision-clear spring week like we\u2019re having now, a forest of construction cranes blocks views of the snowcapped Olympic Mountains to the west of the clangorous technopolis. The views, at least, used to be free. A downtown neighborhood that once featured a bar with a 6 a.m. happy hour and a refuge for sailors called the Catholic Seamen\u2019s Club is now better known for the gleaming new building that was home to the overcompensated creep in \u201cFifty Shades of Grey.\u201dFor all of that, bald eagles nest in city parks and boys and girls in boats still glide over Lake Washington. On Puget Sound\u2019s shore, a working waterfront remains, with foghorns and a briny grittiness. Nature has not been entirely neutered.Seattle used to want to be like San Francisco, albeit with six months of steady rain. No more. What\u2019s become of San Francisco \u2014 the nation\u2019s most childless city, traffic that is frozen all hours of the day, a surfeit of sketchy and unprosecuted property crimes, and 4,300 people on the street \u2014 is nothing to duplicate. Talented young people are living in tents, garages, vans, even a wooden box, home for someone paying $400 a month for said confinement. Kramer would need a trust fund.I\u2019m not against the brogrammers walking the canyons of the Amazon compound in Seattle. I welcome the newcomers who challenge the civic xenophobia of the natives. I\u2019m proud to share a hometown with a philanthropy attempting to give away more money than any private entity has ever tried to do. Two of the great stories of modern America \u2014 Amazon and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation \u2014 define the Seattle of 2016.But I also wonder if there is any way to slow or mitigate the pace of change, to ensure that the city\u2019s soul is not swept out by the new. How do you contain the excesses of entrepreneurial capitalism and nurture the things you like \u2014 original music, food, businesses and literature, affordable homes for cops and Kramers? Unfettered growth just produces more inequality. So does taxing the middle class to death.A great city has to give space for people to fail, for its Kramers. Other places, much older than the urban adolescents on the West Coast, have grappled with these same problems, with limited success. But that\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s still so invigorating about the West \u2014 the past has never been seen as a barrier to inventing a better future.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cloud Services Show Their Value in Earnings Reports", "Date": "2016-04-29", "News": "Supported byBitsThe star of the show was Amazon Web Services, or AWS, that cloud business. Amazon breaks out that sector from the rest of its business, and it makes for impressive reading: Operating income as a percentage of sales for Amazon\u2019s retail business was 3 percent; for AWS it was 24 percent.AWS is still a relatively small part of the company\u2019s total business, but that outsize profitability is reshaping Amazon. Over all, the company\u2019s operating income is 3.6 percent of revenue, but that is up from 1.1 percent a year ago. A big reason is that AWS has doubled its profitability.Cloud computing makes a lot of money in part by automating things: A large data center, supplying potentially thousands of customers, may be run by just a half-dozen people. The people engineering these systems have become very clever about running them efficiently too, devising special semiconductors and software.Google and Facebook are also cloud-based companies, though for now they get most of their money from advertising.As we near the end of the tech earnings season, it is useful to look at net income earned per employee at the company. Microsoft had profits of about $32,200 per person in the quarter, a healthy performance considering how many employees it still has in older businesses. It came in just ahead of Goldman Sachs, on a profit per employee basis.There are two lessons from that: If you do sell retail products, it helps to sell highly profitable fetish objects, like iPhones \u2014 which, not incidentally, have a lot of value because of the cloud-based apps running on them.And if you are selling bargain retail, it\u2019s a very good idea to be in the cloud computing business, too.Advertisement"}

He has picked up a couple of screenwriting credits, including one for the movie version of Maurice Sendak\u2019s children\u2019s classic \u201cWhere the Wild Things Are,\u201d which he wrote with the director, Spike Jonze, but somehow his own novels seemed to elude the big screen.Now, however, films based on two of his books are about to appear \u2014 \u201cThe Circle,\u201d written and directed by James Ponsoldt, which will open at a date to be determined, and \u201cA Hologram for the King,\u201d written and directed by Tom Tykwer, opening Friday, April 22. As if that weren\u2019t enough good fortune, both of them star Tom Hanks.\u201cWhat can I tell you?\u201d Mr. Eggers said recently from San Francisco, where he lives with his wife and family. \u201cIt feels deeply, deeply surreal.\u201dIt\u2019s about a middle-aged American businessman, Alan Clay \u2014 divorced, broke and partly estranged from his daughter \u2014 who travels to Saudi Arabia in the hope that he can get back on his feet by selling a holographic telecommunication system to King Abdullah. Aside from drinking illegal moonshine and performing amateur surgery on a lump he discovers on the back of his neck, he mostly just waits for a meeting that keeps not happening. The book\u2019s epigraph comes from \u201cWaiting for Godot\u201d \u2014 \u201cIt is not every day that we are needed\u201d \u2014 and both its setting, a literal and metaphorical desert, and black humor also owe something to Beckett.Mr. Tykwer said that the minute he read the novel he knew there was a movie in it, one more upbeat and lighthearted than the book. He is a brainy, genre-tweaking German director best known to Americans for \u201cRun Lola Run\u201d (which, like a video game, restarts the same story over and over) and for collaborating with the Wachowski siblings on \u201cCloud Atlas.\u201d\u201cI am not one of those filmmakers who read everything that\u2019s out there in hopes of making a movie,\u201d he said recently from Germany, speaking on the telephone in English that differs from a native speaker\u2019s only in being about twice as fast. \u201cI love reading for itself and am always trying to protect the act of reading from my own urges to look for projects.\u201dBut in the case of \u201cHologram,\u201d he went on, \u201cit\u2019s one of those mysterious things, which you cannot really explain. I immediately felt I had an instinctive film approach.\u201d\u201cTom is such an earnest, hard-working guy, you just want to trust him,\u201d Mr. Eggers said. \u201cHe saw a movie with more potential for hope and sweetness \u2014 it comes from his very optimistic view of life. I thought that was a valid approach and I wanted him to have some freedom. I always think that the unsuccessful film adaptations are the ones that are too timid and slavish.\u201dFrom the beginning, Mr. Tykwer said, he saw the possibility of more humor than was in the book, because he believes that movies can get away with less bleakness than literature can. \u201cIt\u2019s not because we\u2019re just more superficial in films,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe sometimes we are, but I don\u2019t think you have to be. You just go in a certain way into a more hopeful region of conclusion.\u201dFor Mr. Eggers, it also didn\u2019t hurt when Tom Hanks was mentioned. \u201cThat\u2019s the first and only name we talked about,\u201d he said, \u201cand I kept thinking, what if?\u201dRecently in an email, Mr. Hanks explained that \u201cthe low profile of the movie interested me, first off.\u201dHe added: \u201cBecause Dave writes such stuff, novels that can\u2019t be turned into conventional movies. Put any American in Saudi Arabia in a story about selling technology and, I think, certain beats are expected, beats which Dave doesn\u2019t hit. This makes for an odd movie, set in a world that might as well be a different planet than ours.\u201dMr. Hanks also wanted to work with Mr. Tykwer because, he said: \u201cHe makes films the way others sit around and have passionate conversations over coffee. I wanted to work with him again for the life experience as much as the creation of a film.\u201dMr. Hanks is a director\u2019s dream, Mr. Tykwer said. \u201cHe\u2019s what you imagine him to be to an extent that it\u2019s staggering,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s immensely curious, and he never stops investigating potentials for a scene. He can always give you something else, which is a little dangerous, because you lose all sense of time. Every new take, you get something else on top of the greatness you already had. You get so overstuffed sometimes that you don\u2019t know where to put it anymore.\u201dAs Mr. Tykwer hoped, the mere presence of Mr. Hanks, with his infectious likability, lifts \u201cHologram\u201d into something much closer to comedy. In many ways, Mr. Tykwer\u2019s script is scrupulously faithful to the novel, often repeating scenes line for line, but at the end it dwells more on a romance between Alan Clay and a Saudi doctor (Sarita Choudhury, Saul\u2019s wife on \u201cHomeland\u201d) who cares for his butchered neck lump.\u201cI really embrace the idea that he tried it,\u201d Mr. Tykwer said, talking about Alan\u2019s unlikely affair in a country that forbids such things. \u201cBut what we don\u2019t know, what the movie never says, is does it really work, living like this? The movie ends there for a good reason. I don\u2019t know, either.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Proposal of Woodrow Wilson", "Date": "2016-04-20", "News": "But what if the entire theme of a puzzle is completely outside your wheelhouse?I\u2019ve gone on record as saying that I do not really follow sports, except to watch the occasional game with friends, all the while pretending that I know what is going on. Basically, I cheer when my friends cheer and I shake my head in pretend disgust when it seems like something bad happened. I spend a lot of time offering to refresh people\u2019s drinks.So you can imagine how lost I felt when Tom McCoy and his upstart crossword puzzle asked me to know how many points a GRAND SLAM, a HAT TRICK, a FOUL SHOT and a TOUCHDOWN totaled. That\u2019s four different sports right there. Apparently, the answer is FOURTEEN POINTS, and that is perfectly alright. Now I know. I think. Which means that I had to fight like the dickens \u2014 that\u2019s the technical puzzle-solving term, at least by New York Times standards \u2014 to make any progress in this puzzle. You might feel like this on a regular basis. I get it, really I do. But it\u2019s important to keeping moving forward. It\u2019s important not to give up. There\u2019s a Catch-22 to becoming a good crossword solver: To be a good solver, you have to develop a certain skill set, but to develop that skill set, you have to solve crossword puzzles. So when you\u2019re feeling stuck, move to another section of the grid and solve that. Put the puzzle down and come back to it when you feel like you\u2019re back in the zone. Ask for help from a friend or a loved one. Google an entry or look it up. That\u2019s not cheating. It\u2019s learning, and I\u2019ll bet you won\u2019t need to do it more than once when you encounter something you don\u2019t know. Remember, this is a game. It\u2019s meant to be fun and mentally satisfying. If someone tells you that you\u2019re cheating because you looked something up, tell them that you\u2019re not cheating, you\u2019re learning. If you feel like you \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d solve crosswords because you had difficulty with one day\u2019s puzzle like I did today, remember that there is another one coming up tomorrow that just might be right in your sweet spot.Let\u2019s hear from Mr. McCoy:For most puzzles, one of the most time-consuming components is scouring word databases (both online and mental) to find a symmetric set of theme entries. For this puzzle, though, I got very lucky: The first three scoring terms I thought of were TOUCHDOWN, GRAND SLAM, and HAT TRICK, and it was quick work to look up a one-point play from basketball, which immediately gave me a set of four themers that added to 14 and that spanned (what I think are) the most widely watched sports in the United States.Thank you for teaching me something new, Mr. McCoy.

{"Headline": "Panama Papers Tie More of China\u2019s Elite to Secret Accounts", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 At least three of the seven people on the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s most powerful committee, including President Xi Jinping, have relatives who have controlled secretive offshore companies, the organization that has publicized a trove of leaked documents about hidden wealth reported on Wednesday.The information made public by the consortium on Wednesday included material on the Communist Party Politburo Standing Committee, the seven-member group, all men, that wields ultimate power in the country.The daughter-in-law of Liu Yunshan, China\u2019s propaganda chief, was once a shareholder and director of a company registered in the British Virgin Islands, and the son-in-law of Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli was a shareholder in three companies domiciled in the British tax haven, the consortium reported.President Xi is the third member of the Politburo committee cited in the report as having a relative who controlled offshore companies. The ties of Mr. Xi\u2019s brother-in-law, Deng Jiagui, to offshore companies have been known since 2012, when a Bloomberg News article about Mr. Xi\u2019s family wealth detailed the business empire of Mr. Deng and his wife, Qi Qiaoqiao, the president\u2019s sister.The consortium\u2019s review of the leaked documents found that Mr. Deng had acquired three additional offshore companies, well before Mr. Xi became China\u2019s top leader and made a crackdown on corruption one of the centerpieces of his leadership.The disclosures provide further insight into how China\u2019s political elite has tapped into the global network of lawyers and wealth managers who, for a fee, can set up complex corporate structures that often have the effect of cloaking vast personal wealth.Many of China\u2019s most powerful families set up offshore companies during the administration of Hu Jintao, who preceded Mr. Xi as president and as leader of the Communist Party. Family members or close business associates of at least five of the nine men who served on the Politburo Standing Committee from 2007 through 2012 had links to offshore accounts, according to records reviewed by The New York Times.It was during that period that Jia Liqing, the wife of Mr. Liu\u2019s son, Liu Lefei, appears to have become the director and a shareholder of Ultra Time Investments, a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands in 2009, according to the consortium's report. It is not clear what Ultra Time was used for, if anything. A Google search for the company\u2019s name on Wednesday turned up only one result, a list of offshore \u201cshelf companies\u201d stating that Ultra Time had been incorporated on April 20, 2009.Ms. Jia and her husband represent two of the most potent arms of the Chinese Communist Party. She is the daughter of China\u2019s former minister of public security and chief prosecutor, Jia Chunwang, according to two people who have met the couple and who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to preserve those relationships. Liu Lefei\u2019s father oversees the country\u2019s propaganda apparatus.A woman who answered a Chinese cellphone number listed for Ms. Jia on the alumni website of Yale University, where she obtained an M.B.A., hung up after the caller identified himself as a New York Times reporter.The consortium of journalists also reported that Lee Shing Put, a son-in-law of Mr. Zhang, the seventh-ranking person on the Politburo Standing Committee, was a shareholder in Zennon Capital Management, registered in the British Virgin Islands, and two other companies, Sino Reliance Networks and Glory Top Investments.Zennon Capital Management is the owner of a Hong Kong company that has the same name as an entity of which Mr. Lee is a director, according to Hong Kong\u2019s company registry. No information could be found on Sino Reliance Networks and Glory Top Investments, although a Hong Kong-registered company also is named Glory Top Investments.The website of the Washington-based Brookings Institution, which tracks China\u2019s top leaders, says Mr. Lee is a son of the founding chairman of Xinyi Glass Holdings, which is listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.Lee Shing Put did not respond to an email request for an interview made through Xinyi\u2019s public relations company.Mr. Deng, Mr. Xi\u2019s brother-in-law, did not reply to faxed questions about his offshore holdings sent to the family\u2019s office in Shenzhen, in southern China.An article on April 7 about revelations that at least three of the seven people on the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s most powerful committee have relatives who have controlled secretive offshore companies gave an outdated title for Liu Lefei, whose wife was once a shareholder and director of a company registered in the British Virgin Islands, and whose father, Liu Yunshan, is a member of the committee. Although the younger Mr. Liu heads one of China\u2019s leading private equity firms, he is no longer a vice chairman of Citic Securities.videoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Struggle in Wisconsin Is About Demographics, Not Momentum", "Date": "2016-04-04", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 RaceAnd the polls show him trailing by a wide margin in Wisconsin, which holds its primary on Tuesday. For some people, it\u2019s a sign that Mr. Trump is finally losing ground.But his problem in Wisconsin is mainly about the state\u2019s demographics, not self-inflicted wounds. Even a 10-percentage-point loss there wouldn\u2019t necessarily indicate any shift against him.The state has always looked as if it would be one of Mr. Trump\u2019s worst. This was true even before the primaries began. Polling by Civis Analytics and Marquette Law both showed Mr. Trump faring much worse there than nationally, just as was the case in neighboring Iowa, where he wound up losing to Ted Cruz.The results of other primaries have consistently pointed toward Mr. Trump\u2019s weakness in Wisconsin. We\u2019ve frequently published articles using models to predict the results of contests based on demographics, and both models \u2014 one after the Super Tuesday primaries and one after the March 15 primaries \u2014 projected Wisconsin to be one of Mr. Trump\u2019s worst remaining states.Our estimate remains virtually unchanged from what it was after the Arizona and Utah contests March 22: a five-point edge in Wisconsin for Mr. Cruz, almost exactly aligned with the polls. The model does not account for the possible redistribution of Marco Rubio\u2019s former support.Why is Wisconsin such a problematic state for Mr. Trump? It\u2019s not the worst possible state for him (Utah was), but it does force him to confront some major weaknesses.Wisconsin is average or above average in basically every educational category. It\u2019s also unusual because many of its most strongly Republican areas are well-educated suburbs, so more of the Republican vote will be cast in well-educated areas than in, say, California.You might not think of Wisconsin as an especially religious state. But it\u2019s a bit above average for religious adherence across all categories: the total religious rate, evangelicals and Catholics. The net effect is slightly negative for Mr. Trump.He fares worst in areas with strong traditional families, especially ones with more children, more married couples and fewer single mothers. The state also has an above-average number of married couples \u2014 and most of the state\u2019s most Republican districts are in the top quartile for marriage rates.As with education, Wisconsin isn\u2019t at the top of the list for these characteristics. But there aren\u2019t many states that are consistently average to above average in education, religion and marriage rates. Often, they cut in the opposite directions: The most religious states aren\u2019t usually highly educated, and many have lower marriage rates. Where these factors do converge, though, Mr. Trump struggles, as he did in Utah, Kansas and Iowa.Iowa, Utah, Kansas \u2014 and Wisconsin \u2014 have something else in common: a large population who report their ancestry from predominantly Protestant countries in Northern Europe.These voters represented the base of the Republican Party for the century after the Civil War, whether it\u2019s the old-stock \u201cYankees\u201d who spread west from New England, or the German, Scandinavian and Dutch immigrants who generally settled over the same stretch of the northern part of the United States later in the 19th century.These voters are probably the biggest problem for Mr. Trump that you haven\u2019t heard of: He would fare about 30 points worse in counties where all of the white residents reported their ancestry from Protestant countries in Northern Europe than he would in a place where none did, according to our model. It\u2019s the type of thing that helps separate Northern Virginia \u2014 where Mr. Trump struggled greatly \u2014 from the Boston area, where he excelled.Exactly why this is so important is a little speculative.\u25a0 They\u2019re the \u201cold Republicans\u201d \u2014 the former base of the party. Perhaps they\u2019re likelier to be offended by Mr. Trump\u2019s breaking with traditional Republican ideology. Mr. Trump fares best among new Republicans \u2014 including white Southerners and white Catholics \u2014 who might have less consistently conservative views.Now, that might just be a coincidence \u2014 there aren\u2019t very many minorities in these same regions, since the same economic forces that drew working-class Catholics to manufacturing jobs in the industrial North also drew African-Americans from the South. Or it might represent a deeper cultural tradition: It was the old-stock Yankees who led the fight for abolition; a century later it was roughly the same area that swung against the fiery conservative Barry Goldwater when he fought and won the nomination against more moderate and liberal Republicans.They\u2019re also the same areas where Barack Obama defeated Hillary Clinton among white voters in the 2008 Democratic primary.All considered, the model-based estimates make Mr. Trump a five-point underdog, with a 40-35 edge for Mr. Cruz.Mr. Cruz could certainly outperform this number because the model doesn\u2019t allocate any of the vote for Mr. Rubio (estimated around 8 percent on March 15), who has suspended his campaign. If the Rubio vote were split evenly between Mr. Cruz and John Kasich, which is about what happened in Utah, then Mr. Cruz might win, 44-35, over Mr. Trump.To get a sense of whether Mr. Trump really lost ground after his controversial remarks, the key number to watch is 35 percent: the expected share of the vote for Mr. Trump based on the results so far. If he falls short, he has lost ground because of momentum, not demographics.Advertisement"}

To sum up the life of Bill Campbell, who died peacefully in his sleep this week with his family by his side, is a daunting and fundamentally impossible task - Bill&aposs life and accomplishments were so vast and varied that even those\n                                        who knew him best were only lucky enough to have witnessed a portion of them. Tributes to his astonishing legacy in Silicon Valley have already been pouring in, and rightly so. It is a legacy that is difficult to\n                                        fathom. He had a hand in almost every consequential technology company of the past 30 years, either through direct relationship or through his coaching and mentoring of the company&aposs key players, (and, in the\n                                        case of Intuit, Claris, and Go, through his own tenure as CEO). From Apple to Google to Amazon to Twitter, from his mentorship of the iconic venture capitalists who helped shape the Valley to his under-the-radar\n                                        involvement with legions of nerdy and unsexy companies barely known outside the tech community, but whose presences and innovations changed the technology landscape - Bill was always there, all smiles and hugs,\n                                        his essence embedded in the company&aposs DNA, pushing everyone involved to be better managers, more creative, and, most importantly, better people, to be the most authentic and truest versions of themselves. He\n                                        is probably best known for being \"the Coach,\" a mentor to legends; as the legends themselves would be the first to tell you, he was so much more than the sum of those he advised. He was himself a legend.\n                                        He was the legend. Bill was a man of beautiful and almost impossible contrasts. He was profane in a way that was unacceptable in many barrooms, let alone in church, and a devout Catholic who rarely missed Sunday\n                                        Mass. A workaholic who pushed himself and those around him beyond their natural and professional limits, and a devoted husband and quite possibly the best father in history, who never, no matter what momentous occasion\n                                        was on his schedule, missed an important event in his kids&apos lives. Famously honest and blunt (and sometimes even harsh), he would never hesitate to let you know when you were \"messing up\"; but when\n                                        you were messing up, he&aposd be the guy who&aposd answer your call at all hours of the night and, with inspiring patience and empathy, talk you through whatever mistakes you had made and how you were supposed\n                                        to rectify them. He preached teamwork and compassion and love. In many ways he seemed a throwback to a different era, a manly man, a jock&aposs jock, gruff, aggressive, macho, old-fashioned, and yet he was comfortable\n                                        and even thrived around dorks, dweebs, outcasts of all types- a \"nerd whisperer,\" as one journalist put it. His identity as \"the Coach\" was derived from both his general football-coaching demeanor\n                                        and his time as an actual football coach, with all the good and bad that that particular stereotype entails; he was a passionate advocate for the advancement of women in Silicon Valley and for the LGBT community.\n                                        He was never happier than at the annual 8th grade graduation at Sacred Heart Schools in Atherton, CA, when, year after year, a stream of students, boys and girls alike, would offer remembrances and speak movingly\n                                        of by far their most meaningful experience at the school: getting the chance to play flag football for Coach Campbell, absorbing the lessons he taught them, lessons that were, perhaps not surprisingly, essentially\n                                        identical to the lessons Coach had imparted to those he&aposd coached in the adult world. Teamwork. Structure. Integrity. Accountability. Passion. Hard work. Empathy. Love. Traits he&aposd learned growing up in\n                                        Homestead, PA, where he would end up donating millions of dollars to education and youth projects. A final common refrain about Bill: Everyone who knew Bill thought of him as their best friend. Bill was a people\n                                        person. He oozed charisma. When he talked to you he made you feel like you were the only person that mattered. It might be tempting for those who didn&apost know Bill that well to conclude that all this was just\n                                        some act. How could one person be so overflowing with joy, with the amount of joy and love requisite for connection with such a staggering number of people on such a profound level - Obviously it had to be an act.\n                                        It wasn&apost. He really did love people the way they loved him. New friends were made wherever he went. Often they were baristas, waiters, and, let&aposs face it, bartenders, people who didn&apost know initially\n                                        who he was and in some cases never would. He had friends in high and low places and everywhere in between. It was infectious. He was a uniter, he imparted his worldview onto his friends and mixed his groups of friends\n                                        together, so that friends in California became close with friends from Homestead and New York and elsewhere; wealthy friends grew to love friends who were less well off and vice versa; tech friends, academic friends,\n                                        and football friends were molded into one great big Bill Campbell group. Bill Campbell never saw wealth or social status or anything artificial when judging the merits of people. He sought in others the same qualities\n                                        he himself so fully embodied. Bill&aposs friends, and there were many, by definition embodied his values; he wouldn&apost have been friends with them if they hadn&apost. Bill Campbell really did believe that\n                                        everyone who lived by his values, friend or not, was fundamentally the same, of equal goodness, of equal worth. On this last point, sadly, he was somewhat mistaken. Indeed when you get down to it most people are\n                                        essentially the same, most of their differences are artificial. But Bill Campbell was better than everyone. And all of his friends are infinitely better off for having known him. William Vincent Campbell Jr., who\n                                        was born August 31, 1940 in Homestead, PA and who died April 18, 2016 in Palo Alto, CA, is survived by his wife Eileen Bocci Campbell, his two children Jim and Maggie, and his three step children Kevin, Matthew,\n                                        and Kate Bocci. A Funeral Mass will be held Monday, April 25th at Sacred Heart Preparatory in Atherton, CA at 11am. In lieu of flowers, the family, per Bill&aposs wishes, requests that donations be made to the\n                                        American Cancer Society, or, for the benefit of the community of Homestead, PA, to the Campbell Education and Community Foundation.

{"Headline": "The Battle Over the Sea-Monkey Fortune", "Date": "2016-04-15", "News": "FeatureA former 1960s bondage-film actress is waging legal combat with a toy company for ownership of her husband\u2019s mail-order aquatic-pet empire.Supported byIn his tiny office in Sayville, on Long Island, Timmons spoke in clipped, near-noir tones, handing me a five-page summary of the case, eager to executive-produce the plotline. \u201cThe heart and soul of this case is trademark infringement,\u201d he said. Signorelli von Braunhut \u201cbelieves in the concept of justice,\u201d he continued, \u201cand when you have that on your side, then you can get through the day.\u201dA few years after her husband\u2019s death in 2003, Signorelli von Braunhut licensed out part of the labor of his multimillion dollar Sea-Monkey enterprise, mostly packaging and distribution, to Big Time. If you\u2019ve ever been 8 years old, then you know that Sea-Monkeys arrive in a small plastic aquarium with several small packets that include the tiny brine-shrimp critters, which reanimate once you add water \u2014 by way of a secret formula that Signorelli von Braunhut keeps locked in a vault in Manhattan.The original deal held that Big Time would supply everything except the specially engineered critters \u2014 and the accompanying packets, which von Braunhut would manufacture and sell separately to Big Time, which would then bundle the full kits and handle the sales. Also in the contract was a second deal \u2014 to buy the company, including the secret formula. It allowed Big Time to pay a straight-up $5 million fee and then $5 million more in installments. Three winters ago, Big Time called up the widow and announced that it considered its previous payments for the packets to be a kind of layaway deal for the company and that, as far as Big Time was concerned, it now owned the Sea-Monkey franchise.Signorelli von Braunhut first sued in 2013, and last year Timmons filed a further complaint accusing Big Time of breach of contract and trademark infringement. Big Time\u2019s national law firm, Epstein Becker & Green, sent me a statement denying any wrongdoing and claiming instead that the widow improperly terminated the contract. In a particularly contemporary twist to the melodrama, Big Time\u2019s court filings revealed that it was now buying knockoff Sea-Monkeys from China.\u201cThis is a David and Goliath story,\u201d Timmons said, only \u201cwithout a slingshot.\u201d Timmons shrugged as if to invite me to look around. His office is, to be generous, snug. There was barely enough room for me. It was surprising that the door doesn\u2019t bang his desk as in that Alan Cumming gag from this season\u2019s \u201cThe Good Wife.\u201d Timmons is a tall, thin man with some Nicolas Cage-iness to him. At times he seemed uninterested, not so much in Sea-Monkeys but maybe in the law in general, or just in the wanton quotidian reality into which we are all born.Our conversation easily swerved off topic and into, say, a debate about Bill Maher\u2019s atheism, or about how \u201cwe are all individuals at the tail end of a universe expressing itself,\u201d or Timmons\u2019s rock band, which plays in the local bars under changing names like Rainbow Bridge and Dreamworld. He likes \u201crenaissance\u201d rock. \u201cIt\u2019s a convergence \u2014 Lennonesque with Hendrix overtones and some Dylan, maybe \u2018dinosauric\u2019 at this point,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s altruistic, seeking the higher ground instead of just lamenting upon the human condition.\u201dTimmons represents Yolanda Signorelli von Braunhut because years ago he used to go to this legendary Halloween party hosted by a larger-than-life opera singer known as Maestro Signorelli, a Bohemian possessed of \u201cthis gravitational-like field of energy.\u201d The grand patriarch of a bustling family, Signorelli taught bel canto to locals determined to improve their coloratura. His annual Halloween masked ball attracted hundreds of \u201cmusicians, dancers and artists,\u201d all of whom came in their most flamboyant costumes. Some attended, if only to meet one of his five beautiful daughters.The second-youngest, Yolanda, was particularly stunning and began a film career in the mid-1960s. She played Lorilie in the 1967 bondage classic \u201cVenus in Furs\u201d \u2014 based on the Leopold von Sacher-Masoch novel of that name, as well as various minxes in \u201cAll Women Are Bad,\u201d \u201cToo Much Too Often!\u201d \u201cDeath of a Nymphette\u201d and \u201cAssignment: Female.\u201d I watched three of them, for research, and was struck mostly by how these films appeared long before the phrase \u201cmoney shot\u201d entered the lexicon and the director\u2019s mandatory scene list. When I finally screwed up the courage to ask Signorelli von Braunhut about her previous career, she casually said: \u201cIn those days, they might have been racy, but today? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Which is true. If anything, her brief movie career looks presciently campy \u2014 less like porn than like a Mike Myers parody titled, \u201cCool It Baby\u201d (which is also the title of a 1967 Signorelli von Braunhut film).On paper, including the legal summary Timmons gave me, the issues of Yolanda von Braunhut v. Big Time Toys might be technical \u2014 breach of contract, sure \u2014 until you find yourself reading affidavits that suggest this could be one of those unusual contests, not of law but of meaning \u2014 maybe not the tail end of a universe expressing itself, but definitely one that leads into that lively place between ordinary truth and hopeful dreams and all the way to the essential contradiction at the core of the American character.Over a salad, she said she was eager for me to understand the inventive genius of her husband, Harold. Beginning in the 1950s and \u201960s, he took out patents on 196 different inventions, gadgets and toys. That whole last page of zany novelties found in comic books for years was the domain of Harold von Braunhut. He also raced motorcycles under the name the Green Hornet. He was a sometime television producer and the agent for one of those guys who high-dived into a wading pool with 12 inches of water. He was a magician who worked under the name the Great Telepo. She said he also invented the Direct-a-Mat \u2014 a device into which you punched your destination in New York City, and the machine told you the fastest subway route \u2014 half a century before Google Maps.Sea-Monkeys were von Braunhut\u2019s most lucrative toy (and still are: In 2006, according to the filings in this lawsuit, sales were $3.4 million). Part of what made Sea-Monkeys successful was a scientific breakthrough Harold von Braunhut claimed he achieved in the early years. In 1960, after observing the success of Uncle Milton\u2019s Ant Farm, von Braunhut first started shipping Instant Life \u2014 simple brine shrimp that could travel in their natural state of suspended animation. This was the era when a good idea with smart marketing was the dream: D.F. Duncan\u2019s yo-yo, George Parker\u2019s Monopoly game, Ruth Handler\u2019s Barbie. Around the same time, the big-time toy company of the day, Wham-O, started selling a similar product called Instant Fish, which was an immediate dud.\u201cThey didn\u2019t work because the formula wasn\u2019t thought through properly,\u201d Signorelli von Braunhut said. Wham-O\u2019s product was actually African killifish, which were supposed to come back to life when rehydrated. But they didn\u2019t. \u201cSo it really hurt sales for Harold, too.\u201dWham-O\u2019s 1960 failure led von Braunhut to reintroduce his creation with new science and a new concept. He worked with a marine biologist named Anthony D\u2019Agostino, and using a process he flamboyantly called superhomeogenation, they created a hybrid brine shrimp that could more easily survive the United States Postal Service and be more likely to flourish after reanimation. They worked with the brine-shrimp species artemia salina, and because they made their breakthrough at Montauk\u2019s NYOSL, the New York Ocean Science Laboratory; they called their new hybrid artemia \u201cnyos.\u201d (I contacted D\u2019Agostino at his home, but his wife said he was seriously ill and couldn\u2019t come to the phone.)According to Richard Pell, who maintains an aquarium of Sea-Monkeys at the Center for PostNatural History in Pittsburgh (alongside displays about spider-silk-producing goats and other attractions), \u201cThey were selectively bred in the early \u201970s so that they would have this extra long dormant cycle in their egg state, and they were able to increase that yield so that you get that satisfying swarm.\u201d Pell admits he\u2019s worried these days. \u201cThe new ones come from China,\u201d he said, \u201cand they are technically not Sea-Monkeys because they don\u2019t come from that original culture developed by Harold and Dr. D\u2019Agostino.\u201dOver coffee, Signorelli von Braunhut talked about this formula for altering the shrimp as one of her husband\u2019s greatest scientific breakthroughs, his greatest invention. Timmons himself jumped in to add that Harold\u2019s genius was with \u201cthe science to get them to live for a prolonged period of time.\u201d She agreed and said, \u201cYes, he went through tremendous efforts to make sure that they \u2014 should I elaborate on that?\u201d and then Timmons said, abruptly, no. Whenever the science came up, in fact, Timmons shooed me away.While Dunninger has been largely forgotten, the couple\u2019s fortuitous meeting on his set came at a crucial juncture in the development of American magic and marketing. Dunninger served as a bridge that led away from live performance \u2014 dating to old-school vaudevillian stagecraft \u2014 and toward the small stage of television, where magic was more patter than prestidigitation, more pizazz than performance. Harold von Braunhut was the perfect person to attend to this shift, as he was, in a sense, a kind of marketing Jedi master.Remember Amazing Hair-Raising Monsters (a bald troll printed on a card that grew green mineral locks when watered)? That was von Braunhut\u2019s, and although his novelty toys were, once they arrived, a bit disappointing, the marketing of them was a wonder of what we\u2019d all come to know as informercialism. His Crazy Crabs were nothing more than hermit crabs in a little cardboard box, but the ad copy described another world: \u201cAs gentle as a pussycat, it lives on LAND instead of water, DOES NOT BITE unless mishandled.\u201d And: \u201cIt loves to be touched and petted, and enjoys running from hand to hand, swinging from your fingers or just cuddling on your shoulder like an adorable tame parrot.\u201dWith Sea-Monkeys, von Braunhut took his marketing to new levels. He spun off numerous whimsical books with all kinds of imaginary advice for caring for the tiny critters. You could coddle them with Sea-Monkeys \u201cBanana Treat\u201d or \u201cCupids Arrow\u201d Mating Powder. (Inside joke for the arthropodologists: Sea-Monkeys don\u2019t always need mates.) There were timely variations of the toy. There was a Space Sea-Monkey kit, and a Sea-Monkey Speedway that deployed giant eyedroppers to create racecourses. The same equipment was repurposed into kits for Sea-Monkeys Ski-Trials, Sea-Monkeys Fox Hunt and Sea-Monkeys Mystery Robo-Diver. In 1992, CBS broadcast a Sea-Monkey TV show starring, naturally, Howie Mandel. To this day, there is a website for Sea-Monkey zealots, who exchange Sea-Monkey lore and kitschy enthusiasms.The gate leading to Signorelli von Braunhut\u2019s home in Maryland is festooned with wrought-iron Sea-Monkeys.What made Braunhut\u2019s work so edgy, so American, was just how wickedly far he\u2019d journey \u2014 far past the product itself \u2014 into the fictional. I remember X-Ray Spex (also von Braunhut\u2019s), with that promise of seeing girls naked beneath their clothes, as my first shattering disillusionment with the world of adults and all their horrible lies. Signorelli von Braunhut told me that Harold\u2019s purest novelty was his Invisible Goldfish. \u201cIt was a glass bowl with some sea plants,\u201d she said, \u201cand a sign that said, \u2018Invisible Goldfish: Do Not Feed.\u2019\u2009\u201d The kit came with a printed guarantee that you\u2019d never see them.Not everyone appreciated the joke. In the 1970s, at the height of a nationwide focus on consumer protection, New York\u2019s attorney general, Louis Lefkowitz, went after von Braunhut. \u201cThe suit against Harold by Louie Lefkowitz,\u201d Signorelli von Braunhut said, \u201cargued that Sea-Monkeys were fraudulent, because it\u2019s a fantasy.\u201dA federal judge who reviewed Lefkowitz\u2019s case was amused by the attorney general\u2019s intense concern. According to the judge, Lefkowitz argued that the novelty\u2019s marketing included von Braunhut\u2019s claim that \u201cSea-Monkeys are covered by \u2018Limited Group Sea-Monkey Life Insurance Policy.\u2019\u2009\u201d Lefkowitz demanded that von Braunhut cease \u201cthe usage of the name \u2018Sea-Monkeys\u2019 in the sale of brine shrimp\u201d because they \u201cwere not miniature monkeys, and are not a miracle or anything new scientifically.\u201d Finally, Lefkowitz beseeched the courts to \u201cenjoin the issuance of insurance policies covering \u2018Sea-Monkeys.\u2019\u2009\u201dIn the legal record, it\u2019s not clear that Lefkowitz got any further than this legalistic tantrum, but Signorelli von Braunhut remembers a judge\u2019s coming down on the side of whimsy. \u201cSea-Monkeys were vindicated,\u201d she said. The judge compared the issue to \u201csponge cake \u2014 it\u2019s not a sponge; and butterflies are not made of butter.\u201dBut apparently, this fundamental question about Sea-Monkeys was not settled. In the scores of files that have already been entered into court for the current litigation, one is an affidavit by Sam Harwell, the chief executive of Big Time Toys. He is a very powerful man in Nashville, not only because he owns a big-time toy company but also because his wife, Beth Harwell, is the speaker of the Tennessee House of Representatives. Harwell declined to return my phone calls, but Big Time has continued to sell Sea-Monkeys, to Walmart and Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, even after Yolanda claimed a breach of contract and quit sending out the specially formulated shrimp.In this affidavit, Harwell explains precisely why he outsourced his Sea-Monkeys to China. He declares that there are seven recognized species of artemia brine shrimp and that artemia nyos \u201cclaimed by plaintiffs is not one of them,\u201d because it is a hybrid. Regular old, salt-lake brine shrimp \u2014 at least in terms of their size and life expectancy \u2014 \u201care indistinguishable from the pouches supplied by plaintiffs.\u201dIn essence, Harwell is making a kind of existential case about the fundamentals of American marketing, and a familiar one. He\u2019s practically picking up where Lefkowitz left off by arguing that there is no there there, Sea-Monkey-wise. It\u2019s all part of the confidence game. Part of the sham. It\u2019s humbug. And if the issues in Harwell\u2019s affidavit go forward, then that is what may be on trial. Humbug.Humbug is as American as Ritz-Cracker apple pie. Which is why Sea-Monkeys are involved in a lawsuit now and why Barnum got tangled up in one in his time, litigating the nature of humbug. The case involved one of the biggest tourist attractions after the Civil War: the 1869 discovery of the Cardiff Giant in a little town of that name near Syracuse. Just as nowadays, there was an argument between rationalists and people of faith about the science of the Bible, in this case, whether the giants described in the Scriptures were real. (People forget that the reason God flooded the entire earth during the time of Noah is that angels and humans kept having lots of illicit sex and inadvertently created a race of deranged giants.)At the time, \u201cfossil\u201d had become one of the buzzwords in the popular battle between Darwinian scientists and angry pastors. So a cigar maker named George Hull thought it would be entertaining to fabricate a fossil of one of Noah\u2019s giants. He had a 10-foot man secretly sculpted, treated it to look old and then buried it in rural New York State, where he contrived to have it found. Instantly, massive crowds of astounded Christians started pouring into town, eager to see biblical proof in the petrified man with the 21-inch-long feet and the six-inch nose and all the other proportionate appendages. Hull made lots of money charging 50 cents a viewing. But as his wealth grew, he became nervous that the hoax would blow up. So he sold the Cardiff Giant to a consortium of businessmen, headed by a man named David Hannum.P.T. Barnum instantly offered the consortium $50,000 to buy the Cardiff Giant, no doubt convinced that humbug of this magnitude really deserved his marketing skills. Hannum declined, but he clearly did not appreciate just whom he was up against. Barnum had his own copy carved and rushed his giant to New York City. At one point the fake giant and the knockoff fake giant were being exhibited two blocks from each other. Barnum\u2019s marketing drew much larger crowds. And even as Hull, the original forger, publicly confessed that the original Giant was a fake, Hannum took Barnum to court. The judge, of course, ruled in favor of Barnum \u2014 you can\u2019t be sued for calling a fake a fake. Humbug won, and the Giants toured for years afterward. Before the judge\u2019s 1870 ruling, Hannum still believed in his giant\u2019s authenticity and fumed about the popularity of Barnum\u2019s, saying, \u201cThere\u2019s a sucker born every minute.\u201d Many mistakenly ascribe the remark to P.T. Barnum himself. And it\u2019s understandable. The quote has a way of making complete sense, no matter which side you\u2019re on.Inside, Yolanda Signorelli von Braunhut greeted me warmly. She invited me into her kitchen, where a propane heater was at work, a Coleman cooler held her comestibles and a camping stove heated us up some tea. A large yellow bird in the kitchen hopped around, upset. \u201cThat\u2019s Josephine, a cockatoo who flew into my window in New York in 1981,\u201d she said as she fixed vegan snacks and recommended some antioxidizing super plant protein called Wild Force Green Formula. \u201cIt helps you de-age,\u201d she said.Through a hallway crowded with scores of smiling angel dolls and various cherubim, we parted a few warming curtains to the living room and entered a cabinet of wonders. Whimsies abounded \u2014 on the table beside me, a Snow White lamp, a Bambi figurine, Sea-Monkey bobble heads. On the wall there was a painting of her mother, whose all-American beauty seems familiar. \u201cI met the artist for Superman,\u201d Signorelli von Braunhut said. \u201cHe had a few Lois Lane models, and she was one of them.\u201d Signorelli von Braunhut was dressed in tight jeans with a d\u00e9colletage Guess top. Josephine perched on her shoulder for the duration of my visit, occasionally striking Angry Bird poses and voicing some shrewd concern at my queries.Signorelli von Braunhut elaborated about what happened after the Wham-O Instant Fish disaster. That was when her husband changed the name from Instant Life and started marketing them as Amazing Live Sea-Monkeys. Joe Orlando, who would later achieve fame at DC Comics and Mad Magazine, illustrated the cover art. The image itself is famous. You know it: a Sea-Monkey family with three antennas wagging on their heads and long paddle tails lounging outside their underwater castle. Von Braunhut took his new marketing to the back page of comics \u2014 the one place where he could bypass parental skepticism and speak directly to children\u2019s imaginations.His campaign was a textbook case of what we now call \u201ccognitive priming.\u201d That is, the deep cerebral desire we all have to see what we expect to see. So when you buy a Sea-Monkey kit, you get the tiny plastic aquarium and fitted into the sides are little magnifying lenses that enhance the tiny brine shrimp just enough, setting off a little motion picture in your head of itty-bitty primates swinging to and fro by their curved tails, gamboling in a watery jungle. The real innovation may never have been the secret formula of his brine shrimp but the cognitive ignition of those four perfect words of distilled humbuggery: Amazing Live Sea-Monkeys.That alone might well have been enough to loft Harold von Braunhut into the pantheon of toy inventors, alongside Uncle Milton Levine, D.F. Duncan and George Parker. Except for one almost unimaginable and horrible thing. Harold von Braunhut was a neo-Nazi. Moreover, a Jewish neo-Nazi. He was born Harold Nathan Braunhut, to Jewish parents. He inserted the \u201cvon\u201d to sound more Germanic.Von Braunhut even indulged his dark side with one particular invention \u2014 the Kiyoga, a retractable baton for beat-downs also known as the Steel Cobra. When Richard Butler, the head of Aryan Nations, was indicted in the late \u201980s, he encouraged his supporters to buy Kiyogas because the \u201cmanufacturer had made a pledge of $25 to my defense fund for each one sold to Aryan Nations supporters.\u201d After an Anti-Defamation League report emerged, von Braunhut refused to answer any more questions and was known to simply slam down the phone when any reporter called him.His background is the source of great remorse on marketing chat boards, where writers are distraught that someone as visionary as the X-Ray Spex and Sea-Monkey guy could be such a racist head case. \u201cI came close to writing a biography,\u201d wrote a contributor known as Kierkegaard, but found it would be too \u201cdifficult to write a sympathetic account due to his political views.\u201d Apparently there are some realities that marketing can\u2019t obscure.Signorelli von Braunhut grew quiet, even sad, when I brought up this subject. There are calculated silences at the heart of any marriage, and this was definitely one. \u201cHarold and I never really talked about things like that,\u201d she told me. \u201cWe just really loved each other, and I didn\u2019t question him or interrogate him.\u201d She said, \u201cI am very inclusive with everybody\u201d and \u201cthat\u2019s why I live on a farm with all kinds of animals and try to impact the earth in the least possible way and try to live a peaceful, happy, loving life.\u201dShe handed me an old-school Sea-Monkey kit on the way out the door. On the drive home, I stopped by Walmart and found the Big Time version. The container makes no mystery of the fact that this is a product of China. So I conducted an experiment \u2014 setting up both kits at precisely the same time and with the same water. Von Braunhut\u2019s kit had extra packets to keep the water stable. Big Time\u2019s kit seemed very stripped down. On the day that the shrimp reanimated, there was really no comparison. Von Braunhut\u2019s produced hundreds of Sea-Monkeys, which \u2014 I have to say \u2014 are still irritatingly tiny after all these years. Big Time\u2019s tank was very quiet by comparison, requiring a lot of squinting and really good light for the embedded magnifiers to offer a fleeting glance of one or two drifting by.It also felt odd that, for a company that broke with von Braunhut years ago, Big Time enclosed literature that still offered such Haroldian extras as \u201cSea Medic\u201d Sea-Monkey Medicine, \u201cCupids Arrow\u201d Mating Powder and the Sea-Monkey \u201cAqua-Leash.\u201d Despite Big Time\u2019s court claims of buying plain old brine shrimp from China, the enclosure boasts that \u201cafter years of crossbreeding, we developed a hybrid,\u201d and \u201cThese amazing new hybrids grow larger and live longer than any \u2018natural\u2019 variety of brine shrimp.\u201d (Big Time had no comment when asked about its use of natural or hybrid artemia, and dismissed my test as \u201cnot reliable.\u201d)The last item on Big Time\u2019s pamphlet was especially surprising. In small print, it urged its new Sea-Monkey owners to earn a DLD degree (Doctor of Denizens of the Deep) by writing directly to the Crustacean College of Sea-Monkey Knowledge. It then lists the Maryland address of the Sea-Monkey estate where Yolanda Signorelli von Braunhut lives in her quilt-lined room and answers Sea-Monkey mail by firelight.Jack Hitt is an occasional contributor to the magazine and to \u201cThis American Life\u201d on public radio.

{"Headline": "San Francisco Approves Fully Paid Parental Leave", "Date": "2016-04-05", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 San Francisco on Tuesday became the first city in the United States to approve six weeks of fully paid leave for new parents \u2014 mothers and fathers, including same-sex couples, who either bear or adopt a child.Before the vote, the supervisors amended the proposal to make employees eligible only when they have worked for a company 180 days. The ordinance goes into effect on Jan. 1, 2017, for companies with more than 50 employees, and a year later for those with 20 or more workers.The new law will make San Francisco\u2019s policy far broader than that of New York City, which has also expanded its parental leave policy. In December, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York ordered that 20,000 nonunionized workers be given six weeks of fully paid parental leave, but that amounts to a sliver of the total municipal work force of around 300,000.Except for a group of small-business owners, the ordinance here had wide support. The San Francisco Chamber of Commerce said that while it favored expanded parental leave benefits, there was a \u201cstrong belief among many business owners that once again, to the financial detriment of small businesses, a mandate is being adopted in San Francisco that would be better dealt with at the state or federal level.\u201d In a letter to the Board of Supervisors, the chamber declared itself \u201cneutral\u201d on the issue.Scott Wiener, the supervisor who introduced the measure, said that San Francisco lawmakers had chosen to take up the issue partly because there was little hope of change at the national level.\u201cWhether it\u2019s paid parental leave, infrastructure investment, minimum wage, paid sick leave or addressing carbon emissions, we know the states have to act,\u201d Mr. Wiener said in an interview before the vote.The ordinance requires a second vote by the supervisors next week and approval by Mayor Edwin M. Lee. Legislators described both as formalities given the unanimous vote on Tuesday.Only two states besides California \u2014 New Jersey and Rhode Island \u2014 mandate paid parental leave, and none at full pay. The funds for parental leave in all three come from employee-funded public insurance systems.Supporters of the measure rallied on the steps of City Hall on Tuesday.Julia Parish, 33, a lawyer with the Legal Aid Society who is eight and a half months pregnant, said the measure would be particularly helpful to lower-income residents who do not work for companies with generous benefits. \u201cWe are ahead of the curve in California, but globally, we are way behind,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s shameful.\u201dIndeed, by global standards, the San Francisco ordinance is a modest step. The United States is one of two countries out of 185 listed by the International Labor Organization that do not have a national law providing some form of paid parental leave. (The other is Papua New Guinea.)The parental leave measure is one of several pro-worker initiatives emerging from California. Gov. Jerry Brown signed a law Monday that would progressively raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2022. Separately, the leader of California\u2019s Senate is pushing to offer tax-free retirement savings plans for the 7.5 million workers in California who do not have employer-provided retirement plans.At a time of great divisions at the national level, amplified by the bitterness of the presidential election campaign, California\u2019s Democratic leaders say they see an opening to push hard on liberal issues inside the state.\u201cWith the presidential election in the background \u2014 with so much anger and anxiety \u2014 California is going in a vastly different direction,\u201d said the Senate president pro tempore, Kevin de Le\u00f3n, who wrote the retirement savings plan. \u201cWe are proving that despite the large legislative vacuum in Washington, D.C., that California can lead on its own.\u201dGavin Newsom, the state\u2019s lieutenant governor, said the country\u2019s divisions were making action by the states more urgent and necessary.\u201cThe nation is alive from the bottom up,\u201d Mr. Newsom said. \u201cFor all the disproportionate focus on Washington, D.C., there\u2019s a whole other America out there, and it should give pause to the pessimists.\u201dPro-labor battles have been hard fought in Washington. The federal parental leave law, known as the Family and Medical Leave Act, provides for 12 weeks of parental leave \u2014 unpaid.The law, vetoed or blocked for a decade, was passed in 1993 and signed by President Bill Clinton.Paid family leave, including parental leave, is scheduled to start in New York State in 2018 as part of a budget passed last week by the Legislature; in the first phase of the law, workers will get 50 percent of their wages during eight weeks of leave.In addition to parental leave, experts point to a growing number of states and municipalities that are passing laws governing sick leave and retirement plans.California\u2019s retirement savings plan addresses what experts say is the looming problem across the country of underfunded retirements. Under the program, called Secure Choice, a yet-to-be determined amount \u2014 around 3 to 5 percent \u2014 would be automatically deducted from workers\u2019 paychecks and placed in an investment fund that they can maintain throughout their careers.The fund would be overseen by portfolio managers chosen by the state. Employers will not add funds to the plan \u2014 the savings come entirely from employees.Employees can opt out of the savings plan.The program passed unanimously through a vetting committee led by the state\u2019s treasurer, but still needs to pass the full Legislature and be signed by the governor.Karen Friedman, the policy director of the Pension Rights Center, an advocacy group in Washington, said that while Secure Choice was a modest start to address the country\u2019s savings shortfall, it was also a \u201cblueprint\u201d for similar programs being proposed in about 25 other states.\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of proposals out there, but California became the state leading the effort,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a recognition that most people are retiring without adequate income.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a political branding opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile others fiddle and diddle, California moves.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Orphaned Orangutans Messed With a Reporter\u2019s Mind", "Date": "2016-04-15", "News": "Supported byStanding in the middle of a quiet, pristine rainforest in Indonesian Borneo watching wild young orangutans in their natural habitat is a unique experience, and in my case it wasn\u2019t an entirely positive one.That\u2019s because this group of around 30 juvenile orangutans were all orphans. Their habitat was a training area of a large rescue and rehabilitation center where they will spend years learning how to survive on their own before being released back into the wild.In fact most of the 480 apes at the center, established by the Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation in 1997, are rescued orphans and have been undergoing this survival training for years. They lost their families to either mass forest fires, including the worst ones on record in 2015; poachers who sold them off as pets; or vindictive villagers with guns.Others were themselves found caged as pets, or alone and sick amid Borneo\u2019s shrinking lowland rainforests, which are the prime habitat for orangutans. (They are also native to the Malaysian side of Borneo and to Indonesia\u2019s Sumatra region.)It\u2019s no secret why the rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra are disappearing: Illegal logging and slash-and-burn land clearing for palm oil plantations, by both large companies and small shareholders, are the main culprits.Having lived nearly 20 years in Southeast Asia, I understand both sides of the \u201cinvestment versus environment\u201d argument. Palm oil has created millions of jobs and lifted millions and millions more out of poverty in Indonesia.Yet the impact was just meters away from me as I watched these juvenile orangutans \u2014 as well as infants as young as 5 months old at other rehabilitation sites nearby. And it was all the more devastating because they look and act so much like humans: A rudimentary Google search will tell you that orangutans share 97 percent of our DNA.The infants I saw being taken by wheelbarrow, usually four per load, from a nursery to their own survival training area, clung to each other and gazed at their surroundings through vacant black eyes.I couldn\u2019t fully describe it. Luckily a good friend from my home state of Virginia, who has supported animal welfare causes for years, did so for me.\u201cI can\u2019t imagine what it must have been like to be with them,\u201d she wrote in an email after my story was published in early April and shared widely on social media. \u201cBittersweet, I\u2019m sure.\u201dYes, indeed. I have always said that journalists have the greatest job in the world, but it\u2019s rarely glam rock and glory. When you see the good and the bad together on the streets of Iraq and Afghanistan, as I have on multiple tours, or in the rainforests of Borneo, it\u2019s mostly depressing.There are no simple answers to the issues of economic development, environmental destruction, global warming and poverty reduction through agriculture.\u201cChoose your side,\u201d I have heard from both environmental activists and multinational corporations over the years. But I have also seen these folks sit shoulder to shoulder, vowing to ensure that such industries will become sustainable.I\u2019ve observed orangutans both in the wild and at rehabilitation centers in Borneo. They are incredibly strong and intimidating creatures. One juvenile at the rehabilitation center whacked my photographer in the leg with a stick; another threw a tree stump at me. Others repeatedly approached us aggressively because, their human minders said, they felt agitated at seeing strangers.Advertisement"}

Private equity.So perhaps he was the most likely person to find and then shame the many state pension funds and university endowments that invest, through private equity, in the payday lending industry. It is an industry that has millions of struggling Americans paying sky-high interest rates for what are supposed to be small loans.Mr. Zhang said he hoped to put the company\u2019s anti-payday-lending efforts in top search engine spots, too, though he landed at NerdWallet almost entirely by chance. His parents, both chemists, brought him to the United States from China when he 2 years old, after a professor at Northwestern University invited them to work and study there.The family eventually moved to Connecticut, where they entered the middle class and then the upper middle class. Mr. Zhang said his father had known as a boy what it meant to go hungry, but his parents\u2019 frugality kept him from ever having to go without. Still, he worked as a babysitter and a busboy, while still achieving enough in the classroom to earn acceptance to Yale.After college, Mr. Zhang spent two years at Morgan Stanley on a team that analyzed the firm\u2019s own strategy and transactions. He followed that up with two years in private equity, where firms use money from high-net-worth individuals and others to invest in companies. Eventually, it would try to sell those companies at a profit and put money back in the pockets of the now higher-net-worth individuals.In early 2015, he got a LinkedIn message from a recruiter at NerdWallet, the first time he\u2019d heard of the company. But when he learned more about it, the move made perfect sense to him. \u201cI spent two years helping the bank make more money and two years helping high-net-worth people make more,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the foreseeable future, I could help everyday consumers think smarter about their money.\u201dHe was hired to help think through the company\u2019s approach to student and personal loans. The site already had some information about the perils of payday loans. A representative from the N.A.A.C.P. in Alabama had noted NerdWallet\u2019s interest in the topic and invited Mr. Zhang to speak at a conference.Speaking there and meeting people who were up to their ears in such loans radicalized him. It also got him thinking. Somebody had to be investing money in these lenders, given how large they had become. But who were they? \u201cI had lived in that world and was familiar with how deals get done,\u201d he said. \u201cSome insecure overachiever tries to find a deal, writes a memo, builds a model, and then a vice president or partner goes and pitches it.\u201dWhile the investments themselves didn\u2019t violate any rules, Mr. Zhang said he didn\u2019t think the financial aid recipients who benefit from endowment earnings and retired state workers would feel good about it. So he and his colleagues passed their findings on to various media organizations.A small, early experiment intended to draw borrowers to the site drew hundreds of clicks from Google each day from people looking for cheap payday loans. Lenders approached NerdWallet with an offer to pay it $60 in commission on a $200 loan, knowing that many borrowers end up repeatedly rolling their loans over into new loans and paying effective annual interest rates well into the three figures.\u201cI asked them whether they would take the $60 and give that discount to the borrower, but they wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Zhang said. \u201cTheir business model is based on repeat customers, so if someone repays their loan, they don\u2019t make money.\u201dEventually, NerdWallet settled on a pro bono effort whereby it would earn no commission and send consumers only to nonprofit lenders with lower interest rates or to governmental organizations that offer short-term assistance. It began on Friday, with links to 44 entities in California and Texas. The company plans to add more over time.While NerdWallet will make no money in the short term from its payday lending redirection, it is well aware that people in financial trouble now could be customers next year. \u201cIf we do this well, we can rehabilitate people in a tough spot,\u201d Mr. Zhang said. \u201cIn six months, when she needs a credit card or wants to start investing, she\u2019ll come back. That\u2019s the best type of bet that we can make.\u201dAbout those credit cards: There\u2019s something pretty rich about a company like NerdWallet, which earns commissions from credit card issuers that charge double-digit interest rates, channeling those commissions toward keeping other customers away from the triple-digit effective interest rates that the payday lenders charge. But hey, at least NerdWallet isn\u2019t using that money to push more credit cards.Mr. Zhang understands how this looks. \u201cWe wrestle with it every day,\u201d he said. To him, the benefits of credit cards outweigh the problems they cause for the many millions of people who use them without getting into years of debt.That\u2019s not something, however, that he can say about lending operations that target people who are down on their luck. \u201cThere is no instance,\u201d he said, \u201cwhere I\u2019d ever encourage people to get a payday loan.\u201dTwitter: @ronlieberAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google\u2019s Calendar Now Finds Spare Time and Fills It Up", "Date": "2016-04-13", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Online technology\u2019s urgent emails, calendar updates and videoconferences may propel business, but the system at times seems to suck energy from our personal lives.The answer, according to Google, is more technology.On Wednesday, the company is introducing new features to its popular calendar that will enable people to program in their aspirations for times when they don\u2019t have work or meetings scheduled.Google\u2019s algorithms will then seek appropriate gaps in a schedule in which stuff like exercise or discussing life with one\u2019s spouse might be appropriate. While this means putting more of ourselves inside the machine, Google argues that its method is more efficient.The product, called Goals, works like this: Inside the online calendar, people choose from a menu of goals like \u201cexercise,\u201d \u201cme time\u201d or \u201cskill building.\u201d The software then asks for some specifics, like how often a person wants to run, for what duration and typically when in the day.It then scours the white spaces in a calendar for possible times and maps out a schedule, filling those times with the desired aspiration. Afterward, the goal can be marked completed or not, which helps the algorithm work out a better schedule over time.Along with Goals, Google is introducing a calendar feature that enables two people in the same company to find mutually convenient meeting times, by enabling a software \u201cagent\u201d to scour both datebooks and pick an optimal time.Not coincidentally, Google\u2019s calendar features are something of a riposte to competitors like Apple, Microsoft and Facebook, which have been getting into the life management business.Presumably, friends\u2019 encouragement programs people to stay with a goal. Artificial intelligence, or A.I., software that behaves socially aims to do the same.Sherry Turkle, who studies the social effects of technology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the Google calendar software appeared to be a promising alternative to the more seemingly \u201chuman\u201d software agents, which she worries can diminish authentic human interactions.\u201cToo often we\u2019re cheap dates that fall for programs that pretend to know us, or ask about our emotional states,\u201d Ms. Turkle said. \u201cThis is harnessing the calendar to make an aspiration real. Of all the applications of a computer dialogue that have been thrown at me lately, this seems good.\u201dMr. Ariely is a professor of psychology and behavioral economics at Duke University and the author of \u201cPredictably Irrational,\u201d a book about why people do things like overpaying and procrastinating. Last year Google bought Timeful, a scheduling company where he worked.Google, which is increasingly trying to move from Internet search and advertising company to a more general provider of A.I.-type software, says its technology already sorts email into high- and low-priority items and weeds out the junk. Unfortunately, this appears to have freed up time to send more work email.\u201cEmail shows up and says, \u2018Answer me!\u2019\u201d Mr. Ariely said. \u201cUnfortunately, time for thinking does not do that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Should a Nephew Be Told Who His Real Father Is?", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported byThe EthicistMy sister has told me that her son is not the biological son of her husband. His sperm count was very low; she was having an affair and became pregnant. The son looks not like his father but like the other man. Her son (he is now middle-aged) doesn\u2019t know, and her husband (they\u2019re now divorced) doesn\u2019t, either. Recently, when my sister had a health crisis, she told the other man for the first time, asking him not to tell anyone. He told her that was his decision. He has no other children. Now he knows he has a son and a grandchild.But do such considerations trump your obligation to keep your sister\u2019s confidence? If you tell, after all, it\u2019s your sister who will have to explain to her son why she has kept this fact from him and face his likely reproaches (spoken or not) for her infidelity to the man your nephew always thought of as his father. There\u2019s also a serious chance her ex-husband will find out, which could lead to more distress, not least because it may disrupt his relationship with the man he raised as his son. And consequences aside, there\u2019s the simple, forceful fact that you gave your word.The best outcome, I suspect, is one in which you persuade your sister to tell her son herself. Aim for that. She surely knows her son better than you do and will have views about how the revelation would affect him; she\u2019ll also have views about how to manage their relationship afterward. And if she still refuses to tell your nephew? Listen to her side of things before you decide whether it\u2019s your place to be the bearer of this news.So the sole party who might have a moral claim against you is the seller \u2014 and the seller picked the price, not you. The lesson of all those stories about Rembrandts found at garage sales is that buyers have no obligation to inform sellers that they could charge more. The obligations run in the other direction. Sellers are supposed to inform buyers if a good has a known defect that affects its value, unless they are explicitly selling \u201cas is.\u201d No inverse convention requires buyers to inform sellers of unknown advantages.There\u2019s a good reason for this. The person possessing the object is better positioned than the buyer to explore its properties before offering it for sale (economists call this \u201cinformation asymmetry\u201d), and it\u2019s in his or her interest to do so. In the age of Google, what\u2019s more, there are lots of price databases online. So you can stop worrying about your purchase\u2019s ethics and just enjoy its aesthetics.I am a vascular surgeon. One of the diseases I treat is aortic aneurysms. Recently, a patient presented in extremis to the emergency room with a rupture of his aneurysm. He told me that he had known about the aneurysm and had declined elective repair in the past. I was frank about the risks of surgery and the likelihood of a poor outcome. I was also truthful when I told him that without surgery he would definitely die soon but comfortably, and that the only, albeit slim, chance of surviving this event would be going immediately to the operating room. His family was hours from our hospital. He decided to proceed with surgery and indeed died from complications.You suggest three reasons for refusing him surgery. First, because he made the wrong decision earlier. Second: It was a waste of resources. Third: His death was painful for you. The first and third reasons sit badly with me. It\u2019s not your job to judge the earlier decisions of your patients \u2014 you don\u2019t withhold surgery from an accident victim who neglected to wear a seatbelt \u2014 and as a surgeon, you\u2019re obliged to do the best you can for your patients, even if it discomforts you.I have some sympathy, though, with the second reason. The costs of treating people are borne by all of us, through taxes and insurance premiums. We cannot spend all our resources on medicine. So we have to make decisions about what we will and won\u2019t do. Difficult and expensive surgery with a very low probability of prolonging life is the sort of thing that we can reasonably decide we won\u2019t do. That tenet wouldn\u2019t normally apply to surgery for ruptured aortic aneurysms, which I gather has a mortality rate of about 50 percent. (Not good, but not terrible.) Yet there may be procedures for which the ratio between resources and results is wildly lopsided.Decisions like these, however, aren\u2019t to be made on the fly by a single physician. We need to get clearer, institutionally, about what our criteria are for rationing long-odds surgery. And we need mechanisms for working out which interventions should and shouldn\u2019t make the cut.Kwame Anthony Appiah teaches philosophy at N.Y.U.

{"Headline": "Down to Lunch Founders Pursue Less-Traveled Path to App Success", "Date": "2016-04-20", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Nikil Viswanathan and Joseph Lau have built the hottest new social app in America. Now the young men have to keep it from getting crushed by an anonymous slander campaign, overwhelmed servers and their urge to personally respond to thousands of messages from users.Mr. Viswanathan, a mile-a-minute talker, and Mr. Lau, who is more laid-back, meet one fundamental requirement for success: a stubborn belief that they have a great idea. Mr. Viswanathan worked on five previous services that tried to connect people, three of them with Mr. Lau, but Down to Lunch was the first to catch on.The San Francisco start-up has needed little capital so far, and the founders have turned away dozens of potential investors. However, the men, both Stanford alumni, have not been shy about seeking advice from their array of Silicon Valley connections, including senior tech executives, venture capitalists and other company founders.As thousands of app developers have discovered, attention spans are short, especially among the college and high school students that Down to Lunch is targeting. Dozens of competitors are vying to help people organize spontaneous gatherings, including Hangster, Shortnotice, Down to Hang and a Google app called Who\u2019s Down.And a lot of things can go wrong on the road to becoming the next Snapchat.Down to Lunch\u2019s servers went down last week after hitting limits imposed by their cloud computing provider, forcing the start-up to devise a work-around. A human error derailed sign-ups for six hours on Monday.In addition to typical start-up problems \u2014 lack of sleep, inadequate staffing, technical malfunctions \u2014 Mr. Viswanathan and Mr. Lau have also been battling an anonymous social media campaign claiming that Down to Lunch is used for sex trafficking.The assertions, some describing encounters with suspicious strangers, are dubious. Down to Lunch is designed to allow communications only between people who know each other and have each other\u2019s phone number.Kirsta Melton, who heads the human trafficking division of the Texas attorney general\u2019s office, said that she looked into the app and found no evidence supporting the allegations.\u201cUnless you have random strangers in your address book or someone stole your phone, it\u2019s unlikely that this app could be used for human trafficking,\u201d she said.It\u2019s not clear who is behind the smear campaign, although Mr. Viswanathan and Mr. Lau believe it might be a competitor. They traced the accusations back to several Twitter accounts. Twitter temporarily suspended one account and appears to have blocked offending tweets from others. Apple and Google have also removed app-store reviews that mention the trafficking allegations.But that has not stopped worried users from contacting Mr. Viswanathan or Mr. Lau or simply deleting the app. Mr. Viswanathan said one school administrator even called him about it.Despite the damage the trafficking accusations have caused, there is no question that Down to Lunch has struck a chord with young people. After the app appeared on the University of Notre Dame\u2019s campus, for example, 15 percent of the student body downloaded it within 12 hours, Mr. Viswanathan said.Aakash Malhotra, a freshman at the University of Georgia who downloaded the app last September, said it helped him build friendships on campus. \u201cWe have enough apps on our phone that give us information or entertain us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019d rather have an app to help us connect in person.\u201dUntil February, Mr. Viswanathan and Mr. Lau were the only employees. The six-person company still operates from the loft-style apartment that the founders share in San Francisco\u2019s South of Market neighborhood.Whiteboards cover one wall, laying out the top tasks for the day and week. Mash notes from fans are posted as inspiration. Leaky takeout containers have colonized the kitchen, and Mr. Lau often stashes McDonald\u2019s breakfast burritos in the refrigerator to fuel marathon coding sessions.Mr. Viswanathan, 28, interned at Microsoft, Google and Facebook, where he sat right outside the glass-walled office of Mark Zuckerberg, the co-founder and chief executive, and occasionally played chess with him.Mr. Lau, 26, was an engineering intern at LinkedIn. When the job wound down, LinkedIn\u2019s chairman and co-founder, Reid Hoffman, personally implored him to stay. Mr. Lau declined and later went to Pinterest.While the pair has not been shy about tapping their networks for help, they have eschewed most of the usual marketing tactics for a start-up.And in an industry where an investment from a top venture capitalist confers immediate credibility, \u201cthey\u2019ve been pushing everyone away, even the who\u2019s who of investing,\u201d said Cameron Teitelman, the chief executive of StartX, a nonprofit for Stanford entrepreneurs that has helped the company.Mr. Lau explained, \u201cIf we take time out to raise money, that\u2019s time we\u2019re not working on the product. That\u2019s time that users can\u2019t talk to us. That\u2019s time that we\u2019re not keeping servers up.\u201dThe founders and their small team have instead focused on improving the app. When they have a new version to test, they drive across the Bay Bridge to the University of California, Berkeley, to get feedback from students.They try to respond personally to the thousands of messages they get from users every week. At one point, Mr. Viswanathan was getting so many texts that his iPhone\u2019s messaging app froze. The problem stumped even Apple\u2019s V.I.P. support team, which got involved after Mr. Viswanathan emailed Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, for help.The founders are also wrestling with a question faced by developers everywhere: How hard do you push your users to recruit friends to download your app?Last week, they added a button that allowed people to invite all of their contacts with one click. But many people consider such requests to be spam, and Twitter was already filled with complaints from people who received unwanted Down to Lunch invitations.After a couple of days, the pair decided to disable the mass-invitation feature.Although their lives are stressful, the founders say they are having a blast.\u201cWe know we can build something that improves the lives for every single person on the planet,\u201d Mr. Viswanathan said. \u201cIt sounds kind of crazy, but we\u2019re going to do it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Theranos\u2019s Fate Rests With a Founder Who Answers Only to Herself", "Date": "2016-04-24", "News": "Supported byIt\u2019s all up to Elizabeth Holmes.Just last year, Theranos was a Silicon Valley favorite with a $9 billion valuation. Now, depending on the outcome of the investigations, including the threat of crippling sanctions by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the company could be forced out of business and Ms. Holmes could lose her position as chief executive.The troubles have led to a cascade of questions about what changes Theranos might make to rebuild its reputation and business prospects. Some have even said that Ms. Holmes should step aside.After more than six months of intense questions, though, changes have been limited. And whatever future moves the company makes are up to Ms. Holmes. She \u2014 not the investors, and not even the board \u2014 controls the switches.Ms. Holmes, a 32-year-old Stanford University dropout, owns a majority interest in Theranos, a privately held company she founded in 2003. She is also the company\u2019s chairwoman and chief executive. What she wants done at her company, she can demand.Ms. Holmes declined to be interviewed. But in an extended interview, David Boies, a heavyweight lawyer who is one of three outside directors on the Theranos board, hinted that some management changes may be coming soon.\u201cThe board is right now in the process, and Elizabeth Holmes is in the process, of adding significant talent to the company,\u201d he said.But an adviser to the company, Richard Kovacevich, a former chief executive at Wells Fargo, acknowledged the limited role played by anyone other than Ms. Holmes. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have to answer anything she doesn\u2019t want to,\u201d he said.The situation at Theranos offers a stark reminder of the perils of investing in Silicon Valley, where it is common for founders to control a company, leaving boards with little real power, including over who should be chief executive.The examples are legion, including huge success stories like Google and Facebook. The upside for venture capitalists is that betting on an individual and getting in early can lead to riches. But if trouble brews, it is nearly impossible for a board or anyone but the founder to make any changes \u2014 a risk that, for now at least, investors remain willing to make.\u201cFor every Theranos, there\u2019s a Facebook,\u201d said Bryan Roberts, a partner at Venrock, a leading venture capital firm.Even in a case like Zenefits, where its founder, Parker Conrad, stepped down as chief executive in February after regulatory problems emerged, the decision to resign was ultimately his.Theranos\u2019s board, which in its early years included some of its large investors, was later composed of an array of diplomatic, military and political leaders, including former Secretaries of State George Shultz and Henry Kissinger and former Senator Bill Frist. Last year, the company divided the directors into advisers and an actual governing board, which includes Mr. Boies, whose law firm represents Theranos.While critics have pointed to the board\u2019s lack of industry expertise and the advanced age of some advisers, Mr. Boies defended it as \u201cextraordinarily qualified.\u201dBut legal experts say that while the directors are responsible for representing the interests of all investors, Ms. Holmes does not have to listen. A founder with controlling interest can replace the board, so directors are ultimately left with the choice of being fired or resigning if they strongly disagree with the executive.Supervoting shares, another common practice among start-ups, grant founders like Ms. Holmes even more power.\u201cYou\u2019re practically a paper tiger and have fiduciary responsibility,\u201d said Charles Elson, a corporate governance expert at the University of Delaware.Mr. Boies says Ms. Holmes has the board\u2019s backing. \u201cI think the board has complete confidence in Elizabeth Holmes as a founder of the company, as a scientist and as an administrator,\u201d he said.The board is represented by an independent law firm, Mr. Boies said, which is answering queries from the United States attorney\u2019s office in San Francisco and the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as conducting an independent investigation into whether Theranos made proper disclosures to investors. No formal accusations have been made.While Theranos is privately held, its investors still have protections, said Joseph Grundfest, a law professor at Stanford. \u201cThe federal securities laws have very strict anti-fraud provisions, and they apply to sophisticated investors, not just unsophisticated ones.\u201dBut Mr. Kovacevich, who is also an investor, emphasized that Theranos was not a publicly held company with the same responsibilities and that the shareholders understood this.\u201cNot only is this a private company, but it has also been stated to the world, to the board and stockholders, that she has no intentions of ever going public,\u201d he said of Ms. Holmes. \u201cThe intention, and a strong intention, is that this company is going to be private forever.\u201dThe Medicare investigation is the most pressing threat, and Mr. Boies is largely mum about what Theranos is planning and how the board is reacting. Theranos has been the subject of scathing coverage in The Wall Street Journal, which has relentlessly questioned the reliability and safety of its blood tests, and it is under intense regulatory scrutiny. \u201cThe exact focus of what needs to be done keeps changing,\u201d Mr. Boies said.The lab and its procedures have been overhauled, Mr. Boies said. Ms. Holmes has hired new management to run the lab, and because the people who ran it previously did not report directly to her, he said he hoped the agency would not take punitive action against her. The company\u2019s other lab, in Arizona, which performs more traditional tests, continues to draw customers, he noted.But Theranos still faces extraordinary skepticism about whether its main technology works, especially given its history of secretiveness, and Mr. Boies said Theranos was taking steps to address the doubts. He pointed to plans to finally publish its results in peer-reviewed journals and the addition of some well-respected individuals to its scientific advisory board. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to reveal much more about the proprietary technology than is desirable,\u201d given the risk of companies\u2019 and countries\u2019 copying what Theranos does, Mr. Boies said.The company\u2019s intellectual property is essentially its main asset, and if the technology works, some observers say, the company could remain a viable business. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re beyond salvage, beyond redemption,\u201d said Lakshman Ramamurthy, an industry consultant with extensive regulatory experience.But while he did not rule out a sale, Mr. Boies dismissed the idea of handing Theranos over to the highest bidder. \u201cThis technology is not going to be sold to somebody who wants to just make more profits from it and charge what is charged today,\u201d he said.And, as Mr. Kovacevich emphasized, Ms. Holmes will ultimately determine what happens next. \u201cYou have to ask Ms. Holmes what the steps are,\u201d he said.Katie Benner contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The complainer\u2019s comments were so suspect that the Times participants, including some newsroom journalists listening in, declined to publish an article on the matter, but instead began to investigate.The call, said Carol Giacomo, an editorial writer, was odd \u201cbecause the more we got into it, the more we had questions.\u201d\u201cThe guy who was supposedly Poroshenko was in the background, and we couldn\u2019t hear him very clearly, and the translator\u2019s voice was dominant,\u201d she said.The translator also quoted the voice identified as Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s as saying he did not want to return the money to his country, in part because he did not want to pay taxes on it.That assertion was so outlandish, said Michael Slackman, international managing editor for The Times, that it helped confirm suspicions about the veracity of their interview.The people on the Ukraine end of the phone call spoke in Russian \u2014 unusual for senior Ukrainian officials. The signature on the letter, it turned out, was identical to a Google image result for Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s signature. The email address for his press officer was a Gmail account. Further, Mr. Poroshenko speaks fluent English and regularly conducts interviews with foreign journalists in that language.When a Times journalist, Andrew E. Kramer, called the press office telephone number provided on the email, the man who answered, who identified himself as Sergei Panfilov, spoke Russian with a pronounced Moscow accent.At first he stuck to his story, that the Ukraine president\u2019s office had contacted The Times. When Mr. Kramer pressed further, Mr. Panfilov \u201cadmitted it was a hoax,\u201d Mr. Kramer said. \u201cHe said that Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s office was upset\u201d with the editorial \u201cand wanted to \u2018discredit\u2019 The New York Times, and had thus hired him to stage the fake interview.\u201dBut the president\u2019s actual press office, which has its own email address and a different phone number, denied having anything to do with the hoax attempt and offered its own theory.\u201cIn our opinion,\u201d a press aide, Yarema Dukh, wrote in an email, \u201cthis bizarre situation is a distasteful attempt to attack both reputation of New York Times and President Poroshenko.\u201d The president\u2019s office presumes, Mr. Dukh wrote, that the pranksters were \u201cconnected to some Russian official bodies and executing their orders.\u201d In a separate post on Facebook, another aide blamed \u201cRussian special services\u201d for the failed hoax.There was no immediate response to a request for comment from the Russian authorities in Moscow late Wednesday night.Advertisement"}

A No. 1 debut on the Billboard chart? Steady play across streaming services? A hit radio single or a viral music video?Now, however, as Mr. West begins to loosen his grip on the music, releasing a traditional single (\u201cFamous\u201d) to radio this week and, starting on Friday, selling the album as a download and sharing it with competing streaming services, Tidal is pulling back the curtain on his experiment: Songs from \u201cThe Life of Pablo\u201d were streamed 400 million times, globally, through Monday, according to data provided to The New York Times by the company. Of those streams, Tidal said 250 million came in the first 10 days.For Mr. West, an iconoclast fixated on new artistic paths and distribution systems, the soft rollout of \u201cPablo\u201d allowed him to play by his own rules, which in this case included updating beats, tweaking lyrics and tinkering with the track list even after the album\u2019s so-called release. (A fresh version, with barely perceptible changes, appeared on Tidal without warning on Thursday.)Def Jam, Mr. West\u2019s label and a subsidiary of Universal Music Group, said in a statement: \u201cIn the months to come, Kanye will release new updates, new versions and new iterations of the album,\u201d calling it a \u201ccontinuous process.\u201dThe evolving album also made Tidal \u2014 which does not have an unpaid tier for listeners but has offered free trials of up to 90 days \u2014 a destination, building on its promise of exclusive content by artists like Beyonc\u00e9 and Rihanna.As a point of comparison, Spotify, which counts 30 million paid subscribers to Tidal\u2019s three million global users, said its best week of streaming belongs to Mr. Bieber\u2019s latest album, \u201cPurpose,\u201d which debuted to 205 million global streams in seven days, and 224 million in its first 10 \u2014 fewer than Tidal\u2019s count for \u201cPablo.\u201d (\u201cPurpose,\u201d however, was not exclusive to Spotify, meaning it could also be found on iTunes, YouTube or even in record stores.)Other top albums on Spotify have included Rihanna\u2019s \u201cAnti,\u201d which had 309 million streams around the world in its first six weeks on the service after debuting exclusively on Tidal for a week. (A corporate sponsor also offered one million free downloads.) \u201cBeauty Behind the Madness,\u201d by the Weeknd, earned 311 million streams in its first six weeks, Spotify said.By claiming to have topped his contemporaries by using a smaller platform and tighter exclusivity, Mr. West is declaring victory for his nontraditional release strategy. \u201cThis is not regular!\u201d he tweeted of the numbers. (The industry standard counts 1,500 streams as equivalent to one album sold; 400 million streams for \u201cPablo\u201d would equal about 267,000 albums, making it the best-selling hip-hop release of the year so far.)Mr. West and his label also began offering listeners a chance to own the album \u2014 as it exists for now \u2014 legally, selling a download at kanyewest.com for $20 (more than most digital albums).Which is not to say that Mr. West is reverting entirely to old-fashioned tactics: A physical version of \u201cThe Life of Pablo\u201d is still nowhere in sight.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ad Agencies Need Young Talent. Cue the Beanbag Chairs.", "Date": "2016-04-18", "News": "Supported byAt the headquarters of the McCann agency in Manhattan, the battle for the future of the advertising industry is being waged with piped-in electronic music and employee-brewed beer.Young professionals, balancing Apple laptops on their knees, drape themselves over space-age chairs near a cafe that sells fresh juice and subsidized snacks. On one floor, plants cover walls, making the office look like a jungle. Elsewhere is a Ping-Pong table.The young and the creative have been the engine that drove the advertising industry for decades. But those who once flocked to the business with dreams of making the next standout television commercial are no longer drawn to the industry in the same way. Some view advertising as stodgy \u2014 who wants to make a 30-second TV commercial when everyone they know is cutting the cord? \u2014 and some are lured by the riches and prestige of the technology industry.\u201cThe biggest threat \u2014 and one of the biggest things that we talk a lot about \u2014 is not only attracting but retaining young talent because there are so many more options,\u201d said David Droga, the creative chairman and founder of the agency Droga5. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost people to Facebook. We\u2019ve lost people to Google; we\u2019ve lost people to Apple.\u201dTo enhance their appeal, many agencies are trying to make themselves look less like Madison Avenue and more like the start-ups and tech companies that are now dipping into the same talent pool. Cue the employee happy hours, table tennis and free snacks. But the advertising industry faces much deeper issues that cannot be fixed with cosmetic changes.Cool new technologies like virtual reality have imperiled the art of the television commercial, which is still, in many ways, the bread and butter of advertising agencies. The proliferation of online ads has made advertising anathema. And money provides little incentive: Last year, the average salary for entry-level employees at agencies was about $35,500, according to the 4A\u2019s, an industry trade group. About 25 percent of the industry makes less than $50,400 a year.\u201cBeanbags and softball matches and a cool Twitter handle doesn\u2019t make young people want to work at your office,\u201d Mr. Droga said. To attract young people, he added, advertising agencies need to produce exciting work again, which many have stopped doing.Even as many agency executives insist that their companies are still the best place for creative minds to shine, they are finding it more difficult to maintain their ranks. Turnover at advertising agencies is higher than in competitive industries like technology and management consulting, and the gap increased 10 percent in the last year, according to a study from LinkedIn and the 4A\u2019s.A lot is at stake: If agencies cannot recruit and retain top young talent, the craft of traditional advertising \u2014 an important part of culture for better or worse \u2014 could disappear.\u201cWe have to fill the pipeline with young talent,\u201d said Tony Weisman, chief executive in North America for the agency DigitasLBi. If agencies fail to recruit and keep top young employees, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to become archaic.\u201dLosing young talent is a problem other industries face as well. Established news organizations are losing people to relatively new outfits like Vice and BuzzFeed. Investment banks like Goldman Sachs and Bank of America have made sweeping changes to their junior-banker programs in part because ambitious college graduates were turning to Silicon Valley.But while Wall Street can match the pay at places like Google and Facebook, advertising agencies cannot. So instead, they are trying to match some of the perks.The creative agency Deutsch offers free snacks and a barista at its New York office and free lunch at its Los Angeles office, moves that Mike Sheldon, the agency\u2019s chief executive in North America, said were modeled after Google. The agency also provides yoga classes, boot camp workout classes and wine tastings. The agency Ogilvy & Mather has beers on the first Friday of every month. McCann allows employees to brew their own beer that is then named after clients. One, named for the military contractor Lockheed Martin, is called Stealth Stout.Some agencies are also revamping their offices to look more like start-ups, with open seating plans and plush chairs. The agency BBDO has created a separate space in its New York office, called Xlab, where restless minds can experiment with virtual reality and drones. (In a bit of a twist, BBDO also happens to be behind the General Electric campaign aimed at getting young people to work for the company.)To reinforce that advertising is an actual career rather than a consolation prize or a steppingstone to something better, agencies like Ogilvy & Mather, Deutsch, Droga5 and DigitasLBi are also bolstering their training and mentorship programs.The changes are geared toward attracting and retaining people like Allan Holmes, 29, who joined the agency Leo Burnett in Chicago after graduating from the Savannah College of Art and Design in 2011, but now works at Facebook\u2019s Creative Shop, the company\u2019s in-house agency. He said he was attracted to Facebook, which he joined roughly two years ago, because it had the \u201csame sort of energy\u201d as a start-up. And what got him most excited initially, he said, was his personal connection to the company \u2014 he met his girlfriend and best friend on social media. \u201cThe platforms mean everything,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re extremely important.\u201dIn the end, perks may do little to combat the advertising industry\u2019s loss of cachet.\u201cPeople no longer have that innate desire and that instinctive desire to be in our business,\u201d said Jay Haines, a founder of Grace Blue, a search firm that works with the advertising industry.But that does not mean the advertising agencies are going to stop trying.At IPG Mediabrands \u2014 like McCann, a part of Interpublic Group, one of the biggest ad holding companies \u2014 the pop hits were already cranked way up on a recent morning. Young employees waited at a coffee bar for lattes and gluten-free pastries. A sign indicated a beer garden. Another, in blue tiles, spelled out \u201cInitiative.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve gone out of our way to make it really comfortable, really cool,\u201d said Henry Tajer, the agency\u2019s global chief executive, as he considered the scene from a conference room. \u201cIt\u2019s a day club.\u201dThe advertising industry can only hope it is not too late to the party.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Companies Face Greater Scrutiny for Paying Workers With Stock", "Date": "2016-04-17", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For the last few years, LinkedIn, the professional social networking company, has doled out increasingly large amounts of stock to pay its workers.In 2014, LinkedIn paid employees $319 million in stock, or 14 percent of revenue; in 2015, that rose to $510 million, or 17 percent of revenue. At the time, those figures were largely met with shrugs from Wall Street.Now that attitude may be changing.The Silicon Valley company\u2019s stock-based compensation \u201cprovides additional reason to remain cautious\u201d on LinkedIn, Mark May, an Internet analyst at Citigroup, wrote in a research note.The issue is not limited to LinkedIn. With tech earnings season kicking off on Monday, investors are paying more attention to stock-based compensation at many tech companies.Paying employees with stock is largely unquestioned when times are good, since the move theoretically aligns the interests of the workers with company performance. The practice is technically a corporate expense, but during boom periods, Wall Street typically focuses on a company\u2019s operating results that exclude that expense.Tech companies stand out as some of the most generous givers of shares to employees. While the median number of restricted shares granted at Standard & Poor\u2019s 1500 companies to executives and employees in 2014 equaled 450,198 shares, tech companies granted a median 798,000 shares of restricted stock to workers, according to data from Equilar, a research firm that provides data on executives, boards and compensation.As a result, there has been a \u201cheightened investor focus on the level of stock-based compensation among the Internet companies,\u201d Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a recent note.In an interview, Mr. Mahaney said stock-based compensation could \u201cdistort the quality\u201d of a company\u2019s earnings and \u201cmake them look stronger than they are.\u201dMr. Mahaney has identified Twitter, LinkedIn, Yahoo and Alibaba as among the tech companies that are highly dependent on stock to pay their employees. In a report, he wrote that Twitter\u2019s stock-based compensation over the last two years accounted for 39 percent of the company\u2019s revenue, on average, the highest percentage of any Internet company.LinkedIn, whose share price is down about 48 percent this year, did not respond to requests for comment. Twitter, whose stock is down more than 20 percent this year, also did not respond to a request for comment.Another tech company that Wall Street analysts are examining for its stock-based compensation expenses is Workday, which sells human resources and financial management software. The company is expected to increase its stock compensation about 48 percent in its 2017 fiscal year, which is faster than its revenue is projected to grow, according to Sarah Hindlian, an analyst at Macquarie Group.In an illustration of how stock-based compensation expenses can affect a company\u2019s results, Ms. Hindlian says Workday\u2019s margins are projected to be around negative 25 percent for fiscal year 2017. But when the company\u2019s $370 million in stock-based compensation is excluded from results, its operating margins are much better, coming in around zero.Workday\u2019s heavy reliance on stock-based compensation has been a factor in Ms. Hindlian\u2019s projections for the company\u2019s share price. Last month, she forecast that Workday\u2019s stock would trade at $49, down from its current price of about $77. She has a sell recommendation on the stock.Ms. Hindlian says that while it can be reasonable for companies to pay workers a lot in stock, the practice can become scary when the stock starts to fall. \u201cParticularly with software companies, you run the risk of losing your leading salespeople, engineers and developers when the stock falls, because employees feel like they\u2019re getting a pay cut,\u201d said Ms. Hindlian, who also rang the alarm on LinkedIn\u2019s use of stock-based compensation over a year ago.\u201cSomewhere along the way a management team may feel pressure to increase their share price to avoid loss of employees,\u201d Ms. Hindlian said, \u201cwhich can ultimately mean management goals and shareholder interests become misaligned.\u201dWorkday declined to comment.When companies authorize additional shares to pay employees and management, that also creates \u201cdilution,\u201d or a decrease in how much of the company a shareholder owns when new stock is issued. That effect is starting to push others on Wall Street to lower their price projections for tech company stocks. Mr. May of Citigroup lowered his price targets this month on Google, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, eBay, Yahoo and Twitter to \u201cfully capture the likely ongoing dilution from future share grants as part of employee compensation,\u201d he said.The increased scrutiny of tech companies that rely heavily on stock to pay employees is just one of many places where investors are taking a harder look as markets soften, said John Roe, a managing director at ISS Corporate Solutions, a group that advises shareholders on corporate governance issues.He noted that some shareholders had also submitted proposals asking companies to consider the impact of share buybacks on earnings, to figure out whether executives delivered better earnings by improving performance or by reducing the number of shares outstanding.\u201cYou see a brighter focus on certain practices when there is more volatility and markets are going down,\u201d said Mr. Roe. \u201cThe reliance on equity compensation is one of those things that you might always worry about, but recent events have amplified that concern.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe Tried to Rein In Google. It Backfired.", "Date": "2016-04-18", "News": "Supported byBut a landmark court ruling intended to rein in Google has instead put it at the forefront of Europe\u2019s enforcement of Internet privacy. That has upended conventional wisdom about the company and raised questions about the role of commercial interests in protecting people\u2019s privacy, often with little or no transparency.Google\u2019s total number of privacy-related judgments is double those of most of Europe\u2019s biggest individual national authorities over the same period, even though these public agencies address a wider range of data protection complaints.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.Less than 1 percent of Google\u2019s decisions are appealed to Europe\u2019s privacy authorities, according to the regulators\u2019 statistics, and those authorities said they generally ruled in the company\u2019s favor.But several individuals who sent requests to Google told The New York Times that the lack of detail over how these decisions were made left them frustrated and, in some cases, angry that a company adjudicated on such delicate matters. These people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to publicize their own privacy cases.\u201cIf governments were handling \u2018right to be forgotten,\u2019 they would have to publish data,\u201d said Martin Husovec, a professor at the Tilburg Institute for Law, Technology, and Society in the Netherlands, and a signatory of the open letter to Google. \u201cBut with Google, we can\u2019t see what\u2019s happening behind the company\u2019s closed doors.\u201dAfter Europe\u2019s highest court ruled in May 2014 that people with connections to the Continent could ask search engines like Google and Microsoft\u2019s Bing to remove links about themselves from online search results, the companies were handed the power to decide which of these requests were legitimate. Citing European privacy rules, the European Court of Justice mandated that search engines, and not a public body, should be the first port of call for the decisions. Europe\u2019s top court did not require that companies make their decision-making process open to public scrutiny.People\u2019s privacy requests must relate to online information, like personal circumstances or a past criminal conviction, that is no longer relevant or not in the public interest, definitions that privacy lawyers say are inherently fuzzy.Thus far, that has mostly involved people demanding mundane information like phone numbers or addresses be removed from links to online directories (the largest collective group of sites affected). Individuals have also requested that links to references about themselves on social media, including Facebook, be taken down.All the talk about data privacy can get caught up in political wrangling. But the different approaches have practical consequences for people, too.Though Google would not comment publicly about the review process, two company executives gave some detail on how decisions were made. They spoke to The Times on the condition they not be named.Typically, requests are sent to Google\u2019s legal team. Straightforward rulings, like those that involve a public figure who cannot legally apply for links to be removed, are handled by junior staff members. Tougher decisions are referred to senior lawyers who must weigh an individual\u2019s privacy against the public\u2019s right to information, the company officials said.When Google\u2019s team accepts a request, it informs an individual that the privacy demand has been successful, while also notifying the website that links to certain European search results have been removed. The website cannot appeal the decision. If Google refuses the request, the company must tell an individual that the decision can be appealed, but does not specifically explain why the submission failed.Some European officials remain wary of handing Google the power to make privacy decisions, though they declined to comment publicly on the court-mandated privacy process. But regulators acknowledge that the company\u2019s system \u2014 which has so far dealt with removal requests for 1.4 million links \u2014 has proved surprisingly straightforward. Some officials also remain satisfied that Google makes these initial privacy rulings despite a lack of openness over how decisions are made.\u201cWhen it comes to appeals, we agree with Google most of the time,\u201d said Mathias Moulin, a deputy director at the Commission National de l\u2019Informatique et des Libert\u00e9s, the French privacy authority.This muted official response \u2014 from both European regulators and politicians \u2014 is partly because agencies lack the financial, technical and human resources to handle the substantial influx of \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d requests, according to regulatory officials and legal experts.Still, for privacy campaigners and some regulators, Google\u2019s regulatory track record remains outweighed by Europe\u2019s effectively handing the policing of one of its fundamental rights to a for-profit company.\u201cIs Google the right entity to have such power over these decisions?\u201d said Johannes Caspar, supervisor at the Hamburg data protection authority, the primary regulator in Germany that oversees American tech companies such as Alphabet, the parent company of Google, and Facebook. \u201cWe have to live by European law, and that says Google must decide.\u201dAdvertisement"}

To sum up the life of Bill Campbell, who died peacefully in his sleep this week with his family by his side, is a daunting and fundamentally impossible task - Bill&aposs life and accomplishments were so vast and varied that even those\n                                        who knew him best were only lucky enough to have witnessed a portion of them. Tributes to his astonishing legacy in Silicon Valley have already been pouring in, and rightly so. It is a legacy that is difficult to\n                                        fathom. He had a hand in almost every consequential technology company of the past 30 years, either through direct relationship or through his coaching and mentoring of the company&aposs key players, (and, in the\n                                        case of Intuit, Claris, and Go, through his own tenure as CEO). From Apple to Google to Amazon to Twitter, from his mentorship of the iconic venture capitalists who helped shape the Valley to his under-the-radar\n                                        involvement with legions of nerdy and unsexy companies barely known outside the tech community, but whose presences and innovations changed the technology landscape - Bill was always there, all smiles and hugs,\n                                        his essence embedded in the company&aposs DNA, pushing everyone involved to be better managers, more creative, and, most importantly, better people, to be the most authentic and truest versions of themselves. He\n                                        is probably best known for being \"the Coach,\" a mentor to legends; as the legends themselves would be the first to tell you, he was so much more than the sum of those he advised. He was himself a legend.\n                                        He was the legend. Bill was a man of beautiful and almost impossible contrasts. He was profane in a way that was unacceptable in many barrooms, let alone in church, and a devout Catholic who rarely missed Sunday\n                                        Mass. A workaholic who pushed himself and those around him beyond their natural and professional limits, and a devoted husband and quite possibly the best father in history, who never, no matter what momentous occasion\n                                        was on his schedule, missed an important event in his kids&apos lives. Famously honest and blunt (and sometimes even harsh), he would never hesitate to let you know when you were \"messing up\"; but when\n                                        you were messing up, he&aposd be the guy who&aposd answer your call at all hours of the night and, with inspiring patience and empathy, talk you through whatever mistakes you had made and how you were supposed\n                                        to rectify them. He preached teamwork and compassion and love. In many ways he seemed a throwback to a different era, a manly man, a jock&aposs jock, gruff, aggressive, macho, old-fashioned, and yet he was comfortable\n                                        and even thrived around dorks, dweebs, outcasts of all types- a \"nerd whisperer,\" as one journalist put it. His identity as \"the Coach\" was derived from both his general football-coaching demeanor\n                                        and his time as an actual football coach, with all the good and bad that that particular stereotype entails; he was a passionate advocate for the advancement of women in Silicon Valley and for the LGBT community.\n                                        He was never happier than at the annual 8th grade graduation at Sacred Heart Schools in Atherton, CA, when, year after year, a stream of students, boys and girls alike, would offer remembrances and speak movingly\n                                        of by far their most meaningful experience at the school: getting the chance to play flag football for Coach Campbell, absorbing the lessons he taught them, lessons that were, perhaps not surprisingly, essentially\n                                        identical to the lessons Coach had imparted to those he&aposd coached in the adult world. Teamwork. Structure. Integrity. Accountability. Passion. Hard work. Empathy. Love. Traits he&aposd learned growing up in\n                                        Homestead, PA, where he would end up donating millions of dollars to education and youth projects. A final common refrain about Bill: Everyone who knew Bill thought of him as their best friend. Bill was a people\n                                        person. He oozed charisma. When he talked to you he made you feel like you were the only person that mattered. It might be tempting for those who didn&apost know Bill that well to conclude that all this was just\n                                        some act. How could one person be so overflowing with joy, with the amount of joy and love requisite for connection with such a staggering number of people on such a profound level - Obviously it had to be an act.\n                                        It wasn&apost. He really did love people the way they loved him. New friends were made wherever he went. Often they were baristas, waiters, and, let&aposs face it, bartenders, people who didn&apost know initially\n                                        who he was and in some cases never would. He had friends in high and low places and everywhere in between. It was infectious. He was a uniter, he imparted his worldview onto his friends and mixed his groups of friends\n                                        together, so that friends in California became close with friends from Homestead and New York and elsewhere; wealthy friends grew to love friends who were less well off and vice versa; tech friends, academic friends,\n                                        and football friends were molded into one great big Bill Campbell group. Bill Campbell never saw wealth or social status or anything artificial when judging the merits of people. He sought in others the same qualities\n                                        he himself so fully embodied. Bill&aposs friends, and there were many, by definition embodied his values; he wouldn&apost have been friends with them if they hadn&apost. Bill Campbell really did believe that\n                                        everyone who lived by his values, friend or not, was fundamentally the same, of equal goodness, of equal worth. On this last point, sadly, he was somewhat mistaken. Indeed when you get down to it most people are\n                                        essentially the same, most of their differences are artificial. But Bill Campbell was better than everyone. And all of his friends are infinitely better off for having known him.

{"Headline": "F.C.C. Approves Broadband Subsidy for Low-Income Households", "Date": "2016-03-31", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Communications Commission on Thursday approved a $9.25 monthly broadband subsidy to help millions of low-income households connect to the Internet, in a move aimed at bridging the digital divide.The vote ensures that \u201cAmericans can access the dominant communications platform of the day,\u201d said Tom Wheeler, the chairman of the F.C.C.Starting in December, those eligible for programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and tribal and veterans benefits, will be able to apply for the subsidy. The funds can be used for wireless or fixed-wire broadband. The F.C.C. said it would aim to keep the budget of the subsidy program under $2.25 billion, money that is provided through line-item charges on wireless and Internet bills.Among the biggest concerns is how financially disadvantaged families are being strained by their inability to connect to the Internet at home. Seven out of 10 schools assign homework that requires Internet access, for example. Most jobs are posted online, and applications for employment are increasingly becoming online-only.\u201cThis meets the 21st-century needs for those most vulnerable,\u201d said Mignon Clyburn, a Democratic commissioner.The vote over the Lifeline plan was delayed for three hours because of back-and-forth between the two Republican commissioners and the three Democratic commissioners over the program\u2019s details. The Republican commissioners, who ultimately voted against the subsidy, said the F.C.C. needed to put a lower and hard cap on the Lifeline program\u2019s budget. Started in 1985 to bring phone services to low-income families, Lifeline later added subsidies for mobile phone services, but some homes started double-billing the program and the budget for the fund ballooned.\u201cThe commission\u2019s failure to clean up the waste, fraud and abuse in the program puts the entire enterprise in jeopardy,\u201d said Ajit Pai, a Republican F.C.C. commissioner.The F.C.C. plans to appoint a third-party administrator to check for double-billing or other instances of fraud.The agency\u2019s two Republican commissioners also voted against the broadband privacy rules, which have drawn strong protest from cable and telecom firms. But the three Democratic commissioners voted in favor, pushing the rules toward a monthslong period of public comments and consideration.Comcast has protested the agency\u2019s privacy proposal, pointing to several recent regulatory decisions that target Internet service providers. The company said that broadband providers had not harmed consumers by abusing their collection and sharing of data. Comcast also pointed to Google and Facebook as more concerning, saying those Internet companies are unregulated, even as their businesses rely on the collection of consumer data for targeted advertising.\u201cThe unfortunate result of the F.C.C.\u2019s extreme regulatory proposals will be more consumer confusion and less competition, and a bunch of collateral damage to innovation and investment along the way,\u201d said David Cohen, senior executive vice president at Comcast.Consumer advocacy groups cheered the vote for Lifeline.\u201cInexpensive options for access have dwindled, not grown,\u201d said Hannah Sassaman, a director at Media Mobilizing Project. \u201cA broadband subsidy for Lifeline will transform access to this basic human right in American cities, where such access is necessary to apply for even the lowest-wage jobs.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Bright Side to the Financial Stumbles of Digital Media", "Date": "2016-04-23", "News": "Supported byCreative DestructionIt is true that the outlook is not great. But there is a bright side: The shakeout may end up taking all the air out of a little bubble that had inflated in the media world. With less hype, we may get to see which new ways of doing things actually work and which don\u2019t. In fact, everything suggests that news consumers are going to get a product that is much more attuned to how they now find, read and discuss the news.So while Mashable, a website that recently announced cuts, BuzzFeed and others may not yet have found the secret sauce, many of the ingredients are there. Those will now be used, improved and added to new ingredients, in the hope of building news operations that can reach millions of readers with strong journalism while generating reliable profits.This probably isn\u2019t going to happen soon, and the news industry seems likely to continue to shrink over all in the near term, but the future need not be grim for innovative publishers that produce well-reported and engaging stories.The solution for this is not easy or cheap. It requires producing articles that are likely to start conversations on social media but also don\u2019t overpromise and then underdeliver.There are no shortcuts to producing such articles, but skilled social media editors with a nose for good stories that will also excel on Facebook, Twitter, Reddit and other digital hangouts can make a big difference. Many already have.Two years ago, the mobile apps for large newspapers mostly presented readers with simple lists of stories with dull headlines. Now they are far livelier, and play a role in driving readership and subscriptions higher.The pessimistic interpretation is that this shows how advertisers are shunning news websites in favor of social networks, and how publications will have to make painful compromises to gain a sliver of that advertising revenue. Some of that will happen. But in some ways the figure was also helpful. It showed that there is a huge amount of money flowing into the advertising-media complex. And the number should further persuade publications to accept reality and think harder about what they have to do \u2014 or, in some cases, stop doing \u2014 to gain more of that revenue.Being a successful news company in these times also requires something less fun: stringent management of resources. Revenues may take time to grow, so costs will have to be contained even as new things are attempted.New media companies, like any other fresh entrants to a sector, are prone to spending too much or underestimating the costs of expansion. They may make the same mistakes again as they pile deeper into video. Older media companies, because they enjoyed strong and dependable revenue for decades, never really developed a management culture that could nimbly deploy newsroom resources.Understanding exactly what\u2019s happening in the new media world is hampered by the lack of detailed data on how these companies are actually performing. They are private companies that don\u2019t have to report regular financial data. But the public stock market is flashing a signal that should give a little hope.The stock of News Corporation, the company that owns The Wall Street Journal and other newspapers, is trading at a multiple that is a substantially higher valuation \u2014 around 24 times expected earnings \u2014 than that of the wider market, which trades at around 18 times future earnings. (The New York Times Company stock has an above-market valuation, too, but it\u2019s bad form to use one\u2019s own employer as an example of an encouraging trend.) There are reasons not to read too much into the valuations, since they may be a temporary phenomenon that disappears as earnings catch up with investors\u2019 expectations.But investors would not be paying through the nose for older media companies if they did not think they could adapt to the harsh new environment.The public is discussing news like never before. The stock market thinks journalism has a future. Maybe those in the media will, too, someday.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Belgian Police Release New Video of Brussels Airport Suspect", "Date": "2016-04-07", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 The Belgian authorities released video footage on Thursday that retraced the steps of a man suspected of taking part in the March 22 bombing of the Brussels Airport and renewed their appeal to the public for help in identifying him.The Belgian authorities had already issued a wanted notice for the suspect, known as the \u201cman in the hat\u201d because of his appearance in a photograph that was released soon after the attacks.Belgian investigators are still working to identify the people who organized and carried out the attacks.But their task has been complicated by overlapping networks \u2014 some of the Brussels attackers have been linked to the November terrorist attacks in Paris \u2014 and by the use of fake identifications, meaning it is still unclear how many suspects were involved or are still on the run.In addition to the man in the hat, French and Belgian news media have reported that the police are looking for a man seen on surveillance footage alongside the subway bomber.The footage released on Thursday by the Belgian federal police, with French and Flemish voice-overs, provided a first look at how the man in the hat left the airport right after the bombings, and where he went.\u201cAfter the bombs exploded at 7:58, the man wearing a bright jacket and a hat went out of the building, walked past the Sheraton hotel, turned right toward the Avis car parking lot and left the airport area,\u201d the video commentary said.The video, using images from Google Maps, outlines the suspect\u2019s trajectory with a red dot. The surveillance footage shows him walking away from the airport in the midst of travelers and bystanders. Although at one point he can be seen jogging lightly, he appears to be walking at a normal pace most of the time.The suspect then walked through Zaventem, the town several miles northeast of Brussels where the airport is, and got rid of his jacket, according to the video commentary.\u201cThe jacket he left behind is bright, with a hood which is dark inside,\u201d the video said, providing close-up pictures of the clothing. \u201cShould this jacket be found, this might give invaluable information to the investigators.\u201dThe suspect was seen at 8:50 a.m. at the intersection of two roads in Zaventem, at which point he was wearing \u201ca bright shirt with rolled-up sleeves,\u201d which the police said appeared to be \u201cbright blue with yokes on the elbows.\u201d He was also wearing \u201cdark trousers and brown shoes with a large white sole,\u201d the video said.The suspect was then recorded by closed-circuit TV in Schaerbeek, a neighborhood of Brussels that is southwest of Zaventem \u2014 first at 9:42 a.m. and again at 9:49 a.m. He was last caught on camera at 9:50 a.m., at the intersection of the Avenue de la Braban\u00e7onne and the Rue du Noyer in Schaerbeek, according to the police video.The DNA of Najim Laachraoui, one of the Brussels Airport suicide bombers, was found in a rented apartment there on Rue Henri Berg\u00e9. Investigators believe the apartment was used as a place to make suicide vests for the Paris assailants.\u201cIf you saw a left-behind bright-colored jacket between the airport and the Chauss\u00e9e de Louvain,\u201d the narrator says, referring to a street that enters Schaerbeek, \u201cor if you saw the offender while he was on the run, or if you know which way he went afterward, please contact the investigators.\u201dThe Belgian federal prosecutor\u2019s office also made a series of announcements later on Thursday over cases that are not directly connected to the Brussels attacks, but that have underscored the complex array of networks and suspected terrorist plots currently being investigated in France and Belgium.The detention of a suspected accomplice of Mr. Abdeslam, who was arrested alongside him and has been identified as Amine Choukri, but also Soufien Ayari, was also extended, the prosecutor\u2019s office said.Separately, the police in Copenhagen arrested four men suspected of joining the Islamic State while in Syria, with the intention of committing terrorist crimes, the authorities said on Thursday.The men were detained in several different areas of the Danish capital around 10 a.m., said Mads Jensen, a spokesman for the Copenhagen police, as part of a joint operation with the Danish security services.He added that searches had been performed, and that ammunition and weapons had been seized. The suspects will be arraigned on Friday at a closed hearing.Lilia Blaise contributed reporting from Paris, and Christina Anderson from Copenhagen.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Satellite Images Can Pinpoint Poverty Where Surveys Can\u2019t", "Date": "2016-04-01", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewAn explosion of data has already changed how we market products and politicians. Now a similar innovation is beginning to change how we combat poverty around the world.Consider an unlikely problem: finding the poor. Even in a world riddled with poverty, nearly every government, nonprofit and aid agency struggles with this issue. Where in Kigali should the Rwandan health ministry place a new health clinic? Which rural districts in India should receive rice at subsidized prices? All these decisions require not just knowing poverty exists, but pinpointing areas of greatest need.These challenges make new kinds of data \u2014 information that can be gathered indirectly using algorithms and novel sources \u2014 particularly valuable. Google searches and Twitter and Facebook posts, which are very useful in the United States, are unlikely to help us in Kibera or Dhaka, Bangladesh. But the core idea behind these sources of data \u2014 measuring without asking people directly \u2014 can be enormously helpful.Take the case of measuring the most basic of economic variables: gross domestic product. The numbers can be unreliable in countries where the statistical infrastructure is weak, the informal businesses do not want to be tracked and the numbers may be manipulated. Morten Jerven, an economist at Simon Fraser University, argues in his book, \u201cPoor Numbers,\u201d that for many African countries the lack of quality data impedes development.It also shows a vast darkness between them, depicting the grim reality of North Korea, where night lighting is a rare luxury. If North Korea is experiencing an economic miracle, it is a purely daytime affair.There are many other important, unconventional sources of data. Consider cellphones. For most of the world\u2019s poor, each call and text has a very noticeable and real monetary cost.We are beginning to see tangible benefits. For example, GiveDirectly, a nonprofit group that gives cash to the poor, now uses satellite imagery to identify villages where thatched roofs signal that they may need help. \u201cRemote sensing data can be powerful, especially when combined with cheap classification tools like crowdsourcing or machine learning,\u201d says Paul Niehaus, co-founder of the organization. \u201cThey\u2019ve let us strip cost and time out of the process.\u201dSome of these projects are about changing how we use old sources of data. Typically we take surveys to determine which variables are most correlated with poverty, such as having a thatched roof or a dirt floor or not having a toilet. These variables are then added up to form a score that ranks households. Those with the highest rank may be deemed eligible for help, whether it is a microloan, a food subsidy or a cash transfer.But this kind of simple score card does not take advantage of the latest technologies. For example, in the United States, modern credit scoring agencies do not simply add a few variables. They use predictive algorithms to scour data for complex relationships most associated with default, which are then combined into a tailored prediction of credit risk. Why should the financial services industry, where mere dollars are at stake, be using more advanced technologies than the aid industry, where human life is at stake?A winning World Bank Innovation Challenge project, with which I collaborated, aims to close this gap. Melissa Adelman, an economist at the World Bank and one of the lead researchers in our project, says: \u201cExisting surveys may contain much more information for poverty measurement than is actually used. We\u2019re exploring how many more of the poor could be identified and targeted for services by using machine-learning tools. It\u2019s exciting because those better algorithms are essentially free to use, so the benefit-to-cost ratio of any gain in targeting will be very large.\u201dAll of these efforts improve efficiency. It doesn\u2019t sound very romantic: Costs go down and accuracy goes up. Typically, efficiency gains like these excite only technocrats. But when these improvements truly help the neediest, all of us should be excited.SENDHIL MULLAINATHAN is the Robert C. Waggoner Professor of Economics at Harvard.Advertisement"}

It was her first film and my first film, too \u2014 and we were taking a leap of faith together.\u201dFor Ms. Hightower \u2014 a Cincinnati native and experienced dancer whose acting mainly had been limited to recreating scenes from the \u201cChucky\u201d horror films (\u201cHe\u2019s fun, and he\u2019s so scary,\u201d she said. \u201cI like scary.\u201d) \u2014 the hardest part of the film was pretending to be a bad dancer. \u201cAfter you\u2019ve been a dancer for so long, it\u2019s hard to act like you don\u2019t know how to dance,\u201d she said.In the film, which also stars Alexis Neblett, her charming, more bubbly stepsister, dancers begin suffering inexplicable \u201cfits\u201d: full-body spasms that leave them writhing on the floor. Is it the water? A contagion? A mass psychosis? As the audience tries to figure it out, so does Toni. And so did Ms. Hightower.The thoughtful young actress said she still can\u2019t explain what caused the events of the film. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was scary, even though I know it wasn\u2019t real.\u201d\u2018Little Men\u2019In \u201cLittle Men,\u201d directed by Ira Sachs, 14-year-old Michael Barbieri plays Tony, a big-city kid with a huge personality and even bigger dreams.\u201cTony\u2019s very similar to me actually,\u201d Mr. Barbieri said confidently, in a New York Italian accent so thick it sounds the way home-cooked lasagna smells. \u201cHis goal is to get into LaGuardia High School for the performing arts, and that was my goal, too. And I got in.\u201dIn this acutely naturalistic indie (opening July 15), Mr. Barbieri\u2019s Tony is a Brooklyn kid whose friendship with his new buddy Jake is imperiled when Jake\u2019s parents, as new landlords, threaten to triple his mother\u2019s rent. Jake, played by the wide-eyed Theo Taplitz, is a sensitive artist. Tony is a charismatic fast-talker, determined to become a star. In real life, Mr. Barbieri, who will attend LaGuardia next year, grew up downtown and fell for acting after playing the Grinch in a play at Our Lady of Pompeii School in Manhattan.\u201cI\u2019ve been told that I was a bit of a brat, and the Grinch was not the nicest person,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it was really fun to get laughs from the crowd and the teachers. I won\u2019t never forget it.\u201dOn the website of the method-acting school, he read course descriptions he didn\u2019t entirely understand at the time and saw the faces of some of his favorite actors: Robert De Niro and Al Pacino.

The acting is amazing.\u201dMr. Sachs discovered Mr. Barbieri through the school and clearly sensed that he had found not only a talented young actor but also a character. Mr. Sachs even wrote in a scene of Mr. Barbieri and his instructor, in which they scream at each other in an ever-escalating acting exercise.\u2018Southside With You\u2019In the summer of 1989, the 28-year-old legal intern Barack Obama had the audacity to hope that his senior colleague Michelle Robinson would say \u201cYes we can\u201d to a first date. Though the future first lady would later debate the technical precision of the word \u201cdate,\u201d she did elect to meet this bold young man on a Saturday afternoon. That meeting turned into an all-day ramble through Chicago, from the Art Institute to a screening of \u201cDo the Right Thing,\u201d and now it has been turned into an improbably moving movie.\u201cHe always had a bit of swagger,\u201d said Parker Sawyers, who plays the president to be, opposite Tika Sumpter\u2019s charming Michelle, in the writer-director Richard Tanne\u2019s \u201cSouthside With You\u201d (Aug. 26). \u201cA nerdy swagger, but a bit of swagger.\u201d\u201cIt started with a full-on impersonation, like playing basketball and working on Michael Jordan\u2019s fadeaway,\u201d Mr. Sawyers explained, noting that he began with the present-day Obama. \u201cOnce I had a mean fadeaway, I worked backward to figure out his qualities, to whittle it back down and figure out why he does \u2026 the things \u2026 he does \u2026 like pauses.\u201dIn the actor\u2019s savvy interpretation, the pauses are the signs of a multitasking mind at work. \u201cI think he\u2019s actually thinking about so many things at once and trying to whittle it down in those pauses,\u201d Mr. Sawyers said. \u201cI wanted to be thinking about something else and making myself focus when I was talking to Michelle.\u201dMr. Sawyers\u2019s ease with the part might relate to his upbringing. Born in Indiana, he was raised by his mother, Indianapolis\u2019s first female deputy mayor, and father, an educator who died in 2006. Parker Sawyers later worked for the prosecutor in Marion County. He began acting in 2011, in films like \u201cZero Dark Thirty.\u201d Besides appearing in Oliver Stone\u2019s coming \u201cSnowden,\u201d he is filming a pilot, \u201cMiranda\u2019s Rights,\u201d a \u201ckind of a law version of \u2018Grey\u2019s Anatomy.\u2019\u201dDespite the film\u2019s lack of overt political content, Mr. Sawyers knows his warm portrait of President Obama might invite controversy. \u201cIf people want to hate-watch it, I don\u2019t mind,\u201d he said. \u201cGo buy the ticket!\u201d\u2018Indignation\u2019Raised in Toronto, Ms. Gadon, a star of \u201cIndignation,\u201d opening July 29, began acting at the age of 10, but her parents refused to let her take a regular role on a television series and insisted that she finish school. So, as Ms. Gadon began to act, she also attended performing arts schools and completed a college degree in cinema studies. \u201cI really fell in love with auteur filmmaking,\u201d she said. \u201cI was lucky that my first major roles were with David Cronenberg and Denis Villeneuve, and I was able to really focus on films with strong directors.\u201dWith Mr. Cronenberg as something of a mentor, Ms. Gadon, now 29, has carved out unusual roles for herself as an actress of restrained, sometimes eerie, precision and intensity, in films like Mr. Cronenberg\u2019s \u201cCosmopolis\u201d and \u201cMaps to the Stars,\u201d as well as \u201cAntiviral,\u201d by his son, Brandon Cronenberg, and Mr. Villeneuve\u2019s \u201cEnemy.\u201d Most recently, she appeared in the Hulu series \u201c11.22.63\u201d opposite James Franco.In \u201cIndignation,\u201d which James Schamus adapted from Philip Roth\u2019s novel, Ms. Gadon plays Olivia, a beautiful blond student who becomes more than just the object of a young Jewish man\u2019s affection.

{"Headline": "Microsoft Sues Justice Department to Protest Electronic Gag Order Statute", "Date": "2016-04-14", "News": "Supported byBig technology companies have usually played a defensive game with government prosecutors in their legal fight over customer information, fighting or bowing to requests for information one case at a time.But now, in a move that could broaden the debate over the balance between customer privacy and law enforcement needs, Microsoft is going on the offense.The software giant is suing the Justice Department, challenging its frequent use of secrecy orders that prevent Microsoft from telling people when the government obtains a warrant to read their emails.In its suit, filed Thursday morning in Federal District Court in Seattle, Microsoft\u2019s home turf, the company asserts that the gag order statute in the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 \u2014 as employed today by federal prosecutors and the courts \u2014 is unconstitutional.The statute, according to Microsoft, violates the Fourth Amendment right of its customers to know if the government searches or seizes their property, and it breaches the company\u2019s First Amendment right to speak to its customers.Microsoft\u2019s suit, unlike Apple\u2019s fight with the Federal Bureau of Investigation over access to a locked iPhone, is not attached to a single case. Instead, it is intended to challenge the legal process regarding secrecy orders.The company is also trying to fuel a public debate about the frequent use of secrecy orders in government investigations and, in the process, portray itself as an advocate of its customers\u2019 privacy. The suit itself could plod through the courts, with appeals going on for months or even years.Emily Pierce, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, said officials were \u201creviewing the filing.\u201dMicrosoft is drawing attention to legal issues that have become more acute as tech companies move their customers\u2019 personal and business information into so-called cloud computing systems. The largest such digital storehouses of personal email and documents are operated by big tech companies like Microsoft, Google and Apple.Seizing information from file drawers or personal computers used to require entering a building to examine paper or a hard drive. Typically, the target of an investigation knew about it.Not so in the cloud computing era, when investigators can bypass an individual and go straight to the company that hosts that information. And when courts issue secrecy orders, often with no time limit, a target may never know that information was taken.Microsoft, in its suit, contends that the government has \u201cexploited the transition to cloud computing as a means of expanding its power to conduct secret investigations.\u201dIn an interview, Bradford L. Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president and chief legal officer, said, \u201cPeople should not lose their rights just because they are storing their information in the cloud.\u201dMicrosoft, like Google and Apple, fields thousands of requests a year from federal and state prosecutors for customer information. The companies issue periodic reports with the totals.But, Mr. Smith said, it was the rising portion of gag orders attached to the information warrants that led to the suit. From September 2014 to March 2016, Microsoft received 5,624 federal demands in the United States for customer information or data. Nearly half \u2014 2,576 \u2014 were accompanied by secrecy orders.Mr. Smith called the growing share of secrecy orders \u201cfairly shocking,\u201d suggesting they had become a routine process rather than an exception.The suit positions Microsoft as a champion of its customers\u2019 privacy and draws attention to a legal process many may not be aware of.\u201cMost people do think of their email as their personal property, wherever it happens to reside,\u201d said A. Michael Froomkin, a law professor at the University of Miami. \u201cBut there is a disconnect between behavior and expectations and the statute. And Microsoft is inviting a court to bring the law in line with people\u2019s expectations.\u201dBeyond image-burnishing, the suit is a pragmatic attempt to move away from litigating cases one by one, which is costly and time-consuming.\u201cMicrosoft is going on offense, but they\u2019re kind of forced into it,\u201d Mr. Froomkin said.Judges grant the secrecy orders. Microsoft sees only the warrant for the information demanded and not the argument made by the prosecutors to justify a gag order. But the Microsoft legal team looked at the high percentage of secrecy orders granted in the year and a half through March of this year, and concluded that prosecutors often relied on a vague standard that there was a \u201creason to believe\u201d that disclosure might hinder an investigation.Microsoft, Mr. Smith said, \u201creadily recognizes that nondisclosure orders are appropriate and necessary\u201d when there is a risk of endangering a person\u2019s life or that crucial evidence may be destroyed, for example. \u201cWhat concerns us is the low standard the government has to bear and the absence of a time limit,\u201d Mr. Smith added.About two-thirds of the secrecy orders Microsoft received in the span it audited had no time limits. In the physical world, so-called sneak-and-peek warrants for secret searches are granted to look at documents without notifying a target. But most secrecy orders delay notification for a fixed period of time, typically 30 to 90 days, and detailed evidence is required for any extensions.Microsoft, Mr. Smith said, has talked to other major tech companies, and others may join with briefs in support of Microsoft.In addition to challenging the Justice Department and the courts, Microsoft is trying to prod Congress into looking at the issue. In both the House of Representatives and the Senate, legislation has been proposed to reform the Electronic Communications Privacy Act. But Mr. Smith said he saw little prospect of any substantive action in Congress anytime soon.\u201cWe\u2019ll keep taking these ideas to the Justice Department, Congress and the courts,\u201d Mr. Smith said.Advertisement"}

The reason is her r\u00e9sum\u00e9: Nearly 30 years before she worked for foreign companies in China, Ms. Chen served a stint in the Chinese military. After that, she was involved in a joint venture that was partly owned by the country\u2019s powerful domestic security ministry.Like many foreign-owned Internet services, Twitter has long been blocked in China. But Ms. Chen\u2019s appointment \u2014 and the stir it has caused \u2014 shows the complicated relationship between Twitter, the technology industry and China. The country has some of the world\u2019s strictest limits on online expression, and it requires Internet companies to place servers in the mainland. It has shown little compunction about blocking or banning companies that will not play along.Twitter has become an online home to a number of Chinese political activists abroad, who use it to communicate with one another and to share their views of current events in China with the world. Some of them reacted with condemnation over the weekend to Ms. Chen\u2019s appointment.In a statement, Dickson Seow, a Twitter spokesman, said that after college in the late 1980s, Ms. Chen was assigned by the Chinese government to become a junior engineer in the People\u2019s Liberation Army. She left in 1994, when the opening of the Chinese economy provided a chance, the statement said.She then was hired by Computer Associates, an American company, to lead its joint venture in China. The Chinese Ministry of Public Security owned a 20 percent stake in that venture through a local company, the statement said, and Ms. Chen focused on selling antivirus products and never worked for the ministry itself. According to her LinkedIn biography, she worked for Microsoft from 2005 to 2009 and for Cisco from 2009 to 2013, before returning to Microsoft.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ford and Google Team Up to Support Driverless Cars", "Date": "2016-04-27", "News": "Supported byDETROIT \u2014 In an unusual alliance between a traditional automaker and a technology company, Ford Motor and Google on Wednesday joined to lead a coalition of companies that advocate federal approval of driverless cars in the near future.By teaming up to promote regulations that favor fully-autonomous vehicles, Ford and Google may be moving toward closer cooperation on the actual development of driverless models.Ford\u2019s chief executive, Mark Fields, has said in recent months that his company is evaluating potential partnerships with other firms on autonomous vehicles, but has not made any formal moves in that direction.Still, by forming a public policy coalition that includes Google, Ford is aligning with Silicon Valley\u2019s most prominent supporter of cars that can operate without a driver.The group, which calls itself the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets, presented testimony on Wednesday at a hearing on autonomous vehicles held by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.The hearing was the second conducted by the federal agency as it tries to develop national guidelines for the use of autonomous cars on American roadways.In January, the Obama administration said it hoped to expedite regulatory guidelines for autonomous vehicles and to invest in research to help bring them to market.While Google has been at the forefront in testing driverless models, many mainstream automakers like Ford are also accelerating development of a wide range of autonomous vehicles.At Wednesday\u2019s hearing at Stanford University in California, the nation\u2019s top auto safety regulator, Mark Rosekind, said the federal government was hopeful that driverless technology could help reduce the annual death toll from traffic accidents. In 2014, the last year for which data was available, 32,675 people died in auto accidents.Mr. Rosekind said that more than 90 percent of vehicle accidents every year were the result of decisions made by drivers at the wheel \u2014 and self-driving technology had the potential to prevent at least some of those accidents.\u201cWe are focused on promoting safety innovation that can do the most to save lives,\u201d he said.Automakers are already putting some self-driving features, like automatic braking and steering, in current models. But the coalition led by Ford and Google is urging swift passage of regulations that allow for totally autonomous vehicles.In addition to Ford and Google, the coalition includes the Swedish carmaker Volvo and the ride-sharing firms Lyft and Uber. The spokesman for the group is David Strickland, a predecessor of Mr. Rosekind\u2019s as the head of the safety agency.\u201cThere are policy issues and inconsistencies in the regulatory environment today that could greatly delay deployment or possibly deny full self driving from many that could benefit from its promise,\u201d Mr. Strickland said at the hearing.A Ford spokeswoman, Christin Baker, said Ford\u2019s involvement with Google was not an indication that the two companies were working together on a driverless car.\u201cThe five founding members of the coalition are focused on public policy issues,\u201d Ms. Baker said. \u201cThat\u2019s the mission of the group.\u201dOther carmakers, including General Motors and Toyota, testified separately at the hearing. A Toyota official, in particular, suggested that regulators hold off on setting requirements for self-driving technology until it was introduced in the market.Other groups that expressed support for self-driving cars included those speaking for disabled persons who cannot operate a vehicle, and Mothers Against Drunk Driving, which noted that driverless cars could reduce the number of accidents that involve alcohol consumption.At an earlier hearing, some consumer groups warned that driverless cars had not been perfected in testing environments. One group, Consumer Watchdog, said that future regulations should require that a licensed driver was present and able to take control of a vehicle if autonomous technology failed to operate safely.Advertisement"}

Says It Needs Hackers to Keep Up With Tech Companies", "Date": "2016-04-19", "News": "Supported byAmy Hess, the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s executive assistant director for science and technology, made the comments at a hearing by members of Congress who are debating potential legislation on encryption. The lawmakers gathered law enforcement authorities and Silicon Valley company executives to discuss the issue, which has divided technology companies and officials in recent months and spurred a debate over privacy and security.Yet that has done little to quell the controversy. The encryption debate has continued with new hearings, proposed legislation and other cases that involve locked iPhones and law enforcement demands that the devices be opened to aid investigations.In Tuesday\u2019s hearing, Ms. Hess did not provide details on how the F.B.I. ultimately gained access to the San Bernardino iPhone but said the agency had come to rely on private sector partners to keep up with changes in technology. She said that there was no one-stop solution and that the agency generally should not use third parties to hack into systems but lacks the expertise to break past encryption.\u201cThese types of solutions that we may employ require a lot of highly skilled, specialized resources that we may not have immediately available to us,\u201d Ms. Hess said.The focus on third parties at the hearing illustrates a growing discomfort by some in Congress and in the tech industry with the use of \u201cgray hat\u201d hackers, who are hackers who may push the boundaries of the law and anger companies but whose intentions are not malicious.\u201cI don\u2019t think relying on a third party is a good model,\u201d said Representative Diana DeGette, a Democrat from Colorado. She questioned if the use of third-party hackers was ethical and whether it could open up greater security risks because sensitive and valuable data could be accessible to outside groups.Ms. Hess did not answer directly when asked about whether there were ethical issues in using third-party hackers but said the bureau needed to review its operation \u201cto make sure that we identify the risks and benefits.\u201d The F.B.I. has been unwilling to say whom it paid to demonstrate a way around the iPhone\u2019s internal defenses, or how much, and it has not shown Apple the technique.Apple\u2019s general counsel, Bruce Sewell, said at the hearing that encryption did not prevent the authorities from solving crimes.\u201cAs you heard from our colleagues in law enforcement, they have the perception that encryption walls off information to them,\u201d Mr. Sewell said. \u201cBut technologists and national security experts don\u2019t see the world that way. We see a data-rich world that seems to be full of information. Information that law enforcement can use to solve \u2014 and prevent \u2014 crimes.\u201dLaw enforcement officials testifying before the committee on Tuesday expressed frustration over their inability to run a number of cases to ground \u2014 particularly sex abuse and child pornography cases \u2014 because of encrypted phones. They said the recent publicity over the issue could end up helping criminals.\u201cMake no mistake \u2014 criminals are listening to this testimony and learning from it,\u201d said Charles Cohen, commander of the Indiana Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force.The F.B.I. said there has been an increase in the number of devices it has acquired through investigations but was unable to gain access to because of encryption. Ms. Hess said that since October, 13 percent of the devices obtained by the F.B.I. were impenetrable by the agency. When asked at Tuesday\u2019s hearing if the relationship between the tech industry and law enforcement had become adversarial, Ms. Hess responded, \u201cI hope not.\u201dTech companies, which have largely banded together in support of Apple\u2019s pro-encryption position, are lobbying against the draft bill.Timed to the Tuesday hearing, trade groups representing top technology companies including Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft sent a letter to Senators Burr and Feinstein, opposing their bill.\u201cWe believe it is critical to the safety of the nation\u2019s, and the world\u2019s, information technology infrastructure for us all to avoid actions that will create government-mandated security vulnerabilities in our encryption systems,\u201d the groups, which include the Reform Government Surveillance and Computer and Communications Industry Association, said. \u201cAny mandatory decryption requirement, such as that included in the discussion draft of the bill that you authored, will to lead to unintended consequences.\u201dMichael Petricone, senior vice president for government affairs at the Consumer Technology Association, added, \u201cThis is urgent because the one thing you don\u2019t want is Congress coming in a knee-jerk fashion and doing something with all sorts of negative consequences, which is what we may be seeing happen now.\u201dPresident Obama has done little to assuage concerns by the tech industry. In a speech in March, the president warned against \u201cfetishizing\u201d encryption and urged more compromise between tech companies and the F.B.I.Advertisement"}

The three, who work in either government or the private sector, spoke on the condition of anonymity.The charges, known formally as a statement of objections, may be announced in Brussels as soon as Wednesday, though the announcement could still be postponed until later this month, according to one of the people.The expected charges against Google are the latest in a raft of regulatory problems that American tech giants have faced as the European Union has cracked down on these companies\u2019 perceived dominance over how people in the 28-member bloc get access to digital services.Google denies that it has breached the region\u2019s tough competition laws, and it will have several months to respond to the charges from the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union.\u201cAnyone can use Android with or without Google applications,\u201d Mark Jansen, a Google spokesman, said in a statement when asked about the company\u2019s mobile software. \u201cHardware manufacturers and carriers can decide how to use Android, and consumers have the last word about which apps they want to use on their devices.\u201dA spokesman for the European Commission declined to comment.Despite the company\u2019s denials, the expected charges linked to Android, which powers 77 percent of European smartphones, would represent a major setback for the Silicon Valley company as it grapples with a growing number of global competition investigations into Google\u2019s vast operations.Canadian authorities, though, said on Tuesday that they had closed their investigation into claims that Google had misused its dominant position in online search. They added they would continue monitoring the company\u2019s activities.Apple continues to generate the largest share of revenue from global smartphone sales. The company also bundles its own services, including digital maps, into its mobile software, but has yet to face similar questions over whether it has broken Europe\u2019s antitrust rules.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.If European officials demand that the company provide rivals greater access to the Android universe \u2014 a possibility if Google is found to have broken the region\u2019s laws \u2014 the search giant may find it more difficult to promote its own mobile services to users worldwide as well as to smartphone makers.As part of the charges to be announced as soon as Wednesday, Margrethe Vestager, Europe\u2019s antitrust chief, is expected to focus on Google\u2019s deals with cellphone manufacturers that include bundles of Google services included in Android.Speaking in Amsterdam on Monday, Ms. Vestager said that these deals may have hindered competition by forcing cellphone manufacturers to rely on Google\u2019s mobile services that come preinstalled on certain versions of the Android software.\u201cOur concern is that, by requiring phone makers and operators to preload a set of Google apps, rather than letting them decide for themselves which apps to load, Google might have cut off one of the main ways that new apps can reach customers,\u201d Ms. Vestager said ahead of the charges being announced.The case related to Google\u2019s Android operating system has been long expected.These companies say that they have been financially hurt by Google practices that they call unfair, an accusation the company rejects.\u201cConsumers deserve more choice and innovation in mobile devices and applications,\u201d said Thomas Vinje, a lawyer for FairSearch. \u201cA statement of objections in the Android case would be an important step forward for competition and consumers.\u201dGoogle says that its partnerships with cellphone makers that rely on its operating system are voluntary, and that these relationships offer benefits to consumers as well as manufacturers.In February, Mr. Pichai traveled to Brussels to meet with Ms. Vestager and other European politicians, including G\u00fcnther Oettinger, a German politician in charge of the digital economy in the bloc. Eric E. Schmidt, Alphabet\u2019s executive chairman, has also been a regular visitor to Europe, meeting often with regional officials, in part to discuss the company\u2019s continuing antitrust problems.Now, Google faces mounting pressure over accusations it abused its position in everything from online search to its Android operating system. And it is the turn of Mr. Pichai, along with other Google executives, to respond.An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of Europe\u2019s antitrust chief. She is Margrethe Vestager, not Margrethre.Advertisement"}

Our economy depends on it. But how often do we think about how it all works, how it\u2019s funded, whether there are public safety concerns, whether new innovations are on the horizon?As more people move to urban areas like New York City, where an additional half million people are expected to arrive in the coming decades, how will our aging infrastructure cope with increased demand?New York 101 was incubated in a series of memos with Mike Luo, the deputy Metro editor, and over drinks, coffees and lunches with colleagues on the Metro desk.We wanted to create a new beat that would break out of traditional coverage areas (transportation, schools, crime) \u2014 and out of an 800-word print box.It comes down to this: If it makes readers anywhere in the world pause to contemplate the hidden mechanics of New York, then it\u2019s a good fit.After doing some preliminary reporting, I created a high-fidelity, seven-step outline in a Google Doc using images and graphics of the aqueducts, ultraviolet treatment facility, watershed maps and other elements of the system. I then approached Andrew Kueneman and Matt Ruby on the digital design team, and we talked through a few format and platform options.Gradually, the photos and maps in my Google Doc were replaced with Josh\u2019s sketches, and I puzzled out how to fit centuries of history, engineering, science and politics into 50- to 150-word nuggets.It was like editing a magazine story down to a haiku. Mike Luo and I chopped and chopped to fit the words on the digital page.The result was a multi-step story that distilled the process, with an interactive twist.So far, I\u2019ve produced three other packages for the New York 101 series:And I met Vijay Rao, the chief operator at Hillview Reservoir.

{"Headline": "How You\u2019re Making Facebook a Money Machine", "Date": "2016-04-29", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsWhat you do when waiting for the bus or avoiding work goes a long way to explaining a tectonic shift in business and media.In such moments you are most likely checking Facebook. More of you will be doing that than tweeting, searching on Google, checking stock prices on Yahoo or reading articles like this. And that constant lure, a fix you can easily satisfy both on a phone and a desktop computer, explains why Facebook is pulling ahead of every other large technology company right now.Your addiction is making Facebook astonishingly profitable. Put a little more kindly, your emotional and intellectual interactions on the social network are creating a great place for companies to advertise.What this means in dollars and cents for Facebook can be seen in numbers contained in its first-quarter financial results, released on Wednesday. For the United States and Canada, Facebook pulled in $11.86 in advertising revenue per user in the first quarter. That\u2019s what advertisers are willing to pay to catch your attention as you argue with your friends and relatives over Donald Trump or coo over baby pictures or both.Facebook\u2019s revenue was up over 50 percent from a year earlier, while its net income soared nearly 200 percent. Its stock leapt on Thursday as the wider market fell. Facebook\u2019s blowout financial performance stood out because Apple, Twitter and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, all reported disappointing first-quarter numbers.Facebook is doing well because it occupies a huge sweet spot in the connected world, perhaps an even bigger one than Google owns.But people apparently hang around on Facebook far longer. According to SimilarWeb, users spent just over 17 minutes on the social network on average in March, well ahead of the nine minutes for Google (these figures don\u2019t accurately reflect how active people are on the sites, but you can still see the difference.)Google has long enjoyed a big advantage in the battle for online advertising revenue because users are more likely to click on an ad for something they are searching for. But even though Facebook users are not usually on the network to buy something, the sticky way in which they engage once there makes it an attractive place to advertise.Another advantage for Facebook is that its costs are lower than Google\u2019s, which helps it make more money out of every dollar of revenue. In the 12 months through March, Facebook\u2019s operating profit was equivalent to 37 percent of its revenue; at Google it was 26 percent. Facebook is in the enviable position of spending less to bring in revenue that is growing more quickly than Google\u2019s.Pundits made a big deal this week about how Facebook excelled as Apple stumbled. But there was a warning for Facebook in Apple\u2019s results. Apple has relied heavily on one product \u2014 the iPhone \u2014 for much of its revenue, so when sales of the device slowed, there was little Apple could do to keep growing. Facebook is even more reliant on a single element: advertising revenue. If people spend markedly less time on Facebook \u2014 because an enticing new network comes along, for example \u2014 the company\u2019s revenue growth could slow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Give Us a King!", "Date": "2016-04-30", "News": "Supported byEVERY era gets the heroic founding father it deserves, and thanks to Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s celebrated musical, ours has Alexander Hamilton \u2014 the immigrant striver, the political genius, and of course, the closet monarchist.And that legacy is at work in the current political moment. Executive-branch Caesarism has been raised to new heights by the last two presidents, and important parts of the country have responded by upping the ante, and \u2014 like ancient Israelites in the Book of Samuel \u2014 basically clamoring for a king.That clamor is loudest from the Trumpistas and their dear leader. Donald Trump is clearly running to be an American caudillo, not the president of a constitutional republic, and his entire campaign is a cult of personality in the style of (the pro-Trump) Vladimir Putin.But the response to Trump is equally telling. The alleged wise men of the center keep imagining that the problem with Trumpism is just its vulgarity and race-baiting, and that a benevolent technocrat could step in and lead the country out of gridlock and polarization, into the broad, sunlit uplands of reform.Michael Bloomberg sensibly recused himself from this role. But the dream lives on, most recently in the former Politico executive editor Jim VandeHei\u2019s Wall Street Journal op-ed urging the formation of an \u201cInnovation Party,\u201d to be led by our Facebook-Google overlords and our best military minds.VandeHei\u2019s piece was deservedly mocked on political Twitter, but his impatience with the two-party system as we know it is shared across the country\u2019s upper class, from Silicon Valley to the (ahem, Hamiltonian) world of finance.Tellingly, none of these Trump-era enthusiasms involve a reinvigoration of congressional prerogatives or a renewed push for federalism and states\u2019 rights.Quite the reverse: They all imagine that the solution to our problems lies with a more effective and still-more-empowered president, free from antique constitutional limits and graced with a mandate that transcends partisanship.And equally tellingly, they are enthusiasms of the center-left and center-right rather than the ideological extremes. This is obviously true of the people pining for a Bloomberg era, a Silicon Valley-led administration, or a Mattis man-on-horseback presidency. But it\u2019s true of Trump\u2019s constituency as well: While the G.O.P.\u2019s staunch ideologues are mostly voting for Ted Cruz, Trump is winning with Northeastern moderates and blue-collar populists, with voters who may be xenophobic but on many issues are closer to the political middle than to the poles.It\u2019s not that our ideologues are averse to an imperial presidency when their side is in charge. (The theory of Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign assumed a rather \u2026 remarkable level of presidential influence.) But the cult of the presidency is clearly strongest in the American center. This means that political polarization probably isn\u2019t pushing us toward a Weimar moment, in which the only question is whether the far right or far left consolidates a dangerous level of power. Instead it\u2019s encouraging a kind of moderate-middle enthusiasm for crown government, as a means of escape from congressional dysfunction and endless right-left war.The good news for the republic is that this center is itself complex and divided, over specific issues like trade and immigration and then along lines of class and culture. The Bloombergist upper-class moderates fear the Trumpist working-class moderates, and Trump\u2019s middle-American populists loathe the globalist elite right back. As long as that\u2019s the case it\u2019s hard to imagine them finding a centrist Caesar to actually unite behind. (Though they are united in their admiration for the military ...)But even if the risk of a true post-constitutional power grab is low, the arc of our history still bends toward a Trumpian conception of the presidency, which means the limits on its power will probably continue to erode \u2014 justified in the name of pragmatism, of Hamiltonian energy, of the need to \u201cget things done.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll be back, time will tell, you\u2019ll remember that I served you well,\u201d George III sings to his rebellious subjects in \u201cHamilton.\u201dWe still might prove him right.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Amateur vs. ISIS: A Car Salesman Investigates and Ends Up in Prison", "Date": "2016-04-23", "News": "Supported byWYOMING, Del. \u2014 By his own account, Toby Lopez was a supremely ordinary guy. He sold Toyotas and lived with his mother in a tidy rancher here with a cherry tree out front. He was proud that he could connect with customers \u2014 anyone from a Superior Court judge to, as he put it, \u201cRedneck Bill from down on the farm.\u201d What passed for excitement was the time his young niece won a beauty contest and he chauffeured her in a red Corvette in a local parade.Then a high school friend was killed in Afghanistan, and the Islamic State began beheading American journalists. Horrified, Mr. Lopez heard on CNN one day in the fall of 2014 that the Islamic State was active on Twitter, and he went online to see what he could find. \u201cI was intrigued,\u201d said Mr. Lopez, 42. \u201cWhat could they possibly be saying on Twitter?\u201dWhat followed was a radical break from his humdrum life. He was pulled into the murky world of Internet jihadists, sparring with them from his office at the car dealership and late into the night at home. Before long, he was talking for hours on Skype with a man who claimed \u2014 falsely, as it would turn out \u2014 to be a top ISIS military commander, trying to negotiate the release of hostages. Mr. Lopez contacted the F.B.I. and began a testy relationship with counterterrorism agents who came to believe he might pose a danger. In the end, he landed in federal prison, where he was held for nearly 14 months without trial.The story of one man\u2019s deepening obsession with a terrorist group is a reminder of how the Internet provides easy portals to distant, sometimes dangerous worlds. It shows the complications for law enforcement agents who confront an overeager amateur encroaching on their turf.But it also underscores how lost a person can feel inside the criminal justice system. Deprived of his freedom, his sanity in question, Mr. Lopez found himself without a legal advocate he trusted or access to evidence he believed could free him.The hundreds of emails, text messages and recorded Skype calls that Mr. Lopez saved show him growing more and more frantic when F.B.I. agents did not see things his way. Believing American hostages\u2019 lives were at stake, he sent an agent 80 increasingly overheated messages in 10 days. In one, he declared, \u201cJust remember whatever ends up happening to you \u2026 You deserved it,\u201d and added an expletive. On Feb. 11, 2015, a dozen police and F.B.I. cars surrounded the house with the cherry tree, arrested Mr. Lopez and charged him with transmitting a threat.He was shuttled among federal facilities in Pennsylvania, New York, Oklahoma and North Carolina. Without access to his records, prison psychologists assumed his tales of talking to Islamic State members were fiction, symptoms of a mental illness that made him incompetent to stand trial. Prosecutors sought a hearing to decide whether he should be forcibly medicated.The defense finally obtained a third mental health evaluation \u2014 the first one by a psychologist who had actually reviewed Mr. Lopez\u2019s voluminous files. It found him competent, and he was released on bail late last month.\u201cWithout having the documents,\u201d Kirk Heilbrun, a Drexel University psychologist, wrote in his March 2 evaluation, \u201cI would have concluded that his account of this entire series of events sounded both grandiose and delusional. Having reviewed these documents, however, I would not describe his account as delusional.\u201dOn Friday, the United States attorney\u2019s office in Delaware said it had taken the \u201cexceedingly rare\u201d step of dropping the charges. \u201cWe have not hesitated to do so when the facts and law support such a decision,\u201d a statement said.In an interview last week, Mr. Lopez\u2019s voice broke as he described his prison ordeal. \u201cNobody deserves to get dragged through what I got dragged through, along with my family,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s sad that when someone does something with righteous intentions and gets treated by the government this way.\u201dBy his own admission, Mr. Lopez knew almost nothing about the Islamic State before 2014. Athletic and fun-loving, he had managed an Italian restaurant for years before becoming a car salesman. He became addicted to painkillers for a while, but he kicked the habit and has been off drugs for several years, he said. \u201cToby is your regular guy,\u201d said Mary Roloff, who is married to Mr. Lopez\u2019s half brother, Edward.At first, Mr. Lopez said, he started insulting people who praised the Islamic State on Twitter. Then he decided to learn more about his social media adversaries. He picked up a few Islamic terms online and began to engage the terrorist group\u2019s supporters, even quoting the Quran to counter them. He found the anonymity of the Internet intoxicating. As he put it, nobody knew he was \u201clittle Toby, the car salesman from Delaware.\u201dThe man who claimed to be the Islamic State commander regaled him with tales of battle, grumbled about condescending Arab bosses and called Mr. Lopez \u201cbrother.\u201d The man confided that he did not believe that Islam condoned the taking of women and children as slaves. Soon he asked Mr. Lopez to raise ransom to free hundreds of members of the Yazidi religious minority held hostage by the Islamic State.When relatives gathered for Thanksgiving in 2014 at the Roloffs\u2019 home near Baltimore, Mr. Lopez showed them jihadist videos and text message exchanges with Islamic State fans.\u201cWe love \u2018CSI,\u2019\u201d Ms. Roloff said. \u201cWe thought, \u2018This is really cool.\u2019 But some of what he shared with us \u2014 like videos of kids hanging from a tree \u2014 started to scare me. It was beyond our comprehension.\u201dMr. Lopez contacted the F.B.I., and two agents visited his home and interviewed him, he said. Through Allan Ripp, a New York public relations specialist he found online, Mr. Lopez also contacted The New York Times. Two reporters visited him in January 2015 and spent several hours reviewing his emails, texts and audio recordings.But after checking with experts, the reporters concluded that Mr. Lopez was talking not to the real, red-bearded Mr. Shishani, but to an impostor. The actual commander did not speak fluent English, and the language overheard in the background of Skype calls was not Chechen, as the impostor claimed, but Kurdish. His multiple Twitter accounts had an antic tone; he once posted a \u201cSimpsons\u201d cartoon about the Islamic State.The man\u2019s motive appeared to be money: He asked Mr. Lopez to bring the ransom to Sweden, supposedly to be forwarded to Syria.When the Times reporters told Mr. Lopez they did not believe he was dealing with the real Islamic State commander, he grew angry. He was hearing similar skepticism from the F.B.I., according to email exchanges with Jeffrey A. Reising, a senior counterterrorism agent based in Wilmington, Del.From the emails, it appears that Mr. Reising was exploring Mr. Lopez\u2019s contacts even as he tried to persuade him to disengage from the online jihadist world. But Mr. Lopez connected with a second Twitter user claiming to be an Islamic State figure who could get American hostages released, and Mr. Lopez tried to contact several hostages\u2019 families. At least one of them complained to the F.B.I.Despite his doubts about Mr. Lopez\u2019s exploits, Mr. Reising appeared to believe he might have stumbled across useful information. \u201cCan you provide all contact information for the person on that chat?\u201d he wrote to Mr. Lopez on Feb. 4, 2015, referring to an exchange with a purported Islamic State representative.Near midnight, Mr. Lopez excitedly emailed the F.B.I. agent. \u201cI want to bring her home alive,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI know I can do it and I will look the PRESIDENT in his eyes and tell him exactly that \u2026 Anything else your fooling yourself and your in denial!! Good night!\u201dThe weary F.B.I. agent replied: \u201cToby\u2026.Seriously. Get some sleep.\u201dWhen Ms. Mueller was reported killed two days later in an airstrike, Mr. Lopez was furious and blamed the F.B.I. for not cooperating with him. His messages to the bureau grew more defiant.\u201cAny attempt to arrest me will be treated as a hostile act,\u201d he wrote to Mr. Reising. By then, agents had been informed by the Delaware State Police that Mr. Lopez\u2019s mother, Joyce Lopez, had told them that her son had a shotgun and was in a \u201cpoor mental state.\u201d Mrs. Lopez, 78, said recently that she had simply asked whether the gun had to be registered.By Feb. 11, the F.B.I. had had enough. Mrs. Lopez arrived home to find her house surrounded. \u201cCars all over the place,\u201d she recalled. \u201cToby was standing there with his hands up. I said, \u2018What\u2019s wrong?\u2019\u201dThe authorities had interpreted Mr. Lopez\u2019s heated emails as a \u201cthreat to injure\u201d Mr. Reising, a crime with a sentence of up to five years. Mr. Lopez said later that he had threatened only to expose what he considered government bungling to the news media. He was locked up, and federal prosecutors soon sought a court order for a mental health assessment.At an initial court hearing in Wilmington, family members urged Mr. Lopez\u2019s public defender, Daniel I. Siegel, to collect the records of his online contacts, which they thought showed his intentions were good. By their account, Mr. Siegel ignored their pleas. \u201cHe just said, \u2018Your brother is very sick and he needs help,\u2019\u201d Ms. Roloff recalled.Mr. Lopez said Mr. Siegel never came to see him in the year that followed, as he cycled through the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan (where he surprised a few terrorism defendants with Arabic phrases); a medical prison in Butner, N.C., (where he played on the softball team); and three other facilities.The first two psychological evaluations found that Mr. Lopez was suffering from \u201cdelusional disorder, grandiose type.\u201d To Mr. Lopez\u2019s distress, Mr. Siegel did not contest the findings.A year into Mr. Lopez\u2019s imprisonment, after complaints from his family and reporters\u2019 inquiries, Edson A. Bostic, the chief federal public defender in Delaware, took over the case. He quickly obtained from the family the files documenting Mr. Lopez\u2019s online history and arranged for the third psychological assessment.Dr. Heilbrun, the Drexel psychologist, declared in his report that if Mr. Lopez had not been talking with the real Mr. Shishani (who was killed last month), then someone posing as the Islamic State commander had pulled off \u201ca clever, detailed, and well-constructed hoax.\u201dIn a statement on Friday, Mr. Bostic called the case \u201ca complex matter\u201d and praised Mr. Siegel\u2019s record of representing indigent clients. But he said the complaints from Mr. Lopez and his family would be investigated. Mr. Siegel did not respond to emails seeking comment.Now that the charges have been dropped, Mr. Lopez, who missed two family weddings while in prison, is reconnecting with friends and relatives.\u201cAll over you see those billboards that say, \u2018See Something; Say Something,\u2019\u201d said Tana Stevens, Mr. Lopez\u2019s sister. \u201cHe tried to do that. And they basically kidnapped him for 14 months.\u201dMr. Lopez said he had consulted lawyers and was considering a lawsuit against the government officials responsible for his incarceration. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t gotten another evaluation, I might still be sitting down at Butner, with a needle in my arm,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was the United States of America, flexing its muscles on me.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Farhad and Mike\u2019s Week in Tech: To Be or Not To Be an Uber Employee", "Date": "2016-04-23", "News": "Supported byHas anyone spent so much for so little before? I mean, other than what our bosses pay you?Oh also, I started watching back episodes of \u201cHalt and Catch Fire\u201d on Netflix and man, that show rules. It deals with the rise of the PC and the era when IBM, or Big Blue, reigned supreme. A different era entirely.Here\u2019s what matters: Aside from the $100 million Uber said it would pay drivers involved in the suit, the company conceded to a bunch of new rules and policies that make things at least slightly better for drivers.For one, drivers can ask for tips now, something they weren\u2019t able to do before (unlike Lyft, where they can get tips inside the app). Uber will also create a union-style \u201cdrivers association\u201d in California and Massachusetts \u2014 just don\u2019t call them unions! \u2014 so that drivers can air their grievances. And drivers won\u2019t automatically be deactivated for canceling too many trips over time.That seems like a list of ways Uber can defend itself in other states in which it faces lawsuits. Essentially, the further away Uber gets from acting like actual employers with drivers \u2014 that is, the less control it exerts over the work force \u2014 the more room it has to call its drivers \u201cpartners\u201d and not employees.This settlement sounds a bit like that situation: Uber drivers get some perks of employment, including people to complain to, and some measure of job security (even if it\u2019s probably pretty weak). But they don\u2019t get to be full employees \u2014 meaning the company does not have to pay them benefits, and the drivers are free to work as much or as little as they\u2019d like.Am I wrong to see this as a pretty good middle-of-the-road fix to a thorny problem that had been vexing lots of on-demand companies?The counterargument for some of this is that Uber can still shut drivers out of the app for short periods of time if they make too many trip cancellations. That\u2019s a level of control that one could argue should be reserved for an employer-employee relationship.Anyway, the moral of the story is this seems to have been largely defused, though not entirely over and done with. Watch other states and the subsequent litigation closely.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Shuts Out Competitors on Android? Hardly", "Date": "2016-04-27", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtOne of the persistent tragedies of Android, Google\u2019s globe-conquering mobile operating system, is that it continues to be better in theory than in reality.The charges make sense in the abstract. Google makes the world\u2019s most popular mobile operating system, and some of its licenses do compel phone makers to include several Google apps, even if they just want to include the Google Play app store. On paper, that may constitute unfair \u201cbundling,\u201d one of the sins that did in Microsoft at its apex in the late 1990s.Yet the European charges miss the messy reality of life on Android, which is clear to anyone who studies the mobile software business: Android phones come teeming with non-Google apps, often to the point of frustration for users. The search company appears powerless to keep many of them off people\u2019s devices, even when doing so might help its business.Harry First, a law professor at New York University who studies antitrust issues, says the key difficulty for regulators in this case is that the tech world has changed radically since the Microsoft antitrust case. Back then, Microsoft managed to outflank rivals like Netscape by bundling its Internet Explorer browser with its Windows operating system, and by using licenses and payments to prevent computer makers from installing competing browsers.\u201cIn the Microsoft era people were unfamiliar with downloading, and nothing was as effective as getting the browser installed by the O.E.M.s,\u201d he said, using the abbreviation for original equipment makers, or computer manufacturers.\u201cBut now, I\u2019d be surprised if people aren\u2019t fully at ease with downloading things from app stores, and people are familiar with having more than one app on their phone that does the same thing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe E.U. has to tell an exclusion story, but it\u2019s hard for me to see the exclusion story here.\u201dBut Hangouts is clearly no messaging juggernaut. In much of the world, that title belongs to two apps owned by Facebook \u2014 Messenger, which has 800 million active users a month, and WhatsApp, which has more than a billion. (Google has never disclosed the Hangouts user base; analysts I spoke to estimated that its share of the messaging market was in the single digits.)Then there\u2019s the popularity of the main Facebook app. As its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has acknowledged, the company was late to realize the importance of mobile phones; for years, its smartphone app was a slow, kludgy mess, and until just a few years ago it had no mobile revenue to speak of. Google, meanwhile, bundled its own social network, Google Plus, with Android phones.So if you were looking at the market a few years ago through the eyes of an E.U. antitrust regulator, you might have anticipated some trouble for Facebook on Android phones, and you might even have ventured that Google Plus would become a hit. After all, here was a small, late-moving upstart pitted against a bundle-friendly giant that owned the operating system.Of course, that\u2019s not how things turned out. Google Plus is now all but dead. And Facebook did not just survive the shift to mobile phones, it became the unstoppable force in the industry.How did Facebook get so popular on phones? On the whole, it happened the old-fashioned way: People loved Facebook, they had no trouble finding it in mobile app stores, and they began to download and use it. In other words, unlike in the desktop era ruled by Microsoft, Google\u2019s platform dominance on mobile phones does not appear to have posed any hindrance to a competitor\u2019s rise.The E.U.\u2019s objections go beyond the supposed restrictions that Google places on Android\u2019s app ecosystem. Another key charge involves Google\u2019s dominance in web search. Regulators say Google ensures that it remains Android\u2019s dominant search engine both by requiring phone makers to install the Chrome browser on their phones and, in some instances, by paying manufacturers to position the Google Search app on the phone\u2019s home screen.Mr. First, the law professor, said the search issue isn\u2019t as clear-cut as the question of whether Google has restricted rival apps. But he noted that the general flexibility of Android \u2014 the fact that, in general, Google makes it pretty easy for device makers and users to tinker with the software \u2014 cuts in Google\u2019s favor.Mr. First said the interaction was noteworthy: Android easily let him download a rival to Google\u2019s offering, and it even asked him if he wanted to set the rival as a default.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see how the commission could do better than that,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Web Privacy Rules: Bad for Google, Bad for Everyone", "Date": "2016-04-25", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsThat\u2019s a problem for a company whose business model is built on search. But it may be an even bigger problem for Internet users. If a European government can control what people all over the world get to see on the Internet, why can\u2019t every other country do the same?Technically, the French may have a point. When Europeans type \u201cgoogle.com\u201d into their browsers, Google directs them to their national versions of the service \u2014 which, it says, are used by 95 percent of its European users. But Google hadn\u2019t erected barriers to stop those people from visiting google.com.In a concession to regulators, Google is changing that now, using \u201cgeo-blocking\u201d technology to control what European users can see. Under the new system, Google will not only remove links on, say, google.fr, but it will block users in France from seeing those links on any other Google country site, or google.com itself. Unless they use tools like virtual private networks to disguise their locations, users in those countries will see pruned search results.Some say this is a logical solution \u2014 avoiding global deletion, while letting a sovereign state enforce its laws, within its borders. But it is a big step away from the Internet\u2019s promise of universally accessible information, and a big step toward a world of \u201csplinternets.\u201dThere are several problems with this. Chopping up important parts of the web raises barriers to entry for anyone looking to set up online, from independent bloggers to nongovernmental organizations to businesses. Smaller online services are unlikely to build bespoke French versions, as Google has done. It is easier and cheaper to block French users entirely. That means new entrants miss out on the French market, French Internet users miss out on new content and technologies from abroad, and everyone everywhere misses out on the creativity and innovation that comes from participating in a global Internet.News outlets should have particular cause for alarm about geo-blocking. Journalists rely on global networks to investigate and report on international stories, like the recent Panama Papers revelations. They themselves are often the first targets when governments seek to control the flow of information to their citizens. Protection exists in European Union privacy law for journalistic activities, so the news media is not directly in the cross hairs of the \u201cright to be forgotten.\u201d But American news organizations have faced libel actions in hostile foreign courts \u2014 and when plaintiffs start asking for geo-blocking in those cases, journalists will be on the front lines.Privacy is a real issue, and shouldn\u2019t be ignored in the Internet age. But applying those national laws to the Internet needs to be handled with more nuance and concern. These developments should not be driven only by privacy regulators. State departments, trade and justice ministries and telecom regulators in France and other European countries should be demanding a place at the table. So should free-expression advocates.One day, international agreements may sort this all out. But we shouldn\u2019t Balkanize the Internet in the meantime. Once we\u2019ve erected barriers online, we might not be able to tear them down.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Presses for Open Market for Cable Set-Top Boxes", "Date": "2016-04-15", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama on Friday announced his support for opening the market for cable set-top boxes, singling out the devices in millions of homes as a clunky and outdated symbol of corporate power over consumers, as he introduced a broad federal effort to increase competition.In an unusual step, Mr. Obama weighed in personally on a pending proposal at the Federal Communications Commission, having his administration file comments that applauded the effort to loosen cable companies\u2019 grip on the boxes.The president, in an interview with Yahoo Finance, said it was an example of the kinds of actions government agencies should take in response to an executive order he signed on Friday calling for administrative action to promote competition and to better protect consumers.\u201cThe cable or satellite box is just one example of an area where, because it\u2019s been tied to the provider and you rent it, and consumers spend billions of dollars on it every single year, there hasn\u2019t been much innovation,\u201d Mr. Obama said, adding that the private sector becomes less effective \u201cif we get closed systems or if people are gaming the system.\u201dThe announcements are the newest moves by Mr. Obama to push back against the forces of consolidation and monopoly, and to shift power away from large corporations in an array of industries.They are also the latest to place the president squarely on the side of technology companies \u2014 some led by executives who have contributed to Mr. Obama\u2019s campaigns, hired his former aides and spoken to him often. Among the supporters of the set-top box proposal are companies like Google, Amazon and Apple, which are eager to establish a broader foothold in the TV market.\u201cAn industry that had previously been considered untouchable \u2014 the cable guys \u2014 is now subject to criticism from the president,\u201d said Susan Crawford, a Harvard Law School professor who is a former aide to Mr. Obama. \u201cThis is like weighing in against Big Tobacco or Big Pharma.\u201dCable industry leaders lashed out at Mr. Obama, arguing that he was rewarding political friends and benefactors like those at Google, and undermining the independence of the F.C.C.Jim Cicconi, a senior executive vice president at AT&T, said the president\u2019s move was \u201caimed at muscling Democratic commissioners to support the Google proposal.\u201dThe administration can comment on any proposal by the F.C.C., an independent agency, but it does so sparingly, and it is rare for the president himself to speak out on a pending matter. In this case, his advisers said he felt that the issue merited his involvement because of the broad impact the changes could have on the cable market, one that touches many American households.In comments submitted on Friday, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, part of the Commerce Department, urged the F.C.C. to take a \u201cmeasured and balanced\u201d approach to injecting competition into the set-top box market, including enabling alternative providers to provide their own user interfaces, as well as other features.In a blog post, Jason Furman, the chairman of Mr. Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, and Jeffrey D. Zients, the director of the National Economic Council, called the set-top box rule the \u201cmascot\u201d for Mr. Obama\u2019s new pro-competition executive order.The president\u2019s aides gave no examples of the kinds of rules Mr. Obama would like to see agencies propose in response to the executive order. Mr. Furman said White House officials had already notified the agencies of the coming call for recommendations, so some of the regulations were already underway.The push announced on Friday is in line with Mr. Obama\u2019s promise in his State of the Union address this year to find ways to help workers, small businesses and entrepreneurs. In a report issued on Friday, the Council of Economic Advisers said that competition was declining in many industries and argued that the decrease was having a harmful effect on consumers and workers.Mr. Obama has acted several times to combat the trend, including signing legislation to unlock cellphones, which allows consumers to switch providers while keeping the same device.The Transportation Department has pressed airports to open slots to more airlines, while the F.C.C. adopted rules for auctioning wireless spectrum intended to allow smaller players more opportunities to participate.The report released on Friday listed several areas that the president\u2019s advisers said they thought could be ripe for pro-competition regulations, including so-called Big Data, the consumer information that includes buying habits and Internet browsing histories, price transparency and common ownership of stock by large institutional investors.Advertisement"}

They howl when they don\u2019t get their way and jump on people to show their love, even if those people are wearing long white gowns.\u201cI bet you 50 percent of the weddings I\u2019m going to do this summer are going to have some dog involvement,\u201d said Jeff Woodward, a photographer in Vermont.Including a pet in your wedding is a leap of faith, in addition to the one you are already making.\u201cIt\u2019s a wild card: You don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d said Alyssa Guilmette, 33. She married Brad Guilmette, 36, in a public park in Lexington, Mass., on Oct. 26, 2014.They said their vows while standing on an rug placed between two trees, with their rescued mutt, Rusty, sitting nearby in a black-and-white houndstooth bow tie.It did not go smoothly. \u201cMy uncle is trying to start the ceremony, and there\u2019s Rusty whimpering and whining and howling, a mix of all three really,\u201d Ms. Guilmette said. \u201cThen he just plopped down and started chewing the fringe of the Oriental rug.\u201cWe understood it was beyond our control and whatever happens, happens. It will add to the untraditional uniqueness of our wedding and our relationship.\u201dAt Allie Dorsky and John Pollack\u2019s wedding last June, their French bulldog, George, also protested loudly. \u201cWe were standing five feet away,\u201d Ms. Dorsky said. \u201cShe cried the whole time, in this very human whine, like \u2018Why am I here and you are over there?\u2019\u201dMany couples say the presence of a pet takes away the pressure of having a perfect wedding, because that is probably impossible even with a well-trained animal around.Emily Layden, 27, and Brian Woods, 30, who live in Menlo Park, Calif., brought their Border collie mix, Canfield, to their wedding in Lake Placid, N.Y. \u201cHaving Canfield at the wedding lowered the stakes rather than raised them,\u201d she said. \u201cI was saying, \u2018I\u2019m going to walk my dog around in six-inch heels in a floor-length wedding dress and hope for the best.\u2019\u201dDogs were part of Anne Surman and Tom Seidenberg\u2019s love story from the beginning. Both live in Exeter, N.H., where he teaches math at Phillips Exeter Academy and she is a member of the town\u2019s Board of Selectmen.On their first date \u2014 a blind one \u2014 he picked her up in a snowstorm, when almost everyone in town had lost power. \u201cI run out and put my head in the car window, and the first thing I see is this big head of Sydney, his standard poodle,\u201d said Ms. Surman, 56. \u201cHe was bringing Sydney on the date because he didn\u2019t want to leave him alone in the dark house.\u201dSince that first date, their crew of creatures has grown to four dogs and two cats. Their wedding invitation was worded as if from their pets. It read: \u201cSydney Seidenberg, Kady, Clipper, Joey, Bogart and Bacall Surman request the honor of your presence at the marriage of their humans.\u201dThe couple\u2019s wedding party included two humans and seven large, beautifully groomed dog \u201cattendants\u201d \u2014 four belonging to the couple and three to friends. \u201cThe moment they walked in, I thought, \u2018My family is here,\u2019\u201d Ms. Surman said.In comparison to dogs, cats can make finicky, moody, often self-centered wedding guests. Allia Zobel Nolan, the author of \u201cWomen Who Still Love Cats Too Much,\u201d said: \u201cCats are really more interested in their own comfort. If you had a dog and the dog was going to carry the rings in a basket, you could train the dog to do that. It would take a very long time and a very patient person to train a cat to do that. And you never know. He might be walking up the aisle and he\u2019d see a mouse and he\u2019d be off.\u201dNevertheless, when Allison Moore, 33, and Dakota Smith, 36, married in Austin, Tex., their cat, Meatwad, was in attendance. \u201cWe just put a bow tie on him and let him go as he pleased,\u201d Ms. Moore said. \u201cHe\u2019s a very social cat and he loves parties.\u201d (Their dogs, Roxy and Sprinkles, are less well behaved so they were left at home.)The degree to which some people treat animals as family varies widely. Carol Bryant, 47, and her wife, Darlene Bryant, 59, do not view their cocker spaniel, Dexter, as a pet. \u201cHe\u2019s my son,\u201d said Carol, firmly.In their hometown, Forty Fort, Pa., Darlene surprised Carol in June 2014 with a proposal, immediately followed by a prearranged ceremony that included a minister, two human guests and Dexter.Leah Fielding, 30, and Whit Boucher, 29, who live in Aspen, Colo., are almost always with Bromley, a mutt named after the ski area in Vermont where Mr. Boucher grew up skiing. On the save-the-date cards for their coming wedding, Bromley is front and center and wearing a sign that reads: \u201cMy Mom & Dad are finally gettin\u2019 hitched. 9/16/16.\u201dMs. Fielding said, \u201cWe do very little without him by our side, so getting married without him there would be a strange thing for us.\u201dBefore Leslee Wieseneck, 33, started dating a fellow Google employee, Noah Wieseneck, 34, she lived alone in Manhattan with Cooper, a large German shepherd mix she adopted. \u201cI was single, and he was my best friend and the love of my life,\u201d she said. \u201cMy friends joked that I was never going to find anyone to date because all I did was hang out with my dog.\u201dWhen they started dating, Mr. Wieseneck was somewhat taken aback by Cooper. \u201cWhen Noah and I hugged or kissed, Cooper would get upset and cry and jump,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was doing the screening for me, if you will, like, \u2018Is this guy going to work for us?\u2019\u201dLast summer, the couple were married in Saratoga Springs, where Mr. Wieseneck walked down the aisle with Cooper, who wore a corsage of white and coral-colored flowers.Cooper leapt onto Mrs. Wieseneck at the end of the ceremony, just as the three were about to walk back down the aisle together. \u201cI didn\u2019t care,\u201d she said. \u201cI was so happy. It was such a special moment, I wouldn\u2019t have cared if he ripped my dress.\u201dSometimes, if a pet is not likely to be happy at a wedding full of noise and strangers, brides and grooms will include it in other ways. \u201cThere was one couple who knew they couldn\u2019t have their cat attend because of the cat\u2019s demeanor, so they made all these buttons with their cat\u2019s face and passed them out,\u201d said Zachary Hunt, a wedding photographer based in Austin.If there is an animal at a wedding, the photographs will probably be more amusing when viewed years later. When Hilary Cooper and Chris Crowley were married 23 years ago in Old Lyme, Conn., Angus, their Weimaraner, stood loyally by their sides. Mr. Crowley said a dog helps relieve the tension in getting married. \u201cThey change the ambience,\u201d he said. \u201cA dog tells you: \u2018Hey, look, we\u2019re all mammals here. Take it easy. Chill.\u2019\u201dDuring the reception, however, Angus was bitten on the nose by a wolfhound belonging to a guest. \u201cThere\u2019s a picture of all the groomsmen with Angus with a bloody nose,\u201d Ms. Cooper said. \u201cWe called the vet and the vet said, \u2018Is this a show dog?\u2019 We said, \u2018No.\u2019 So, he said, \u2018Deal with the scar and have a nice wedding.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Blame Silicon Valley for Theranos", "Date": "2016-04-27", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorTHREE years ago, Walgreens (b. 1901) arrived in Silicon Valley for the same reason many old economy companies do: to hurry and join the digital vanguard before it was left behind. Walgreens quickly made a deal with Theranos (b. 2004), the medical diagnostics company and media darling that promised a revolutionary approach to blood tests.That hopeful beginning seems so long ago. Last fall, a series of investigative articles in The Wall Street Journal cast suspicion on Theranos\u2019s methods, a devastating federal report found serious deficiencies in the company\u2019s quality control, and Theranos is now under investigation by federal prosecutors and by the Securities and Exchange Commission.It is tempting to see Theranos as another example of Silicon Valley hype \u2014 a company based on a wisp of an unproven idea becomes a multibillion-dollar phenomenon with the backing of pump-and-dump venture capitalists.In fact, however, Silicon Valley\u2019s most experienced investors in start-ups saw red flags at Theranos before anyone else. The Theranos saga shows just how well Silicon Valley does its homework, especially when considering medical technology, in which the risks of doing real harm to people are higher than those posed by the next photo-sharing app.Walgreens made a rookie mistake when it looked at Theranos\u2019s GPS coordinates. Silicon Valley actually consists of two very separate places. The first is the start-up ecosystem built around the 15 or 20 venture capital firms in the tech sector and a similar number in life sciences that account for almost all of the successful companies.The second place is the surrounding fringe, occupied by small companies in perpetual search of well-connected investors, and investors in perpetual search of novel start-ups. Their desperation for partners resembles that of bar patrons who are unattached at last call.Both groups of Silicon Valley players are similar in appearance, but they couldn\u2019t be more different in status or access to critical networks and knowledge. Historically, the top 10 percent of venture-capital firms produce returns almost 10 times greater than the average of the remaining 90 percent.Theranos did make presentations to many, if not most, of the top life sciences firms. Part of the company\u2019s appeal was the familiar origin myth of Theranos\u2019s founder, Elizabeth Holmes, who, like Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg before her, dropped out of college in order to found her company.That might impress some social media investors, but in life sciences, everyone puts in years of formal study just to earn a seat at the table. For example, at MPM Capital, a venture firm that invests in life sciences, almost every one of its 20 investing directors and partners has either a Ph.D. or M.D., and one has both. Even the general counsel has a Ph.D. in cell, molecular and developmental biology.GV, formerly Google Ventures, has a five-person investment team for Life Science & Health that includes two members with Ph.D.s in bioengineering; another with both an M.D. and a Ph.D. in biophysics; and a partner who, unlike Ms. Holmes, finished at Stanford, then went on to earn an M.D. and M.B.A. at Harvard.Theranos approached GV twice and was turned down twice because of what one partner called \u201cso much hand-waving.\u201d People I have talked to at other investment firms said they turned down Theranos for similar reasons, unsatisfied with Theranos\u2019s attempt to substitute its intangible \u201ccoolness\u201d in place of technical details needed to validate its diagnostic technology.Another tipoff? Theranos wouldn\u2019t publish in peer-reviewed journals. Guy Cavet, chief technology officer for the biotech firm Atreca, said: \u201cEvery smart prospective partner of a life sciences start-up looks for strong peer-reviewed publications. It\u2019s a way of getting expert due diligence at zero cost.\u201dExperience in health care is critical for a company like Theranos, which has to comply with government regulations. Instead, even the board of directors was weighted during most of the company\u2019s life with older political figures like George P. Shultz and Henry A. Kissinger.Luke Evnin, a co-founder at MPM Capital, said he had never met with Theranos or Ms. Holmes, but he found the makeup of the board puzzling: \u201cIt is pretty weird that if you look at her board, there\u2019s not a single person who knows what they\u2019re doing in the business.\u201dThe first million dollars that the company received was from Tim Draper, a venture capitalist who became a venture capitalist through a very un-Silicon Valley-like route: His father was one (as was his grandfather). Mr. Draper had known Ms. Holmes as a childhood neighbor and playmate. The investors that followed Mr. Draper are a motley group, at least the ones visible in S.E.C. filings: a tiny firm named ATA Ventures; Continental Properties, a real estate company; and Donald L. Lucas, whose claim to fame was having invested in Oracle Corporation early.No, they needed results. Theranos might still prove viable. But if Walgreens ends up with swampland, it\u2019s not Silicon Valley\u2019s fault.Advertisement"}

It can now be used on any carrier. Its voice and data quality are stellar. Some of its built-in apps, such as Apple Pay, are best in class. There are 1.5 million apps created by outside developers.I have finally caved in: My phone is now an iPhone.Faced with slowing sales growth, Apple is counting on millions of people like me to give up their Android phones, which can be bought new for as little as $30 in some countries, to purchase iPhones, which cost $400 or more.\u201cWe were blown away by the level of Android switchers that we had last quarter,\u201d Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, told Wall Street in January. \u201cWe see that as a huge opportunity.\u201dAs someone who has since 2010 used high-end phones based on Google\u2019s Android operating system, I have experienced a rocky transition, like moving to a faraway city. The landmarks are unfamiliar, the customs are different, and I miss my old haunts even as I explore new ones.Switching phone operating systems should in theory be simple. First you transfer your data from the old phone to the new one. Then you reinstall your favorite apps. Finally you customize the settings for features like ring tones and notifications and learn the quirks of your new device.But as I learned, many things can go wrong, and my experience is not unusual.\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to go through the things that are most valuable to you and make sure it\u2019s all there,\u201d said Jonathan S.

It was as if a moving company had lost half my stuff during a cross-country haul.Apple later told me that I could have called a toll-free number for help, gone to an Apple store or erased everything and started over. The company lent me another iPhone 6S to try the Move to iOS app again \u2014 and this time it did transfer my data. But it failed to do the other half of the job: download the Apple versions of my Android apps to the new iPhone.The most fundamental difference between iPhones and Androids is the level of conformity dictated by each company. This is where personal preferences play a big role in customer satisfaction.Apple exercises great control over the look, feel and features of iPhones to deliver its idealized version of what it thinks people want. Android is free-form and adaptable \u2014 so much so that the look and feel can vary widely from one phone maker to the next, especially in Asia.One consequence of Apple\u2019s approach is that the iPhone is more stable. Every Android phone I have ever used has suffered mysterious hardware and software problems like random reboots and crashing apps. These happen much more rarely in iOS.But Apple\u2019s control has its downsides. The company makes its apps the permanent default options for common services like maps, web browsing and email.In my case, I have a Windows laptop; my employer, The New York Times, uses Google\u2019s enterprise apps; and I depend on Google\u2019s search technology to find airline tickets, email addresses and old photos stored in my various digital pockets. My life is deeply enmeshed in the Google ecosystem.To make my iPhone more familiar and my data easier to find, I put my favorite Google apps on my home screen and mostly use them instead of Apple\u2019s apps. Google has knitted its iPhone apps together so that Gmail uses Google\u2019s browser, Chrome, when you click on a link in an email, and Google\u2019s calendar uses Google Maps when you click on an address.Given the headaches of switching, most people avoid it.Michael R. Levin, partner and co-founder of Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, which surveys smartphone users in the United States, said only about one out of five people activating a new iPhone or Android was switching from the other platform. \u201cIn the past two years, the loyalty and switching rates have gotten very, very set,\u201d he said.Over all, I am getting more comfortable with my iPhone. I like Apple\u2019s fingerprint reader and have finally figured out how to align my fingertips precisely enough to unlock the phone (at least most of the time).Will the iPhone ever feel like home? Check back in two years, when I am due for my next upgrade.An article on the Personal Tech pages on Thursday about switching to an iPhone from an Android device misstated the content of a Google web page.

Other bidders included the private equity firm TPG.A special committee of Yahoo\u2019s board is now expected to sort through the preliminary offers to decide which to pursue. The company did disclose that it paid its outside advisers $9 million during the quarter.Ms. Mayer hinted that Yahoo would prefer a buyer like Verizon that could achieve \u201cstrategic synergies,\u201d as opposed to a purely financial buyer like a private equity firm.Yahoo, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., said revenue fell 11 percent to $1.09 billion, and its net loss was $99 million, or 10 cents a share, in contrast to revenue of $1.23 billion and net income of $21 million, or 2 cents a share, in the same quarter a year ago.After deducting payments Yahoo made to advertising partners for traffic, its revenue exceeded Wall Street\u2019s expectations. Profits after adjusting for certain items also narrowly beat projections, although shareholders are much more focused on the potential sale of the company than quarterly financial results.Yahoo shares were up slightly in early after-hours trading.Analysts were unimpressed with the results, but said that the company\u2019s exact financial results did not matter.As Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research, put it in a note to clients, there was \u201crelatively little commentary on the transaction news that so many are waiting on, and relatively more commentary on the current state of the business and management\u2019s plans, which likely won\u2019t matter for very long.\u201dYahoo, a leading content portal in the early days of the web, missed the shift to mobile devices and has been struggling to compete against Google, Facebook and specialty apps for advertising dollars and user loyalty.Ms. Mayer, Yahoo\u2019s chief executive since 2012, has failed to turn around the company. Restive shareholders are pressing the board to sell the Internet businesses and unlock Yahoo\u2019s large stakes in Alibaba, a Chinese e-commerce company, and Yahoo Japan, an independently traded company.Together, those two investments have a face value of about $40 billion \u2014 more than the $35 billion stock market value of all of Yahoo, based on Tuesday\u2019s stock prices.While the sales process has advanced, Yahoo\u2019s management team, led by Ms. Mayer, has continued to run the business as if nothing were going to change. Yahoo said it again increased mobile revenue in the quarter, but declines in search and display advertising revenue more than offset that growth.Yahoo noted that it ended the quarter with 9,400 employees, down 21 percent from the previous year, as it eliminated many of its digital magazines, closed overseas offices and made cuts in other parts of the business.Kenneth Goldman, Yahoo\u2019s chief financial officer, said the company was continuing to explore the sale of real estate.Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said, \u201cThis was same old, same old at Yahoo,\u201d adding, \u201cThe overall trends remained relatively soft.\u201dJeffrey Smith, the chief executive of the Starboard Value hedge fund, said on Tuesday that he intended to keep the pressure on Yahoo. Starboard has proposed an alternative slate of nine directors to replace Yahoo\u2019s entire board at the company\u2019s next annual shareholder meeting, expected in June or July.\u201cIf we get to the end, and they haven\u2019t been successful as it relates to getting the company sold \u2014 the core business sold \u2014 well, we\u2019re going to need to pick up the pieces,\u201d he said.Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Samsung Profits Are Up, Thanks to Its Galaxy 7 Smartphone", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 Samsung performed better than expected at the beginning of what it has said will be a tough year, thanks to a product that recently has been its Achilles\u2019 heel: smartphones.The South Korean electronics maker said on Thursday that its operating profit for the first three months of this year rose about 10 percent over the same period a year ago. The increase was slightly less than the fourth quarter\u2019s, but better than many analysts had expected. Much of that performance came from sales of its curvy new Galaxy S7 smartphones, analysts said.The results indicate that even as the company has faced moderating growth, it has the potential to surprise with new products that catch consumers\u2019 eyes.Samsung probably cannot return to the heady days of 2013, when strong smartphone sales powered its transformation into a global device company and helped it make nearly $10 billion a quarter. But the strong smartphone sales are a welcome return to form for a part of the company that has been squeezed at one end by cheap Chinese smartphone makers and at the other by Apple.Mr. Thompson said the major factors that hurt Samsung \u2014 including Apple\u2019s release of a handset in China\u2019s largest telecom service provider, China Mobile, and its decision to offer a big-screen iPhone \u2014 are in the South Korean company\u2019s rearview mirror.\u201cThere is a population that wants a high-end Android phone,\u201d he said, referring to the operating system from Google that many of Samsung\u2019s phones use, \u201cand the reality is Samsung is good at making hardware. They make a good phone.\u201dSamsung said that operating profit would be 6.6 trillion won, or about $5.7 billion, in the fourth quarter compared with 6.0 trillion a year earlier. The numbers released Thursday are preliminary; Samsung will post its final earnings later this month.Another factor helping Samsung has been a change in the way the company manages its new product rollouts, said Peter Yu, a BNP Paribas analyst. Last year, the company missed strong demand for its Edge series of phones, in part because it imitated Apple\u2019s hype-filled product release, and early sales of limited supplies that sell out, Mr. Yu said.This year, Samsung limited the number of countries where it was releasing the phones, and made sure it had already shipped phones across many of its channels, he said.\u201cThere was a better sell through this year compared to last year,\u201d Mr. Yu said.\u201cThere was a production issue too,\u201d he added. \u201cNow that they have climbed the learning curve, the production is there. So they have the production, the costs are lower and without those constraints they found that the Edge is selling better than they thought.\u201dWhile smartphone sales have helped solidify earnings, the company is still likely to face weak demand for its components this year on soft global demand for electronics. The conglomerate, whose products include smartphone screens, memory and microchips, has been broadly exposed to economic weakness.This year, Samsung also has to work to replace some of the microchip business it had with Apple, which it lost when Apple shifted orders to its Taiwan semiconductor rival TSMC.Even so, analysts expect Samsung, which has leading technology in sectors like screens and memory chips, to perform better whenever conditions improve.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "From Wall Street Banking, a New Wave of Fintech Investors", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported byFinance is where they built their careers. Now some of banking\u2019s former stars are pouring millions of dollars \u2014 and in some cases staking their careers \u2014 into new technologies that are shaking up everything from lending to payments to investing.They are part of a wave of investors who sank $17.8 billion into financial technology, or fintech, in the first nine months of 2015, an 88 percent increase from the same period in 2014, according to a new report by Accenture. The three top technologies were cloud, mobile and analytics, the report said.A separate analysis by Citigroup put total fintech investing for all of last year at $19 billion, up from $1.8 billion in 2010.In many ways, the investors are filling a void where the financial industry left off. Traditionally banks have invested heavily in technology, but that activity fluctuates with the fortunes of the industry.Bank tech investing dropped off immediately after the 2008 financial crisis because the banks had to focus on other issues. Regulatory changes since then have forced banks to cut back on riskier ventures, such as trading, as well as the technology investments, like data analytics and electronic systems, that go with those activities. That opened the door to start-up development and the creation of products and services that threaten to upend the way traditional banks work.Former finance executives say that they are bringing their experience to start-ups to steer them on the right path.\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to ruin the banking system,\u201d said Mr. Morris, the former Visa chief and ex-Citi executive, who is now a managing partner at the fintech investment firm Nyca Partners and a board member of Lending Club, Payoneer and CardWorks. \u201cWe help some of the new tech companies understand exactly what the opportunities are and what they aren\u2019t.\u201dToday\u2019s generation of fintech companies are different in that many of the start-ups aren\u2019t developing technology to sell to the financial services industry \u2014 as has been the pattern in past fintech booms \u2014 they are taking their products directly to consumers through easy-to-use mobile apps.The public, particularly younger Americans, has taken to these technologies after the financial crisis eroded its trust in the traditional banking system, says Bruce Wallace, chief digital officer at Silicon Valley Bank. Millennials, especially, are \u201cmore receptive to buying a financial product or service directly from a tech company.\u201dOne concept that has captured a lot of attention is peer-to-peer lending, popularized by online sites like Prosper and Lending Club, which connect ordinary people who want to borrow money with ordinary people who are willing to lend it to them, cutting banks out of the process. The lending sites flourished as banks curtailed unsecured and riskier lending.SoFi brought in Anshu Jain, the former Deutsche Bank co-chief executive, as a board adviser this year and Arthur Levitt, the former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, last year.The firm also invests in Simpl, which makes technology to ease the checkout process for online shoppers, and Two Tap, another online shopping tool that allows users to buy items outside a retailer\u2019s website, by tapping twice on an image of the product on their device.Silicon Valley\u2019s edgy appeal also attracted the former Morgan Stanley finance chief Ruth Porat, now chief financial officer of Alphabet (formerly known as Google). The former Goldman executive J. Michael Evans joined the Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba in 2014, and a fellow former Goldman banker, Anthony Noto, became finance chief of Twitter earlier that year.More recently, the former JPMorgan Chase commodities head Blythe Masters went to the blockchain technology firm Digital Asset Holdings, which just announced a $50 million investment from Goldman, JPMorgan and other banks. And the former card company executives Amit Parikh (Discover) and Gail Hodges (HSBC) joined Apple Pay.Traditional banking isn\u2019t likely to be completely displaced by fintech disrupters, however, said Mr. Wallace of Silicon Valley Bank; the industry is large enough to have room for more firms. \u201cThere can be multiple winners,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is That Even a Thing?", "Date": "2016-04-16", "News": "Speakers and writers of American English have recently taken to identifying a staggering and constantly changing array of trends, events, memes, products, lifestyle choices and phenomena of nearly every kind with a single label \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a thing. In conversation, mention of a surprising fad, behavior or event is now often met with the question, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs that actually a thing?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Or \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen did that become a thing?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Or \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow is that even a thing?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Calling something \u00e2\u0080\u009ca thing\u00e2\u0080\u009d is, in this sense, itself a thing.I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to do either. My assumption is that language and experience mutually influence each other. Language not only captures experience, it conditions it. It sets expectations for experience and gives shape to it as it happens. What might register as inarticulateness can reflect a different way of understanding and experiencing the world.Clearly, cultural phenomena have long existed and been called \u00e2\u0080\u009cfads,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009ctrends,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009crages\u00e2\u0080\u009d or have been designated by the category they belong to \u00e2\u0080\u0094 \u00e2\u0080\u009cproduct,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cfashion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009clifestyle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d etc. So why the application of this homogenizing general term to all of them? I think there are four main reasons.First, the flood of content into the cultural sphere. That we are inundated is well known. Information besieges us in waves that thrash us against the shore until we retreat to the solid ground of work or sleep or exercise or actual human interaction, only to wade cautiously back into our smartphones. As we spend more and more time online, it becomes the content of our experience, and in this sense \u00e2\u0080\u009cthings\u00e2\u0080\u009d have earned their name. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA thing\u00e2\u0080\u009d has become the basic unit of cultural ontology.Read previous contributions to this series.Third, the closing gap between satire and the real thing. The absurd excess of things has reached a point where the ironic detachment needed to cope with them is increasingly built into the things themselves, their marketing and the language we use to talk about them. The designator \u00e2\u0080\u009ca thing\u00e2\u0080\u009d is thus almost always tinged with ironic detachment. It puts the thing at arm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s length. You can hardly say \u00e2\u0080\u009ca thing\u00e2\u0080\u009d without a wary glint in your eye. The volume, particularity and inanity of the phenomena effectively force us to take up this detachment. The complaint that the young are jaded or ironic is misplaced; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the conditions that are this way.Finally, the growing sense that these phenomena are all the same. As we step back from \u00e2\u0080\u009cthings,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they recede into the distance and begin to blur together. We call them all by the same name because they are the same at bottom: All are pieces of the Internet. A thing is for the most part experienced through this medium and generated by it. Even if they arise outside it, things owe their existence as things to the Internet. Google is thus always the arbiter of the question, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs that a real thing?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cA thing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d then, corresponds to a real need we have, to catalog and group together the items of cultural experience, while keeping them at a sufficient distance so that we can at least feign unified consciousness in the face of a world gone to pieces.Alexander Stern is a doctoral candidate in philosophy at the University of Notre Dame.More From Fixes \u00bbMore From Private Lives \u00bbMore From Couch \u00bbMore From The Stone \u00bbMore From Moviegoers \u00bbMore From The End \u00bbMore From Draft \u00bbMore From Anxiety \u00bbMore From Menagerie \u00bbMore From Disunion \u00bbMore From Bedside \u00bbMore From The Conversation \u00bbMore From The Great Divide \u00bbMore From Errol Morris \u00bbFollowAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Case Against Google Might Help Rivals More Than Consumers", "Date": "2016-04-28", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseIn a persistent (and thus far fruitless) effort to hobble giant American technology companies, the European Union has again taken aim at Alphabet\u2019s Google search engine.At first blush, it might seem the Europeans are onto something. If device manufacturers want to preinstall the Google Play app, they must agree to install Google search and its Chrome browser as well \u2014 and make Google the default search engine.With some manufacturers, Google pays to have its search function preinstalled as the default option \u2014 an estimated $1 billion a year to Apple, according to a court filing last year.If these claims seem a little like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, that\u2019s because anyone over the age of 20 has seen this before: Microsoft embedded its Internet Explorer browser in its Windows desktop operating system, a so-called tying arrangement. In the late 1990s, the Justice Department and European Union regulators accused Microsoft of illegally trying to extend its dominant position in operating systems to Internet browsers and search. (Microsoft ultimately settled the cases.)But the rapid rise of mobile and tablet devices has pretty much rendered all that irrelevant. The latest version of Internet Explorer still has the largest market share for desktop Internet browsers, but it has only a negligible share for fast-growing mobile and tablet devices, where Google Chrome is far ahead.Technological change has also undermined the superficial similarities between the old Microsoft case and the new Android one. Back then, consumers who wanted a rival browser like Netscape to run on their Windows operating system rather than the (free) Explorer had to go to a store, pay for a disk with a rival program and then install it.Today, a free rival browser is a tap away. When I checked into Google Play this week, there were more browser choices than I knew what to do with, including some I\u2019d never heard of (Maxthon?). But I\u2019m satisfied with Google\u2019s offering and have no interest in further cluttering my phone\u2019s display screen.It\u2019s so easy to substitute or add apps that it\u2019s not even clear Google\u2019s agreements with manufacturers would be deemed tying arrangements. \u201cI don\u2019t think they meet the requirement,\u201d said Herbert Hovenkamp, an antitrust expert at the University of Iowa College of Law. \u201cThere\u2019s almost no limit to your ability to add additional apps or to delete the Google app and substitute a different one.\u201dOf course, there\u2019s obviously an advantage to being the default app, or else Google wouldn\u2019t be paying Apple such a large sum. \u201cOn the other hand, anyone can change if they\u2019re unhappy,\u201d Professor Hovenkamp said.Nor do manufacturers have to preinstall any Google apps on devices using Android, which is an open source system, available free. Amazon\u2019s Fire was an Android mobile device with a built-in Amazon shopping app, but it didn\u2019t come with Google Play or Search preinstalled. Fire was deemed a flop, in part because it lacked popular Google apps like Gmail and Maps.Even if Google is found to be using a tying arrangement, that\u2019s not necessarily illegal or bad for consumers. Scott Hemphill, an antitrust professor at New York University School of Law, said tying arrangements are common across a wide array of products and industries. \u201cNo one complains because they don\u2019t have a choice of transmission manufacturers in their cars,\u201d Professor Hemphill said.These same issues were raised last year in a class-action suit in a Federal District Court in California.The two named plaintiffs both bought Android phones, one in Louisville, Ky., the other in Des Moines, Iowa, and complained that they hadn\u2019t realized they came with Google search already installed. Judge Beth Labson Freeman of Federal District Court struggled to find any evidence that either had suffered any harm.So who exactly is being hurt by Google\u2019s behavior? It\u2019s not, apparently, consumers, in whose name this battle is being fought. Google\u2019s search engine is even more popular in Europe, where it has a more than 90 percent market share, according to the European Union, than it is in the United States.The driving force pushing the European action was a consortium of Google\u2019s corporate rivals \u2014 foremost among them, ironically, Microsoft, which once complained loudly about European overreaching. It has backed a lobbying group called FairSearch, which hailed the European action against Google as \u201ca crucial step to end abusive business practices.\u201d(Microsoft and Google said this week that they were burying the hatchet and would withdraw regulatory complaints about each other around the globe. Microsoft has said it will no longer back FairSearch.)If Microsoft really wants to compete with Google\u2019s search engine in Europe, it has the wherewithal to outbid Google and pay manufacturers to make Bing their default search engine.The Russian Internet company Yandex has been the most vocal in urging European action against Apple, which is even more ironic considering that Russia is not a member of the European Union and has been sanctioned over its annexation of Crimea. Yandex has dominated Internet search in Russia but has recently been losing ground there to Google. It filed \u2014 and, no surprise, won \u2014 similar claims in Russia. (Google is appealing that outcome.)Even if competitors like Yandex would stand to benefit, \u201cthe purpose of antitrust law, at least in the U.S., is to protect consumers, not competitors,\u201d Professor Hemphill said.Professor Hovenkamp echoed that thought. \u201cEurope is moving pretty far into left field with this case,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems like over-regulation for the benefit of competitors that won\u2019t end up doing consumers any good.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Its previous investors include Ari Emanuel, co-chief executive of William Morris Endeavor, and the enterprise software company Autodesk.Of the 133 virtual and augmented reality investments made in 2015, media companies participated in six, according to the venture capital research firm CB Insights.Discovery Communications introduced a service last August called Discovery VR, which is available via Apple and Android apps, as well as through other outlets. Discovery VR has more than 75 virtual reality experiences about such topics as sharks, gold mining and surfing. The app has been downloaded nearly 600,000 times and has been viewed more than 23 million times, according to the company.Suzanne Kolb, executive vice president of Discovery Digital Networks, said the deal with Otoy should give Discovery a front-row seat to new technological developments and ways to tell stories. \u201cIt is an evolving space,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

But somehow, designers are embracing Mr. De Feo\u2019s colorful approach.\u201cMarketing has become so precious, too perfect, homogeneous,\u201d said Georgia Christensen, the Neiman Marcus brand creative vice president. \u201cAnyone who is breaking those boundaries is getting noticed, especially if it is beautiful.\u201dThe fashion industry has long embraced graffiti artists who accentuated brands while furthering their careers: Futura; Brian Donnelly (known as KAWS) and Lady Aiko among them. On the back wall of Mr. De Feo\u2019s downtown studio one recent afternoon, the artist hung a Christian Dior handbag advertisement he had taken from an uptown bus shelter hours earlier. His wife, Lia, an eager scout, had seen it days earlier and had taken a photograph. Mr. De Feo studied the lollipop-red bag, oblivious to a freckle-faced Jennifer Lawrence clutching it to her chest.\u201cWhat I\u2019m doing is kind of this balance between working with the ad in a way, but also fighting against it and subverting it,\u201d he said. Sometimes he is attracted to a model, he said. Other times it is the overall composition. In this case, it was the cherry bag.About a dozen paper cups filled with acrylic paint were arranged on a stool. He dipped his brush into a cup of grass green, and sketched a blossom on the lapel of Ms. Lawrence\u2019s white jacket. He painted another one, switching next to blue, then light caramel, until the actress was consumed in a festive bouquet. \u201cI don\u2019t want to annihilate the ad,\u201d he said. \u201cIt results in a better dialogue when you approach something gently or with whimsy.\u201dMr. De Feo has installed his handiwork at bus stops in Midtown, on the East Side and in the meatpacking district. His first was a Christian Dior ad with Natalie Portman covered in an oversize posy of black and pink on Second Avenue. (Christian Dior executives did not return an email seeking comment.) He took it down, though, after the shelter\u2019s light didn\u2019t illuminate the image properly at night.\u201cIt has to read from a distance, the back of a taxi,\u201d Mr. De Feo said. He planned to take the newly painted handbag ad to Amsterdam and hang it in a bus stop there. \u201cSome of the work I end up putting on the streets end up disappearing,\u201d he said. He surmised that they might be replaced with new ads. Or, perhaps, collectors are on to him and are taking the ads for themselves.Mr. De Feo\u2019s work is described by some as a form of culture jamming, that is, an attempt to explore consumer assumptions about media and materialism through street art. \u201cIt\u2019s about interfering with the corporate culture,\u201d said Dan Witz, a longtime street artist and friend of Mr. De Feo. That includes, he said, \u201cusing context or format to make a message.\u201dRetailers, though, suggest Mr. De Feo\u2019s street art is more benign than that. \u201cThe first reaction is, \u2018This is terrible,\u2019\u201d said Steven Roberts, the chief executive for the Echo Design Group, commenting on artists who deface designer ads. But Mr. De Feo, he said, \u201cis not disrespecting it. It\u2019s embellishment to enhance.\u201dMr. Roberts added: \u201cEveryone can relate to it. He\u2019s saying, \u2018Don\u2019t take this too seriously.\u2019\u201dMs. Christiansen agreed. \u201cThere is a civility even though he is breaking the law,\u201d she said.Mr. De Feo grew up in Rye, N.Y., and attended the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan, from which he graduated in 1995 with a degree in graphic design. He began street painting in 1993, he said, and, a year later, painted his first flower mural on the side of a building on East 23rd Street.He expanded internationally from there, with public paintings in Amsterdam, Buenos Aires, Hong Kong and Paris.To support himself while he pursued street art, he got a job teaching at Westhill High School in Stamford, Conn. He was a popular teacher of ceramics, Photoshop, drawing and other creative fare. But in 2013 he quit his job of 15 years to devote more time to art.\u201cI walked a fine line being a teacher,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have Google, and kids today look up their teachers. I didn\u2019t work hard keeping what I did a massive secret. I was also never arrested.\u201d But not everyone was enthralled. \u201cSome parents didn\u2019t like it,\u201d he said.When asked what his bus shelter flower art said about American culture, he was flummoxed. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, looking at his newly painted ad. \u201cThis is one message out of the many.\u201dBut something quickly came to mind. Most people don\u2019t look like celebrities, whose wrinkles are airbrushed and features enhanced by Photoshop. \u201cIt\u2019s not real life,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd these are not real flowers.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Minecraft Generation", "Date": "2016-04-14", "News": "FeatureHow a clunky Swedish computer game is teaching millions of children to master the digital world.Supported byAn 11-year-old in dark horn-\u00adrimmed glasses, Jordan is a devotee of Minecraft, the computer game in which you make things out of virtual blocks, from dizzying towers to entire cities. He recently read \u201cThe Maze Runner,\u201d a sci-fi thriller in which teenagers live inside a booby-\u00adtrapped labyrinth, and was inspired to concoct his own version \u2014 something he then would challenge his friends to navigate.Jordan built a variety of obstacles, including a deluge of water and walls that collapsed inward, Indiana Jones-style. But what he really wanted was a trap that behaved unpredictably. That would really throw his friends off guard. How to do it, though? He obsessed over the problem.Then it hit him: the animals! Minecraft contains a menagerie of virtual creatures, some of which players can kill and eat (or tame, if they want pets). One, a red-and-white cowlike critter called a mooshroom, is known for moseying about aimlessly. Jordan realized he could harness the animal\u2019s movement to produce randomness. He built a pen out of gray stones and installed \u201cpressure plates\u201d on the floor that triggered a trap inside the maze. He stuck the mooshroom inside, where it would totter on and off the plates in an irregular pattern.Presto: Jordan had used the cow\u2019s weird behavior to create, in effect, a random-\u00adnumber generator inside Minecraft. It was an ingenious bit of problem-\u00adsolving, something most computer engineers I know would regard as a great hack \u2014 a way of coaxing a computer system to do something new and clever.Since its release seven years ago, Minecraft has become a global sensation, captivating a generation of children. There are over 100 million registered players, and it\u2019s now the third-best-\u00adselling video game in history, after Tetris and Wii Sports. In 2014, Microsoft bought Minecraft \u2014 and Mojang, the Swedish game studio behind it \u2014 for $2.5 billion.There have been blockbuster games before, of course. But as Jordan\u2019s experience suggests \u2014 and as parents peering over their children\u2019s shoulders sense \u2014 Minecraft is a different sort of phenomenon.In this way, Minecraft culture is a throwback to the heady early days of the digital age. In the late \u201970s and \u201980s, the arrival of personal computers like the Commodore 64 gave rise to the first generation of kids fluent in computation. They learned to program in Basic, to write software that they swapped excitedly with their peers. It was a playful renaissance that eerily parallels the embrace of Minecraft by today\u2019s youth. As Ian Bogost, a game designer and professor of media studies at Georgia Tech, puts it, Minecraft may well be this generation\u2019s personal computer.At a time when even the president is urging kids to learn to code, Minecraft has become a stealth gateway to the fundamentals, and the pleasures, of computer science. Those kids of the \u201970s and \u201980s grew up to become the architects of our modern digital world, with all its allures and perils. What will the Minecraft generation become?Playing with blocks, it turns out, has deep cultural roots in Europe. Colin Fanning, a curatorial fellow at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, points out that European philosophers have long promoted block-\u00adbased games as a form of \u201cgood\u201d play that cultivates abstract thought. A recent paper Fanning wrote with Rebecca Mir traces the tradition to the English political philosopher John Locke, who was an early advocate of alphabet blocks. A century later, Friedrich Froebel \u2014 often called the inventor of kindergarten \u2014 developed block-\u00adbased toys that he claimed would illustrate the spiritual connectedness of all things. Children would start with simple blocks, build up to more complex patterns, then begin to see these patterns in the world around them. Educators like Maria Montessori picked up on this concept and pioneered the teaching of math through wooden devices.When Fanning first saw Minecraft, he felt a jolt of recognition. Nearly all these historical \u00adimpulses were evident in the game. \u201cIt\u2019s striking to me how much this mirrors the appeal and the critical reception of Minecraft,\u201d he says. \u201cIn Scandinavian toys, the material of wood has had a really long association with notions of timelessness and quality and craftsmanship.\u201d In Minecraft, as he notes, wood is one of the first resources new players gather upon entering the game: chopping trees with their avatar\u2019s hand produces blocks of wood, and from those they begin to build a civilization. Children are turned loose with tools to transform a hostile environment into something they can live in.\u201cIt\u2019s \u2018Buy the box, open the box, turn to the instruction sheet, make the model, stick it on the shelf, buy the next box,\u2019\u2009\u201d the veteran \u00adgame designer Peter Molyneux says in a 2012 documentary about Minecraft. \u201cLego used to be just a big box of bricks, and you used to take the bricks, pour them on the carpet and then make stuff. And that\u2019s exactly what Minecraft is.\u201dPersson, now 36, was a child of the \u201980s computer scene who learned to program when he was 7 on his father\u2019s Commodore 128. By the time he was in his 20s, he was working for an online photo-\u00adalbum site and programming games in his spare time at home, an apartment littered with game CDs and soda bottles. He released the first version of Minecraft in 2009. The basic play is fairly simple: Each time you start a new game, Minecraft generates a unique world filled with hills, forests and lakes. Whatever the player chops at or digs into yields building blocks \u2014 trees provide wood, the earth dirt and stone. Blocks can be attached to one another to quickly produce structures. Players can also combine blocks to \u201ccraft\u201d new items. Take some stone blocks, add a few pieces of wood, and you make a pickax, which then helps you dig more quickly and deeper, till you reach precious materials like gold, silver and diamond. \u201cMobs,\u201d the game\u2019s creatures (\u201cmob\u201d is short for \u201cmobile\u201d), can be used for crafting, too. Kill a spider, and you get spider silk, handy for making bows and arrows.In its first year, Minecraft found popularity mostly among adult nerds. But sometime in late 2011, according to Alex Leavitt, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Southern California, children discovered it, and sales of the game exploded. Today it costs $27 and sells 10,000 copies a day. (It\u2019s still popular across all age groups; according to Microsoft, the average player is between 28 and 29, and women make up nearly 40 percent of all players.) Persson frequently added new features to the game, like a \u201csurvival mode,\u201d in which every 20 minutes evening falls and monsters attack \u2014 skeletons shooting arrows, \u201ccreepers\u201d blowing themselves up when they get close to you \u2014 forcing players to build protective shelters. (\u201cCreative mode\u201d is just about making things.)Persson also made it possible for players to share their works. You could package your world as a \u201cmap\u201d and post it online for others to download and move around in. Even more sophisticated players could modify Minecraft\u2019s code, creating new types of blocks and creatures, and then put these \u201cmods\u201d online for others to use. Further developments included a server version of Minecraft that lets people play together on the Internet inside the same world. These days, kids can pay as little as $5 a month to rent such a server. They can also visit much larger commercial servers capable of hosting hundreds or thousands of players simultaneously. There is no single, central server: Thousands exist worldwide.The game was a hit. But Persson became unsettled by his fame, as well as the incessant demands of his increasingly impassioned fans \u2014 who barraged him with emails, tweets and forum posts, imploring him to add new elements to Minecraft, or complaining when he updated the game and changed something. By 2014, he\u2019d had enough. After selling Minecraft to Microsoft, he hunkered down in a $70 million mansion in Beverly Hills and now refuses to talk about Minecraft any more.I wanted to know whether the European tradition of block-play had influenced him, but Persson politely declined to be interviewed. Via a public reply to me on Twitter, he explained that he \u201csold Minecraft to get away from it.\u201dThese AND and OR gates are, in virtual form, the same as the circuitry you\u2019d find inside a computer chip. They\u2019re also like the Boolean logic that programmers employ every day in their code. Together, these simple gates let Minecraft players construct machines of astonishing complexity.One day this winter, I met Sebastian, a 14-year-old, at his home in New Jersey, where he showed off his redstone devices. One was a huge \u201ctrading post,\u201d a contraption that allows players on either side of a large wall to trade items through an automated chute. It required a large cluster of AND gates, he said, and took him several days to figure out.\u201cHop down here,\u201d he said, moving down into a subterranean pit beneath the apparatus and looking around. (In Minecraft, you see the world from the viewpoint of your in-game avatar.) It was like being in the bowels of a factory: the redstone sprawled in all directions. He pointed out different parts of the wiring, rattling off components like an architect at a construction site. \u201cComing in from these two wires are the lever inputs from the side \u2014 and from over here, the other side. And what these do is, when they\u2019re both on, they power a piston, which pairs redstone to this block up into this tower dispenser.\u201dMastering redstone requires rigorously logical thinking, as well as a great deal of debugging: When your device isn\u2019t working, you have to carefully go over its circuitry to figure out what\u2019s wrong. One fifth \u00adgrader I visited, Natalie, was assembling a redstone door on her iPad while I watched. But nothing happened when she flicked the \u201con\u201d lever. \u201cI did that wrong,\u201d she said with a frown, and began tracing her way through the circuit. Eventually the problem emerged: A piece of redstone was angled incorrectly, sending the current in the wrong direction.This is what computer scientists call computational thinking, and it turns out to be one of Minecraft\u2019s powerful, if subtle, effects. The game encourages kids to regard logic and if-then statements as fun things to mess around with. It teaches them what computer coders know and wrestle with every day, which is that programs rarely function at first: The work isn\u2019t so much in writing a piece of software but in debugging it, figuring out what you did wrong and coming up with a fix.Minecraft is thus an almost perfect game for our current educational moment, in which policy makers are eager to increase kids\u2019 interest in the \u201cSTEM\u201d disciplines \u2014 science, technology, engineering and math. Schools and governments have spent millions on \u201clet\u2019s get kids coding\u201d initiatives, yet it may well be that Minecraft\u2019s impact will be greater. This is particularly striking given that the game was not designed with any educational purpose in mind. \u201cWe have never done things with that sort of intent,\u201d says Jens Bergensten, the lead Minecraft developer at Mojang and Persson\u2019s first hire. \u201cWe always made the game for ourselves.\u201dOther Minecraft features resemble the work of software engineers even more closely. For example, programmers frequently write code and control their computers through a bare-bones interface known as the \u201ccommand line,\u201d typing abstruse, text-\u00adbased commands rather than pointing and clicking. Many programmers I know complain that while the point-and-click world has made computers easier to use for everyday people, it has also dumbed us down; kids don\u2019t learn the command line the way they would have back when personal-\u00adcomputer use emerged in the \u201970s and \u201980s. This is partly why newcomers can find programming alienating: They\u2019re not accustomed to controlling a computer using only text.But Minecraft, rather audaciously, includes a command line and requires players to figure it out. Type \u201ct\u201d or \u201c/\u201d while playing the game, and a space appears where you can chat with other players or issue commands that alter the environment. For example, typing \u201c/time set 0\u201d instantly changes the time of day inside the game to daybreak; the sun suddenly appears on the horizon. Complex commands require a player to master chains of sophisticated command-\u00adline syntax.One day last fall, I visited Gus, a seventh \u00adgrader in Brooklyn. He was online with friends on a server they share together, engaging in boisterous gladiatorial combat. I watched as he typed a command to endow himself with a better weapon: \u201c/give AdventureNerd bow 1 0 {Unbreakable:1,ench:[{id:51,lvl:1}],display:{Name:\u201cDestiny\u201d}}.\u201d What the command did was give a bow-\u00adand-\u00adarrow weapon to AdventureNerd, Gus\u2019s avatar; make the bow unbreakable; endow it with magic; and name the weapon Destiny, displayed in a tag floating over the weapon. Gus had plastered virtual sticky-\u00adnotes all over his Mac\u2019s desktop listing the text commands he uses most often. Several commands can be packed into a \u201ccommand block,\u201d so that clicking on the block activates them, much as clicking on a piece of software launches it.Mimi Ito, a cultural anthropologist at the University of California, Irvine, and a \u00adfounder of Connected Camps, an online program where kids play Minecraft together, has closely studied gamers and learning. Ito points out that when kids delve into this hackerlike side of the game \u2014 concocting redstone devices or creating command blocks \u2014 they often wind up consulting discussion forums online, where they get advice from adult Minecraft players. These folks are often full-time programmers who love the game, and so younger kids and teenagers wind up in conversation with professionals.\u201cIt\u2019s one of the places where young people are engaging with more expert people who are much older than them,\u201d Ito says. These connections are transformative: Kids get a glimpse of a professional path that their schoolwork never illuminates. \u201cAn adult mentor opens up these new worlds that wouldn\u2019t be open to them,\u201d she adds. Of course, critics might worry about kids interacting with adults online in this way, but as Ito notes, when there\u2019s a productive task at hand, it\u2019s similar to how guilds have passed on knowledge for ages: knowledgeable adults mentoring young people.Ito has also found that kids\u2019 impulse to tinker with Minecraft pushes them to master real-world technical skills. One 15-year-old boy I interviewed, Eli, became interested in making \u201ctexture packs.\u201d These are the external shells that wrap around 3-D objects in the game, like a drape thrown over a table: Change the pattern on the drape, and you can change what the object looks like. Designing texture packs prompted Eli to develop sophisticated Photoshop skills. He would talk to other texture-\u00adpack designers on Minecraft forums and get them to send him their Photoshop files so he could see how they did things. He also began teaching himself to draw. \u201cI\u2019d be downloading the mod,\u201d he says, \u201clooking at the original texture and saying, \u2018O.K., how can I make this a little more cartoony?\u2019\u2009\u201d Then he would put his own designs up on the forums to get feedback, which, he discovered, was usually very polite and constructive. \u201cThe community,\u201d he says, \u201cis very helpful.\u201dWhile Minecraft rewards this sort of involvement, it can also be frustrating: Mojang updates Minecraft weekly, and sometimes new updates aren\u2019t compatible with an older version. Players complained to me about waking up to discover that their complex contraptions no longer worked. One player spent weeks assembling a giant roller coaster whose carts were powered by redstone tracks only to have an update change the way rails functioned, and the entire roller-\u00adcoaster mechanism never worked again. Others ruefully described spending months crafting cities on their own multiplayer servers, only to have a server crash and destroy everything.For Ito, this is all a culturally useful part of the experience: Kids become more resilient, both practically and philosophically. \u201cMinecraft is busted, and you\u2019re constantly fixing it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s that home-brew aesthetic. It\u2019s kind of broken all the time. It\u2019s laggy. The kids get used to the idea that it\u2019s broken and you have to mess with it. You\u2019re not complaining to get the corporate overlord to fix it \u2014 you just have to fix it yourself.\u201d This is a useful corrective to other software. \u201cIPhone apps are kind of at the opposite end,\u201d Ito says. \u201cAnd the way that kids react when things are broken in the Apple ecosystem versus the Minecraft ecosystem is totally different. With [Apple] it\u2019s, \u2018Why are they broken?\u2019 Whereas with Minecraft it\u2019s like \u2014 \u2018Oh, they messed with something again, it\u2019s broken, we have to go figure out what they changed.\u2019 There\u2019s a sort of resignation to that the fact that you\u2019re tinkering all the time.\u201dBecause Minecraft is now seven years old, Ian Bogost will soon have students at Georgia Tech who grew up playing the game. The prospect intrigues him. \u201cI\u2019m very curious to see what their attitude to technology is,\u201d he says.Minecraft is an incredibly complex game, but it\u2019s also \u2014 at first \u2014 inscrutable. When you begin, no pop-ups explain what to do; there isn\u2019t even a \u201chelp\u201d section. You just have to figure things out yourself. (The exceptions are the Xbox and Play\u00adStation versions, which in December added tutorials.) This unwelcoming air contrasts with most large games these days, which tend to come with elaborate training sessions on how to move, how to aim, how to shoot. In Minecraft, nothing explains that skeletons will kill you, or that if you dig deep enough you might hit lava (which will also kill you), or even that you can craft a pickax.\u201cIn Minecraft, knowledge becomes social currency,\u201d says Michael Dezuanni, an associate professor of digital media at Queensland University of Technology in Australia. Dezuanni has studied how middle-\u00adschool girls play the game, watching as they engaged in nuanced, Talmudic breakdowns of a particular creation. This is, he realized, a significant part of the game\u2019s draw: It offers many opportunities to display expertise, when you uncover a new technique or strategy and share it with peers.The single biggest tool for learning Minecraft lore is YouTube. The site now has more than 70 million Minecraft videos, many of which are explicitly tutorial. To make a video, players use \u201cscreencasting\u201d software (some of which is free, some not) that records what\u2019s happening on-screen while they play; they usually narrate their activity in voice-\u00adover. The problems and challenges you face in Minecraft are, as they tend to be in construction or architecture, visual and three-\u00addimensional. This means, as many players told me, that video demonstrations have a particularly powerful explanatory force: It\u2019s easiest to learn something by seeing someone else do it. In this sense, the game points to the increasing role of video as a rhetorical tool. (\u201cMinecraft\u201d is the second-\u00admost-\u00adsearched-\u00adfor term on YouTube, after \u201cmusic.\u201d)That includes Ava on Long Island \u2014 who, after being killed by skeletons, began watching \u201csurvival mode\u201d videos to learn how to stay alive. Soon she had mastered that, and also discovered the huge number of YouTube videos in which players review \u201cminigames,\u201d little challenges that some Minecraft devotees design and load onto servers for others to play. (In one popular minigame, for example, players are shown a sculpture made of blocks and then try to copy it exactly in 30 seconds.) For young Minecraft fans, these videos are a staple of their media diet, crowding out TV. Ava\u2019s mother is genially baffled by this. \u201cI don\u2019t understand it,\u201d she told her daughter when I visited them last fall. \u201cWhy are you watching other people play the game? Why don\u2019t you just play?\u201dAva had recently started her own YouTube channel with her friends Aaron and Patrick, where they play and review minigames. Her father set up a high-\u00adquality microphone on a telescoping arm bolted to the computer desk; her sister drew Ava a white sign that says: \u201cRECORDING.\u201d (Its back says: \u201cNOT RECORDING JUST WANT YOU TO BE QUIET.\u201d) As the family\u2019s gray cat wandered around Ava\u2019s keyboard, she dialed up Patrick on a Skype video call.When they record a video, they improvise freestyle banter while playing, and simply start all over again if something goes awry. (Which, Patrick said dryly, \u201chappens often.\u201d) So far they have 19 subscribers and have posted 21 videos.She played a recent video for me, in which they tried to navigate a difficult map filled with lethal, flowing lava. Their conversation is loose and funny; it\u2019s like listening to two talk-\u00adradio hosts, or perhaps the commentary over a game of basketball \u2014 if the commentary were delivered by the athletes themselves, while they play.Considered as a genre, YouTube Minecraft videos are quite strange. They take elements of \u201chow to\u201d TV \u2014 a cooking show, a home-\u00adrenovation show \u2014 and blend them with the vocal style of podcasting, while mixing in a dash of TV shows like \u201cOrange County Choppers,\u201d where ingenious mechanics parade their creations.\u201cI don\u2019t even know that I know how to properly classify them,\u201d says Ryan Wyatt, the head of gaming content for YouTube. Minecraft videos offer a glimpse of the blurring of the line between consumers and creators. Probably two-thirds of the kids I interviewed had started their own Minecraft channels on YouTube. Most of them were happy when even a handful of friends and family watched their videos.\u201cI told my mom, \u2018I\u2019m quitting my paper round,\u2019 and she said, \u2018Why?\u2019 And I said, \u2018I do a YouTube channel, and it\u2019s earning me more.\u2019\u2009\u201d When his mother looked at his channel, she saw it had more than 40,000 subscribers and more monthly traffic than the corporate newspaper sites she consults for.Next year he plans to study computer science in college. \u201cIn the redstone community,\u201d he says, \u201ca lot of people around me are programmers.\u201d Teaching himself coding is much like learning Minecraft, he found; you experiment, ask questions on Internet forums. He described his YouTube channel on his college application, and that, too, \u201cseems to have helped,\u201d he says. The university accepted him without even seeing his final school grades.Most online games don\u2019t require kids to manage the technical aspects of how gamers interact. A hugely popular commercial game like World of Warcraft, for example, is played on a server run by its owner, Blizzard Entertainment. Game companies usually set the rules of what is and isn\u2019t allowed in their games; if you grief others, you might be banned by a corporate overlord. Or the opposite might happen: Abuse might be ignored or policed erratically.But Minecraft is unusual because Microsoft doesn\u2019t control all the servers where players gather online. There is no single Minecraft server that everyone around the world logs onto. Sometimes kids log onto a for-\u00adprofit server to play mini\u00adgames; sometimes they rent a server for themselves and their friends. (Microsoft and Mojang run one such rental service.) Or sometimes they do it free at home: If you and I are in the same room and we both have tablets running Minecraft, I can invite you into my Minecraft world through Wi-Fi.What this means is that kids are constantly negotiating what are, at heart, questions of governance. Will their world be a free-for-all, in which everyone can create and destroy everything? What happens if someone breaks the rules? Should they, like London, employ plug-ins to prevent damage, in effect using software to enforce property rights? There are now hundreds of such governance plug-ins.Seth Frey, a postdoctoral fellow in computational social science at Dartmouth College, has studied the behavior of thousands of youths on Minecraft servers, and he argues that their interactions are, essentially, teaching civic literacy. \u201cYou\u2019ve got these kids, and they\u2019re creating these worlds, and they think they\u2019re just playing a game, but they have to solve some of the hardest problems facing humanity,\u201d Frey says. \u201cThey have to solve the tragedy of the commons.\u201d What\u2019s more, they\u2019re often anonymous teenagers who, studies suggest, are almost 90 percent male (online play attracts far fewer girls and women than single-\u00adplayer mode). That makes them \u201cwhat I like to think of as possibly the worst human beings around,\u201d Frey adds, only half-\u00adjokingly. \u201cSo this shouldn\u2019t work. And the fact that this works is astonishing.\u201dFrey is an admirer of Elinor Ostrom, the Nobel Prize-\u00adwinning political economist who analyzed the often-\u00adunexpected ways that everyday people govern themselves and manage resources. He sees a reflection of her work in Minecraft: Running a server becomes a crash course in how to compromise, balance one another\u2019s demands and resolve conflict.Three years ago, the public library in Darien, Conn., decided to host its own Minecraft server. To play, kids must acquire a library card. More than 900 kids have signed up, according to John Blyberg, the library\u2019s assistant director for innovation and user experience. \u201cThe kids are really a community,\u201d he told me. To prevent conflict, the library installed plug-ins that give players a chunk of land in the game that only they can access, unless they explicitly allow someone else to do so. Even so, conflict arises. \u201cI\u2019ll get a call saying, \u2018This is Dasher80, and someone has come in and destroyed my house,\u2019\u2009\u201d Blyberg says. Sometimes library administrators will step in to adjudicate the dispute. But this is increasingly rare, Blyberg says. \u201cGenerally, the self-\u00adgoverning takes over. I\u2019ll log in, and there\u2019ll be 10 or 15 messages, and it\u2019ll start with, \u2018So-and-so stole this,\u2019 and each message is more of this,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd at the end, it\u2019ll be: \u2018It\u2019s O.K., we worked it out! Disregard this message!\u2019\u2009\u201dSeveral parents and academics I interviewed think Minecraft servers offer children a crucial \u201cthird place\u201d to mature, where they can gather together outside the scrutiny and authority at home and school. Kids have been using social networks like Instagram or Snapchat as a digital third place for some time, but Minecraft imposes different social demands, because kids have to figure out how to respect one another\u2019s virtual space and how to collaborate on real projects.\u201cWe\u2019re increasingly constraining youth\u2019s ability to move through the world around them,\u201d says Barry Joseph, the associate director for digital learning at the American Museum of Natural History. Joseph is in his 40s. When he was young, he and his friends roamed the neighborhood unattended, where they learned to manage themselves socially. Today\u2019s fearful parents often restrict their children\u2019s wanderings, Joseph notes (himself included, he adds). Minecraft serves as a new free-\u00adranging realm.Joseph\u2019s son, Akiva, is 9, and before and after school he and his school friend Eliana will meet on a Minecraft server to talk and play. His son, Joseph says, is \u201cat home but still getting to be with a friend using technology, going to a place where they get to use pickaxes and they get to use shovels and they get to do that kind of building. I wonder how much Minecraft is meeting that need \u2014 that need that all children have.\u201d In some respects, Minecraft can be as much social network as game.Just as Minecraft propels kids to master Photoshop or video-\u00adediting, server life often requires kids to acquire complex technical skills. One 13-year-old girl I interviewed, Lea, was a regular on a server called Total Freedom but became annoyed that its administrators weren\u2019t clamping down on griefing. So she asked if she could become an administrator, and the owners said yes.For a few months, Lea worked as a kind of cop on that beat. A software tool called \u201ccommand spy\u201d let her observe records of what players had done in the game; she teleported miscreants to a sort of virtual \u201ctime out\u201d zone. She was eventually promoted to the next rank \u2014 \u201ctelnet admin,\u201d which allowed her to log directly into the server via telnet, a command-\u00adline tool often used by professionals to manage servers. Being deeply involved in the social world of Minecraft turned Lea into something rather like a professional systems administrator. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to take charge of anybody who\u2019s breaking the rules,\u201d she told me at the time.Not everyone has found the online world of Minecraft so hospitable. One afternoon while visiting the offices of Mouse, a nonprofit organization in Manhattan that runs high-tech programs for kids, I spoke with Tori. She\u2019s a quiet, dry-\u00adwitted 17-year-old who has been playing Minecraft for two years, mostly in single-\u00adplayer mode; a recent castle-\u00adbuilding competition with her younger sister prompted some bickering after Tori won. But when she decided to try an online server one day, other players \u2014 after discovering she was a girl \u2014 spelled out \u201cBITCH\u201d in blocks.She hasn\u2019t gone back. A group of friends sitting with her in the Mouse offices, all boys, shook their heads in sympathy; they\u2019ve seen this behavior \u201ceverywhere,\u201d one said. I have been unable to find solid statistics on how frequently harassment happens in Minecraft. In the broader world of online games, though, there is more evidence: An academic study of online players of Halo, a shoot-\u2019em-up game, found that women were harassed twice as often as men, and in an unscientific poll of 874 self-\u00addescribed online gamers, 63 percent of women reported \u201csex-\u00adbased taunting, harassment or threats.\u201d Parents are sometimes more fretful than the players; a few told me they didn\u2019t let their daughters play online. Not all girls experience harassment in Minecraft, of course \u2014 Lea, for one, told me it has never happened to her \u2014 and it is easy to play online without disclosing your gender, age or name. In-game avatars can even be animals.But for now, its grip is strong. And some are trying to strengthen it further by making it more accessible to lower-\u00adincome children. Mimi Ito has found that the kids who acquire real-world skills from the game \u2014 learning logic, administering servers, making YouTube channels \u2014 tend to be upper middle class. Their parents and after-\u00adschool programs help them shift from playing with virtual blocks to, say, writing code. So educators have begun trying to do something similar, bringing Minecraft into the classroom to create lessons on everything from math to history. Many libraries are installing Minecraft on their computers.One recent afternoon, I visited the Bronx Library Center, a sleek, recently renovated building in a low-\u00adincome part of the borough. A librarian named Katie Fernandez had set up regular Minecraft days for youths, and I watched four boys play together on the library\u2019s server. Fernandez had given them a challenge: Erect a copy of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris in 45 minutes. Three of them began collaborating on one version; a younger boy worked on his own design. The three gently teased one another about their skills. \u201cNo, no, stop!\u201d shouted one, when he noticed another building a foot of the Arc too wide. \u201cRyan, this \u2014 like this!\u201d They debated whether command blocks would speed things up. As the 45th minute approached, they hadn\u2019t quite finished their Arc, so they gleefully stuffed the interior with TNT, detonated it and hopped onto different games.Over in the corner, the fourth boy continued to labor away at his Arc. He told me he often stays up late playing Minecraft with friends; they have built the Statue of Liberty, 1 World Trade Center and even a copy of the very library he was sitting in. His fingers clicked in a blur as he placed angled steps, upside-\u00addown, to mimic the Arc\u2019s beveled top. He sat back to admire his work. \u201cI haven\u2019t blinked for over \u2014 I don\u2019t know how many minutes,\u201d he said. The model was complete, and remarkably realistic.\u201cI\u2019m actually pretty proud of that,\u201d he said with a smile.Clive Thompson is a contributing writer for the magazine and the author of \u201cSmarter Than You Think: How Technology Is Changing Our Minds for the Better.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Revenue, at $20.26 billion, was about $120 million less than expected. Earnings per share, excluding certain items, were $7.50 when the consensus estimate was $7.96.The result: The stock fell about $46, or about 6 percent, in after-hours trading.Shares of Google were priced for perfection, and the first quarter was a little less than perfect. Whether that means anything substantive is more doubtful.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with this company,\u201d said Colin Gillis of BGC Partners. \u201cThey spent a bit more and took in a bit less than we thought, so Mr. Market is having a mood swing. But it was a fine quarter.\u201dThe Silicon Valley company, which reorganized itself into a holding company called Alphabet last year, gets nearly all of its revenue and all its profits from the core Google search and advertising business.Google is in the middle of a multiyear transition from desktop ads to the harder game of mobile ads. In the latest quarter, aggregate cost per click fell 9 percent from a year ago.Revenue from what the company calls \u201cOther Bets\u201d \u2014 including its fiber business and the Nest thermostat \u2014 was $166 million, more than double what it was in the first quarter of 2015.

{"Headline": "Bill Campbell, Coach of Silicon Valley Stars, Dies at 75", "Date": "2016-04-18", "News": "Supported byBill Campbell, one of the most influential background players in Silicon Valley, who was known as \u201ccoach\u201d there for his work advising technology industry stars like Steve Jobs at Apple and Larry Page at Google, died on Monday at his home in Palo Alto, Calif. He was 75.His family said the cause was cancer.Mr. Campbell had exerted a strong influence on Apple and Google, two of the world\u2019s most valuable companies, since the 1980s. Operating in a network of billionaire technology innovators, he was known for making informal but lasting personal connections that helped shape the industry.The term \u201ccoach\u201d was a reference to his days coaching the Columbia University football team from 1974 to 1979 \u2014 he had also played for Columbia \u2014 but it applied as well to his business career.As recently as the end of March, John Doerr, one of the valley\u2019s leading venture capitalists, publicly cited \u201cCoach Bill Campbell\u2019s\u201d advice when Mr. Doerr announced that he would give up his executive role at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and become its first chairman.Mr. Campbell was an Eastman Kodak executive in Europe when he was recruited to Silicon Valley in 1983 by Apple\u2019s chief executive at the time, John Sculley. Mr. Sculley named him vice president of marketing. Mr. Campbell later played a significant role in Apple\u2019s spectacular turnaround when Steve Jobs, who had been fired by Mr. Sculley, returned to the company in 1997. Apple went on to revamp its Mac computer line and introduce the iPod, iPhone and iPad.Mr. Campbell was an Apple director from 1997 until 2014.It was Mr. Doerr who brought Mr. Campbell to Google to serve as an informal adviser to the two founders, Mr. Page and Sergey Brin. Mr. Campbell was instrumental in the hiring of Eric Schmidt to be Google\u2019s chief executive in August 2001.Strikingly, Mr. Campbell\u2019s advisory role was often unpaid, at his insistence; he said he wanted to pay back what he felt was a debt to the nation\u2019s technology region.At Google, for example, he helped shape its leadership for a generation or more but, except for a single stock grant, never had a formal financial relationship with the company, according to Mr. Schmidt, who is now Google\u2019s chairman.\u201cGoogle would not be the company it is today without the influence of Bill Campbell,\u201d Mr. Schmidt said, \u201cand my guess is Apple wouldn\u2019t be, either.\u201dMr. Campbell also worked early on with Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, as well as Ben Horowitz and Marc Andreessen before they founded one of the country\u2019s top venture capital firms, Andreessen Horowitz.Mr. Campbell was deeply involved in Silicon Valley\u2019s start-up culture as well. In 1987 he led a group of Apple executives in setting up a software subsidiary, Claris, with the ultimate goal of spinning the company off as a start-up. When Apple decided not to let Claris become a separate public company, many of the executives, including Mr. Campbell, left.He later became chief executive of Go Corporation, a pioneering tablet computer company that fought a long and ultimately unsuccessful battle with Microsoft. From 1994 until 1998 he was chief executive of Intuit, a personal finance software company.William Vincent Campbell Jr. was born on Aug. 31, 1940, and grew up in Homestead, Pa., near Pittsburgh. He excelled in football in high school.Mr. Campbell ended his coaching career in 1979 with an overall record of 12-41-1. He then went to work for J. Walter Thompson, the advertising agency, before joining Kodak.In 2009, the National Football Foundation and College Hall of Fame announced that its annual award given to the top scholar-athlete would be renamed for Mr. Campbell.He was chairman of Columbia University\u2019s board of trustees from 2005 to 2014 and donated $10 million to help fund the Campbell Sports Center on the university\u2019s campus. As a philanthropist he also donated millions in support of education in the Pennsylvania steel country where he grew up.His survivors include his wife, Eileen Bocci Campbell; a daughter, Margaret; a son, Jim; and his stepchildren, Kevin, Matthew and Kate Bocci.Mr. Campbell was known for his informality. Randy Komisar, a partner at Kleiner Perkins who had been a young lawyer at Apple, recalled Mr. Campbell running down a hall one day and dragging him into a dark conference room to tell him he was starting the software company that would become Claris. Without saying anything about title or compensation, Mr. Campbell looked at him across the table and simply asked, \u201cAre you in, or are you out?\u201dAn obituary last Tuesday about Bill Campbell, an adviser to executives in the technology industry, misstated his history with the tablet computer company Go Corporation. While he was a former chief executive of the company, he did not help found it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Achieving Mindfulness at Work, No Meditation Cushion Required", "Date": "2016-04-23", "News": "Supported byPreoccupationsIn a recent seminar I gave for over 100 business professionals, I asked the participants to play a simple word association game with me: \u201cI say mindfulness, you say ________.\u201d The word that rang out in unison was, of course, \u201cmeditation.\u201dMindfulness, it seems, has become a mainstream business practice and a kind of industry in its own right. Meditation instructors are the new management gurus, and companies including Google, General Electric, Ford Motor and American Express are sending their employees to classes that can run up to $50,000 for a large audience. Many mindfulness apps exist, nearly all of which focus on \u201cmindfulness meditation.\u201dThe proliferation of meditation in the name of mindfulness and the combination of the two terms naturally lead people to equate the two. Mistakenly so.By most definitions, mindfulness is a higher-order attention that involves noticing changes around us and fully experiencing them in real time. This puts us in the present, aware and responsive, making everything fresh and new again.Meditation is simply one of several tools for achieving mindfulness, and in the context of work it may not be the most suitable for many people. For those who, like me, can\u2019t seem to get the hang of meditation, there is good news: You don\u2019t have to meditate to become more mindful.There are two approaches to mindfulness: Eastern and Western. The Eastern view indeed positions meditation as an essential tool to achieving a mindful state. But the Eastern view is more about quieting the mind and suspending thought. This philosophy is almost the complete opposite of the Western view of mindfulness, which centers on active thinking.I would argue that given the speed of change today, it may not be realistic to suspend or stop thinking. Rather, we need to actively think through problems in new ways to achieve innovative, elegant solutions. These will not rain from on high in a meditation session.Both views share the same goal: avoiding mindlessness. When we\u2019re mindless, the past is riding herd over the present. We get trapped in categories created in the past, stuck in rigid perspectives, oblivious to alternative views. This gives us the illusion of certainty.For example, imagine that the numbers in the incorrect Roman numeral equation below are movable sticks. Leaving the plus and equals signs as they are, what is the least number of sticks you would have to move to correct the equation?XI + I = XMost people react immediately with an answer of \u201cone.\u201d But that is a mindless answer, based on knowledge acquired long ago. The optimal answer would be \u201czero,\u201d arrived at by looking at the problem from an alternative perspective. By looking at the problem upside down, you could read the equation literally right to left, so that X (10) = I (one) plus IX (nine). Or you might recognize the visual symmetry, and reflect it in a mirror. By noticing different ways to view the problem, you move from mindless to mindful.This kind of in-the-moment, noticing mindfulness is similar to the concept of the impartial spectator first introduced in the 18th century by Adam Smith, who wrote that we all have access to an \u201cimpartial and well-informed spectator.\u201d This spectator\u2019s form of attention puts us in the present and gives us a more unbiased perspective \u2014 much the way our attention is focused when we travel to a new place, noticing details that the locals take for granted.The key to mindfulness is learning to look at the world in a more conditional way. Understanding that our perspective is merely one among alternative views requires us to embrace uncertainty. When we\u2019re uncertain and unsure, our surroundings become interesting again, like the peculiar little details we notice when we arrive in an unfamiliar place.The most effective technique I\u2019ve found for moving from mindless to mindful without meditation involves a form of self-distancing, and talking to yourself as an objective adviser would. It is achievable in a few simple steps.Suppose you\u2019re facing a situation that\u2019s causing you stress \u2014 perhaps a change at work, a tough problem or an important decision. The first step is to realize that you\u2019ve already made two unwarranted assumptions: that something will happen, and it will be bad. Next, give yourself three reasons the issue you\u2019re worried about might not happen. Notice that it immediately becomes less stressful, because you just went from \u201cit\u2019s going to happen\u201d to \u201cmaybe it will happen, maybe it won\u2019t.\u201dNow give yourself three reasons that, if the situation does turn out bad, good things will happen. Those reasons are easy to find once you ask the question. Now you\u2019ve gone from thinking \u201cthere\u2019s this terrible thing that\u2019s going to happen\u201d to thinking \u201cthere\u2019s this thing that may or may not happen, but if it does, it could have both good and bad outcomes.\u201dIt\u2019s an easy method that leads us to become less reactive to the world \u2014 still responsive, just not reactive. In the end, the entire key to eliminating mindlessness without meditation may simply be realizing that the issue looks different from a different perspective, and then taking that perspective.Matthew E. May is the author of the forthcoming \u201cWinning the Brain Game\u201d (McGraw-Hill Education).Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Swiss City Is \u2018the Silicon Valley of Sports\u2019", "Date": "2016-04-22", "News": "Supported byLAUSANNE, Switzerland \u2014 The Olympic rings decorate everything here, from the train station to the police uniforms, flaunting this city\u2019s identity as the capital of international sports.Their world has been largely independent \u2014 lightly taxed, exempt from Swiss anticorruption laws and boasting its own arbitration court, based in a chateau here. It also generates serious money: Sports organizations bring more than a billion dollars to Switzerland annually, according to a six-year study published in 2015.Lausanne and the Swiss canton, or state, of Vaud are actively recruiting federations to move here \u2014 offering to pay their rent for two years, to help employees house-hunt and to coordinate visa applications \u2014 having committed to filling a new office building by 2018.\u201cWe\u2019re the Silicon Valley of sports,\u201d said Sabrina Attias, delegate for international sport for the city of Lausanne. \u201cFor a long time, we didn\u2019t have to do anything to attract them. Then we realized the opportunities and decided to be proactive.\u201dTen years ago, the city, together with the state and the I.O.C., built an office complex called the Maison du Sport International, a sort of corporate Olympic Village that houses dozens of governing bodies \u2014 archery, boxing and weight lifting share a building \u2014 as well as other important organizations, like the World Anti-Doping Agency.The venture has been so successful, with a waiting list for office space, that a four-story fourth building is under construction. With two years until it opens, the government has promised developers that it will fill 80 percent of the new offices, causing city workers like Ms. Attias to hustle to woo more tenants.\u201cIt\u2019s a risk, but we\u2019re going to succeed,\u201d she said, pointing proudly to the complex\u2019s amenities: colorful common areas evoking Google\u2019s headquarters; a gym and adjacent soccer fields and tennis courts; and a carnotzet, or traditional Swiss-French wine cellar with the air of a speakeasy.Officials are confident that a new law criminalizing bribery and corruption in sports federations, which were previously immune from investigation unless they requested it, will not dull the appeal of Switzerland once it takes effect in July.Beyond the magnetism of the I.O.C., sports organizations have long been attracted to Switzerland for its political neutrality, geographic centrality, favorable tax structure and friendliness to private arbitration, said Lucien W. Valloni, a sports lawyer in Zurich.But Lausanne and the canton government have sweetened the pot with more incentives yet: Any federation that relocates to the city, as a tenant in the Maison du Sport or elsewhere, receives two years of free rent, permanent exemption from taxes and help from Ms. Attias and her team with tasks like finding places for employees to live and securing permits to work in Switzerland.Some organizations have followed the path of the Sailing Federation, which in 2014 opened an office in Lausanne while maintaining its headquarters in Southampton, England. Others, like the International Basketball Federation, moved to the region from other parts of Switzerland.Lausanne, now a city of roughly 140,000 people, has seen its population grow along the way, by about 10 percent in the last decade.More than a dozen other federations, including cash-flush FIFA, have their headquarters elsewhere in the country, making for roughly 65 sports organizations in Switzerland.The organizations are particularly beneficial to the Swiss economy, Mr. Stricker said, because they make the vast majority of their revenue outside Switzerland while spending a significant amount within the country and inspiring further spending. For every Swiss franc a sports organization spends in Switzerland, Mr. Stricker\u2019s study found, the local economy sees an impact of 1.55 francs.But recognizing that the number of federations to recruit is not limitless, the Swiss have also set their sights on regional associations \u2014 European sports confederations, for instance \u2014 and other sports associations or businesses, like the International World Games Association, which opened an office last year.Even after successfully attracting organizations to the region, the government is increasingly focused on making sure they stay. Ms. Attias invoked a roster of events: seminars, ballet outings, ski trips in the Alps and an annual dinner for top sports federation officials and Swiss government officials, including the country\u2019s president, to socialize.Roland Rino B\u00fcchel, a member of the Swiss Parliament who spearheaded the recent legislation in Switzerland, called such coziness dangerous. \u201cCan you imagine if the same police raid that happened at FIFA happened at the I.O.C.?\u201d he said. \u201cA policeman with the I.O.C. logo on his sleeve has to search the I.O.C.\u201dMr. B\u00fcchel said that before the new law passed, he feared that sports organizations could damage the reputation of Switzerland. \u201cPeople think of FIFA on the same level as the banks,\u201d he said. \u201cBut come July, this nice life will be over for federations.\u201dSwitzerland has also newly classified sports officials as so-called politically exposed persons, recognizing them as prominent public figures at greater risk for bribery and corruption. That new standing subjects sports officials and their friends and relatives to financial scrutiny and corruption investigations.Even in the face of such new measures, Mr. Valloni, the Swiss lawyer, said he thought it impossible for sports associations to operate so flexibly elsewhere. \u201cSwiss law is very, very liberal,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no other place that would be so favorable.\u201dIf such a place did exist, Mr. B\u00fcchel said, \u201cGood luck to the country that says to the sports federations: \u2018Leave Switzerland because you can\u2019t be corrupt there anymore.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAdvertisement"}

So when Google sought several artist collaborators for the launch of Tilt Brush \u2014 its just-released technology that allows users to \u201cpaint,\u201d employing two hand-held controllers and a VR headset, in virtual-reality 3D \u2014 Yellin was a natural choice. He received early access to the technology (Jeff Koons did, too) and has been working with it for about a month, during which time he\u2019s spent many hours in the virtual studio, creating and exploring awesomely complicated virtual works. (He\u2019s also, he said, made many requests of and suggestions to the developers.)\u201cFor me, it was such a perfect thing,\u201d Yellin said. \u201cI work in space and through space. So in a way, this was cool, because it kind of put me inside one of my works.\u201d With the headset on in his studio, it really did feel that way \u2014 wandering around one of the pieces he\u2019d created, experiencing it from within and without, was almost as much fun as painting my own. \u201cIt\u2019s such a totally different kind of practice,\u201d he said, compared to the cutting, pasting and assembling that go into his usual work. \u201cBut as this evolves, and I might be able to scan pieces of collage and maybe video and things like that, this is going to get bananas. But even now, what a way for me to make a sketch, or practice an idea that I\u2019m thinking about or test space.\u201dBy this point, Yellin is more or less synonymous with Pioneer Works, and the Tilt Brush collaboration involves the center, too. The headset and software Yellin has been using will live in its tech lab, so that artists in residency there can create new virtual work. And at Sunday night\u2019s Pioneer Works Village F\u00eate, its annual spring fund-raiser, one of the galleries in the space will be equipped with three VR stations, giving guests the opportunity both to explore the works Yellin has created and to try their hand at creating their own.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama\u2019s Latest View on Secrecy Overlooks Past Prosecution of Leaks", "Date": "2016-04-11", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 When President Obama defended Hillary Clinton\u2019s email practices in a television interview over the weekend by saying, \u201cthere\u2019s classified, and then there\u2019s classified,\u201d he was only repeating what critics of government secrecy have long contended: that most of what is classified is merely sensitive, a little embarrassing or perhaps a policy debate still in progress.But these are distinctions the Obama administration has not necessarily made in its treatment of classified information when dealing with news organizations, whistle-blowers or government officials accused of leaking information.The White House has overseen some nine leak prosecutions, compared with just three under all previous presidents, drawing sharp criticism from news media advocates. The administration denounced the huge trove of confidential State Department cables released by WikiLeaks as damaging to American diplomacy, and it created task forces to counter Edward J. Snowden\u2019s revelations about the National Security Agency \u2013 some of which involved genuine secrets, and some of which did not.\u201cIf you\u2019re on trial for unauthorized disclosure of classified information, you don\u2019t get to say, \u2018there\u2019s classified, and then there\u2019s classified,\u2019 \u201d said Steven Aftergood, who directs the Project on Government Secrecy for the Federation of American Scientists.The president, Mr. Aftergood said, may have been simply stating the truth about the subjective nature of the classification process. But his statement, delivered on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Mr. Aftergood said, \u201cfailed to grapple with the fact that a bunch of people in his administration have been caught up in a meat-grinder as a result of classification policy.\u201dDuring the Obama administration, a midlevel State Department official was prosecuted for telling a Fox News reporter that North Korea would most likely react to sanctions with more nuclear tests. The former director of the C.I.A., David H. Petraeus, was prosecuted for giving his mistress, who was writing a biography of him, notebooks full of classified information, though he received a light sentence, which may have reflected the view that little in the notebooks was still operationally important.There is no evidence that Mrs. Clinton disclosed classified information while she was secretary of state; she says that nothing she sent or received was even marked as classified at the time. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is probing whether any classified information was mishandled as a result of her use of a personal email address and computer server.Speaking about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s case, Mr. Obama said, \u201cThere\u2019s stuff that is really top-secret, top-secret, and there\u2019s stuff that is being presented to the president or the secretary of state that you might not want on the transom, or going out over the wire, but is basically stuff that you could get\u201d from unclassified sources.But after more than seven years in office, the administration has only recently gotten serious about curbing the reflex to stamp \u201csecret\u201d or \u201ctop secret\u201d on the cables that flow each day from embassies to the State Department, or course through the Pentagon.In fact, Mr. Obama\u2019s distinction between genuine secrets and vaguely secret material echoes arguments that The New York Times and other news media organizations made after the WikiLeaks disclosures, some of which were published in The Times. A substantial percentage of the 250,000 cables consisted of articles published in local news media. As officials entered them into the State Department\u2019s system, many were marked \u201cclassified,\u201d even though they could be found in simple Google searches.Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama, in those days, did not see much distinction among classified documents. She said then that publishing the cables would \u201ctear at the fabric\u201d of alliances, and particularly objected to the publication of \u201cany information that was intended to be confidential, including private discussions between counterparts or our diplomats\u2019 personal assessments and observations.\u201dSome officials predicted that foreign leaders would never again have confidential conversations with their American counterparts. That turned out not to be the case, though many diplomats now say they put more information into private emails, or intelligence channels, and avoid the State Department\u2019s official cable system.Mr. Obama, Mrs. Clinton and other officials now find themselves making a more nuanced argument \u2014 that just because something is technically classified does not mean it is damaging. Consider, for example, the exchanges between Mrs. Clinton and several of her top aides on the July 4 holiday in 2009, just six months into the administration. The emails were among the 30,000 that the State Department released under a court order in response to a Freedom of Information Act request.North Korea had just launched a ballistic missile, an occurrence that has become so common that it barely warrants a Situation Room meeting. Various aides offered assessments, all of which have now been redacted \u2014 though the State Department noted that many of the facts discussed had been published by news organizations. The redaction argument, department officials say, was won by the intelligence agencies, which feared that some of the information came from satellite surveillance.It turned out that this intelligence was published days after the exchange of emails, meaning that the data sent to Mrs. Clinton could not have come from those sources. Still, those sections of her emails have been deleted, at least for now, while the agencies continue the argument.Scott Shane in Washington contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Now the company is taking steps to ensure its founder remains in charge.Mr. Zuckerberg on Wednesday cited the Silicon Valley mantra of founders in explaining the new class of stock, calling Facebook a \u201cfounder-led company.\u201d In a conference call, he added, \u201cFacebook has been built on a series of bold moves. When I look out on the future, I see more bold moves ahead of us, not behind us.\u201dFacebook\u2019s shares, which are up more than 33 percent over the past year, soared 9 percent in after-hours trading.The new C shares effectively allow Mr. Zuckerberg to maintain 60 percent of voting power while still giving away large amounts of stock. Under the proposal, all holders of Facebook stock will get two C shares for each A or B share that they own. Importantly, the C shares come with no voting power. Holders of A shares are entitled to one vote per share, while holder of B shares have 10 votes a share.That means Mr. Zuckerberg, as the majority owner of Facebook shares, will obtain a large amount C shares that he can then donate without diluting his voting power in the company.\u201cIt is a rational, if somewhat eyebrow-raising way, for founders to distribute wealth without giving up operating control of the company,\u201d said Lise Buyer, founder of the Class V Group, which advises start-ups on initial public offerings. \u201cThis structure will continue to allow Facebook to make decisions that may not always look great in the short term, but may pay off for investors over time.\u201dFacebook\u2019s C shares may trade at a slight discount to A shares, which would still have one vote. Most investors currently hold A shares, which only have about a quarter of the overall shareholders\u2019 voting power, so they may not be forgoing much if they choose to sell their A shares versus their C shares.\u201cIt\u2019s almost like voting Republican in Massachusetts \u2014 you can do it, but it won\u2019t affect the outcome,\u201d said Rick Kline, a partner in the technology and capital markets practice of law firm Goodwin Procter.Investors getting new C shares will not gain economically because the same proportion of new stock will be given to all holders.Facebook, in contrast, has figured out how to wring billions of dollars from its members on mobile devices and other platforms, making the company\u2019s revenue-generation machine unstoppable.And while growth in new users on Facebook has slowed in recent years, the total is still getting larger. Facebook said 1.65 billion people visited the site on a monthly basis in the first quarter, up from 1.44 billion a year earlier. More than 1.5 billion people are monthly mobile-only users, up from 1.25 billion a year ago.Facebook\u2019s other big bets like WhatsApp, the messaging service, and Oculus, its virtual reality play, have yet to pay off with immense new revenue streams. But Facebook is comfortable gathering a critical mass of users \u2014 nearly a billion in WhatsApp\u2019s case \u2014 and then introducing advertising later on when it makes more sense.\u201cTo me, this is like Google 10 years ago,\u201d said Mark Mahaney, an Internet analyst at RBC Capital. \u201cThey really had such momentum, and they\u2019re proving how valuable they are to both advertisers and consumers.\u201dMike Isaac reported from San Francisco and Leslie Picker from New York.

{"Headline": "How \u2018Empowerment\u2019 Became Something for Women to Buy", "Date": "2016-04-12", "News": "Supported byFirst WordsAt my day job as an editor at a women\u2019s website, I receive a daily mess of emails promoting random products and activities as \u201cempowering.\u201d Recent offerings include the Pure Barre workout, divorce, Miley Cyrus, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ancient Egyptian sex rites, leggings, sending nude photos, receiving nude photos, declining to send or receive nude photos, doing stand-up comedy and purchasing full-bottomed lingerie. The mix of things presumed to transmit and increase female power is without limit yet still depressingly limiting.\u201cEmpowerment\u201d wasn\u2019t always so trivialized, or so corporate, or even so clamorously attached to women. Four decades ago, the word had much more in common with Latin American liberation theology than it did with \u201cLean In.\u201d In 1968, the Brazilian academic Paulo Freire coined the word \u201cconscientization,\u201d empowerment\u2019s precursor, as the process by which an oppressed person perceives the structural conditions of his oppression and is subsequently able to take action against his oppressors.Eight years later, the educator Barbara Bryant Solomon, writing about American black communities, gave this notion a new name, \u201cempowerment.\u201d It was meant as an ethos for social workers in marginalized communities, to discourage paternalism and encourage their clients to solve problems in their own ways. Then in 1981, Julian Rappaport, a psychologist, broadened the concept into a political theory of power that viewed personal competency as fundamentally limitless; it placed faith in the individual and laid at her feet a corresponding amount of responsibility too.Sneakily, empowerment had turned into a theory that applied to the needy while describing a process more realistically applicable to the rich. The word was built on a misaligned foundation; no amount of awareness can change the fact that it\u2019s the already-powerful who tend to experience empowerment at any meaningful rate. Today \u201cempowerment\u201d invokes power while signifying the lack of it. It functions like an explorer staking a claim on new territory with a white flag.Enter the highly marketable \u201cwomen\u2019s empowerment,\u201d neither practice nor praxis, nor really theory, but a glossy, dizzying product instead. Women\u2019s empowerment borrows the virtuous window-dressing of the social worker\u2019s doctrine and kicks its substance to the side. It\u2019s about pleasure, not power; it\u2019s individualistic and subjective, tailored to insecurity and desire. The new empowerment doesn\u2019t increase potential so much as it assures you that your potential is just fine. Even when the thing being described as \u201cempowering\u201d is personal and mildly defiant (not shaving, not breast-feeding, not listening to men, et cetera), what\u2019s being mar\u00adketed is a certain identity. And no matter what, the intent of this new empowerment is always to sell.This consumption-and-conference empowerment dilutes the word to pitch-speak, and the concept to something that imitates rather than alters the structures of the world. This version of empowerment can be actively disempowering: It\u2019s a series of objects and experiences you can purchase while the conditions determining who can access and accumulate power stay the same. The ready partici\u00adpation of well-off women in this strat\u00adegy also points to a deep truth about the word \u201cempowerment\u201d: that it has never been defined by the people who actually need it. People who talk empowerment are, by definition, already there.I am right in this word\u2019s target demographic, being young, female, educated and upwardly mobile. I work at a women\u2019s website. I love raises and underwear and voting. And still, I have never said \u201cempowerment\u201d sincerely or heard it from a single one of my friends. The formulation has been diluted to something representational and bloodless \u2014 an architectural rendering of a building that will never be built.But despite its nonexistence in honest conversation, \u201cempowerment\u201d goes on thriving. It\u2019s uniquely marketable, like the female body, which is where women\u2019s empowerment is forced to live. On March 8, International Women\u2019s Day, Kim Kardashian posted an essay on the topic to her subscription-only website, in response to the backlash over a naked selfie she had posted \u2014 criticism leveled mainly by women who drink their empowerment a different way.\u201cI am empowered by my body,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI am empowered by my sexuality.\u201d Quickly, her focus turned global: \u201cI hope that through this platform I have been given, I can encourage the same empowerment for girls and women all over the world.\u201dOn that day, corporate empowerment came to a teleological summit in the hands of Kardashian, who\u2019s not as different from Sheryl Sandberg as she may seem. Like Sandberg, Kardashian is the apotheosis of a particular brand of largely contentless feminism, a celebratory form divorced from material politics, which makes it palatable \u2014 maybe irresistible \u2014 to the business world.The mistake would be to locate further empowerment in choosing between the two. Corporate empowerment \u2014 as well as the lightweight, self-exculpatory feminism it rides on \u2014 feeds rav\u00adenously on the distracting performance of identity, that buffet of false opposition. Sandberg and Kardashian are perceived by most to be opposites, two aesthetically distinct brands fighting for our allegiance, when each has pioneered a similar, punish\u00adingly individualistic, market-driven understanding of women\u2019s worth, responsibility and strength. In the world of women\u2019s empowerment, they say the same thing differently: that our radical capability is mainly our ability to put money in the bank.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Media Websites Battle Faltering Ad Revenue and Traffic", "Date": "2016-04-17", "News": "Supported byThis month, Mashable, a site that had just raised $15 million, laid off 30 people. Salon, a web publishing pioneer, announced a new round of budget cuts and layoffs. And BuzzFeed, which has been held up as a success story, was forced to bat back questions about its revenue \u2014 but not before founders at other start-up media companies received calls from anxious investors.The trouble, the publishers say, is twofold. The web advertising business, always unpredictable, became more treacherous. And website traffic plateaued at many large sites, in some cases falling \u2014 a new and troubling experience after a decade of exuberant growth.Online publishers have faced numerous financial challenges in recent years, including automated advertising and ad-blocking tools. But now, there is a realization that something more profound has happened: The transition from an Internet of websites to an Internet of mobile apps and social platforms, and Facebook in particular, is no longer coming \u2014 it is here.It is a systemic change that is leaving many publishers unsure of how they will make money.\u201cWith each turn of the screw, people began to realize, viscerally, that this is what it feels like to not be in control of your destiny,\u201d said Scott Rosenberg, a co-founder of Salon who left the company in 2007.Audiences drove the change, preferring to refresh their social feeds and apps instead of visiting website home pages. As social networks grew, visits to websites in some ways became unnecessary detours, leading to the weakened traffic numbers for news sites. Sales staffs at media companies struggled to explain to clients why they should buy ads for a fragmented audience rather than go to robust social networks instead.Advertisers adjusted spending accordingly. In the first quarter of 2016, 85 cents of every new dollar spent in online advertising will go to Google or Facebook, said Brian Nowak, a Morgan Stanley analyst.The power shift was made clear last week as the Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg took the stage for the company\u2019s annual developer conference. He stood in front of a diagram outlining an audacious 10-year expansion plan, which included several features to help keep people inside Facebook\u2019s world instead of following links out.\u201cMessenger is going to be the next big platform for sharing privately, and for helping you connect with services in all kinds of new ways,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said, after demonstrating a CNN chat bot on stage.At the same time, publishers pored over a report from the analytics firm Parse.ly, detailing how important Facebook had become to their business: Among sites tracked by the firm, more than 40 percent of web traffic came from the social network.Facebook\u2019s users seem to be following Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s lead. NewsWhip, which tracks how publishers are performing across major Internet platforms, says the rate at which links to outside websites are shared on Facebook, compared with videos and Instant Articles, has declined.Liam Corcoran, NewsWhip\u2019s communications director, says that in recent months a wide range of publishers have called him to ask whether sudden drops in Facebook reach are widespread, and asking how they might be remedied \u2014 as if they were asking how to cure a disease.\u201cIt\u2019s a doctor\u2019s office,\u201d he said.So far, publishers are responding in a variety of ways. With the help of venture capital funding, companies like BuzzFeed and Vox are investing heavily in video production with a focus on TV and film. Others, like Mashable, are diverting resources to increasing their audience on Facebook, hoping that enough money \u2014 through revenue-sharing arrangements with the company \u2014 will follow.\u201cWe invest in a number of strategies, then figure out which strategies are most effective,\u201d Pete Cashmore, Mashable\u2019s founder, said in an interview.Others are planning to do less with less. \u201cWe talk about our business as though we\u2019re in a shrinking market, and plan accordingly,\u201d said Alex Magnin, chief revenue officer at Thought Catalog, an essay site.Online news sites have watched the rise of social platforms closely. Publishers have started in recent years to obsessively monitor the ways in which their readers arrived at their sites. The sheer speed with which Facebook, Twitter, Google and Snapchat have come to dominate the landscape has taken publishers by surprise.In 2014, Gawker Media\u2019s founder, Nick Denton, wrote a memo to his staff that admonished them for giving in too fully to the influence of platforms, which drove many of his company\u2019s most popular stories. \u201cWe \u2014 the freest journalists on the planet \u2014 were slaves to the Facebook algorithm,\u201d he wrote.Looking back at 2015, however, Mr. Denton, once known for harsh assessments of the media business, struck a conciliatory tone.\u201cThe Instant Articles deal seems great,\u201d he said in an interview last week. \u201cUsers get relevant stories and relevant ads. It\u2019s the realization of that particular Internet dream.\u201dMr. Denton said he was hopeful, like many publishers, that deep \u201cniche\u201d brands have something to offer advertisers. E-commerce partnerships, in which publishers are paid commissions by retailers for products recommended, or mentioned, on their sites, now cover the company\u2019s editorial spending. The arrangement largely sidesteps social networks, but relies on agreements with another huge partner: Amazon.Other companies are looking to focus more on branded content like videos, sponsored stories and full-fledged campaigns. But publishers have quickly learned that those efforts are labor-intensive and put them in direct competition with advertising agencies.Mr. Malik of Gigaom, whose site employed 85 people at its peak, said if he were to start the business today, it would probably be a Facebook page. There is an opportunity, clearly, to reach people there.Money? That\u2019s another matter.\u201cHow do I monetize?\u201d he asked. \u201cStill not clear.\u201dJim Rutenberg contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

For almost two years, European Union citizens have been able to apply to have links to certain web search results taken down. As over 90 percent of Europe\u2019s search market belongs to Google, this is primarily a law about what Google can track and link the public to.So who is deciding the merits of applications to be \u201cforgotten\u201d? More than anyone else, Google. How do they decide whether the application is warranted? Google won\u2019t say.European Union officials appear to think Google is acting fairly, but that doesn\u2019t answer the question of why Google should be policing itself. The answer to that appears to be that no one else has the money and know-how to effectively do the job.As the Internet gets to be a bigger part of everyone\u2019s lives, it may increasingly be that only the biggest Internet companies can do Internet-scale tasks. Google already appears to have the world\u2019s largest commercial network of computers.To some extent, it\u2019s the same for Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook. It would be interesting to see whether Alibaba and Baidu have more computational and data power than the Chinese government.Much the way it curates much of what happens on the Internet, Google has spent years scanning books to create its searchable corpus. For better or worse, few people would want those things destroyed, or made inaccessible.

{"Headline": "IPhone Sales Drop, and Apple\u2019s 13-Year Surge Ebbs", "Date": "2016-04-26", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 From the iPod to the iPhone to the iPad, Apple created more than a decade\u2019s worth of new gadgets to fuel its historic growth.But the technology company\u2019s dazzling 13-year run of quarterly revenue growth ended on Tuesday \u2014 a casualty of Apple\u2019s already immense size, weakness in key global markets like China and the lack of another hot product to pry open the wallets of customers.Nearly half of the smartphones sold in the United States are iPhones, and Apple may be reaching the saturation point among potential customers in other developed countries. Rival smartphone makers using Google\u2019s Android operating system continue to challenge the company with powerful, less expensive devices.Over all, Apple sold 16 percent fewer iPhones in the quarter compared with the same quarter last year.\u201cThere\u2019s no question that Apple\u2019s best days are behind it,\u201d said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at the Bernstein brokerage firm. \u201cThe company grew at astronomical rates, and it\u2019s now so big that its ability to grow at those rates doesn\u2019t exist anymore.\u201dApple\u2019s disappointing quarter is the latest in a string of bad reports from the biggest technology companies. While the reasons vary \u2014 including the long slump in personal computer sales and slipping prices for online ads \u2014 a common theme has been that as these companies have grown into giants, it has become harder and harder to keep up the momentum.Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, described the decline as a \u201cpause,\u201d not a fundamental change in the company\u2019s business.\u201cThis, too, shall pass,\u201d he said in a call with Wall Street analysts to discuss the results. \u201cThe future of Apple is very bright.\u201dApple\u2019s forecast for the current quarter did not make Wall Street more confident. The company projected revenue of $41 billion to $43 billion. That is much worse than Wall Street had been predicting.Amit Daryanani, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said that Apple may be entering a period of slowing replacement sales, similar to what happened in the personal computer market a decade ago.Mr. Daryanani also noted that many companies had been hurt by the strong dollar, which makes American products more expensive overseas. \u201cIt\u2019s a common theme across technology companies,\u201d he said.Mr. Cook portrayed the slowdown as part of the normal two-year product cycle of Apple\u2019s iPhone. The company\u2019s larger iPhone 6 line, introduced in 2014, led to a surge in sales last year as customers upgraded, sending Apple\u2019s stock to a record high.\u201cIf you look at our installed base of iPhones today versus two years ago, it\u2019s increased 80 percent,\u201d he said.Apple\u2019s newest phone, the four-inch iPhone SE, went on sale March 31 \u2014 too late to affect the second quarter\u2019s results \u2014 and Mr. Cook said that there was more demand for it than Apple could currently fill.Apple has high hopes for some of its consumer-oriented services, such as Apple Music and iCloud, as well as for its nascent Watch accessory, but those have yet to turn into giant businesses. Apple said first-year sales of the Watch exceeded first-year sales of the original iPhone, but declined to provide specific figures.The iPad tablet, once a powerful revenue generator for the company, has had disappointing sales in recent years, despite new, larger professional versions. But Mr. Cook said iPad sales would improve in the current quarter.Apple still generates tens of billions of dollars of cash every year. And the company said Tuesday that it would pass along more of that money to its shareholders. Apple said it would raise its quarterly dividend 10 percent to 57 cents a share and increase the amount of stock it buys back to $175 billion.Apple\u2019s services segment was one bright spot in the quarter, with revenue up 20 percent. The company ended the quarter with $233 billion in cash and marketable securities.\u201cWhen we look at the dynamics of the iPhone business, we feel very good,\u201d Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, said in a telephone interview. Although unit sales were down 16 percent, \u201cwe continue to draw millions of people that are buying their first smartphone to iPhone.\u201dDenny Fish, a portfolio manager at the Janus Global Technology Fund, said Tuesday that the fund sold some of its position in Apple in the first quarter, citing the company\u2019s growth challenges and worries about its position in China.Apple, which is based in Cupertino, Calif., is expected to introduce other iPhones this year, which could give sales a jolt.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With a Stand-Alone App, Starz Looks Beyond the Cable Bundle", "Date": "2016-04-04", "News": "Supported byAnd then there was Starz.The hot and crowded market of subscription streaming services will get yet another entrant on Tuesday when Starz, the premium TV network, plans to introduce a stand-alone app available on Apple and Google devices.Aimed at the 20 million homes that pay for broadband but not the full cable TV bundle, the new service, which costs $9 a month, will offer Starz original series like \u201cOutlander\u201d and \u201cPower,\u201d as well as thousands of TV episodes and movies, including Disney\u2019s blockbuster \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens\u201d later this year.The development puts a renewed spotlight on Starz, which has surpassed its rival Showtime to become the second-largest premium TV network in the country behind HBO. Now it is seeking to expand its footprint even more by making the network available outside the traditional pay TV model, as HBO has with HBO Now, and other media companies have with similar services.At the same time, Starz has been the subject of on-again-off-again merger and acquisition chatter since 2013, when it spun off from the billionaire John C. Malone\u2019s Liberty Media. Mr. Malone, known for his deal making, has spoken publicly about what he sees as the need for consolidation of what he calls \u201cfree radicals\u201d in the media industry.Creating a stand-alone streaming service has been a long time in the making for Chris Albrecht, who took over as chief executive of Starz in January 2010.Previously, Mr. Albrecht was the chief executive of HBO, where he helped assemble a slate of signature series like \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d \u201cThe Wire\u201d and \u201cSex and the City.\u201d During that time, he said, he started exploring the idea of creating a \u201clighter\u201d service that HBO could sell directly to consumers, outside traditional cable or satellite packages.\u201cI like to think it was because I was really smart,\u201d he said, but he instead credited people he hired \u201cwho knew about the space and thought about the way people are going to consume content.\u201dThey said, \u201cThis is something that we should be doing and we should be first,\u201d he recalled.\u201cOther companies that are out there might not now exist if we had done that then,\u201d he added, hinting at the rise of Netflix and of Amazon\u2019s streaming service.Starz had only just started experimenting with original programming, with projects like \u201cParty Down\u201d and \u201cSpartacus.\u201d The flagship network at the time counted about 17 million subscribers and had struck a programming deal with Netflix that Mr. Albrecht described as an \u201calbatross around our neck.\u201d That deal \u201cdid a great job in helping launch Netflix,\u201d he said.The company has changed significantly since then. In 2013, Starz was spun off from Liberty into an independent, publicly traded company. It has also raised its profile with critically acclaimed programs like \u201cOutlander,\u201d based on the best-selling novel about a World War II-era British Army nurse, and \u201cPower,\u201d produced by the rapper Curtis Jackson, better known as 50 Cent, about a New York nightclub owner and drug kingpin.Starz now has about 23.6 million subscribers, according to SNL Kagan, slightly ahead of Showtime\u2019s 23.4 million. HBO, the leading premium channel, has 32.5 million subscribers. Those figures do not include subscribers to their streaming services.Amy Yong, a media analyst with Macquarie, said subscriber numbers were growing for Starz largely because cable and satellite companies get big incentives to sell its subscriptions.Starz is estimated to capture about $4 a subscriber, with the rest of the subscription fee going to cable and satellite companies.\u201cThey are happy to be partners with cable companies,\u201d Ms. Yong said, at a time when many media companies find themselves in heated disputes with cable operators over rights fees.Total revenues for the company increased 2 percent in 2015 to $1.7 billion, with net income down 12 percent to $237 million, primarily because of increased programming and marketing costs. Analysts expect the expiration of a programming deal with Disney to deliver cost savings in the future.Despite the strides Starz has made, it still suffers a perception problem compared with HBO and Showtime, whose shows \u2014 like \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and \u201cHomeland\u201d \u2014 can become part of the cultural conversation. \u201cEveryone knows and recognizes HBO, and consumers can rattle off the last couple of shows on that network,\u201d Ms. Yong said. \u201cStarz still hasn\u2019t found that voice with the consumer. They don\u2019t have any recognizable hits, but they are getting there.\u201d\u201cIt is like they tied one of their legs to ours, tied an anchor around the other leg and threw the anchor off the boat,\u201d Mr. Albrecht said.\u201cIt was certainly distressing to see that and not a lot of fun since then,\u201d he added. \u201cWe can show the ways that we can continue to evolve through the lines of business that we have, as well as creating new ones. We\u2019re going to show a company that is worth investing in.\u201dOne major focus is the new app, which offers downloads of most content and allows four people to stream simultaneously. People who already subscribe to Starz through a traditional pay TV provider also will be able to use the app, which initially will be available on Apple and Google devices, with other future partners expected.In a statement, an Apple spokeswoman said, \u201cAs we\u2019ve said, the future of TV is apps, and STARZ is another incredible example of iOS and Apple TV customers being able to watch the shows they love on their favorite devices.\u201dStarz original series attract viewers who are more racially diverse and have lower average incomes than audiences of other premium TV networks, according to Nielsen data provided by the network. Mr. Albrecht said that the new app was meant for viewers who are likely to be interested in the network\u2019s original programming but are priced out of higher-cost premium TV networks.Typically, cable and satellite providers sell premium networks like HBO, Showtime and Starz on top of subscriptions to standard cable bundles.\u201cThere is an opportunity to differentiate ourselves to a group of consumers that would likely be customers of Starz if they could access it,\u201d Mr. Albrecht said. \u201cPremiums are stuck on top as a cherry last to be added, first to come off.\u201dIndeed, Starz will have much differentiating to do. The debut of the network\u2019s app comes nearly a year after HBO introduced its $15-a-month HBO Now streaming service to much fanfare. Soon after, Showtime unveiled a similar service for $11 a month. All the while, digital competitors like Netflix, Amazon and Hulu have greatly expanded their offerings.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Seattle Shelter Effort, Amazon Shows Glimmers of a \u2018Good Neighbor\u2019", "Date": "2016-04-21", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 Amazon\u2019s new urban headquarters \u2014 more than 30 office buildings and three towers that, once completed, will dominate a low-slung section of the city \u2014 are a gleaming symbol of boom times here. The tech giant has added 20,000 new jobs in Seattle and attracted other tech companies that want to rub elbows. Google plans to expand here as well, with four new buildings and perhaps 4,000 workers. Smaller start-ups dot old brick neighborhoods like Pioneer Square, and newer developments like South Lake Union, where Amazon is building.But this week, Amazon stepped into a new place of civic engagement, and raised hopes, city leaders said, of much more to come.The company, in partnership with a nonprofit group called Mary\u2019s Place, threw open the doors of an unused building near the heart of its corporate empire, creating one of the largest homeless shelters in Seattle. The 200-bed shelter is taking shape in a former Travelodge that Amazon bought in 2014, a structure that many of the company\u2019s employees walk by every day on their way to or from work. The first handful of families who will sleep there started arriving Monday.The solution is temporary. The building will be demolished next year to make way for several more company office buildings. But advocates for the homeless, and Seattle\u2019s mayor, Ed Murray, said the real significance of the project, which will be managed by Mary\u2019s Place, could not be measured in beds or in the number of months that the shelter will be open.Rather, it is measured in the new relationships that Amazon appears to be forging with the city it calls home.\u201cNew companies struggle to figure out how they can be corporate good neighbors,\u201d Mr. Murray said in an interview. \u201cThe fact that Amazon has chosen to participate in what is, among West Coast cities, the most difficult and the most controversial issue we face, sends to me a positive signal about what kind of corporate neighbor they could grow into.\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s a very interesting place for them to take a risk,\u201d he added.Amazon\u2019s director of global real estate and facilities, John Schoettler, said the path to turning the old hotel into a shelter was \u201crather serendipitous.\u201d The hotel closed years ago, he said, and the building was being used as college dormitory space when Amazon bought it. But when the mayor declared a state of emergency last fall, Mr. Schoettler said, bells went off.\u201cWe were thinking about different things that we could do with it, and we didn\u2019t want it to just sit idle,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we reached out to the mayor\u2019s office.\u201dThe area around the shelter is a building maelstrom, with five major commercial office projects and 10 residential developments with 4,657 housing units in planning or construction within a quarter-mile of the property, according to figures from the city.But low-budget hotels still stake out part of the area, too, as do automotive shops. The Elephant Super Car Wash, with its revolving pink sign dating from an earlier era, is only a few blocks away.Support for Amazon\u2019s new role has been enthusiastic, especially in the realm of homeless advocacy.Mary\u2019s Place will also get $400,000 from the city, from a fund opened up by the mayor\u2019s emergency declaration, to help with operating expenses. Ms. Hartman said the new shelter doubled in one day how many people her group can help.So far, customers have donated items that include 37 room lamps, 49 twin mattresses, 145 boxes of diapers, 26 shower curtains and 1,080 hand and bath towels.Isela Espinoza, 35, a medical assistant and one of the first shelter residents, said the relief it had already begun providing was immediate: She could actually sleep.\u201cI was sleeping in my car before that,\u201d she said. And with her two children there with her, ages 12 and 15, she was ever on alert. \u201cI never felt I could fall asleep because I felt like I needed to protect my children,\u201d she said.\u201cIt changed my way of thinking about the company,\u201d she said about Amazon. \u201cYou hardly hear of big companies, making millions and billions of dollars, looking down to see who needs help.\u201dSome economists and politicians said tech companies hadbeen unfairly blamed for negative social and housing effects on cities. Mr. Murray, for one, said the breakdown of government funding for housing and mental health treatment was driving much of the problem here, as well as in rural and suburban areas.A housing expert at the Urban Land Institute, a research group based in Washington, D.C., said growth is always disruptive, and right now, tech is simply the visible engine of that growth in many places.\u201cWithout question, any American city that has seen recent, significant economic growth is grappling with a housing affordability problem,\u201d said the expert, Stockton Williams, who studies demographics and housing trends for the research group. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a city that is fully meeting the housing needs of all its citizens.\u201dMr. Schoettler said he hoped Amazon\u2019s commitment would extend beyond the one-year life of the shelter. He said that another property nearby could be available next spring, but that it was too soon for promises.\u201cI can see this going on for several years, but again that\u2019s all dependent on our need for space,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
