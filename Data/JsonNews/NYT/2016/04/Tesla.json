Get in line. According to IHS Automotive, the segment outsold sedans in the United States last year. Now, you could buy a station wagon (they handle more like sports sedans because of their lower center of gravity) or a minivan, but buyers have voted for crossovers with their checkbooks. Cheap gas helps.But which one performs the best? With that question in mind, members of the Northwest Automotive Press Association started a competition, called Mudfest, in 1994. The name gives you the idea. Over two days this year, 26 journalists evaluated 27 vehicles, including crossovers, S.U.V.s and pickups, in six categories. Pitting a Mitsubishi Outlander Sport against a Lexus LX 570 or Chevrolet Colorado pickup is like comparing apples to oranges.But even the categories are getting harder to differentiate. This year\u2019s field included two hybrids (Toyota RAV4 and BMW X5 xDrive40e plug-in) and a diesel. Mazda\u2019s CX-3 could be considered a diminutive all-wheel-drive hatchback. The fastback-style Mercedes-Benz GLE450 AMG looks and performs like a sports coupe. What\u2019s next? A convertible Range Rover Evoque? Wait, that\u2019s a real thing. Also, the only pickup without a diesel engine is the Toyota Tacoma.For on-road testing, we pushed the vehicles on the go-kart course at the Ridge Motorsports Park in Shelton, Wash. There\u2019s nothing more wrong \u2014 or joyous \u2014 than throttling a full-size Nissan Titan pickup on a track designed for vehicles that can nestle in its bed. The idea is to discover acceleration, handling and braking prowess.The vehicles were also tested on a moderate off-road course whose dips and potholes would damage many cars. But nearly all of the competitors, including Kia Sportage, Fiat 500X, Acura RDX and Ford Explorer slogged through the mud, ruts and grades without breaking a sweat (or more important, suspension arms). The lesson? Don\u2019t overbuy when it comes to capability. Vehicles like the Jeep Wrangler, Range Rover Sport and Lexus LX 570, as well as the pickups \u2014 Nissan Titan, Ram, Toyota Tacoma and Chevrolet Colorado \u2014 tackled a more extreme course, which in some places was difficult to traverse by foot.The writers did more than just driving. They sampled interiors, specialty features and technology. If you have not bought a car in 10 years, you\u2019re missing auto-braking with pedestrian detection, heated steering wheels and around-view camera systems that make it seem as if a helicopter is hovering above the vehicle.The manufacturers provided the vehicles they felt best suited for this competition. But not all automakers participated. I was surprised that the 2016 Volvo XC90 was not there and disappointed that the Tesla Model X was a no-show.

Has Much to Prove to Investors", "Date": "2016-04-21", "News": "Supported byWheelsDETROIT \u2014 SINCE going bankrupt in 2009 and needing a government bailout to survive, General Motors has methodically rebuilt itself as a profitable automaker that has capitalized on surging sales in the United States market.The company\u2019s stock price hardly budged from its recent level of $32 on the news that G.M. earned $1.95 billion in the quarter, compared to $945 million in the same period in 2015.Industry analysts have been generally impressed by G.M.\u2019s comeback from its financial problems and its recent safety crisis over faulty ignition switches linked to 124 deaths.Yet much of the credit for the healthy earnings is attributed to the strong market in the United States for new cars, rather than G.M.\u2019s improving balance sheet and new models.Now G.M., with its domestic rivals Ford Motor and Fiat Chrysler, is pushing hard to be a major player in the industry\u2019s high-technology revolution centered on autonomous vehicles and electric cars.And rather than try to develop all the technology itself, G.M. is spending freely to acquire and work with Silicon Valley companies that can accelerate its transformation from an old-line automaker into a leader in all aspects of personal mobility.\u201cThey are investing in companies that are further along than they are in new technology,\u201d said Karl Brauer, an analyst with Kelley Blue Book. \u201cAnd that\u2019s something G.M. would never have done back before its bankruptcy.\u201dInvesting in companies like the Lyft ride-hailing service is part of an effort by G.M. to shed its reputation as a plodding bureaucracy that is slow to keep up with the newest trends in the industry.The motivation to take more risks can be directly attributed to the emergence of Apple and Google as potential automakers, and the stunning success of Tesla Motors in electric cars.\u201cThe forces of change like Google and Tesla have motivated G.M. and other older automakers to defend their turf,\u201d Mr. Brauer said.Mary T. Barra, G.M.\u2019s chief, said on Thursday that the company intended to be a leader in autonomous cars and electric vehicles, even if that meant spending big for companies like Cruise Automation, a tiny software business that customizes cars with self-driving equipment.\u201cWe see a significant opportunity, and that\u2019s why we are moving so aggressively on all fronts,\u201d Ms. Barra said in a conference call with analysts.The company is also preparing to go head-to-head in competition with Tesla for customers for the first midpriced electric cars with a driving range of 200 miles.Tesla has garnered more than 325,000 orders for its Model 3, which will not be available until at least 2017. G.M. is set to begin production late this year on its Chevrolet Bolt, which has a comparable price and driving range as the new Tesla.Still, Tesla has a high-tech cachet from the success of its luxury cars. And G.M. is committed to selling the Bolt in Chevrolet showrooms that cater to mass-market consumers.\u201cThe electric car is integrated into the portfolio,\u201d Ms. Barra said.That strategy is counter to what some other big automakers are doing. Honda on Thursday said it would offer vehicles powered by fuel cells or batteries.Establishing a product line dedicated to advanced, low-emission models \u201cwill help create a new volume pillar for electrified vehicle sales,\u201d said John W. Mendel, of Honda\u2019s American division.As G.M. tries to carve out a larger business in electric cars, it is also acting to improve profit margins in its core North American business.The company is pulling back on less profitable sales of vehicles to rental fleets, and taking advantage of consumer demand for trucks by introducing variants such as its midsize pickup and a Chinese-built small sport utility vehicle.In the first quarter, G.M. increased its pretax profit in North America by 5 percent, from a year ago, to nearly $2.3 billion.It also improved in other regions, particularly in Europe, where it reduced losses to $6 million in the quarter, compared to a loss of $239 million in the same period in 2015.Still, analysts remain mixed on G.M.\u2019s outlook.Some are praising the company for its postbankruptcy restructuring that has left it in far better position to weather a slowing of domestic sales.\u201cThe great story about G.M. is that even if a sales slowdown occurs, the company is in position to still remain profitable due to an improved balance sheet, flexible production, and disciplined decision making,\u201d said David Kudla, chief executive of the investment firm Mainstay Capital Management.Other analysts said G.M. was vulnerable if the market began slipping below last year\u2019s record sales of 17.5 million vehicles in the United States.In a research note on Thursday, a Morgan Stanley analyst, Adam Jonas, warned that big profits in the American market were unsustainable in the long term because of an inevitable slowdown in consumer demand.Yet with another strong quarter behind it, G.M. may be starting to change some of the negative perceptions that have dogged it since its bankruptcy.\u201cA strong start to the year once again shows why G.M. is a fundamentally different company than it once was,\u201d the Citibank analyst Itay Michaeli said in a research note.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Companies Poised to Take Leap in Developing a Driverless Car", "Date": "2016-04-03", "News": "Supported byGansha Wu was a veteran engineering manager at Intel Corporation and director of Intel Labs China when two events upended his world last year.First, he listened to the veteran technology writer Michael Malone tell an audience of Intel employees that if they were too cautious they would fail. Then he attended a leadership training session for Intel executives. The trainer told them that \u201cto be a leader is to design a future that is unpredictable and which nobody bets on.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t sleep at night, thinking about his well-ordered, 16-year career at Intel. So he decided to take a risk. With four colleagues, he made the decision to take the uncertain path, which today is becoming more common in China than even in Silicon Valley: He quit his job to begin a start-up that specializes in autonomous, or self-driving, cars.In the process, Mr. Wu hit upon a rare moment when a tech sector in China is developing in lock step with a similar but separate market in the United States.In fact, some argue that conditions in China are actually more favorable for quick adoption of driverless cars, in part because of more aggressive support from the national and local governments. And, unlike in the United States, China never fully developed a romance with the open road and car ownership.Car ownership has spiked in China, of course. And in recent years, it has become a middle-class status symbol to own a car. For the ultrawealthy, there are clubs dedicated to Ferraris and Maseratis.But enormous traffic jams in China\u2019s largest cities can make driving a less-than-romantic experience. Why not let a machine built with artificial intelligence inside do the work for you?Research done by the Boston Consulting Group suggests that within 15 years China will be the largest market for autonomous vehicles, said Xavier Mosquet, a managing director at the firm. Automated taxis will most likely lead the trend.\u201cIt\u2019s not that people are more willing to use the cars in Beijing or Shanghai, it\u2019s that the economic value is much higher in China than in the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Mosquet said, adding that air pollution could be as much a catalyst as bad traffic.Even as American companies like Google and Tesla work on autonomous vehicles, a number of Chinese companies are working on driverless car technology. The Internet company Leshi Internet Information & Technology (better known as Letv) has a driverless car tech unit, and the Chinese carmaker Great Wall Motors has opened a research center in Silicon Valley. The assumed leader in the field in China is the search engine company Baidu, which has been at work on autonomous vehicles since 2013.Among the torrent of start-ups, however, Mr. Wu and his colleagues are unusual because of their experience.Mr. Wu\u2019s company, Uisee Technology, has yet to announce its financial backers, but it has significant ambitions. The team plans to have a technology demonstration ready in less than a year at the consumer electronics show in Las Vegas in 2017.\u201cHis team is an unusual collection of supertalent,\u201d said Kai-Fu Lee, a venture investor from Taiwan and former head of Google in China. \u201cThey combine a mechanical expert from a university, a top computer vision expert and machine learning from Google as well as Gansha and his team of semiconductor experts. Gansha is an excellent leader that binds these people together.\u201dThe founders of Uisee, which is an acronym for Utilization, Indiscriminate, Safety, Efficiency and Environment, say they believe the company will find a profitable niche between the poles of the driverless car debate that is raging in Silicon Valley.Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, has predicted that completely self-driving cars may be on the road in the United States in two to four years. Chris Urmson, the director of Google\u2019s self-driving-car program, has said his goal is to bring a self-driving car to market by 2019.Others are more cautious, and say they believe it may take a decade or longer for self-driving cars to hit the market. And among the biggest automakers like Toyota, the interest is less in cars that drive themselves than in cars that have artificial intelligence capabilities to assist drivers, like emergency braking.\u201cWe see a few stages toward fully autonomous driving,\u201d said Mr. Wu, adding that safety technologies are coming quickly. He said driver assistance systems will be followed by completely driverless cars in restricted circumstances, such as on private roads, fixed routes at low speed and in controlled environments. Uisee will begin by developing technologies that assist rather than replace drivers.Baidu has teamed up with BMW and recently said it was testing its technology in the United States. Baidu has said it is preparing to introduce automated public transportation services in China within the next two years.Unlike Google, which has had difficulty convincing regulators in its home state, California, that self-driving cars are ready for the road, Baidu already has the regulatory and infrastructure support of a number of local Chinese governments, which it will use to introduce small autonomous buses that will run set routes.The Chinese government is playing a major role in the overall driverless market. Along with empowering Baidu to run public transportation, in other cases central and local governments have been investing in research and development for driverless car projects.Mr. Wu also embodies a growing entrepreneurial movement in China. The Chinese government reported that 4.8 million new companies were registered from March 2014 to May 2015, a rate of 10,600 new businesses per day, or seven every minute. Even though venture investment has begun to dry up in China recently, the nation has clearly been infected with a Silicon Valley attitude.Although in some quarters it is still known as the land of copycat technology, China has long since moved on to copying the start-up ethos of the Valley, with more and more entrepreneurs creating their own companies.The Chinese government is encouraging the boom as a way to solve a number of economic problems, including unemployment and the transition of the economy from one centered on manufacturing to one based on services.\u201cThis year more than seven million people are entering the job market in China,\u201d said Haiyang Li, a professor at the Jesse H. Jones Graduate School of Business at Rice University in Houston. \u201cWhat are they going to do with these students? The government does not have any better way to solve the employment issue.\u201dEven as analysts and investors worry the government is over-investing in start-ups, the state support, along with China\u2019s engineering talent and the business need for self-driving cars, could help the nascent business in China.But there are obstacles. In China, roads often have poorly marked lanes and little signage. People, animals, three-wheel rickshaws and trucks are liable to veer in front of a car at any time. That makes for a more challenging engineering problem in China, said Junyi Zhang, a partner with the consulting firm Roland Berger.\u201cIt is harder in China, where many roads have pedestrians, bicycles, low-speed vehicles and high-speed vehicles all mixed together,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a very complicated environment, and many don\u2019t ride or drive to the same standard.\u201dCao Li contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}

Ford has budgeted $7.7 billion for capital costs this year and is projecting to increase that to $9 billion by around 2020, a spokesman said.The headquarters plan reflects a broader struggle by automakers to shed their Rust Belt images and recast themselves as nimble, high-growth companies, said Akshay Anand, an analyst at with the research firm Kelley Blue Book.It is a move that is aimed at investors and potential employees as much as consumers of the future, Mr. Anand said. \u201cFord is now saying, \u2018We want to be the place everybody is talking about when you\u2019re working in these fields.\u2019\u201dHenry Ford founded his car company in Detroit, but in 1917 began building a factory in Dearborn, his hometown. As more facilities were moved there, the city became synonymous with the company.The first phase of Ford\u2019s project will begin this year and focus on the company\u2019s research and engineering facilities, which date to 1953. They will be renovated and linked with new green spaces, covered walkways and bike paths. The centerpiece will be a new design center. Work is supposed to be completed by 2023.A renovation of its \u201cGlass House\u201d headquarters building, which opened in 1956, is scheduled to begin in 2021. Over several more years, it will be connected to a series of new and existing buildings. They will be linked to parking decks, soccer fields and a nearby arboretum.Together, the two campuses will serve as a showcase for the future, with autonomous vehicles ferrying executives around and other people riding electric bikes.All of the buildings will be designed to minimize energy use. One of them will demonstrate sustainability by generating more energy than it consumes. It will rely on solar power as well as geothermal power for heating and cooling, Ford said.Advertisement"}

The judge, he added, is \u201cnot in the mood for stalling, that\u2019s for sure.\u201dVolkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.Widely described by lawyers in California as fair, pragmatic and creative, the judge, the younger brother of Justice Stephen G. Breyer, holds sway over whether and how Volkswagen fixes the cars and how vehicle owners will be compensated.Judge Breyer, 74, who says he has no ambitions to be appointed to a higher court, is presiding over complex litigation involving hundreds of thousands of car owners who want the company to fix their cars or buy them back, as well as civil suits brought by car dealers and by the Department of Justice.It is a career highlight for someone who had long aspired to be center stage, just not always in the courtroom.While his brother followed their father, a longtime counsel to the San Francisco school board, into law, Judge Breyer initially hoped to pursue a career in acting. After graduating from Harvard University with an economics degree, he spent the summer auditioning, including on Broadway.\u201cI never got a callback,\u201d he said wryly in an interview last week.Instead, he went to law school at the University of California, Berkeley, and found that trial law \u201cwas theatrics by another name.\u201dHe cut his teeth as an assistant district attorney in San Francisco, often prosecuting homicide cases. Then, in a forerunner to the Watergate scandal, burglars broke into a psychiatrist\u2019s office in California in search of records that could damage Daniel Ellsberg, who had leaked the Pentagon Papers and antagonized the Nixon administration. He prosecuted several Nixon aides, who became central figures in the Watergate case, for that break-in.\u201cIt was fascinating,\u201d he recalled. \u201cYou did have a sense that you were engaged in a significant inquiry. You had no sense whatsoever of whether you were going to be successful. None.\u201dJudge Breyer later became a trial lawyer in San Francisco, with clients ranging from the American Cigar Company to the estate of Elvis Presley. He remained mostly in private practice until Bill Clinton appointed him to the federal bench in 1997.He still has a passion for performance. Judge Breyer has been known to quote Shakespeare in his courtroom, and, like his brother, he regularly draws chuckles in court.Last month, when a lawyer for Volkswagen, Robert J. Giuffra Jr., mentioned that his son disliked the case because his father was never home, Judge Breyer responded: \u201cIn a month\u2019s time, we will reintroduce you to your family. They can all come to San Francisco for an environmentally correct holiday.\u201dJudge Breyer is \u201cjust very, very effective at cutting straight to the core of an issue, and wading through the marginal, peripheral atmospherics,\u201d Mr. Cohen said. The judge, he added, likes to move things along quickly and naturally, and toward a settlement if possible.As a senior district judge for the Northern District of California, Judge Breyer has presided over a long line of complex litigation that has often ended in settlements. Last year, he approved settlements in a major class-action case involving accusations of price-fixing in the airline industry. In another major case, involving liability claims regarding two painkillers made by Pfizer, a settlement was announced in 2008.While he rarely gets automotive cases, in 2014, Judge Breyer dismissed a complaint by shareholders of Tesla Motors claiming that the electric carmaker had made false statements about the fire risks of the car batteries. In dismissing it, Judge Breyer said he was at a \u201ctotal loss\u201d for \u201cunderstanding the basis for this lawsuit.\u201d The case is being appealed.Judge Breyer, known for his bow ties and a love of baseball, declined to comment on the Volkswagen case during the interview in his spacious 17th-floor chambers, which overlook downtown San Francisco. The office contains a host of figurines and knickknacks, a wall of legal books and a small aquarium.Asked whether his deadline of Thursday would be met, he replied simply, \u201cI hope so.\u201dIf it is not, a summer trial could be an uncomfortably rapid timeline for Volkswagen, which is already under immense pressure to find an engineering fix for its cars \u2014 if one exists.Jeannine Ginivan, a spokeswoman for the Volkswagen Group of America, wrote in an email that the company is \u201ccommitted to resolving the U.S. regulatory investigation as quickly as possible,\u201d and to working to earn back the trust of its customers and dealers.Many legal observers expect the case to eventually settle rather than go to trial.Soon after he began presiding over the litigation, Judge Breyer appointed the former F.B.I. director and longtime lawyer Robert S. Mueller III to help the various sides come together.In his January order appointing him, the judge said that Mr. Mueller had the authority to schedule settlement discussions, and to determine the location and other details of those talks. Mr. Mueller is providing regular progress reports to Judge Breyer.\u201cAppointing Mueller so early and putting him to work \u2014 it just shows you, you\u2019ve got a judge who has a plan,\u201d said Alan Schulman, a professor in residence at the University of San Diego School of Law. \u201cHe\u2019s going to move this case forward, rather than let it languish in his court for a decade.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Tina Brown walked by, absorbed in her smartphone. \u201cThey both invited me,\u201d Ms. Musk whispered of Ms. Brown and Ms. von Furstenberg. \u201cI hope I get to meet them tonight.\u201d\u201cI was famous until Elon became famous,\u201d Ms. Musk said, half-joking, over oatmeal at Caf\u00e9 Luxembourg the day before.\u201cWe are at a point where people are demanding diversity and inclusion,\u201d said Ivan Bart, president of IMG Models, which has begun representing Ms. Musk. He added, \u201cPeople want to see age and size because that is who their friends are.\u201dBut his client\u2019s motivation is simpler. \u201cI just want to work,\u201d she said.She was born in Regina, Saskatchewan, in 1948, a twin and one of five children, and moved with her family to Pretoria, South Africa, in 1950. Her parents, Joshua and Wyn Haldeman, had a thriving chiropractic practice and a thirst for adventure. In 1952, the couple flew 22,000 miles around the world in a plane Mr. Haldeman brought in pieces from Canada.Her mother prepared maps and slide shows of the trips, which she shared with ladies\u2019 groups and other travelers. \u201cMy parents were very famous, but they were never snobs,\u201d Ms. Musk said.In 1970, she married Errol Musk, an engineer she had met in high school, and a year later, Elon was born, followed by another son, Kimbal, and a daughter, Tosca. Ms. Musk earned a master\u2019s degree in dietetics from the University of the Orange Free State in South Africa. (And later another in nutritional sciences from the University of Toronto.)She worked at home, counseling nutrition clients, while modeling for extra money. The marriage, though, lasted barely nine years, and Ms. Musk left Pretoria for Durban, a coastal town. \u201cI think it\u2019s tougher being in an unhappy marriage,\u201d she said, than being a single mother.In his teens, Elon moved to Pretoria to live with his father, followed by Kimbal. \u201cI think, at the end of the day, she was very hurt,\u201d said Tosca, 41, who stayed with her mother. Ms. Musk would say only that it was \u201csad,\u201d and that their relationship is now good. Kimbal and Elon were not made available for interviews, but in statements Kimbal called his mother \u201camazing\u201d and \u201cdynamic\u201d; Elon chose \u201cawesome.\u201dWith South Africa in upheaval over its apartheid policy, Elon wanted to pursue his interest in technology in Canada, where Ms. Musk\u2019s relatives lived and where she was still a citizen. To pay for his trip to Toronto, Ms. Musk said she sold stock she gave Elon when he was born. \u201cI got a collect call,\u201d she recalled. \u201cHe said: \u2018I\u2019m at the airport. What do I do now?\u2019\u201d Their Canadian relatives weren\u2019t home. \u201cI told him to go to the Y.M.C.A.\u201dShe moved with Tosca to a rent-controlled apartment in Toronto a year later. \u201cWe were not wildly rich people; people forget that,\u201d said Tosca, now a filmmaker living in Los Angeles. Kimbal, a restaurateur and investor, joined his siblings soon after.\u201cThe children knew they wouldn\u2019t have a future in South Africa,\u201d said Julia Perry, Ms. Musk\u2019s longtime stylist.Elon and Kimbal asked their mother to move to San Francisco in 1996, where they started Zip2, a software company. \u201cI was lonely there,\u201d she said. Her children threw her a 50th birthday party at the home of an investor. \u201cJulia flew into San Francisco and said, \u2018We have to get you a nice dress,\u2019\u201d recalled Ms. Musk, adding she told her, \u201c\u2018I can\u2019t afford this.\u2019\u201dMs. Perry had a dress made for Ms. Musk, she said, a gift she believed was from her children. \u201cThey gave me a tiny wooden house and wooden car,\u201d she said. \u201cThey said, \u2018Someday we will buy you a house and a car.\u2019\u201d She now drives a Tesla and owned an apartment in New York for 13 years before moving to Los Angeles in 2013 after visiting Tosca, who had just had twins on her own.Now the Musk family gets together for regular dinners, often at home because Elon is interrupted when they go out. Ms. Musk says she gets at least 100 requests a month from people who want to meet her son.\u201cIt\u2019s all about a pitch,\u201d she said. \u201cI had a New York photographer Facebook Messenger me yesterday and said, \u2018Let\u2019s get together for coffee.\u2019\u201d She hadn\u2019t seen him in six years and asked why. \u201cHe said, \u2018I have a project I want to run by you,\u2019 and I know what that means,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a project he wants Elon to finance.\u201d Ms. Musk politely deferred the request.But being Elon\u2019s mother also has its perks. Last September, Ms. Musk and Nell Rebowe, another model, attended the Banana Republic presentation during New York Fashion Week. There, Charlotte McKinney, the curvaceous GQ cover girl and Carl\u2019s Jr. pitchwoman, walked in with a friend, Zachary Scott, a 26-year-old technology entrepreneur.\u201cNell,\u201d Ms. Musk said she told her friend, \u201cwe have to get a photo with her because it will increase our Instagram followers. I thought: \u2018Oh gosh. I am really going to drop Elon\u2019s name. How else are we going to get a photo?\u2019\u201dMs. Musk was introduced to Mr. Scott. \u201cDo you know Elon Musk?\u201d she asked, adding, \u201cHe\u2019s my son.\u201d Mr. Scott shouted to Ms. McKinney. \u201cThis is Elon Musk\u2019s mother!\u201d\u201cI saw she had 15 agencies in markets all over the world,\u201d Mr. Scott said. \u201cSo I sent her an email and said: \u2018Are you happy with your agencies? They are all small and I think you could have better representation.\u2019\u201dModeling in Los Angeles is tough: fewer fashion shoots, more actresses increasing the competition. \u201cShe knew I was obsessed with Elon,\u201d Mr. Scott said. \u201cBut then she said she was having to go to casting calls and sit in a lawn chair, and I thought: \u2018This is crazy. You\u2019re Maye Musk. How could they treat you that way?\u2019\u201dHe agreed to be her business manager, teaming with Marlon Stoltzman, a fashion agent from South Africa who manages Candice Swanepoel. Mr. Scott said he renegotiated Ms. Musk\u2019s outstanding contracts and began searching for a new home.Mr. Bart of IMG Models started getting calls from agents and others about Ms. Musk last December, and met with her soon after at Chateau Marmont in West Hollywood, Calif.\u201cShe was vocal about wanting to elevate her brand,\u201d he said. But though Ms. Musk is interested in promoting fitness and health, she said she would not take a modeling job that would embarrass her 10 grandchildren. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to see grandma naked,\u201d she said.\u201cShe is the sort of person that it does not matter if it is Vogue or catalog work,\u201d Mr. Bart said. \u201cShe loves to be in the studio. And that is what we are going to do.\u201dOn a recent Monday, Ms. Musk met with Ms. Perry at the design office of Yuna Yang, who is creating Ms. Musk\u2019s outfit for the Met Gala. With the evening\u2019s theme technological, Ms. Yang had constructed an electric-blue pantsuit and cape embellished with brocade, lace and airy ostrich feathers, to be worn with nude Ferragamo heels. Ms. Musk ducked behind a rack of dresses to slip into the outfit, which Ms. Yang and an assistant adjusted to fit her shape.They debated whether she should wear a one-piece undergarment. \u201cI\u2019ve done the jumpsuit thing,\u201d Ms. Musk said. \u201cIt takes a half-hour to take it off, and then people think you got lost.\u201dShe held up her finger. She smiled and shifted her hip. She pouted like a schoolgirl.\u201cThis is my party,\u201d she said, and beamed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Leaders Roll Up Sleeves on Climate, but Experts Say Plans Don\u2019t Pack a Wallop", "Date": "2016-04-21", "News": "Supported byBut can they deliver on their promises to fight global warming?After a quarter-century of failed diplomatic efforts, signs are growing that nations have turned a corner in their political willingness to tackle climate change. Many leaders are pushing to make the Paris agreement legally binding years earlier than originally expected. The falling cost of clean energy is providing a powerful tailwind for their efforts.For all the signs of progress and political will, however, new challenges to implementing the accord have arisen just since December. Outside experts also say the countries\u2019 bare-bones plans are still far from enough to keep global warming to tolerable levels. No country has shared a detailed, credible strategy to achieve what scientists think is necessary: ending the era of fossil-fuel emissions and converting entirely to clean energy no later than the middle of this century.Unless countries develop more ambitious plans, the experts say, the world could ultimately suffer profound consequences, including debilitating heat waves, food shortages and fast-rising seas.World leaders are gathering Friday to sign the Paris Agreement on climate change. Here\u2019s a status report on the key players and their efforts to slow greenhouse gas emissions.In developing countries, hundreds of coal-burning power plants are still on the drawing board. And oil and gas companies continue to invest billions of dollars a year searching for new reserves of fossil fuels.\u201cThe signing ceremony, the unprecedented number of countries that are going to sign is creating a momentum,\u201d said Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists, a Washington advocacy group. \u201cBut there is still a lot of work to do, not just in the U.S. but around the world, to nail down these domestic actions.\u201dLooming large over the climate push is the American presidential election. The Democratic candidates, Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, have promised to build on Mr. Obama\u2019s legacy and to pursue strong climate policies. But the two leading Republicans, Donald J. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, have questioned the science of climate change and sharply criticized the Paris agreement.The issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.The fight over a nominee to the Supreme Court is, in part, a fight over the fate of the Clean Power Plan, which is intended to limit emissions from power plants in the United States.The plan still has to move through a June hearing in a federal circuit court, and the deciding vote when it gets to the Supreme Court for a final ruling could well be cast by Justice Scalia\u2019s replacement.Moreover, even if the plan is upheld, some experts have concluded that Mr. Obama is likely to leave office without establishing policies sufficient to ensure the country will meet the pledge he offered in Paris: to reduce American emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent in 2025, compared with their level in 2005.The White House contends that it is still on track to meet those targets, and Brian Deese, the White House climate change advisor, said he and his staff are now preparing models and plans to lay the groundwork for the next president to strengthen the current policies.The signing ceremony on Friday is only an intermediate step. After, countries will still have to present formal ratification documents, and the Paris Agreement will not take effect until 55 countries representing 55 percent of global greenhouse-gas emissions have done so.That was originally expected to take at least a couple of years. But some countries are talking about rushing through the final steps, possibly even bringing the agreement into force by the end of this year, before Mr. Obama leaves office on Jan. 20.The French minister of environment and energy, S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal, alluded to the importance of the American presidential election during a meeting on Monday with reporters at the United Nations, saying the agreement might be \u201csigned and ratified by the time anybody is elected.\u201dAt that moment, the French ambassador to the United Nations, Fran\u00e7ois Delattre, uttered a stage whisper within the earshot of several reporters. \u201cOn esp\u00e8re,\u201d he said, or \u201cOne hopes.\u201dFor all the lingering political uncertainty, however, the economics of clean energy appear to be improving so rapidly that a radical acceleration of the energy transition may become possible, if governments push it along with new policies.For instance, some analyses suggest that keeping climate change to a tolerable level will require mass adoption of electric cars by the 2030s, coupled with a transition to a cleaner electricity grid to power the cars.Most of the existing power plants still run on nonrenewable energy, however, and because the plants last for decades, that is likely to change only slowly. Wind turbines and solar panels are now supplying about 10 percent of the world\u2019s electricity, a figure that has doubled in the last decade. The pace of adoption would need to rise sharply to meet the broad climate goals.As the market for clean power technology has grown, the cost has plummeted, and countries are scrambling to adapt their plans. India has promised a 20-fold increase in solar power, and bids for giant solar farms there have been coming in so low that many analysts are increasingly convinced that the country can pull it off.The promises rich countries made to secure the Paris agreement included mobilizing billions in financing for poor countries like India.\u201cIndia\u2019s needs are going to be astronomical if we are going to succeed,\u201d said Dipak Dasgupta, an Indian economist and a former board member of a United Nations fund intended to channel some of the climate money.Whether the money will materialize is one of the great uncertainties about the Paris deal. Mr. Obama has had trouble persuading Republican lawmakers to provide even small sums to advance his international climate agenda, though Congress did approve tax measures in December that would give a big push to wind and solar power in the United States over the next few years.But if the money promised by rich countries is not forthcoming, the poor countries that pledged strong climate action in Paris could easily decide to walk away, one of the many ways the progress reflected in the deal remains fragile \u2014 and easily reversible.Somini Sengupta and Ellen Barry contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tesla\u2019s New Model 3 Jump-Starts Demand for Electric Cars", "Date": "2016-04-01", "News": "Supported byDETROIT \u2014 Despite a steady stream of new models from a number of automakers, sales this year of electric and hybrid vehicles have failed to keep pace with the growth in the overall American market.Given that electric and hybrid vehicles account for only about 2 percent of last year\u2019s record-setting sales in the United States, the extraordinary reaction to Tesla\u2019s first mass-market model was a vivid demonstration of the potential demand in the segment.\u201cIt shows that the future of electric vehicles is not necessarily bleak,\u201d said Alec Gutierrez, an analyst with the research firm Kelley Blue Book. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ve been waiting for the right products that resonate with consumers.\u201dTesla said on Friday that it had booked reservations \u2014 at $1,000 each \u2014 from nearly 200,000 people for the first Model 3 sedans, which will not be available until next year.With a starting price of $35,000 and a battery range of 215 miles, the new Tesla is a big leap in the company\u2019s expansion beyond expensive luxury models.\u201cThe final step in the master plan is a mass-market, affordable car,\u201d Elon Musk, Tesla\u2019s chief executive, said at the lavish introduction of the Model 3 held at the company\u2019s design studios in Hawthorne, Calif.Other automakers are also pressing ahead with important new electric models, including the Chevrolet Bolt from General Motors, a revamped version of the Nissan Leaf, and new entries from Ford Motor and Hyundai.With those and other electrified vehicles coming in the next couple of years, the segment could finally begin to grow beyond the fringes of the market.Last year, automakers sold fewer than 400,000 electric and hybrid vehicles in the United States, even as the overall market soared to record sales of 17.5 million, analysts said.On Friday, automakers said the torrid pace of sales cooled some in March, when overall sales increased about 3 percent, to about 1.6 million vehicles sold. That was lower than Wall Street estimates, and the closely watched seasonally adjusted annual sales rate dropped below 17 million for the first time this year.Sales of trucks and sport utility vehicles continued to account for most of the gains, while passenger cars lagged behind. And despite the introduction of a new Prius hybrid from Toyota, there was little improvement in overall sales of electrified models.\u201cThe segment has been pretty soft over all, and we expect to see that continue this year,\u201d Mr. Gutierrez said.Electric cars and hybrid models, which are powered by both a gasoline engine and a battery, are critical to nearly every automaker\u2019s efforts to improve their overall fleetwide fuel economy to meet a new federal standard of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. And meeting the goals has become even more important in the wake of the Paris climate accord last year, which mandated significant reductions in carbon emissions.Despite the lukewarm acceptance of electrified vehicles so far by consumers, environmental groups are praising the impact that the relatively small sales have had already.A report released this week by the Union of Concerned Scientists shows, for example, that about 200,000 electric cars have been sold in California to date, which has reduced annual gasoline consumption in the state by 56 million gallons.\u201cNew models like G.M.\u2019s Bolt, Tesla\u2019s Model 3 and the new plug-in Prius Prime should keep the number of electric vehicles growing,\u201d said David Reichmuth, a senior engineer with the scientists group.Trends in the marketplace, however, are working against electrified models. With fuel prices still hovering at about $2 a gallon, many consumers are choosing larger vehicles that are more affordable to own when gas is cheap.And with automakers also improving the mileage of their existing compact cars and small sport utility vehicles, many buyers are meeting their fuel-economy needs with conventional, gas-powered models instead of electrified ones.Still, the Tesla\u2019s introduction is a sign that latent demand for electric cars could translate into big sales in the showroom down the road.Mr. Musk said Tesla was preparing for a surge in demand by adding dealerships, prepping its California assembly plant to build as many as 500,000 electric cars a year, and building a new factory in Nevada to produce batteries.As far as the Model 3 is concerned, Mr. Musk was characteristically confident of its ability to compete with any car \u2014 electric or not \u2014 on the market. \u201cYou will not be able to buy a better car for $35,000,\u201d he said.For the most part, industry executives say that lower prices and greater driving range are the key factors in jump-starting the electric market.Carlos Ghosn, the chief executive of the Japanese automaker Nissan and the French carmaker Renault, said recently that the electric segment needed a wider and more diverse array of models to interest a larger audience of potential buyers.Nissan has had limited success with the all-electric Leaf, but growth is a \u201cstep by step\u201d process, Mr. Ghosn said last month at the New York International Auto Show.\u201cWe\u2019re not in it so much to showcase technology,\u201d he said. \u201cOur main driver is going to be the mass market for electric cars.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In addition, automakers are being scrutinized by other government agencies, including the Justice Department, for their conduct related to recalls and safety defects.In recent weeks, G.M. announced a major recall to fix seatbelts in its trucks, and other companies have announced safety actions to repair faulty airbags.On Friday, Fiat Chrysler said it would recall 811,586 cars and S.U.V.s in the United States after reports of 41 injuries linked to transmission problems. The automaker also will recall more than 300,000 vehicles for similar problems in various international markets, including Canada and Mexico.The vehicles affected include 2014-15 Jeep Grand Cherokee S.U.V. and 2012-14 Dodge Charger and Chrysler 300 sedans.Unlike conventional transmissions, the levers do not change position when shifted. Instead, the levers return to the same position after shifting, and gear selection is indicated by lights.\u201cUnless due care is taken, drivers may draw erroneous conclusions about the status of their vehicles,\u201d Fiat Chrysler said.According to documents from the auto safety regulator, more than 300 incidents were reported in which vehicles rolled away after improper shifting, resulting in more than 100 accidents. Among the injuries were a fractured pelvis, broken ribs, cuts, sprains and severe bruising.Regulators also found that shifters in the affected vehicles were unreasonably difficult to operate.\u201cThe shifter is not intuitive and provides poor tactile and visual feedback to the driver, increasing the potential for unintended gear selection,\u201d regulators said.Fiat Chrysler said it would enhance the warning systems and otherwise modify the transmission systems in the recalled models. The company said it had already updated the shifters in newer versions of the vehicles.Advertisement"}

And with more than 115,000 orders before the car was even introduced, it is well on its way.A crowd of Tesla fans cheered as the Model 3, a sleek five-seater, was unveiled Thursday evening at the company\u2019s design studio in Hawthorne, Calif. Interested customers lined up at Tesla dealerships around the country, and the enthusiasm was matched with a torrent of comments online.The Model 3 is \u201cthe final step in the master plan, which is a mass market, affordable car,\u201d Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, said at the unveiling. \u201cIt was only possible to do after going through the prior steps.\u201d\u201cWith any new technology, it takes multiple iterations and it takes economies of scale before you can make it great and affordable,\u201d Mr. Musk said.The Model 3 will be able to travel at least 215 miles on a single charge and can go from 0 to 60 miles per hour in less than six seconds.Each advance order included a charge of $1,000, and the company took in more than $115 million within 24 hours. If those orders all translate into sales, revenue from the Model 3 will exceed $4 billion. A screen at the debut event Thursday showed online reservations continuing to tick past 133,000.\u201cThis is kind of crazy,\u201d Mr. Musk said in announcing the number of advance orders.Although the Model 3 unveiling generated intense buzz, the company faces competition from automotive giants like General Motors and Renault-Nissan, which have also begun manufacturing electric vehicles. Low fuel prices could hurt overall sales of electric vehicles.\u201cI do feel fairly confident it will be next year,\u201d Mr. Musk said to laughter from the audience.Meeting anticipated interest in the cheaper model will require a sharp increase in Tesla\u2019s production capacity. Last year the company delivered 50,580 vehicles.Mr. Musk said Thursday that he believed the company\u2019s factory in Fremont, Calif., could produce as many as 500,000 vehicles annually.\u201cIt\u2019s very doable,\u201d he said.The expansion also requires the construction of a huge battery production plant. Tesla began construction of its Gigafactory 1 in northern Nevada in 2014. It is now operational, and once it is at full capacity, it will \u201cproduce more lithium ion batteries than all other factories in the world combined,\u201d Mr. Musk said.Advertisement"}

Arms Race Goes Upscale", "Date": "2016-04-14", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseOne of the last big profit centers for Detroit\u2019s automakers, the sport utility vehicle, is under siege.An onslaught of competitive new S.U.V.s, especially in the most profitable high-end segment, is in the development pipeline or already showing up in dealer showrooms.At this year\u2019s New York International Auto Show, the star attractions weren\u2019t the usual sleek sports and muscle cars, but new luxury S.U.V.s from Jaguar, Maserati (where a line formed for a chance to be enveloped in the wood-and leather-lined interior) and even Bentley, which had its new Bentayga safely cordoned off behind velvet ropes.No wonder, with a starting price of $229,000.There\u2019s intense competition even at that stratospheric level. A Mercedes G65 AMG can easily cost more than $220,000. Range Rover, which has long dominated the S.U.V. market at the very top, has introduced a model in collaboration with Holland & Holland, the London manufacturer of sporting guns, which sells for about $245,000. (The price includes a built-in gun storage compartment, but no actual guns.)New S.U.V.s are on their way from Rolls-Royce, Lamborghini and even Aston Martin, the famed sports-car maker that put its toe in the water with a Lagonda S.U.V. at the Geneva International Motor Show. (Even James Bond, the quintessential Aston Martin driver, may have an S.U.V. in his future.)\u201cIt\u2019s an arms race at the moment,\u201d said Ian Fletcher, an automotive analyst for IHS who previously worked at Jaguar and Bentley. \u201cCarmakers are making ever bigger vehicles.\u201dAnd for the comparatively few S.U.V. customers who seem to care about fuel efficiency and the environment, this week Tesla updated its S.U.V. line with the all-electric Model X 75D, which starts at $83,000 and features sexy gullwing doors reminiscent of a vintage Mercedes sports car or DeLorean.With so much at stake, General Motors and Ford, the last American-based global automakers, are not taking the competition lightly. Each had record pretax profits for 2015 of $10.8 billion , almost entirely because of sales of trucks, S.U.V.s, and S.U.V.-like crossovers.Last year, traditional passenger car sales declined slightly in the United States, while sales of S.U.V.s and crossovers lept 16 percent. They accounted for 35 percent of all vehicle sales last year. The trend has continued this year. Through March, S.U.V. and crossover sales surged 9.3 percent from a year ago, while car sales dropped nearly 5 percent.Some of this may be because of collapsing fuel prices, but perhaps not all that much. Carmakers have narrowed the fuel-efficiency gap between traditional cars and S.U.V.s, and in any event, at the high end, the price of gas seems to have minimal impact on purchase decisions.At G.M.\u2019s flagship Cadillac brand, sales of its Escalade S.U.V. advanced nearly 25 percent last year, and its SRX crossover jumped over 13 percent. The Escalade starts at $74,000 and a Platinum edition can easily hit six figures. There has been minimal discounting, which has buoyed G.M.\u2019s profit margins. Indeed, Cadillac said sales were constrained because production couldn\u2019t keep up with demand.\u201cThe Escalade saved the Cadillac brand,\u201d Mr. Fletcher said.In China, now the world\u2019s largest car market and the ultimate battleground for automotive brand dominance, S.U.V.s already account for a third of the market. \u201cThe Chinese are going massively for these,\u201d Mr. Fletcher said. \u201cThe traditional sedan market has been weak recently, but S.U.V.s and crossovers are booming for the same reasons as they are everywhere else: The roads are crowded and there are lots of crazy drivers on them.\u201dIn developing countries where the highway infrastructure is still primitive, safety concerns are paramount and status matters, S.U.V. sales are also surging. Last year\u2019s wealth report from the global real estate consultants Knight Frank even targeted Africa as a potential growth market: \u201cAlthough wealth in Africa is extremely concentrated in certain countries, we see growing potential for luxury brands, including high-end auto marques.\u201dThe venerable Ford Explorer and Fiat Chrysler\u2019s Jeep Cherokee still dominate the middle market. Ford and G.M. featured new luxury S.U.V.s or crossovers at this year\u2019s auto shows, with more models on the way.Ford\u2019s Lincoln brand has been drawing big crowds to its new Navigator S.U.V. concept vehicle, which, like the Tesla, features gullwing doors. Its redesigned front grille looks a lot like the Jaguar and Bentley.The exotic doors will not survive when the production model goes on sale next year, but the luxurious interior probably will. It looks a little like a first-class airline cabin, featuring video screens at every seat and an intercom connecting the first and third rows of seats.Cadillac unveiled its new XT5 crossover, which replaces the popular SRX, and has said it has more S.U.V.s in the development pipeline. Still, both American makers are far behind BMW, which offers at least seven models of S.U.V.s and what it calls S.A.V.s, for Sports Activity Vehicle.Not that today\u2019s S.U.V. has much to do with sports, utility or any activity likely to work up much of a sweat. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got two kids and all their equipment and still want comfort and luxury, these models are appealing,\u201d Mr. Fletcher said. \u201cThey\u2019re not a station wagon or minivan. There\u2019s a \u2018cool\u2019 factor. You sit up high, you\u2019ve got a good view of the road, and you feel safe. Once people experience this, it\u2019s hard to go back.\u201dAutomotive purists and driving enthusiasts may sniff at the bulky profile and trucklike handling of the traditional models (Ferrari insists it won\u2019t make an S.U.V.), but automakers are following demand and looking for growth by appealing to the world\u2019s most affluent consumers. And some of the new models, like the Maserati, manage to disguise their bulk with sleek curves and distinctive styling.Many of these factors were in evidence at this spring\u2019s New York auto show. Mike Fedorenko of Westfield, N.J., told me he was trading up from a Ford Explorer to one of the new luxury S.U.V.s after recently inheriting some money. He admired the red and black leather seats in the Jaguar F-Pace and the reasonable price (starting at $42,000) but otherwise dismissed the interior appointments as \u201ccheesy.\u201d (It probably didn\u2019t help the Jaguar that the Bentley\u2019s burled walnut and quilted leather was in our peripheral vision.) He said he was leaning toward the new Maserati Levante or a Porsche Cayenne.Mr. Fedorenko said fuel efficiency wasn\u2019t a concern. \u201cI\u2019m sure the world would be a better place if we all drove Minis,\u201d he said. \u201cBut with so many crazy drivers on the road, I want the biggest vehicle I can get.\u201dAn earlier version of this column misspelled, on second reference, the surname of a prospective buyer of a luxury S.U.V. As noted in the first reference, he is Mike Fedorenko, not Federenko.The Common Sense column on Friday, about luxury automakers\u2019 entry into the S.U.V. market segment, misidentified the parent company of Bentley. It is Volkswagen, not BMW.Advertisement"}

If the self-consciousness can be charming, it also prevents \u201cThe American Side\u201d from becoming fully its own film. The movie plays like an exercise for the cast members, who labor with the stylized dialogue, and for an audience flattered at catching a reference.Still, \u201cThe American Side\u201d shows glimmers of ingenuity, both with its use of Tesla mystique and with atmospheric location work that makes Buffalo a presence. The title refers to the American side of Niagara Falls.
