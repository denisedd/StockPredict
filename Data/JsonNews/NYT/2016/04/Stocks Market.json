That may be the extent of the victory lap for the tech I.P.O. market, at least for now.In its first day of trading on Friday, shares of SecureWorks, a digital security company, have been hovering near the $14 price it set the night before. The stock opened on the Nasdaq market at $13.89.SecureWorks raised $112 million, selling eight million shares. It had been marketing nine million shares within the range of $15.50 to $17.50, indicating that demand was weaker than expected.The lackluster demand is not that surprising.For one thing, SecureWorks has little in common with so-called unicorns \u2014 those private, venture-backed start-ups with valuations above $1 billion that have been avoiding the public markets. SecureWorks is 17 years old, based in Georgia and owned by Dell.And the ways in which SecureWorks does resemble some unicorns \u2014 top-line revenue growth, a history of losses and an enterprise-software business model \u2014 are not the most encouraging for investors.Recent trading among already public security stocks did not help SecureWorks\u2019 deal.Shares of FireEye and Rapid7 declined in recent weeks as SecureWorks was meeting with potential buyers of its stock. Investors look to companies similar to the one going public when trying to determine what price they might be willing to pay for the I.P.O. When the so-called comparables slip, it can be a bad sign for the debutant.Dell will own 86 percent of SecureWorks after the offering, and it is hoping the share price will rise in the public market. Dell will also control more than 98 percent of the voting power through a separate class of shares.The I.P.O. price yields a valuation of $1.1 billion, which is almost double the roughly $600 million Dell paid for the company in 2011, according to Triton Research, which provides information on private companies.SecureWorks said it might use the proceeds from the offering to develop new solutions or enhance current ones, and fund capital expenditures. Those funds may be necessary as competition in the security world increases.The company said in the filing that it expected \u201cpricing pressures within the information security market to intensify as a result of action by our larger competitors to reduce the prices of their security monitoring, detection and prevention products and managed security services.\u201dStill, the company has drawn quite a bit of revenue from its 4,200 customers. SecureWorks reported $339.5 million in total revenue for the year through Jan. 29, a 30 percent increase from the same period last year. SecureWorks had $72.4 million in losses for the year, almost twice as much as the same period in 2015.Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase are managing the offering.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In a Big Hole for a Detroit House, but Happy", "Date": "2016-04-22", "News": "Supported byYour Money7 PhotosDETROIT \u2014 Many residents of high-cost areas entertain the dream, at least occasionally: Give up the rent or mortgage grind, liquidate assets and start over someplace cheaper, perhaps one that could use a few spirited new residents.Amy Haimerl and her husband, Karl Kaebnick, fell hard for Detroit and thought they could make their own dream of financial freedom come true when they moved here in 2013. But this is what happened: They put more than $400,000 (including all of their retirement savings) into a 3,000-square-foot, 102-year-old home in the city\u2019s West Village neighborhood that was most recently appraised at just $300,000.They claim, however, to be 100 percent satisfied and genuinely happy. Which raises a question: Are they insane?So let\u2019s start with those facts. Ms. Haimerl, who is 40, and Mr. Kaebnick, 44, had about $10,000 in liquid assets when they decided to move. They settled on a house on a block where only two homes were boarded up.They bought the smaller one, a wreck with no wires or radiators or doors or pipes, for $35,000, liquidating Ms. Haimerl\u2019s retirement account to close without a mortgage. \u201cThere is essentially nothing left inside the walls,\u201d she writes in her book. \u201cWhat we have is a pile of bricks with character.\u201dFor the renovation, they were counting on the $110,000 that would be left from Mr. Kaebnick\u2019s accounts. The previous owners had figured it would take $150,000 or so to make it habitable. What could go wrong?Well, the couple was missing two crucial bits of knowledge, one about the Detroit market and the other about themselves.First, they realized only after they had bought the house that there were no construction loans available. That was because there wasn\u2019t any evidence that after renovation, homes like theirs would be worth more than what it would cost to fix them. So whatever work the couple wanted to do, they would have to pay for it themselves. Then, they could try to get a mortgage after the work was done and take out cash to repay any other debts they incurred along the way.And it turned out that there were a lot of those debts, in part because the couple misjudged the amount of work they would need and want to do. They started by looking at options for doing just $100,000 of work, but that might have forced them to move in without any water. The only contractor who made them feel comfortable figured it would take $300,000.He went to work, and they ended up spending $400,000 total, not including the purchase price. You\u2019ve heard versions of this story before, but the specifics here involved a balcony from a crumbling church that made incredible wainscoting but begged for matching custom woodwork and installation that eventually cost $65,000.So they borrowed $75,000 from Ms. Haimerl\u2019s father and $40,000 from her grandparents and aunt. Mr. Kaebnick\u2019s family chipped in with kitchen appliances in lieu of a wedding or a gift, and the rest came from a $25,000 Lending Club loan, $50,000 in USAA personal loans and some credit card debt.The result is by no means extravagant, though it is a lot of space for two people with no designs on having children. The interior trim is bare, and the house still needs paint in many rooms. It\u2019s missing a porch, and the garage out back is crumbling.On paper, Ms. Haimerl is about the last person you would expect to go all in like this. She grew up poor and lost a house to a foreclosure in Denver several years ago, when a previous relationship disintegrated. She has even worked as a personal finance editor.The money scold in me believes she should have known better, but she believes she knows plenty. \u201cAs a contractor\u2019s daughter, I grew up with men who want to do it right,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t skimp on work now because you pay for it later.\u201d So they shored up the roof and rebuilt the rear of the structure.Then, there is her take on retirement. Her father had $75,000 to lend to her because he had been forced to liquidate a once-thriving business that he built after the family\u2019s earlier lean years. \u201cI never grew up with any idea that there would be retirement,\u201d she said. \u201cYou were trying not to go to a payday lender. My dad\u2019s retirement was supposed to be the business.\u201dMs. Haimerl is a writer and Mr. Kaebnick is a computer programmer, and perhaps they can work well into their 70s or 80s. In the meantime, their net worth is negative. They did get a mortgage after the work was done, and the appraiser assigned the $300,000 value to their home, a triumph in their neighborhood at the time.\u201cI\u2019m confident other contractors would not have made the same call,\u201d Mr. Garfield said. \u201cBut I do think everyone we have done business with has become a friend, and in that mix of things, this seemed to be the right thing to do.\u201dBut how best to explain away their lack of retirement savings? Plenty of people who sank their life savings into real estate in less desirable parts of Brooklyn or San Francisco a decade or two ago are probably thrilled.So is that how they think about the money they have put into their Detroit dream? That they bet on a city instead of a bunch of stocks? \u201cWe have gotten gun-shy about talking that way,\u201d Ms. Haimerl said. \u201cPeople here say, \u2018How dare you treat our city like an investment.\u2019\u201dMr. Kaebnick said he understood the sentiment. \u201cSo many people who stuck it out here for so long never had anything to show for it,\u201d he said. \u201cTo them, we might come across as privileged newcomers who are going to ride it to the bank.\u201dIn the meantime, Ms. Haimerl and Mr. Kaebnick have not found financial freedom in Detroit, though they insist that they are so much richer for having moved. In a poignant moment early in her book, Ms. Haimerl describes gazing longingly into a window in a newly gentrified Denver neighborhood, before her dream of homeownership there turned into a nightmare. The living room looked like luxury, a place where the residents weren\u2019t constantly hustling to hold things together.Aspiring homeowners in Detroit may well walk down her street someday soon, see her through the window and wonder how she had it so good. Would they be jealous? Should they be?\u201cI thought maybe that once you were inside the window, you didn\u2019t have to hustle,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the truth is, we\u2019re all hustling.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the surname of the contractor hired by Amy Haimerl and Karl Kaebnick for their home in Detroit. It is Calvin Garfield, not Maxwell.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Claims of a Ponzi Scheme in the Collapse of a Rare-Wine Seller", "Date": "2016-04-02", "News": "Supported byInside WealthFrom the outside, the Premier Cru wine store in Berkeley, Calif., looked like a traditional, upscale wine seller. The 29,000-square-foot store was lined with tapestries, wood shelves and a \u201crare wine room\u201d stocked with trophy Bordeaux and Burgundies.Yet Premier Cru didn\u2019t just sell wine off the shelves. According to court documents, it built a global, multimillion-dollar trading empire selling futures contracts for French wine to thousands of rich collectors and investors over the Internet. Now investigators and customers are looking into whether Premier Cru\u2019s futures business was also used to fund the largest-ever Ponzi scheme in the wine world \u2014 with some of the biggest victims coming from China.In January, facing mounting lawsuits from customers, Premier Cru filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation. The company listed $70 million in debt and only $7 million in assets. Along with more than 9,000 victims, the crash of Premier Cru has left a trail of questions: What happened to the more than $60 million in customer payments? How did a 35-year-old wine store that became a favorite of the rich suddenly go bust? And how did so many smart collectors get bilked out of millions?Premier Cru\u2019s co-founder and owner, John Fox, could not be reached for comment. His bankruptcy and criminal-defense lawyers declined to comment.Mr. Fox has invoked his Fifth Amendment right in declining to provide financial details on his bankruptcy or the case, according to lawyers. Creditors are seeking his 2016 Corvette and his 2014 Ferrari as part of the bankruptcy.\u201cA few of our old-time customers are used to waiting,\u201d Mr. Fox said at the time. \u201cThey know they\u2019ll get their wine. But customers that have come around in the last six to seven years, because we have good wines at the right price, they are not used to waiting extended periods.\u201dThe list of Premier Cru\u2019s victims reads like a who\u2019s who of wealthy wine collectors \u2014 from the billionaire Jeff Greene to top financiers on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley. Arthur Patterson, the tech venture capitalist of Accel Partners, was owed $836,000 by Premier Cru, according to court filings. Adebayo Ogunlesi, the Goldman Sachs board member and chairman of Global Infrastructure Partners, spent over $470,000 with Premier Cru.Of course, few will have sympathy for wealthy oenophiles crying over their spilled Margaux. Yet the victims also include teachers, doctors, accountants and wine store workers who used their savings to buy special-occasion wines with Premier Cru.\u201cSure it hurts,\u201d said Ned Valois, a retired Florida policeman who may have lost $800 to Premier Cru. \u201cI got suckered into it by the prices. They seemed too good to be true, and they were.\u201dPremier Cru\u2019s collapse has sent a chill through the broader wine and collectibles market. As wine, art, classic cars and other collectibles have soared in value and transformed from status trophies into financial investments, they have also become more prone to fraud. Although fake vintage wine has dogged the industry for years, there are signs that wine fraud has reached a new \u201cfinancialized\u201d stage, where millions of dollars are lost without a single bottle changing hands.Premier Cru started out as a low-price wine shop for high-income collectors. Founded in 1980 by Mr. Fox and other partners, it outgrew its store in Emeryville, Calif., and in 2011 opened its gigantic emporium on University Avenue in Berkeley.Clients said Mr. Fox was the driving force behind Premier Cru. Tall, businesslike and better known for his taste in fast cars than fine wine, Mr. Fox often dealt with Premier Cru\u2019s biggest clients and orders. Much of Premier Cru\u2019s business came online. Clients say wine buyers often search the Internet for the best prices for top wines, and Premier Cru often undercut its competitors by 15 to 20 percent \u2014 significant savings for wines that may sell for more than $1,000 a bottle.In the 2000s, Premier Cru started expanding its business of selling wine futures, according to clients. Futures allow customers to pay for wine (usually Bordeaux or Burgundy) while it is still in the barrel but is not yet bottled or sold in retail outlets. The wine is delivered more than a year later. If a wine increases in value while it\u2019s aging, the buyer gets the wine at a discount. Some buyers can also use futures to buy wine they can later flip for a profit, making futures more like a financial investment.Thomas Boothe, a lawyer in Portland, Ore., started buying wine and futures from Premier Cru in the late 1980s, he said. He talked with Mr. Fox several times over the years.\u201cHe was pretty formal, not someone you would chat about family or wine with,\u201d Mr. Boothe said. While Mr. Boothe\u2019s shipments would sometimes be delayed, Premier Cru largely delivered as promised \u2014 until about 2010, he said. The delays and excuses kept building until April 2015 when, Mr. Boothe said, Premier Cru owed him more than $161,000 for wine that was never delivered. His orders included a $9,600 bottle of Roman\u00e9e-Conti and $2,700 bottles of P\u00e9trus.When Mr. Boothe called the store to complain, he said Mr. Fox offered various excuses, such as computer errors, shipping snags and problems with a wine merchant in France. Mr. Boothe filed suit in January. Like many lawsuits filed by customers against Premier Cru, Mr. Boothe\u2019s has been stayed by the bankruptcy. Mr. Boothe said his credit card company has reimbursed him for all but $50,000 or $60,000 of his claims.In 2010 and 2011, prices for many Bordeaux wines fell as Chinese buyers started turning to Burgundy. The value of some Bordeaux wines fell more than 40 percent below their original futures price. As the values fell, Premier Cru\u2019s prices went from \u201csimply low to irrationally low,\u201d according to Mr. Boothe.For instance, clients say Premier Cru was selling bottles of 1996 Lafite Rothschild for $600, even though they normally sell for $1,000 or more.\u201cAt that point the alarm bells should have sounded,\u201d Mr. Boothe said.When Brad Karp, a New Mexico real estate developer, started buying wine from Premier Cru, he was happy with the initial deliveries. But then he started buying Burgundy and Bordeaux futures purely as financial investments.\u201cI wanted a different risk profile from stocks,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I started allocating capital toward wine futures.\u201dBy 2015 he was owed $712,000 by Premier Cru, he said. Some of the wine he bought was later delivered and his credit-card company refunded some of his payments. Yet Mr. Karp estimates he is still owed about $300,000.\u201cI don\u2019t expect to see that money or wine again,\u201d he said.Some of biggest victims appear to be from China. Lawrence Wai-Mun Hui of Hong Kong spent about $981,000 for wine from Premier Cru that was never delivered, according to a court documents. A collector named Amanda Gong in Harbin, China, is owed $669,000, while a Chinese wine collector and investor named Bo Feng is claiming losses of $660,000, according to filings.So far, the bankruptcy trustee and investigators have not been able to find out how Mr. Fox or his partners spent or lost the money. Mr. Fox filed for Chapter 7 personal bankruptcy in February claiming assets of less than $50,000 and debts of $50 million to $100 million. He sold his home in Alamo, Calif., in January for about $3 million and is now renting, according to lawyers involved in the case.Mr. Boothe said Mr. Fox complained to him of health problems in one of their last conversations, late last year.\u201cHe had back issues, and he said the stress was getting to him,\u201d Mr. Boothe said.An article last Sunday about Premier Cru, a Berkeley, Calif., wine store that is under investigation on suspicion of running a Ponzi scheme on futures contracts for French wines, erroneously included one person among the creditors or customers of the store. William Koch, of Medford, Ore., was in that group; William I. Koch, the Palm Beach, Fla., billionaire, was not.ROBERT FRANK is CNBC wealth editor and the author of \u201cRichistan.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Investing With a Conscience, but Done by a Robot", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported byCracker Barrel Old Country Store, the company behind a chain of down-home restaurants, might not seem an obvious model for advanced financial technology. Its specialty is vintage: vintage food, and in its gift shops, vintage toys and vintage music in the form of hymnal CDs.Yet an upstart fund manager called Arabesque Partners has determined that Cracker Barrel is among the most attractive investments out there in a special category that takes into account environmental, social and governance factors \u2014 known in the industry as ESG.And even more intriguing: The calculation was not made by a human analyst, but by a robotic one.In the most recent full quarter for which data was available, Cracker Barrel represented 1.31 percent of the Arabesque Prime fund, which factors in a company\u2019s sustainability and corporate responsibility track record before investing. That was more than any other stock, including more obvious suspects like Unilever, the consumer goods giant that is obsessed with sustainability, and Xinyi Solar Holdings, a big maker of solar panel components.Arabesque is one of a growing number of investors that are leaning on mountains of new data about companies\u2019 environmental, social and governance performances in hopes of making more profitable trades.New firms like Arabesque are making ESG data a core part of their strategy. Goldman Sachs has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to start an ESG-focused exchange-traded fund. And the biggest money managers in the world, including BlackRock, now regularly incorporate ESG analysis as they compose their portfolios.The motivation is not entirely about ethics. Underpinning the strategy is a belief that companies that take better care of the environment and their communities will perform better in the long run.\u201cNo one wants to be patronized with a moral argument,\u201d said Andreas Feiner, head of ESG research at Arabesque. \u201cYou tell investors that these companies are going to perform better.\u201dAnd yet even among the most strident capitalists, there is a growing sense that doing well by doing good is in vogue.\u201cWe have the opportunity to marry making money with a purpose,\u201d Mr. Feiner said. \u201cThat is a very rare thing in finance.\u201dWhat makes the Arabesque position in Cracker Barrel all the more surprising is that it wasn\u2019t a fund manager who made the decision to invest. It was an algorithm.Arabesque bills itself as the first firm exclusively focused on ESG investing through quantitative analysis \u2014 that is, with algorithms, rather than humans, picking the stocks. It has two funds, with about $50 million under management. Its Prime fund is fully invested in equities and rebalanced quarterly, while its Systematic fund moves money to cash holdings during periods of market volatility and is rebalanced daily.To make these decisions, Arabesque\u2019s technology relies on an expanding universe of data concerning the ESG performance of thousands of companies. Among the biggest suppliers of such information are Bloomberg, Sustainalytics and MSCI. Bloomberg said that about 15,000 of its customers regularly accessed the ESG data it provided through its terminals.To compile the data, firms like Bloomberg mine regulatory filings, company sustainability reports and websites to find seemingly obscure information, such as how much nitrous oxide a manufacturer emits each year, how many employees died on the job, and how many women are in management positions.Once firms like Arabesque get their hands on the data, they add it to their algorithms and place their faith \u2014 and funds \u2014 in the wisdom of the machine.Arabesque has gone further than most, turning over the entire composition of its funds to algorithms rather than to humans. But many traditional institutional investors are moving in similar directions. At Newton, part of BNY Mellon, ESG considerations are part of the everyday investment decisions.\u201cTo make the best risk-adjusted return decision, what I am doing is thinking more broadly and more holistically about things that a lot of investors don\u2019t traditionally think about,\u201d said Sandra Carlisle, head of responsible investment at Newton. \u201cTake climate change. It\u2019s very clear that that manifests itself in physical risk, in all sorts of things. That was not something that we were thinking about in the 20th century.\u201dBNY Mellon scoops up data from Bloomberg and Sustainalytics, as well as RepRisk, which does broad ESG analysis; CDP, which focuses on carbon emissions; and Institutional Shareholder Services, a corporate governance specialist.About 15 years ago, the accounting scandals at Enron and WorldCom began to focus investors\u2019 attention on the importance of corporate governance. After that, investors began to wonder if environmental and social factors should be on their radar, too.\u201cThe door opened a crack so you could have a conversation about the possibility of these things,\u201d said Michael Jantzi, chief executive of Sustainalytics, one of the main providers of ESG data.\u201cMore and more people are realizing that this is a smart thing to do when you\u2019re making investments,\u201d Ms. Carlisle said. \u201cBetter to know than not to know.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Does Your Stockbroker Draw Complaints? Here\u2019s How to Find Out", "Date": "2016-04-08", "News": "Supported byYour Money\u25a0 Among brokers employed from 2005 to 2015, 7.28 percent had at least one disclosure in their industry records for a settled consumer complaint or worse.\u25a0 Many household-name firms have double the percentage of brokers with such marks. Oppenheimer tops the list at 19.6 percent.\u25a0 Five of the 10 counties with the highest percentage of brokers with disclosures are in Florida.To spot-check these figures, I looked up all 50 Oppenheimer brokers within 25 miles or so of Palm Beach. Seventeen of them \u2014 or 34 percent \u2014 had spotty records, and some had nine or 10 things to disclose. Then I called them all and tried to ask them how they would advise readers to evaluate their records. The company acknowledges that it has some work to do.Before we get there, however, let\u2019s stop and talk about this data, where it comes from and some of the assumptions the researchers made.Any of these items results in what the database refers to as a disclosure. A disclosure is not evidence of wrongdoing in and of itself, because there are disclosures even when a customer brings a complaint and arbitrators dismiss it. Still, any disclosure ought to give a customer or potential customer pause.The analysis relied on a particular definition of \u201cmisconduct.\u201d To them, it is fair to describe settled consumer complaints as misconduct. After all, the median settlement amount that aggrieved consumers receive is $40,000, which would pay for a lot of a lawyer\u2019s time to defend an innocent broker. A quarter of the settlements exceed $120,000, though settlements generally include boilerplate language about not having admitted or denied wrongdoing.Professor Matvos said he still believed that their definition of misconduct was conservative. He added that even when brokers had a complaint that was dismissed or dropped, that was still predictive of future problems. And brokers who do have disclosures for misconduct, by the professors\u2019 definition, are five times as likely, on average, to end up with similar marks on their records in the future as all other brokers. (The other broker disclosures that meet the professors\u2019 definition of misconduct are regulatory actions, a job change after an allegation, customer disputes with actual awards and completed civil actions.)But whatever the correct definition of misconduct, down in Florida, Oppenheimer\u2019s roster of brokers would raise most reasonable people\u2019s eyebrows. Most of the professionals there with disclosures have more than one. One person who recently left the firm had a no-contest plea for felonious assault on his record.Does Oppenheimer have specific standards for whom it is willing to hire and retain? Yes, according to the company, but they are proprietary. In a statement, the company said that it had replaced the branch manager in Boca Raton, Fla. It added that it was also making \u201csweeping\u201d changes to its team of brokers there and had already asked \u201ca number\u201d of them to leave.He\u2019s right about that. After all, 80 percent of Oppenheimer\u2019s brokerage force has a clean record, and many of them would no doubt do right by consumers. The new fiduciary rule \u2014 and ever-increasing compliance efforts at Oppenheimer and elsewhere in the industry \u2014 will probably help some.Still, you cannot be too wary when turning your money over to a financial professional. If you or your relatives are in Florida or your broker is, it sure seems that you need to be especially careful. The researchers note that in general, brokerage customers who are older, less educated and wealthier tend to end up in trouble most often.If your broker does have disclosures (and you should check every year or so for new ones that may have popped up), ask some questions. If the response is defensive, that ought to tell you something. If brokers don\u2019t like answering your inquiries, perhaps they ought to work in an industry where there isn\u2019t as much disclosure.If the response is unintelligible, keep pressing. If the brokers have gotten in trouble for pushing complex products that you (or they) don\u2019t understand, then that is a significant sign as well. The money management industry is much too complicated, and it\u2019s not your job to translate the gibberish that some of its sales agents spew.Too many people do not do this, which is a source of endless frustration and sadness to people like Professor Matvos. \u201cDespite the information being out there, the most vulnerable people don\u2019t know that it\u2019s there,\u201d he said. \u201cThe big puzzle we face is how do we get those people to use the information at their disposal?\u201dAdvertisement"}

But the kind of order created by IEX, known as a discretionary peg or D-Peg order, is not yet in use on exchanges.\u201cIf the S.E.C. supports an expansion of the ways an exchange can innovate with order types,\u201d she said, \u201cthe New York Stock Exchange is interested in introducing new offerings to meet our clients\u2019 needs and to respond to changing market structure and regulation.\u201dIt\u2019s great that the exchange wants to incorporate a new technology designed to protect both investors and the public. And the invention that it wants to mimic is entirely separate from the aspect of the IEX exchange application that the Big Board considers unfair and problematic.That element is the speed bump that IEX has proposed for its system, which would delay all participants\u2019 trades by 350 microseconds. This prevents participants \u2014 such as high-frequency traders \u2014 from being able to trade on IEX in reaction to price movements that appear on other venues but that have not yet been recorded on the exchange.But because of the S.E.C.\u2019s delay on the IEX exchange application, the regulator is putting an innovator at a disadvantage that just doesn\u2019t seem right.Not only is the S.E.C.\u2019s foot-dragging preventing IEX from becoming an exchange, now it may let an established exchange copy IEX technology. Even worse, as a result of the delay, the Big Board would be able to attract customers using the IEX technology before IEX could, even if the S.E.C. approves it as an exchange.Some of the delay is attributable to changes IEX has made to its proposal in answer to criticisms. But not all.I raised the issue of fairness with the S.E.C. As is its custom, it declined to comment.All this frustrates Brad Katsuyama, who founded IEX with eight colleagues in 2013. \u201cIt\u2019s an innovator\u2019s dilemma when an incumbent like the New York Stock Exchange can lobby aggressively to delay a new entrant like IEX, while simultaneously copying our innovations,\u201d he said.For two years, IEX worked on a formula designed to predict, as accurately as possible, the price at which a stock was going to trade next. Having completed that work, it created a new order type using the formula that IEX says is accurate to within 90 percent.Essentially IEX\u2019s technology ensures that a customer whose buy or sell order has been placed at a certain price won\u2019t lose out by having his or her trade executed at a price that is not yet reflected in the rapidly changing market.Institutional customers on IEX\u2019s existing trading platform are using this technology and applaud it.One is Mehmet Kinak, head of electronic trading at T. Rowe Price. \u201cIf the order book is changing,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019re not fast enough to see it. But a sophisticated high-frequency trader can dash to any place that is slow and try to take advantage of a move that\u2019s already happened.\u201dThat risk diminishes with IEX\u2019s D-peg. \u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic order type,\u201d he added, \u201cbecause it protects us but also allows the stock at times to move in my favor.\u201dThis is largely because the investors\u2019 orders were executed at prices that were closer to the actual market rather than at the midpoint between the bid and offer on a stock, known as the spread.\u201cWe saw a marked improvement in the midpoint orders offered by IEX,\u201d Mr. Suryawanshi said in an interview. \u201cAbsent D-Peg orders, customers would be giving up half the spread all the time. That may sound small but all these half-a-spread improvements over a large set of orders really make a big difference.\u201dMany investors are already benefiting from IEX\u2019s invention, and if the Big Board wins the right to create its new order type, those beneficiaries may increase. That\u2019s all to the good.Still, the S.E.C.\u2019s delay is hurting IEX in more ways than one. And as the regulatory deliberations drag on, that only adds to the puzzlement.An earlier version of this column gave an incorrect title for Jatin Suryawanshi of Jefferies & Company.

{"Headline": "Small-Cap Growth Funds: For Investors With Nerves of Steel", "Date": "2016-04-09", "News": "Supported byInvesting in small-cap growth funds requires a strong stomach because this part of the stock market tends to lurch wildly.Since 2000, the Russell 2000 Growth exchange-traded-fund index, which tracks small-cap growth stocks, has gone through three years with stomach-churning double-digit losses of 22 percent, 30 percent and 38 percent.During that period, small-cap growth stocks were more than 25 percent more volatile than large-cap stocks, according to Christopher Bennett, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. And some big moves have already occurred this year. The iShares Russell 2000 Growth E.T.F., which mirrors that Russell index, plunged nearly 19 percent in January and early February before rebounding to close the quarter down 4.6 percent.\u201cSmall-cap stocks tend to overreact to the news,\u201d said Ralph Bassett, portfolio co-manager for the Aberdeen US Small-Cap Equity fund.His fund has outperformed its peers in the last four years, according to Morningstar. This year it returned nearly 3.9 percent while small-cap growth funds over all finished the first quarter off 4.1 percent.In-depth talks with top management at scores of companies help Aberdeen avoid some investing mistakes, Mr. Bassett said. \u201cA lot of growth managers have overpaid for growth that wasn\u2019t realized,\u201d he said. This has been especially true in some areas of technology and in biotech, he added.But the risk inherent in the sector cannot be avoided. Mr. Bassett embraces it. He is not a big believer in diversification, despite its evident benefits in reducing the volatility of a portfolio. \u201cChoosing the right companies is more important than diversification for diversification\u2019s sake,\u201d he said. Winners this year include the G-III Apparel Group and the egg producer Cal-Maine Foods.Virtus Small-Cap Sustainable Growth also outperformed its peers in 2014, 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. \u201cA lot of managers are focused on finding companies with the highest rate of growth,\u201d Todd Beiley, a co-manager of the fund, said. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on finding companies with competitive advantages that will produce the longest-lasting growth.\u201dCompanies with \u201cvery strong and durable competitive advantages\u201d figure to have \u201cmuch higher earnings persistence and lower earnings volatility,\u201d Mr. Beiley said.The fund owns MarketAxess Holdings (MKTX), an electronic trading platform for bonds. MarketAxess has dominant market share among electronically traded high-grade corporate bonds. With more than 1,000 broker-dealers, pension funds, mutual funds and other participants on its platform, MarketAxess enjoys a \u201cnetwork effect\u201d advantage, Mr. Beiley said. The liquidity produced by so many buyers and sellers keeps attracting new traders to the platform. \u201cTheir success feeds on itself,\u201d he said.Copart, another Virtus holding, also benefits from a network effect, he said. Copart auctions used vehicles online, including those that have been severely damaged in crashes. The insurance companies that use Copart want the largest number of potential buyers for those wrecks, and Copart has \u201cthe biggest auctions,\u201d Mr. Beiley said. The company says more than 100,000 vehicles are available for bidding daily.Heico, which sells more than 10,000 types of aircraft replacement parts, has an advantage of another sort, Mr. Beiley said. Replacement parts are subject to approval by the Federal Aviation Administration. The complex approval process and the inclination of buyers to go with established sources make this a tough market for others to crack, Mr. Beiley said.Timing the sale of securities is especially important for mutual funds in this volatile category. For example, the Needham Small-Cap Growth fund was hit hard last year and early this year. In 2015, the fund lost nearly 9 percent. But since Feb. 12 it has rebounded and ended the quarter with a return of 7.5 percent.Chris Retzler, portfolio manager, resisted the impulse to unload some positions with heavy losses and has been rewarded. \u201cWe like to sell at certain valuation points relative to historical valuation,\u201d he said. By January, for example, TTM Technologies, which manufactures printed circuit boards, had fallen to about $5 a share from a 2015 high near $11. But shares stood at multiyear lows in their price-to-sales and price-to-earnings ratios, so Mr. Retzler did not sell. TTM rebounded, rising more than 30 percent through the quarter since bottoming.It is impossible to predict the market accurately and consistently, but one thing is quite likely: Small-cap growth stocks should continue to be especially volatile.Laura Lallos, a Morningstar analyst, noted that the category often leads the way in speculative rallies but tends to \u201cunderperform in down markets.\u201dNancy Tooke, manager of the Eaton Vance Small-Cap fund, which holds growth and value stocks, put it this way: \u201c In a downwardly biased market, growth stocks, which have high valuations, tend to do the worst.\u201dInvestors should be prepared for a rough ride.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Junk Bonds: Never Stodgy and Steadier Than You Might Think", "Date": "2016-04-09", "News": "Supported byAt first glance, high-yield bond funds had a strong start to 2016 with a first-quarter gain of 2 percent. But if you were paying closer attention, the ride was anything but smooth.In the first six weeks of the year, the largest high-yield bond fund, BlackRock High Yield Bond, lost 4.6 percent, and the biggest exchange-traded fund, iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond, shed more than 5 percent. During that time, the Vanguard Total Bond Market index fund, the largest fund that sticks with stodgy Treasuries and other high-grade bonds, gained 2.4 percent.The steep losses through mid-February were the latest illustration that high-yield bonds are an unequivocal failure when it comes to delivering on the classic role of fixed-income investments: ballast that steadies your portfolio when stocks are off on one of their depressive jags. While it makes perfect sense to shun high-yield bonds \u2014 also known as junk bonds \u2014 for the part of your portfolio that you rely on for stability and predictability, completely swearing off junk could be a failure of portfolio imagination.Junk bonds can play a useful role, as part of the riskier, stock side of your portfolio. In that context, junk bonds are fairly reliable, delivering higher income than dividend-paying stocks. For example, the Vanguard High-Yield Corporate bond fund has a current yield near 6 percent, compared with 3.2 percent for the Vanguard High Dividend Yield index fund. The lofty income payouts of high-yield bonds have been the major driver of equitylike total returns over long stretches.From 1983 through the end of 2015, the 8.8 percent annualized return of an index of high-yield bonds captured 80 percent of the gain for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, with about half the volatility of the stock index. An analysis by AllianceBernstein found that if you kept 75 percent in stocks over that stretch and moved the other 25 percent into high-yield bonds, the 10.4 percent annualized return trailed the all-stock return by less than a half a percentage point, while clocking in with 16 percent less volatility than the all-stock portfolio.\u201cThere\u2019s a pervasive attitude that high yield is scary, but that misses the big opportunity,\u201d said Gershon Distenfeld, director of high yield at AllianceBernstein. \u201cUsed in place of stocks it dampens your volatility without costing you much in return.\u201dOne way to measure value is to compare interest payouts. The long-term trend is that junk yields are on average 5.25 percentage points higher than yields from Treasuries. Right now this so-called spread is seven percentage points, meaning investors are getting paid more than the historical norm to dip a toe into the junk bond market. Mr. Swaffield found that in the two dozen times since the late 1980s when the spread was that wide, the annualized total return for high yield over the next three years ranged from 8 to 16 percent.Robust economic growth could in turn spur solid earnings growth, which would help stocks post strong returns from today\u2019s lofty levels, but that isn\u2019t expected. S&P Capital IQ, a research firm that serves the financial industry, projects that the S.&P. 500 will post 1 percent earnings growth this year.\u201cAn economy that feels like it is running through mud doesn\u2019t look good for stocks at current valuations,\u201d said Raymond Kennedy, a portfolio manager of the Hotchkis & Wiley High Yield fund. \u201cBut high yield can do well in a slow-growth economy.\u201d As long as cash flow remains positive, high-yield issuers can make interest payments even if earnings growth slows to a crawl.While junk bonds are generally less volatile than stocks, don\u2019t presume this will be a placid cruise.Defaults are always a front-and-center concern. In a recent analysis that made the case for junk being one of the better asset values in the market, Ben Inker, co-head of asset allocation at GMO, noted that the 4.6 percent average default rate for the bonds since 1988 ranges from a high of 15 percent to a low of less than 1 percent.Defaults are expected to rise this year from 2015\u2019s 3.5 percent pace. Junk issues tied to energy, metals and mining represent about 18 percent of the value of outstanding junk debt. Mr. Swaffield of Eaton Vance said the entire junk market is currently trading at a level that prices in a default rate of about 18 percent \u2014 as if everything linked to the battered commodities market were doomed. Moody\u2019s forecasts an overall default rate of 4.7 percent over the next 12 months, a bit lower than the 6 percent projected by Eaton Vance.With a hypothetical 6 percent default rate, the damage to a broad junk portfolio would be about 3.6 percentage points based on typical net losses on defaulted high-yield bonds. If you\u2019re starting at a yield of 7 or 8 percent, a 3.6 percentage point cut still leaves you with a return of around 4 percent. And there\u2019s the potential for actively managed funds backed by a team of credit analysts to sidestep some of the carnage. Last year as junk came under pressure from commodity-related defaults and investors running for the exits, two-thirds of actively managed junk funds did better than their benchmark index, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.There\u2019s also the \u201claw of small numbers\u201d to contend with, said Carl Kaufman, a manager of the Osterweis Strategic Income fund. \u201cWith growth already anemic, any disappointing news, no matter how small, will trigger an amazing amount of volatility,\u201d he added.A shift in the trading mechanics of the junk market is also fueling volatility. The role of banks as middlemen in the bond market has diminished since the financial crisis. That has made bond trading a choppier endeavor. For example, after falling 4.5 percent in the first six weeks of this year, high-yield bonds then rallied to a near 7 percent gain over the next four weeks. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen whipping around like this,\u201d said Mr. Kennedy, who has been running portfolios with high-yield bonds for 30 years. \u201cVolatility is here to stay,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you\u2019re willing to close your eyes for a few years you are going to do well.\u201dAn article in the Mutual Fund Quarterly last Sunday about the role of junk bonds in an investment portfolio miscalculated the effect a 6 percent default rate would have on a broad junk bond portfolio. The loss would be 3.6 percentage points, not 2.4 percentage points. A further calculation based on that number misstated the return that would be left after that loss. It would be around 4 percent, not 5 percent or more.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "BlackRock, Hurt by Volatile Markets, Reports Slide in Profit", "Date": "2016-04-14", "News": "Supported byVolatile global markets had their effect on BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset management firm, as its earnings for the first quarter of this year declined by 14 percent.Bonds and stocks rallied in March, but persistent selling rattled the markets in the first two months of the year, as oil prices slid and concerns mounted over China\u2019s slowing economy.For the quarter, BlackRock said on Thursday, its net earnings declined to $711 million, compared with $830 million in the quarter a year ago. The firm\u2019s assets under management, the most critical gauge of an investment managers success, declined by only 1 percent, to $4.7 trillion.\u201cIn a volatile quarter, we only had a 1 percent drop in assets under management,\u201d Laurence D. Fink, BlackRock\u2019s chief executive, said in an interview on Thursday. \u201cGrowth in E.T.F.s helped, and we continue to see strong flows into our funds from institutional investors.\u201dCompared with other less diversified asset managers that have been experiencing pronounced investor withdrawals more several years now, BlackRock was buoyed by its exchange-traded funds division, which was responsible for $24 billion of the firm\u2019s $36 billion net inflow for the quarter.Some $27 billion of the inflows came from passive, index-based strategies, which continue to attract more funds than higher-priced actively managed approaches. Exchange-traded funds are low-priced funds that track a variety of different indexes and investment strategies.So even in a quarter when investor sentiment swung from negative to positive, BlackRock\u2019s iShares unit was able to lure investors into its defensive Treasury bill funds in the beginning of the year and its riskier high-yield and emerging market funds last month.It is shaping up to be another grim year for the nation\u2019s biggest banks. They were hit hard by a bad environment for trading and deal-making.BlackRock Solutions, the firm\u2019 advisory practice, also bucked the down quarter, increasing revenue 16 percent from the quarter a year ago.Growth was driven by the Aladdin risk management platform, which acts like a central nervous system of sorts, allowing an investment manager to assess the risk and liquidity of its assets at any given moment.BlackRock uses the platform itself and has become increasingly successful in selling this service to its institutional clients who are under persistent pressure from regulators to disclose the risk of the securities they own and their ability to sell them in a pinch.As to the future, Mr. Fink said he expected equity markets to remain robust on the expectation that there would not be a hard economic landing in China. He did caution, though, that there could be a number of political surprises in the months ahead that could influence investor sentiment \u2014 including worries over Britain leaving the European Union and the uncertainties of the United States presidential race.\u201cWe are living in a world of political uncertainty,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misstated the amount of net investments that BlackRock reported for its exchange traded funds division for the first quarter. It was $24 billion, not $26 billion.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "JPMorgan Chase Reports Lower Quarterly Profit", "Date": "2016-04-13", "News": "Supported byWith investors expecting a weak first quarter for the banks, JPMorgan Chase delivered results that were slightly better than the forecasts.JPMorgan, the first of the major banks to report its financial results for the first three months of the year, said on Wednesday that both revenue and profit slid in the first quarter, from a year earlier, largely as a result of bad conditions in the financial markets.The bank\u2019s overall revenue fell 3 percent from the quarter a year earlier, while profit fell 7 percent. The bank earned $5.2 billion in the first quarter, or $1.35 a share. Analysts had been expecting profit to fall to $1.26 a share, according to Thomson Reuters.\u201cDespite challenging market conditions we delivered really quite good performance in the quarter with diversification allowing us to perform well in difficult environments,\u201d the firm\u2019s chief financial officer, Marianne Lake, said in a call with investors Wednesday morning.JPMorgan\u2019s success in beating expectations helped push up its stock price 4.2 percent on Wednesday. The stocks of other big banks, which will report their earnings over the next week, also rose.The first quarter is typically a strong time for global banks, as clients prepare to put their money to use \u2014 but this year has not followed that trend because of all the volatility in the global markets.The falling prices of oil and stocks pushed down results in JPMorgan\u2019s Wall Street division. Revenue from both stock and bond trading were down, depressing overall market revenue by 13 percent from a year earlier. The volatile markets also put a damper on mergers and acquisitions. Revenue in that business fell 19 percent.It is shaping up to be another grim year for the nation\u2019s biggest banks. They were hit hard by a bad environment for trading and deal-making.JPMorgan put aside another $529 million to cover for potential losses on loans it has made to oil and natural gas companies, which have been hurt by the falling cost of oil. It put aside another $162 million for metals and mining companies.The numbers looked better in JPMorgan\u2019s consumer bank.Consumers took out more mortgages and credit card loans, suggesting some optimism in the economy. Profit in the consumer division rose 12 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier.The firm\u2019s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, said in a statement: \u201cWhile challenging markets impacted the industry, we maintained our leadership positions and market share in the corporate and investment bank and asset management, reflecting the strength of our platform. Even in a challenging environment, clients continue to turn to us in the global markets and we saw positive net long-term asset flows in asset management.\u201dMs. Lake said that on the Wall Street side of the company, the bad market conditions had abated at the end of the first quarter and the beginning of the second quarter.But she warned that it was too soon to tell whether that would continue.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Investors Look for Solid Footing After Market Recovery", "Date": "2016-04-09", "News": "Supported byStocks went nowhere fast in the first quarter, plunging into an abyss and rocketing right back out to end modestly above where they began. It\u2019s as if traders concluded first that economic and corporate conditions were profoundly disappointing, and then, with equal certainty, that conditions were much better than they had come to expect.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index finished the quarter with a gain of 0.8 percent after falling more than 10 percent. The benchmark index ended March at 2,059.74.The quarter had two halves for other assets, too, often taking investors on even wilder rides. The Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks, down 16 percent at one point, ended down 1.7 percent; emerging-market stocks lost almost as much before ending up nearly 7 percent; crude oil fell about 30 percent, then recouped all of the deficit and more to finish up 3 percent.Investment advisers make persuasive cases that stocks will trade as they did in the first quarter \u2014 either the first part or the second, maybe both. Likewise they contend that oil, emerging markets and the other dead cats may have been given a second life or are just bouncing. It\u2019s hard to know what to prepare for, because while sentiment clearly changed in February, economic indicators and prospects for corporate results remain murky.\u201cEarnings beats are being done through buybacks and lower tax rates,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a quality way to beat expectations.\u201dBuying back stock increases earnings per share by dividing profits over a smaller number of shares. There may be no gain in real earnings.Yet as earnings expectations continue to be cut, stocks get more expensive, even with the market going nowhere. The S.&P. 500 ended the first quarter at roughly 17 times estimated 2016 earnings. With valuations high and profit growth hard to come by, Mr. Wilhelm said, \u201cWe\u2019re pretty cautious on the market.\u201d\u201cThere is no margin for safety for any kind of bad news,\u201d he warned.\u201cYou have to have everything working positively\u201d for the market to be worth its present valuation, he said, \u201cbut that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening. The economy is weak relative to history, and revenue growth is not there, as well, relative to expectations.\u201dThe move off the lows has been striking in assets that had the largest declines, including value stocks, emerging markets and commodities. That signals an attitude adjustment that persuades Mr. Turnill that the rally will persist.\u201cIn the last six weeks, we\u2019ve had a V-shaped rebound in risk assets accompanied by a change in market leadership,\u201d he said. That indicates to him that the economy and markets have entered \u201ca sweet spot where growth is good enough and fears of recession have diminished, but there\u2019s still no material evidence of renewed inflation.\u201dThe sugar rush late in the first quarter helped domestic stock funds tracked by Morningstar to erase most of their earlier losses, but not all. They fell 0.1 percent on average, eroded by declines of 13.7 percent in portfolios that specialize in health care, 5.9 percent in financial sector funds, 4.1 percent in small-company growth and 2.9 percent in technology.Utility funds bucked the trend, rising 11.4 percent. Portfolios devoted to natural resources were up 6.1 percent, and specialists in precious-metals mining stocks rose 38.9 percent.Bond funds were uniformly solid. The average taxable one rose 2.1 percent. High-yield funds were up 2 percent and municipal funds 0.6 percent.Central banks in Europe and Japan have been even more accommodating, keeping rates at historically low \u2014 even negative \u2014 levels and supporting markets through the asset purchases called quantitative easing.\u201cPart of the reason that the risk of recession is lower is the coordinated policy response globally,\u201d Mr. Turnill said. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the story of why markets are in better shape.\u201dHe cautioned that they might drop out of their sweet spot if a deflationary threat emerged. Energy prices could reverse recent gains, for instance, or Chinese authorities could make a misstep in managing their currency. A danger in the opposite direction could occur, he said, if \u201cinflation risk picks up and the Fed looks like it\u2019s behind the curve.\u201d\u201cYou can see the improvement,\u201d he said. \u201cInflation is better,\u201d meaning the risk of deflation is diminishing, \u201cand unemployment is steadily falling.\u201dFunds that own foreign stocks were down 1.1 percent in the first quarter, held back by losses in Europe and India portfolios and supported by a 16 percent gain in Latin America funds that helped the average diversified emerging-market fund return 4 percent. Emerging-market bond funds were also strong, rising 5.9 percent.Mr. Crooke finds good investment opportunities in Britain, where stocks and the pound have suffered from worries about the outcome of a June 23 referendum on continued membership in the European Union. He expects that \u201cpeople will vote for their jobs and to stay in the second-largest trading bloc in the world.\u201dHe likes \u201cquality names listed in London that do business around the world\u201d and also favors stocks of companies in core European countries such as France, the Netherlands and Switzerland that engage in activities in ordinarily stable sectors like health care and consumer staples.Mr. Crooke added that he was not buying into the rally in the most beaten-down market segments.\u201cI\u2019m not getting sucked into this commodity updraft\u201d or the rally in emerging markets, he said. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot that\u2019s telling us conditions are getting better.\u201d\u201cCommodities have recovered, emerging markets have outperformed the developed world for the first time\u201d in quite a while, \u201cand value has outperformed growth,\u201d Mr. Hallett said. \u201cIt looks to us that there\u2019s at least a possibility that more cyclicality is coming back into favor. Whether it lasts the whole year remains to be seen, but it seems to be a little more than a dead-cat bounce.\u201dIn his view, oil prices, which ended the first quarter above $35 a barrel, should stabilize between $40 and $60 rather than \u201ccrash back down.\u201d As for emerging markets, he anticipates strong returns, especially for banks and industrial companies, as stock prices rise and local currencies, which also have been hit hard, revive.Mr. Turnill agrees that the rebound in commodities and emerging markets has further to run.\u201cIn a world where there are very few cheap assets, these are areas where there\u2019s real value,\u201d he said. He also finds good value in Europe and in stocks generally over bonds.Mr. Wilhelm is emphasizing large businesses with low debt and low fixed costs in Touchstone Focused. He tends to find them in traditionally defensive sectors like health and consumer staples and in industrial companies that sell large amounts of services with their products.It can take some time for a market to reach its peak, he said. \u201cIt takes a while for people to wake up and realize that things are a little tougher than they thought. With each retest of the highs, more people become aware that we might have a problem.\u201dIt\u2019s one that central banks might not be able to solve, he warned.\u201cThe Fed often creates excitement through monetary policy, but at some point the fundamentals have to be there,\u201d Mr. Wilhelm said.Mr. Freeman at Westwood has a similar affinity for high-quality companies in the same sectors and industries, and for the same reasons.

{"Headline": "In Doha, Major Oil Exporters Fail to Agree on Production Freeze", "Date": "2016-04-17", "News": "Supported byDOHA, Qatar \u2014 Officials from 18 oil-producing nations failed on Sunday to reach a deal to freeze oil production at current levels.A sharp fall in oil prices could also feed into equity prices, which have recently tended to rise and fall along with oil prices.Oil fell sharply in early trading on Monday in Asia, at one point dropping nearly 6 percent to fall below $38 a barrel. Asian stock markets were mixed. Japanese shares were down nearly 3 percent in morning trading, but stocks across the rest of Asia saw more modest declines. Markets in Shanghai and Hong Kong opened around 1 percent lower.\u201cThere will be a lot of people who they have disappointed,\u201d said Bill Farren-Price, chief executive of Petroleum Policy Intelligence, a British firm that advises hedge funds and other businesses on the oil markets. The oil exporters, he said, \u201craised expectations.\u201dA major stumbling block in the talks appears to have been pressure from Saudi Arabia for Iran to participate in the freeze, a measure to address the current global oversupply of oil. The Iranians, who are rapidly increasing production after the end of most sanctions over their nuclear program, have refused to cap production at current low levels.The oil producers seemed to head into the meeting full of confidence that a deal to stabilize oil markets could be reached. In fact, a draft agreement calling for a freeze at January levels through October was circulated Saturday.Talk of a potential freeze had already helped lift the oil markets from their January lows below $30 per barrel to about $43 per barrel for Brent crude. \u201cI think at least the discussion and expectations around the Doha meeting have contributed to higher prices,\u201d Eric Lascelles, chief economist at RBC Global Asset Management, said in an interview before the meeting.A deal was unlikely to quickly change the amount of oil on the market because most participants in the freeze were pumping at high levels. And the failure is unlikely to have much of an impact on supply and demand balances.What might limit the reaction is a strike on Sunday by Kuwaiti oil workers. That has cut into the country\u2019s oil production by what appears to be a substantial amount. \u201cYou would expect the market to sell off but the downside might be limited, \u201c said Mr. Farren-Price, who was observing the Doha meeting.Analysts on Sunday also raised the question of how Saudi Arabia and the other countries could have scheduled the meeting if they knew it was doomed to failure. After all, the idea was to calm the markets, not roil them.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.\u201cThis implies really poor communication by the lead members of the group,\u201d particularly Saudi Arabia and Russia, said Richard Mallinson, an oil analyst at Energy Aspects, a London-based market research firm. \u201cWhy even schedule this meeting if you did not have a compromise agreed over Iran.\u201dSaudi Arabia, Russia, Qatar and Venezuela agreed in principle on a freeze at a meeting in February, but made it contingent on participation by other major producers. The idea of a freeze gained favor because it would involve little or no sacrifice for anyone.Analysts and some OPEC officials thought that a way could be found to accommodate Iran\u2019s desire to make up ground lost under sanctions.Either they misread the Saudis or the kingdom\u2019s leadership hardened its position. Saudi Arabia and Iran are bitter rivals in the Middle East, clashing over Yemen and Syria. The competition increasingly extends to oil, where a resurgent Iran is vying with the Saudis for market share among customers in Asia and Europe.In the days before this meeting, a mixed message emerged from Saudi Arabia. Its oil officials, led by Ali al-Naimi, an 80-year-old veteran oil minister, evidently sought accommodation with other big producers, including Iran, while, the deputy crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, who has become the kingdom\u2019s chief policy maker, indicated that Saudi Arabia might not go along with a freeze if Iran did not also comply.\u201cIf all major producers don\u2019t freeze production, we will not freeze production,\u201d Prince Mohammed told Bloomberg News recently.The deal was scuppered by Saudi Arabia\u2019s insistence that language requiring that all OPEC members participate in the freeze be inserted in the draft. There was little question that Iran, which was not represented at the meeting, would agree. After lengthy negotiations among Saudi Arabia, Russia, Venezuela and Qatar, which convened the meeting, the talks broke up on Sunday.Saudi tactics on the freeze appear to be a part of a shift in the kingdom\u2019s oil policy, analysts say.The Saudis, analysts say, increasingly seem to accept that they can no longer control oil prices through OPEC, in part because the huge increases in supply from the United States in recent years have undercut OPEC\u2019s leverage.\u201cThis is the new world of oil,\u201d said Jim Burkhard, head of oil markets and scenarios research at IHS, who was also observing the meeting. \u201cThe oil market is a reflection of the world. Power is more decentralized.\u201dThe Saudis are shifting instead toward producing whatever oil they need to supply their growing network of domestic refineries and petrochemical plants and their expanding body of overseas customers.A glut of crude oil on the markets is pushing the price of oil down to levels not seen since the global financial crisis.Prince Mohammed, who has authority over the Saudi oil industry, warned that the kingdom could increase production by a million barrels per day in the coming months if it chose.With low production costs, estimated at $3.50 to $5 per barrel, Saudi Arabia can compete on price with any producer. So can Russia, which can produce oil for about $4 per barrel, according to IHS. While Saudi Arabia and its Persian Gulf allies, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, are feeling the pinch of lower revenues, they are in far less immediate trouble than OPEC members like Venezuela and Algeria, analysts say.Some of the less well-off oil producers clearly wanted a deal in hopes that it would raise prices and revenues. \u201cThis is something that affects the whole oil industry whether you are in OPEC or not,\u201d Ecuador\u2019s oil minister, Carlos Pareja Yannuzzelli, told reporters on Sunday.While plans are far from fully delineated, Prince Mohammed appears to be charting a more independent course for the Saudi oil industry. For instance, he has said he plans a public listing of the national oil company, Saudi Aramco, the world\u2019s largest oil-producing company. A public listing might require the company to pay more attention to the requirements of outside investors than to other OPEC members.Prince Mohammed increasingly seems to see oil as a potential political instrument \u2014 an approach that Mr. Naimi eschewed.\u201cThere is a lot of change happening in Riyadh,\u201d Mr. Mallinson said. Oil policy is becoming \u201cless insulated from politics.\u201dSome analysts speculate that Mr. Naimi \u2014 who has long been skeptical that other producers, including Russia, would honor production ceilings \u2014 is going along with the idea of a freeze to help insulate Saudi Arabia from criticism.The Saudis might have been \u201ccovering their backs,\u201d said Paul Stevens, an analyst at Chatham House, a London-based research firm. \u201cThey can say, \u2018We tried.\u2019\u201dRussia had reason to go along with a freeze. Russia\u2019s economy, which depends heavily on oil revenues, is in recession. The Kremlin\u2019s desperation for higher prices is palpable; the country is committed to two wars, in Ukraine and Syria. At home, wages are being cut, bringing signs of social unrest ahead of a parliamentary election in September.Russia\u2019s energy minister, Alexander Novak, who attended the Doha meeting, has been a crucial supporter of a freeze. A role assigned to Mr. Novak was to bring in Iran, but he has failed so far.Russia and Saudi Arabia trade places for the top spot among oil producers. Russia has been in the lead of late, pumping 10.9 million barrels of oil a day in January compared with Saudi Arabia\u2019s 10.2 million. But because of Russia\u2019s larger population and industrial base, it consumes more oil at home, leaving Saudi Arabia the leader in exports.Since the Soviet period, OPEC has looked on Russia as a freeloader on price-boosting production cuts: Russia benefited but never joined in.Analysts say that OPEC\u2019s efforts to involve Russia and other outsiders underlines its diminished clout. Joining with Russia is \u201cwhat is left for an organization that has lost its core reason for being, at least for now and possibly for the longer term,\u201d said Bhushan Bahree, an OPEC analyst at the market research firm IHS, who was observing the meeting.Stanley Reed reported from Doha, and Andrew E. Kramer from Moscow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Taking Shelter in Old-School Dividend Stocks", "Date": "2016-04-09", "News": "Supported byOver the last several years, growth stocks, like Amazon and Netflix, have brought much momentum to the market. But in the first quarter, those kinds of stocks lost some of their sizzle, as old-school dividend payers came back into favor.That is where three of the quarter\u2019s top-performing mutual funds found some of their better stock picks.Cheapness is not enough, though. A company must also have a durable, defensible business and a burly balance sheet. That is not to say they avoid wading into situations that some investors might consider scary. Part of their strategy is to hunt in sectors where \u201cfear and anxiety\u201d have depressed prices, Mr. Sertl said.Thus, a couple of years ago, they bought gold-mining stocks \u2014 a first for their 10-year-old fund. \u201cGold and gold stocks went into a horrific bear market, and that\u2019s when we got involved,\u201d he said. \u201cGoldcorp peaked at $55 in 2011 and bottomed out in January at under $10.\u201d The stock ended up being one of the fund\u2019s better-performing holdings in the first quarter.A period of disfavor for media companies likewise drew the fund\u2019s managers into CBS and Time Warner shares, which also have done well lately. Some consumers have been dropping cable TV in favor of online video streaming, and media companies have responded by offering \u201cskinnier bundles\u201d of services and channels, Mr. Sertl said. That could mean less revenue, which has prompted some investors to scurry away. But Mr. Sertl said he and his colleagues believed that companies with popular programming, like CBS\u2019s sports broadcasts and the Time Warner division HBO, would continue to thrive.\u201cSome people say, \u2018Content is king,\u2019 and we believe that,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you have good content, you\u2019ll be able to monetize it.\u201dThe Artisan fund, whose investor shares have an expense ratio of 1 percent, returned 6.38 percent in the first quarter, compared with 1.35 percent for the S.&P. 500.The managers assemble the portfolio annually and replace a stock in the interim only if its yield falls below the median yield of the S.&P. 500 or if a company is taken over, Mr. Pettee said. Otherwise, they leave the holdings alone.\u201cA big part of our success is the fact that we reconstitute the fund only once a year,\u201d he said. \u201cThat cuts down on our opportunities to make mistakes.\u201dThe strategy has led to the fund owning an abundance of companies in traditional sectors like industrials and energy, and fewer in higher-flying ones like health care and information technology. But as tech companies mature, more of them are finding their way into the fund \u2014 and even more will most likely end up there in the future, Mr. Pettee said.\u201cThink about Apple,\u201d he said. \u201cIt declared a dividend in 2012, so it\u2019s now in my world. It didn\u2019t score well in our model \u2014 the valuation was too rich \u2014 so it\u2019s not in the portfolio. But I\u2019m looking forward to the day when I own Apple as a Dog of the Dow.\u201cMicrosoft was the Apple of the \u201980s, and in 2013, we bought it as a Dog of the Dow.\u201dThe SunAmerica fund, whose A shares have an expense ratio of 1.07 percent, returned 6.29 percent in the first quarter.Croci (pronounced \u201ccroaky\u201d) stands for \u201ccash return on capital invested,\u201d she said. That is a measure that Deutsche Asset Management, a division of Deutsche Bank, developed to compare stocks across industries and countries. It was conceived as an improvement over traditional measures like the price-to-earnings ratio, Ms. Kumble said.\u201cEarnings are based on accounting numbers,\u201d she said. But accounting rules can vary across industries and countries, making earnings and thus P/E ratios tough to compare. \u201cWith Croci, we make adjustments to transform accounting reports into economic values,\u201d she said.The fund\u2019s managers apply a series of screens to winnow their potential holdings from among large-cap domestic stocks.\u201cWe start with the S.&P. 500 and exclude financials and any stock that pays no dividend,\u201d Ms. Kumble said. The managers then seek stocks with low financial leverage and low price volatility as well as above-average dividend yields and low prices based on their proprietary calculations. All of the stocks they buy are given an equal weight in the portfolio, and they are rebalanced and, as needed, replaced quarterly.The methodology produces a portfolio that can yield picks that might seem surprising when viewed via traditional metrics.Consider Exxon Mobil and Coca-Cola, Ms. Kumble said. Back in 2013, Coke had a price-to-earnings ratio of 19, while Exxon\u2019s was 12. \u201cSo on the surface, Exxon was cheap,\u201d she said. \u201cBut our Croci economic P/E was higher for Exxon Mobil than Coke. So our methodology said Coke was actually the cheaper stock.\u201d The Croci approach made a number of adjustments, including, for example, counting Coke\u2019s advertising and brand as assets, which differs from the traditional approach, Ms. Kumble said.Coke was also among the fund\u2019s most recent reported holdings, though Exxon Mobil was not. Apple, too, was a holding.The Deutsche fund, with a net expense ratio of 1.08 percent, returned 6.45 percent in the first quarter.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Politics Influences the Stock Market: Not Very Much", "Date": "2016-04-25", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsBefore long, someone is going to call this the Hillary rally.As the chances of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s nomination have strengthened, the Dow Jones industrial average has soared, rising 2,344 points, or 15 percent, from its recent low on Feb. 11.Other factors could have helped drive stocks higher. They had fallen a long way before the rally, the outlook for company earnings has improved slightly, and fears about the strength of the world economy have subsided a bit.It wouldn\u2019t be wise to also call it a Trump rally, though he is leading on the Republican side. During this period, as Mrs. Clinton\u2019s grasp on the nomination tightened considerably, the polls show her beating Mr. Trump in November.But here\u2019s some advice for anyone in the Clinton camp who might want to point to the market\u2019s jump as evidence that investors would be happy with her winning in November: Don\u2019t.Time and time again, political partisans have tried to recruit the stock market to their side. Most of the time it backfires.One of the most famous examples of this occurred in the months after Barack Obama was elected in 2008. The stock market, still roiled by the financial crisis and a horrible global economy, was plunging. Right wingers said investors were selling because they were fearful of the new president\u2019s policies, and called the rout \u201cthe Obama bear market.\u201dThe article contained plenty of caveats about not slavishly reading too much into the markets. But Mr. Summers also contended that markets \u201care like canaries in coal mines: very valuable in giving warning when conditions change.\u201d But the same markets are rising and appear to be signaling optimism. Were they right then but wrong now?In an email exchange, Mr. Summers said that the thesis of his column was that policy makers should have been more worried than they seemed to be at the time about the outlook for the global economy. Since then, Mr. Summers said, the Federal Reserve has significantly modulated expectations of monetary tightening.As a result, he contended, the upswing in the markets \u201cwas in significant part the result of policy doing what I urged \u2014 \u2018heeding market warnings.\u2019 \u201dMore broadly, he added, \u201cThink of markets as a mediocre but not hopeless weatherman making probabilistic forecasts.\u201d (His comments came after publication because I overlooked his initial response to my query.)The market does contain important signals that can tell a bigger story, but it\u2019s a job to separate them from the noise and pure speculation. Sometimes markets react to specific political events. If Mr. Trump were to start polling strongly against Mrs. Clinton shortly before the presidential election, while still pledging to introduce tough protectionist trade policies, the stock market would most likely sell off on fears of what those policies might do to the economy.But you could reach the same economic conclusions without ever looking at the stock market. Most of what the markets appear to be saying can already be guessed at by looking at other sources.Markets also misread what\u2019s going on in the wider world. They don\u2019t have a special clairvoyance. They also don\u2019t always say what we think they are saying. The recent rally may indeed be a sign that investors would be O.K. with Mrs. Clinton winning, and the rally may even signal that she will win.But would her chances be any lower if the markets plunged for purely economic reasons? They could be higher.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Seymour Lazar, 88, Dies; Flamboyant Entertainment Lawyer, and More", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported bySeymour M. Lazar, a swashbuckling entertainment lawyer, stock trader and serial litigator whose lifetime of adventures took him from the legal tangle surrounding the estate of Howard Hughes to involvement in a colossal fraud case that threatened to bring down one of the biggest shareholder class-action law firms in the United States, died on March 30 at his home in Palm Springs, Calif. He was 88.His death was confirmed by his daughter, Tara Lazar.Mr. Lazar was a flamboyant renegade. As a hip young lawyer in Los Angeles in the 1950s and \u201960s he represented a colorful list of clients that included the comedian Lenny Bruce, the jazz musicians Miles Davis and Cannonball Adderley, and emerging pop stars like Johnny Rivers.He took LSD with Timothy Leary. He strolled through Haight-Ashbury with Allen Ginsberg. He offered career advice to Maya Angelou, then a struggling young cabaret singer whom, he said, he dated for a time.\u201cI was very shapely and nice to look at, but Seymour saw more than that,\u201d Ms. Angelou told The Wall Street Journal in 2006. \u201cHe knew I was always writing and encouraged me to be more than a cocktail singer.\u201d On the acknowledgments page of her book \u201cAll God\u2019s Children Need Traveling Shoes,\u201d she thanked him \u201cfor belief in my youthful ambition.\u201dBored with the law, Mr. Lazar jumped headfirst into the stock market. He became one of the largest independent traders in the United States, buying and selling more than $300 million in stocks in 1967, most of it related to mergers and acquisitions.\u201cI was an in-and-out trader,\u201d he told New York magazine in 1976. \u201cIf I bought a stock in the morning, and still owned it at noon, that was a long-term investment.\u201dHis wild deals and even wilder personal style \u2014 he had a long ponytail, refused to wear socks and was on occasion seen in a Pierre Cardin leather suit with no shirt \u2014 earned him a walk-on role as Seymour the Head in \u201cSupermoney,\u201d George Goodman\u2019s 1972 account of the global financial game, written under the pen name Adam Smith.Working with the celebrity lawyer Marvin Mitchelson, Mr. Lazar invested $250,000 in efforts to prove that a mysterious document discovered in the headquarters of the Church of Latter-day Saints in Salt Lake City represented the final wishes of the reclusive tycoon Howard Hughes, who died in 1976.The Mormon Will, as it was known, left millions to an unusual collection of beneficiaries, most peculiarly to a gas station owner named Melvin Dummar. Mr. Dummar said he had earned Hughes\u2019s gratitude after giving him a ride when he was wandering in the desert. A Nevada jury pronounced the will a fake.\u201cIf I lose, I\u2019ll just go on to something else,\u201d Mr. Lazar said at the time.The something else was class-action lawsuits, filed scattershot against companies large and small, claiming offenses large and small. In 1980 he filed suit against Hertz, claiming that it had overcharged him for gas on a rental car, to the tune of $11.15. That claim was denied, but others, often connected to the poor performance of stocks he owned, succeeded.Mr. Lazar eventually pushed his luck too far. In 2005 a federal grand jury in Los Angeles indicted him on multiple counts, including mail fraud and money laundering. He was accused of taking $2.6 million in kickbacks over 25 years from the law firm of Milberg Weiss to initiate suits on its behalf in his own name and the names of relatives.In 2007, as part of a plea bargain, he pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice, filing a false tax return and making a false declaration. He was sentenced to six months in home detention and ordered to pay a $600,000 fine, on top of a previously ordered $1.5 million forfeiture.\u201cSeymour was living in an unregulated age,\u201d Sheridan Hill, who is completing a biography of Mr. Lazar, said in an interview on Tuesday. \u201cHe was engaging in arbitrage before anyone called it arbitrage. The same with entertainment law. He was doing deals because he saw they were there to be done.\u201dSeymour Manuel Lazar was born on June 14, 1927, in Brooklyn and grew up on a ranch in the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles. His father, Nathan, an accountant, moved the family west in 1933. His mother, the former Rita Tannenbaum, came from a family that ran a wholesale meat business in Beverly Hills.By the time he was 12, Seymour was keeping the books for his father\u2019s accounting business. After graduating from Los Angeles High School in 1943, he took a job at Lockheed, which trained him as an electrical engineer, before enrolling in the pre-law program at the University of California, Berkeley.Drafted into the Army Air Corps, he served two years before resuming his studies. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in economics from Berkeley in 1949 and a law degree from the University of Southern California in 1951.After setting up in private practice, Mr. Lazar found his niche when a Hollywood producer walked into his office and asked if he specialized in entertainment law. He did not, but he said yes and played catch-up. He also bought the Caf\u00e9 Gala, just off the Sunset Strip, which generated a stream of clients.In the 1960s he somehow managed to combine two personas: Wall Street shark and dharma bum. He drove a Rolls-Royce and pushed vast sums through offshore accounts in the Bahamas. His gains and losses were staggering. When a proposed merger between Armour and General Host fell through in 1969, he took a $10 million hit.At the same time, while soaking up the sun in the expatriate community in Cuernavaca, Mexico, he amassed a serious collection of pre-Columbian art. He later collected African and Oceanic art as well. He financed an ashram in Arizona and a monastery in Nepal.It was in Cuernavaca that Mr. Goodman, quite skeptical of the Lazar lore he had heard so much of, met the man behind the myth. \u201cSeymour was real,\u201d he wrote, describing him as a \u201cformerly respectable lawyer with a respectable wife and child, who discovered arbitrage, mind-blowing chemicals and a new lifestyle all at the same time.\u201dMr. Lazar\u2019s first marriage ended in divorce. In addition to his daughter, he is survived by his wife, Alyce Lou; two sons, Job and Adam; a sister, Eileen Russell; and six grandchildren.Mr. Lazar remained defiant after being indicted and in the stressful period that ensued. He languished for months at his home in Palm Springs, wearing an ankle bracelet that he was allowed to remove only when he had to undergo triple-bypass surgery. The so-called kickbacks, he insisted, were referral fees and perfectly legal.The court disagreed. It rankled.\u201cI swear, they treated me like an absolute thug,\u201d he complained to The Wall Street Journal. \u201cDid I hurt anybody? Who did I cheat? Did anybody get screwed?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Buy or Rent a Home? Weighing Which Is Better", "Date": "2016-04-01", "News": "Supported byYour MoneyRob Austin and his wife, Natalia, have a 10-month-old son, healthy incomes and plenty of cash in the bank for a down payment on a house. But they are happily renting a townhouse in Pasadena, Calif., with no plans to buy for now, given the frothy prices in their area.\u201cAs long as there is such a disconnect, where a couple like my wife and me have to put down a gargantuan down payment and still have a large monthly payment to get into a decent, and not necessarily nice, house, that is a game we don\u2019t wish to play,\u201d said Mr. Austin, a 39-year-old business manager at a biotechnology company. \u201cWhen home price-to-income levels come back to a more normal level, when that happens, then we will be the first to jump in. If that never happens, that is O.K.\u201dMore American households are renting, across all income levels and generations, for different reasons. But when homeownership is the centerpiece of the American dream, most of us have internalized certain ideals: Buying a home builds equity, putting you on the fast track to building wealth. Renting, by contrast, is essentially throwing money to the wind.The arguments in favor of ownership are persuasive, particularly for people who expect to stay in place for at least five to seven years but probably more. A mortgage acts like a forced savings plan, even if you\u2019re paying the bank hundreds of thousands of dollars in interest for the privilege of building equity. Call it the cost of enforcing a positive behavior.Buying also generally protects consumers from rising rents, while traditional mortgage payments remain constant. Then, there is the fact that buyers are using borrowed money to purchase an asset that is likely to appreciate over a long period, though that can backfire as well (see housing market plunge, millions of underwater borrowers, circa 2008). Being able to call a place your own has a real, albeit intangible, value too.How well any household will fare financially by buying or renting really depends on factors no one can predict. Other studies have found that renters who invest their down payment and any savings from renting as opposed to owning often come out ahead.Either way, most financial professionals would caution against viewing a home purchase as an investment, particularly after factoring in the cost of maintenance, taxes, insurance and the high costs of buying and selling, though it\u2019s difficult not to.\u201cDisregarding the special amenities that many people value in homeownership,\u201d Professor Shiller said, \u201cit would be hugely better invested in the stock market.\u201dThe choice between buying a home and renting one is among the biggest financial decisions that many adults make.There may also be something about many people who buy. As Mr. Benningfield pointed out, they may have other attributes that may contribute to their economic success.The authors\u2019 point, however, is that people often blindly believe that buying is usually the smarter option. \u201cMost of the public drive to buy is without looking under the hood,\u201d Professor Johnson said.But any number of variables can quickly shift that calculus, including the price of the home relative to the rent, whether the family is affluent enough to benefit from tax savings, and the time spent in the home.\u201cThe longer you stay, the stronger the argument is for buying, all else equal,\u201d said Aron Szapiro, who conducted the analysis. But he also contends that the tax advantages of homeownership are often oversold, particularly to moderate-income households.If you\u2019re trying to determine the right option, some guideposts may help. Mr. Szapiro, for example, found that in households with about $100,000 in earnings, net wealth typically rose more 10 years after buying a home than if they had rented \u2014 but only if the annual rent was 6 percent or more of the purchase price. So it would pay to buy a $600,000 home when rent in the area was about $3,000 a month or more.

{"Headline": "Ramapo Town Supervisor Arrested in Federal Fraud Case", "Date": "2016-04-14", "News": "Supported byAfter Ramapo voters resoundingly rejected a $16.5 million plan to finance the construction of the ballpark in 2010, Mr. St. Lawrence said the project would be built with private funds. The 4,500-seat stadium, Provident Bank Park, opened in June 2011.But Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, said that while assuring the public that no town money would be used to build the stadium, Mr. St. Lawrence and a co-defendant, \u201cthrough lies and accounting manipulations, found a way for the town to fund more than half of the $58 million it cost to build that stadium.\u201d\u201cThe defendants then filled the big hole opened up by these costs in the town\u2019s general fund with a series of fake accounting entries,\u201d Mr. Bharara added.Mr. Bharara said the prosecution was believed to be the first criminal securities fraud case brought against city officials in the United States for accounting fraud in connection with the sale of municipal bonds. \u201cBut I suspect that it will not be the last,\u201d he said.His remark underscored an eccentricity of America\u2019s $3.7 trillion municipal bond market, which state and local governments routinely tap to raise money for public works. It is lightly regulated, operating on a level of faith that can seem quaint, even out of date, in an age of increasingly sophisticated global markets.While the Securities and Exchange Commission is an active watchdog of companies that issue stocks and bonds, it has largely left state and local governments to police themselves. But as concerns about fraud and deceptive accounting have mounted, the agency has filed lawsuits against municipalities and states like New Jersey and Illinois, which have typically been resolved with cease-and-desist orders. The S.E.C. filed a lawsuit against Ramapo on Thursday, but the bringing of criminal charges by federal prosecutors suggested a change in the government\u2019s approach.The co-defendant, N. Aaron Troodler, was the executive director of the Ramapo Local Development Corporation, a nonprofit organization that undertook development initiatives in Ramapo.Each man was charged with securities fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy in connection with municipal bonds, according to an indictment unsealed in Federal District Court in White Plains.In one instance in 2013, the indictment said, Mr. St. Lawrence, after making a false statement to the town\u2019s bond rating service, urged town employees to carry out a refinancing of short-term debt as quickly as possible: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to all be magicians to get to some of those numbers.\u201dMr. St. Lawrence, 65, who was arrested at his home by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Mr. Troodler, 42, were each released on bond after court appearances on Thursday. Both men pleaded not guilty. A lawyer for Mr. St. Lawrence did not return a message seeking comment. Joseph G. Poluka, a lawyer for Mr. Troodler, declined to comment.Mr. St. Lawrence, Mr. Troodler, the town of Ramapo, the development corporation and two other defendants were also named in the lawsuit filed by the S.E.C.\u201cThe object of the fraud was to mask the deterioration of the town\u2019s primary operating fund,\u201d the lawsuit said.The stadium project was the subject of harsh criticism in 2012, when the state comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli, issued an audit that said town officials had \u201cinappropriately mingled the activities of the town\u201d and the development corporation.\u201cAn already stressed and struggling town will end up being harmed even more,\u201d Mr. Bharara said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "For Bill Gross, Besting Pimco Is the Best Revenge", "Date": "2016-04-25", "News": "Supported byNEWPORT BEACH, Calif. \u2014 Sitting in the conference room of his empty office suite, with its floor-to-ceiling wall of windows, William H. Gross cannot help noticing the sleek office tower that the bond giant Pimco moved into in early 2014.Just a short walk up the road, the 20-story building looms large in the Southern California sun \u2014 a potent symbol of the riches and might that Pimco came to represent during Mr. Gross\u2019s long reign there as the bond king.Although he was forced out nearly two years ago and has moved on to a rival, Janus Capital Group, Pimco remains very, very close \u2014 both physically and, it would appear, psychologically.\u201cWe were a family: Everything I did was for them,\u201d Mr. Gross said in his whispery, high-pitched voice. \u201cThat is the most disappointing thing \u2014 it just didn\u2019t make business sense.\u201dPimco would disagree, even though $376 billion has walked out the door since it was decided in late 2014 that the firm would be better off without the man who was the public face of the franchise.The trouble for Pimco does not stop there. Mr. Gross has filed a lawsuit asserting that he was wrongfully terminated, and he is seeking $200 million \u2014 which he said he plans to donate to charity. And, as he is only too happy to point out, his new vehicle, the Janus Global Unconstrained Fund, is handily beating its counterpart at Pimco.William H. Gross is suing the company to repair the damage that was done to his reputation in the year before and after he was fired.In a world where a portfolio manager\u2019s ability to outperform represents the truest measure of worth, these results have invigorated Mr. Gross.\u201cI am fixated on proving that they were wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like \u2014 no, you shouldn\u2019t have done that and the numbers will prove it.\u201dPimco is no less fixated on him. This month, Pimco filed a legal response to Mr. Gross\u2019s suit, rebutting his allegations.The turmoil was tied to the abrupt departure in 2014 of Mohamed El-Erian, who had been set to succeed Mr. Gross.The accounts of Mr. Gross\u2019s conduct were described by people who have worked with him at the firm, but who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Furious at the betrayal, Mr. Gross wanted to dock Mr. El-Erian\u2019s pay and provoke him into suing Pimco, which, he believed, would hurt his chances of getting another job, those people said. Pimco executives rejected the idea \u2014 as well as a demand that they lie to a newspaper reporter to present him in a better light, they said.Even with the punishing toll of that turmoil \u2014 outflows, layoffs and a battered reputation \u2014 firm leaders say they have no regrets.Still, while they have strived to assure concerned clients that Pimco is moving on, Mr. Gross\u2019s ability to remain squarely in the public eye, via the legal fight and now a campaign to promote his superior performance, is driving them to distraction.Michael Reid, a spokesman, said, \u201cThe entire 240-member portfolio management team competes in the financial markets every day with the goal of generating strong risk-managed returns on behalf of our clients.\u201dPatricia Glaser, Mr. Gross\u2019s lawyer, said the assertions were untrue: \u201cPimco seems to have a problem getting their story straight. It is now acknowledging they pushed Bill out, instead of their previous claim that Bill walked away from the company.\u201dThat the dispute has become a mind game of sorts does not seem to bother Mr. Gross.Unlike any other fund manager, Mr. Gross, who majored in psychology at Duke, puts himself on the couch for the world to see. In his investment letters, he has revealed such intimacies as the erotic pleasure of a good sneeze, his failure in college to get a girl into the back seat of his car and how sad he was when his cat died.Convention bores him: That is why he will stand on his head when the urge hits and wear a silk tie as a scarf, draped loosely around his neck.Mohamed El-Erian was set to succeed William Gross at Pimco but left abruptly in 2014.So it is no revelation for him to own up to obsessive behavior in terms of how his $1.3 billion fund is faring against its Pimco counterpart.Mr. Gross, 71, is not tethered to his phone, so when Bloomberg publishes the daily result of his fund at 3 p.m. California time, he will drop his golf clubs and rush to the office to get the news.The first thing he says he does when arriving home (after kissing his wife, Sue, of course): Check the Bloomberg. At night he will wake up as many as three times to check on global markets, he says.He is not above poking fun at himself, though. At a recent golf tournament he was paired \u2014 to his surprise \u2014 against Michael Gomez, a young Pimco executive known to be close to his nemesis, Mr. El-Erian.\u201cI really wanted to win \u2014 but yeah, they killed us,\u201d he said, laughing loudly.Since Mr. Gross officially took control of his fund on Oct. 6, 2014, he is up 1.8 percent, compared with Pimco Unconstrained, which is down 1.64 percent, according to Morningstar.Making it all the sweeter is the fact that Daniel J. Ivascyn, one of the executives who led the effort to oust him and then took over as chief investment officer, is an executive of the fund. Mr. Ivascyn, who manages the better-performing Pimco Income Fund, is not a primary manager on the vehicle.\u201cMy whole evening is dependent on whether I beat them,\u201d Mr. Gross said. \u201cYou see, I have to prove it all over again. Every day.\u201dDespite this favorable run, money has not flooded in. One of his larger investors, George Soros, last year removed $490 million from his oversight.Of the $1.3 billion in the fund, about half is Mr. Gross\u2019s own money.\u201cMoney is holding out,\u201d said Todd Rosenbluth, a mutual fund specialist at Standard & Poor\u2019s Global Market Intelligence. \u201cI think there is legitimate market skepticism that he can do this on his own \u2014 without a Pimco team supporting him.\u201dMr. Gross contends the main reason that his bond fund has been winning the day is that Pimco has been making bold plays on emerging market bonds and inflation-linked securities, wagering that central bank activism will stimulate global growth.For some time now, he has been arguing that with rates at zero or negative, central banks have virtually no ability to spur growth.\u201cThey are betting on reflation, while I am skeptical of it,\u201d he said.Mr. Gross, has, in effect, taken the opposite side of this wager by building a portfolio that pays off if there are no global market shocks, like interest rate increases or a large country going bust.Of course, such a strategy carries dangers. Mr. Gross has made some big bets that Brazil and Mexico will not default by selling investors credit-default swaps, derivative instruments that would force him to disburse large sums if these countries go belly up.Such derivative-fueled bets on financial stability can backfire when markets go haywire. Last year, his Janus fund experienced several sharp drops in price, which preceded Mr. Soros\u2019s decision to withdraw his funds.\u201cThis is not a riskless strategy,\u201d Mr. Gross acknowledged.He is also under no illusion that his good run is permanent.So he is enjoying its fruits while they last. And if he has become fanatical about beating the guys across the street, so what? He is convinced that fealty to the screen, not to mention daily yoga stretches, is what keeps him feeling youthful.In fact, over the years, Mr. Gross has consistently asked one question of prospective employees: What drives you?The twist is that they must pick one of three answers: money, power or fame.Strangely to him, no one has ever picked fame.\u201cIt is the one thing I have always wanted,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I was starting out at Pimco in 1972, I told my mother and father that I was going to become the most famous bond manager in the world.\u201dThat he did, but then came the fall.\u201cWhen you write my obituary I don\u2019t want you to mention that I was fired by Pimco,\u201d he said. \u201cI want you to write that I was a great investor \u2014 so maybe I am not over it.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Tuesday about the bond investor William H. Gross overstated what is known about his exit from Pimco. The nature of his departure is the subject of litigation between Mr. Gross and Pimco; it has not been determined that \u201che was fired nearly two years ago.\u201d (Mr. Gross contends that he was wrongfully terminated; the company says that Mr. Gross resigned and was not fired.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Winds From Washington Chill Wall Street\u2019s Deal Making", "Date": "2016-04-14", "News": "Supported byOn Wall Street, the phones have been a little quieter. The workload has been a little lighter. The happy hours have been starting earlier.For most people, that would be a good thing. But not for deal-hungry lawyers and bankers, who are experiencing a recent slowdown in megadeals. A series of broken transactions and stock-market volatility have shaken the confidence of some in the boardroom to tackle their next big acquisition.The value of abandoned deals has been higher than that of newly signed deals in the United States so far this year. Almost $340 billion worth of mergers have been withdrawn in 2016, while $282 billion worth of newly signed deals were announced, according to data compiled by Dealogic. The cancellations are skewed toward megadeals, defined as those worth $10 billion or more.The divergence in the deal market comes largely as a result of a regulatory clampdown.Over the last year, with shareholder encouragement, companies ventured into large, complex and risky deals. Last week, the government fought back, in a lawsuit by the Justice Department and new rules from the Treasury Department, to stop many of the transactions.One lawyer described a depression that set over mergers and acquisitions as a result of those two actions. A banker said that Wall Street had come to a grinding halt. These deal makers requested anonymity, so as not to be seen at odds with the government\u2019s decisions.During an election year, advisers say, the big, politically unpopular deals may just have to wait.\u201cCompanies were concerned that their large deals would draw political focus and be criticized as part of the campaigning,\u201d Marc-Anthony Hourihan, co-head of Americas mergers and acquisitions at UBS, said.Robert A. Profusek, who heads Jones Day\u2019s global mergers and acquisitions practice, said, \u201cThe gargantuan deals, they\u2019re harder; there\u2019s no question in my mind.\u201d\u201cThe government has been tougher, but they would say: \u2018That\u2019s because you guys have been jamming these giant deals at us. What do you expect us to do?\u2019\u201d Mr. Profusek said.There is plenty of blame to go around. Bankers and executives would argue that with little global economic growth, mergers have been the best way for companies to jump-start their businesses. Lately, though, they say there has been more uncertainty about what the government will and will not approve, resulting in an abatement in activity.That has been a concern for months, some say, and last week\u2019s government actions, and subsequent deal terminations, merely provided validation.The law firm Kirkland & Ellis said in a note on Wednesday, \u201cThe proposed regulations are so far-reaching that, if finalized in their current form, they likely will affect the way every multinational corporate group with a U.S. presence does business.\u201dThe firm was referring to new rules regarding so-called earnings stripping, in which an American subsidiary borrows from its foreign parent and uses interest costs from the loan to help shrink its United States tax bill.The drug makers Pfizer and Allergan called off their merger as a result of the new rules, which also essentially disqualified Allergan as a merger partner for Pfizer because it had made a few too many inversions.But ever-optimistic bankers say there is opportunity to be had in all of this. After Pfizer\u2019s and Allergan\u2019s deal was terminated, pharmaceutical stocks rallied as investors speculated which companies would become the next targets. And the factors that led to such rampant deal making last year \u2014 slower growth and cheap financing \u2014 have not gone away.It just may be the smaller companies that feel more confident in pulling the trigger.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it a day yet on the M.&A. wave,\u201d said Mr. Profusek of Jones Day.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rise of Institutional Investors Raises Questions of Collusion", "Date": "2016-04-12", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorBlackRock, Vanguard and other big institutional investors own roughly 70 percent of the public stock market, according to some reports. People are starting to ask whether this allows companies \u2014 now having the same owners \u2014 to compete less and raise prices.Take, for example, the airline industry. Across all of its funds, BlackRock held 8.3 percent of United, 6.6 percent of JetBlue, 4.7 percent of Delta and 4.5 percent of Southwest, as of March 31, 2013. Mr. Baer said the Justice Department was exploring whether such cross-ownership either explicitly or implicitly pushed companies to compete less.After all, if there is less competition in the airline industry and higher fares result, it will arguably benefit BlackRock over all, because it holds shares in not just one company but several in the industry. Less competition may mean higher costs for consumers but more profits for the airlines and BlackRock\u2019s investors.Let\u2019s just stop here and note why this is interesting.These are not the typical antitrust violations where one company buys a rival and is able to squeeze out competition and raise prices. Instead, these institutional shareholder positions are minority holdings that are pervasive throughout the public stock market. If these holdings diminish competition and result in higher prices, it is an attack on the way shares are held. And it also means that the public is suffering under our capital markets arrangement.This is why the Justice Department\u2019s interest is more than academic. It has the potential to be an attack on the entire system of mutual fund holdings.The paper on airline ownership is likely to spawn a whole field of study, and the authors deserve kudos, but it is important to put it in perspective.The problem is that the Justice Department will not find anything in its investigation because the study does not capture how shareholders interact with the companies they invest in, particularly those like BlackRock that are full of passive index funds.First, during the time of the airline study, the airline industry was undergoing sweeping consolidation, with bankruptcies and mergers galore. At the same time, shareholders were concentrating their holdings. The paper may just be finding a symptom of industry movement, with shareholders flocking to more concentrated industries but not causing them to be concentrated.The theory is that the holdings of the two fund managers combined were so large it gave them pricing power. But the authors do not report what Barclays and BlackRock held before or after the acquisition.In response to an email inquiry, Mr. Azar provided the numbers they used for the four airlines they studied for this part of the test. Barclays held 2.2 percent of Delta, 4.6 percent of US Airways, 5.6 percent of AirTran and 4.1 percent of JetBlue. BlackRock held 1.5 percent of Delta, 1.2 percent of US Airways, 1.2 percent of AirTran and 1.3 percent of JetBlue.In the appendix, the authors illustrate this phenomenon by looking at the route from Rochester, N.Y., to West Palm Beach, Fla., flown by Jet Blue and AirTran.After the acquisition of B.G.I., BlackRock\u2019s holdings in JetBlue increased to 5.4 percent and its holdings in AirTran rose to 6.9 percent, but did that result in less competition on a secondary route?It is hard to believe that these smaller changes in ownership at these four airlines among two asset managers actually led fares to rise across the board by such a large amount. Instead, the authors seem to be picking up large price rises on routes that had smaller carriers like AirTran and JetBlue. If a modest increase in holdings caused this type of reduction in competitiveness, we would expect to see this happen with other asset managers or acquisitions.And that\u2019s the other problem with this cross-holding theory. It simply does not reflect how shareholders act and think in today\u2019s environment.Even in an age of activist shareholders, institutional shareholders vote only on directors and \u201csay on pay\u201d advisory issues, as well as other corporate governance initiatives. How they vote is decided in an office that is usually separate from the fund managers.Institutional investors may engage with management on their business, but it is not extensive and it is done at the fund level, not globally from each asset manager.Instead, funds engage in quasi-passive governance, often herding toward activist investors that do not have these cross-holdings. BlackRock, which is known for not challenging management, just ran its first activist campaign in Hong Kong.It is hard to believe that these shareholders are influencing pricing at these smaller levels without engagement with the company.A counterexplanation is that management seems safe not to compete with all of this cross-ownership because it knows it will not be challenged. Yet, this seems to ignore another aspect of the story \u2014 growing consolidation and the natural tendency of some industries toward collusion.This does not mean that we should not do some hard thinking about what it means when a handful of shareholders own a majority of shares on the public markets, even though most of it is through passive index funds. Is that too much influence? What are the effects of this ownership?And it does not mean this is not an excellent paper \u2014 it is clearly picking up some effect of cross-ownership, but it is not certain yet what causes that effect.It could be that the Justice Department proves me wrong and finds extensive collusion between shareholders and airlines. But more likely, it will find that the opposite is true. Institutional investors do not necessarily push for less competition, but they do fulfill the conventional wisdom that shareholders do not do enough to challenge failing companies.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Valeant Tumbles, So Does Bill Ackman\u2019s Hedge Fund Herd", "Date": "2016-04-27", "News": "Supported byThe billionaire investor William A. Ackman has become the unofficial leader of a thundering herd that has lost billions of dollars betting on Valeant Pharmaceuticals over the past year.Mr. Ackman\u2019s firm has lost billions of dollars on Valeant. Shares of the Canadian drug maker have plummeted 85 percent since he first pitched the company as one of his best investment ideas at a hedge fund charity event last year.Not coincidentally, big names like Paulson & Company, Viking Global Investors and Brahman Capital have also lost billions, collectively, by betting on Valeant \u2014 underscoring a growing phenomenon of hedge fund groupthink. It is a reflection of big-dollar investors chasing too few ideas and getting tripped up when things turn poorly for a company they have set big markers on.\u201cThe bottom line is, hedge fund herding is not going away anytime soon,\u201d said Andrew Karolyi, a professor of finance at Cornell University. \u201cIf anything, we are now seeing the early signs that this type of hedge fund herding is spilling over into herding of large institutional investors. To the extent that that spillover grows and expands, then we will be concerned.\u201dHedge funds piled into Valeant as the stock soared more than $200 a share last year, even as warning signs about the company\u2019s leadership and business practices began to appear. The stock is now trading around $36 a share, as Valeant prepares to install a new chief executive and races to meet a deadline to file a delayed financial report.Big hedge funds employ teams of analysts to conduct research on companies, and they also spend tens of millions of dollars on outside research. But managers are also influenced by the big bets of their counterparts: So-called best ideas get exchanged at charitable events and exclusive industry dinners attended by traders and managers.\u201cWhy do people believe it?\u201d asked David Maris, an analyst at Wells Fargo. \u201cThey follow Valeant because they want to follow it. They want to believe they have found a new way to make money in pharmaceuticals without investing in new drugs \u2014 it sounds like a magic money box.\u201dThe crowding of hedge funds into Valeant was not an isolated event.SunEdison, a renewable energy company, was once a hedge fund darling. Big investors included Omega Advisors, Glenview Capital Management and Greenlight Capital Management. David Einhorn, the founder of Greenlight and one of the industry\u2019s most closely followed investors, emerged as SunEdison\u2019s head cheerleader when he gave a presentation promoting it in October 2014 at a Manhattan charity event. He called his presentation: \u201cHere Comes the Sun-E,\u201d playing of SunEdison\u2019s stock ticker name.Mr. Einhorn, 47, whose fund at its peak owned 6.8 percent of the company\u2019s shares, remained bullish on SunEdison\u2019s prospects even as the stock, which was trading at about $31 a share last summer plunged during the remainder of the year. In early January, as SunEdison shares were trading at $3, Mr. Einhorn got a representative appointed to the company\u2019s board.Then on April 21, the company filed for bankruptcy. Shares now trade for around 24 cents.Calculating specific losses for a hedge fund is difficult without knowing the prices which a firm purchased its shares. But Valeant\u2019s and SunEdison\u2019s plunging share prices have caused considerable carnage.It is a time of turbulence for the hedge fund industry, where some of the biggest names have reported double-digit losses. Last year, firms fell deeply into the red after wide swings in certain so-called hedge fund hotel stocks, leading what Daniel S. Loeb of Third Point Management called a \u201chedge fund killing field\u201d in a recent investor letter.The total value of hedge fund positions in SunEdison, which once accounted for 66 percent of the company\u2019s shares, is now worth just $15 million after its bankruptcy filing, according to FactSet, the financial research firm. Before hedge funds began selling their SunEdison shares last year, the value of all of those firms\u2019 holdings was $3.5 billion.The losses are worse with Valeant. At the beginning of 2015, hedge funds owned about 23 percent of the company\u2019s shares. Today, the market value of the industry\u2019s holdings in Valeant have fallen by $7.3 billion even as hedge funds bought more, according to FactSet.Firms have until mid-May to disclose whether they sold or bought shares in the fourth quarter.That so many hedge funds remained bullish on Valeant despite months of turmoil \u2014 as questions were raised repeatedly about its accounting practices \u2014 reflects the difficulty managers sometimes have with changing course.\u201cWe all get lazy and when an idea seems to be working \u2014 inertia tends to take over and you stop paying attention,\u201d said James Chanos, the founder of Kynikos Associates and one of Wall Street\u2019s best-known bearish investors. \u201cThat\u2019s on full evidence with Valeant and SunEdison too,\u201d he added.Mr. Chanos\u2019s firm began researching Valeant in late 2013. The company was a classic corporate roll-up that was growing because of serial acquisitions, piling on the debt at the same time. His short thesis focused on the fact that Wall Street was giving the company too much credit for future growth that would continue only as long as Valeant could keep acquiring bigger companies.In February 2014, Mr. Chanos presented Valeant as a stock to short at his annual \u201cBears in Hibernation\u201d retreat in Miami, which some three dozen of his friends and like-minded bearish investors in the hedge fund industry routinely attend.Mr. Ackman reached out to Mr. Chanos a month later to learn about his short bet and Mr. Chanos offered to share his research. Mr. Ackman appeared not to be persuaded and by February of the next year, he began to build what is today a 9 percent stake in Valeant.Now, as a recently appointed member of Valeant\u2019s board, Mr. Ackman is not only one of the biggest investors in the company, but has also positioned himself as an architect of its potential comeback as well. His most recent investor letter on April 26, emphasizes his role in stepping in to stabilize the company earlier this year, gaining two seats on the board.But much work remains. Valeant still has a debt pile of $31 billion to manage. It continues to wrestle with the fallout from a now shuttered mail-order drug distribution company, Philidor Rx Services, which led to an internal review of its accounting for revenue from that channel. It may have to restate earlier earnings.Mr. Ackman, in his opening statement on Wednesday to the Senate Special Committee on Aging, tried to strike a conciliatory tone when it came to the uproar over Valeant\u2019s history of increasing prices on drugs it acquired through acquisitions. He said Valeant will institute a process to ensure it considers \u201call appropriate factors and patient access in particular, when setting prices for its drugs.\u201dScolded by one senator for not looking closely enough into Valeant\u2019s drug pricing, a somewhat flustered Mr. Ackman said, \u201cI regret that we didn\u2019t do more due diligence.\u201dFor Mr. Einhorn and SunEdison, the path forward is more uncertain. Normally, equity holders get little to nothing in a bankruptcy reorganization. Mr. Einhorn\u2019s Greenlight firm cut its stake in the company nearly in half a few days before the bankruptcy filing, but by then, the damage was done.Mr. Einhorn has not said anything since the bankruptcy filing and has said little to his investors this year about his bet on SunEdison.But in a letter to investors in January, Mr. Einhorn quoted David Bowie, in what now seems like a prescient statement, \u201cI don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going from here, but I promise it won\u2019t be boring.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Financial Fables: All the Better to Teach You With, My Dear", "Date": "2016-04-09", "News": "Supported byEssayThose people over at the National Rifle Association have some great ideas.That gives me an idea for some stories of my own \u2014 fairy tales about money. But let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves.Nobody actually gets blown away in these stories \u2014 mayhem is averted, not committed, by an armed citizenry.Oh, you can get all liberal and say that these stories play down the risks of firearms. You might even say that if the wolf and the witch had guns of their own \u2014 say, rifles with sights \u2014 these would have been much shorter stories, with full bellies for the bad guys.I got in touch with Professor Tatar, because how often do you get an excuse to talk with a professor of Germanic folklore and mythology? She said that one of the problems with these gun-toting, sanitized tales was that they missed the point of Grimm. Success in fairy tales, she explained, comes down to more than tight shot grouping. \u201cThey are very much about problem-solving, using your wits and courage to get out of trouble,\u201d she said. \u201cUnfortunately, because they take up very basic cultural contradictions and are supremely malleable, they can also be harnessed for almost any purpose. The Nazis recast Little Red Riding Hood as the innocent Aryan victim of a Jewish wolf.\u201dYikes.Still, these stories intrigued me. I, myself, have written things for money. I have even written books, which is, in my experience, the least fun you can have in your underwear. It seemed to me there might be an opportunity here for me to write things for money that serve a greater purpose \u2014 just like the N.R.A.So here is my brilliant plan: If we can update fairy tales for pedagogical purposes, why not use them to teach children the value of investing? Mutual funds might not be as fascinating to children as firearms, but I love a challenge. And my finances are certainly Grimm.I sought advice. I sent an email to Ms. Hamilton, who has a master\u2019s degree in English and 18th-century history from the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. She responded, \u201cI love the idea, but I\u2019m not available for comment at this time.\u201dSo I struck out on my own and tried a couple of test runs.Cinderella? A fabulous example of outsourcing. Her animal friends did all the work. Or are they unpaid interns? Still working on this one.The possibilities are endless. Business is, after all, built on fairy tales. What\u2019s an S-1 filing for an initial public offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission, if not corporate storytelling? And look at Theranos, the health tech phenomenon whose blood tests from the prick of a finger are starting to look as if they have more to do with fantasy than reality. That could be a model for an updated Sleeping Beauty: Pricking her finger didn\u2019t go well for her, either.Our politicians understand the ways that business really is a Grimm tale. If you listen to Bernie Sanders, big, bad Wall Street bankers are scarier than any wolf.I explained my bold new storytelling idea to Professor Tatar. She listened politely. And then she shocked me by saying \u2026 she liked it. \u201cYou can\u2019t teach kids investing principles per se, but if you put it in a story, it becomes instructive in a way the dry, abstract stuff will not,\u201d she said. \u201cI trust you,\u201d she said, \u201cand think you would create a work that would do more good than harm.\u201dThat trust might be misplaced. Still, great things might await me. As Jack said after climbing the beanstalk: Show me the money.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The High Fees You Don\u2019t See Can Hurt You", "Date": "2016-04-23", "News": "Supported byStrategiesHigh fees, often hidden from view, are still enriching many advisers and financial services companies at the expense of ordinary people who are struggling to salt away savings. The problem has persisted year after year. A new analysis of mutual fund data confirms its severity.But don\u2019t rejoice just yet: It is only a step.First, the Labor Department\u2019s new rules are not yet in place. They are scheduled to take effect in 2017 and 2018 but are opposed by much of the financial services industry. They could easily be changed, weakened or blocked.For now, even for retirement accounts that are to be covered by the rules, many advisers are not required to act in their clients\u2019 best interests. This means that they are legally entitled to look out for themselves first and recommend investments with higher fees, to the detriment of those who have asked for help.The rules say that, with some exceptions, advisers will be required to make reasonable recommendations based on an examination of industry norms and practices. But the rules don\u2019t detail which specific investments or fee levels are acceptable.As a consequence, I\u2019ve been reviewing data on the performance and fees charged by mutual funds, which are the primary investing vehicle for many Americans.Fund performance records are of limited predictive value: History does not guarantee future performance, as the S.E.C. requires mutual fund companies to say in advertisements and fund documents.To the contrary, even when fund managers succeed in outperforming their peers in one year, they cannot easily repeat the feat in successive years, as many studies have shown. That\u2019s why low-cost index funds, which merely mirror the performance of the market and don\u2019t try to beat it, make a great deal of sense as a core investment.But whether you choose an index fund or one that is actively managed, commissions and fees provide important clues about future performance.Low fees won\u2019t turn intrinsically bad investments into profitable ones, of course, but they make a big difference. Aye M. Soe, senior director of index research and design for S&P Dow Jones Indices, performed a custom analysis at my request. Using the data in her report on mutual fund performance, \u201cThe Spiva Scorecard\u201d (Spiva is an acronym for S.&P. Indices Versus Active), she separated out the effects of fees and commissions. This may seem to be dry stuff, but bear with me. Some of Ms. Soe\u2019s new findings are important.Mutual fund commissions, also known as sales loads, are a big drag on performance. They are often difficult to justify if an adviser is truly working in an investor\u2019s best interest. I\u2019ll turn to them in another column.For now, let\u2019s briefly consider the range of fees contained in mutual fund expense ratios, which include payments made to fund managers and distribution companies as well as many miscellaneous expenses. These expenses are stated in fund prospectuses, by requirement of the S.E.C.With fees included, the average actively managed fund in each of 29 asset categories \u2014 from those that invest in various sizes and styles of stocks to those that hold fixed-income instruments like government or municipal bonds \u2014 underperformed its benchmark over the decade through December. In other words, index funds outperformed the average actively managed fund in every single category.But part of the problem for actively managed funds is their fees. When Ms. Soe eliminated the impact of fees, more funds managed to beat their benchmarks. For example, in the real world, more than 80 percent of large-cap funds trailed their benchmarks. But when Ms. Soe\u2019s calculations removed the negative effect of fees from fund returns, only 69 percent underperformed. That\u2019s still a poor record \u2014 and still argues for cheap index funds \u2014 but it\u2019s much better.What was striking, though, was that in some categories, fees were responsible for the actively managed funds\u2019 mediocrity. This was true for large-cap value stock funds and international small-cap stock funds, as well as for global, general municipal, California municipal and New York municipal fixed-income funds. The average fund in these categories actually beat its benchmark when the impact of fees was removed from fund returns.In other words, over the long run, the odds that a talented manager will beat an index fund improve when fees are low \u2014 though those odds are still quite low, and a low-cost index fund remains a safer bet.One outcome of this analysis is very clear, Ms. Soe said. \u201cFees matter a great deal,\u201d she said. \u201cHigh fees should be avoided, and investors need to have enough information to understand that.\u201dWhat is a reasonable benchmark for fees? Note that according to Morningstar, the median expense ratio for actively managed mutual funds is 1.2 percent. For index funds it is about 0.5 percent. The data suggests that, for the most part, the less you pay the better off you will be.Investors who believe they have found honest and skillful advisers may still want to understand all of this. Not everyone truly has your best interest at heart.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Target-Date Funds Are Simple, but They Still Require Careful Aim", "Date": "2016-04-09", "News": "Supported byTarget-date funds are intended to be all-in-one investing solutions capable of getting you all the way to retirement. They typically don\u2019t try to produce market-beating returns, but can provide an appropriate mix of stocks and bonds based on your age and planned retirement date.That may be enough for you. Yet you still may want to scrutinize these vehicles, because they don\u2019t guarantee returns and may not provide the precise blend of investments that you want.Target-date funds have been popular for a good reason. They keep things simple: You designate the approximate year that you think you will be leaving the work force, and fund managers will provide a preset portfolio, gradually increasing the proportion of bonds and cash as you age, while reducing stock fund holdings.One key to divining risk in a target-date fund is understanding its \u201cglide path,\u201d the changing proportion of stocks, bonds and other investments held in the fund from year to year. For individual investors, there may be too much or too little risk. It\u2019s also worth knowing whether you have a \u201cto\u201d or \u201cthrough\u201d fund. The former will take you to a retirement date and hold a majority of investments in bonds and cash when that time nears. A \u201cthrough\u201d fund, on the other hand, will keep investing in stocks after retirement, which may help you manage inflation and longevity risk.Target-date funds don\u2019t necessarily mirror the performance of the larger stock and bond markets. Instead, their returns depend on the mix of their individual portfolios, and in some years, their returns may be disappointing. Last year was a case in point: In every date range, the average target-date fund produced a negative return, according to Morningstar.In better years, such as 2014 when the S.&P. 500 rose nearly 14 percent, target-date funds outperformed actively managed funds, and did so over longer periods as well, according to Morningstar.What\u2019s more, investors in target-date funds tend to buy and hold them for long periods. That has produced better results than those for people who try to time the markets by jumping in and out of funds.Yet because target-date funds are diverse, there can be wide variation in returns, depending on the company that operates them, the portfolio mix and internal expenses. Only two companies scored top \u201cgold\u201d ratings in Morningstar\u2019s overall evaluation of 25 target date groups: BlackRock\u2019s LifePath Index Series and Vanguard\u2019s Target Retirement Series, according to Holt.These two companies provided some of the lowest-cost target-date funds. In December, the average asset-weighted expense ratio for BlackRock\u2019s funds was 0.18 percent, according to Morningstar; for Vanguard it was 0.17 percent. That compares with 0.73 percent for the overall category.Of course, you don\u2019t need to restrict yourself to target-date funds. If you want to go further afield, you can pick other funds from your employer\u2019s 401(k) line, or make investments outside your plan, either on your own or with an adviser\u2019s help.Francesca Federico, an investment adviser and fiduciary in Boston, says that while target-date funds may be fine, some people \u201cmay be better off in alternatives.\u201d That may mean a portfolio that includes downside protection on stock and bond losses, managed futures, precious metals and emerging markets \u2014 investments typically not found in most target-date funds.Customized portfolios can be expensive, though, and that could hurt your returns. Conventional money managers typically receive 1 percent annually of assets under management. And individual fund expenses need to be factored in on top of that.For many people, target-date funds remain a comfortable and intelligent choice. Whether you stick with them exclusively or as part of a broader mix, you may want to do some homework. Customizing a portfolio might help you better address specific risks and needs but if you do mix investments, you will need to calculate your overall asset allocation carefully, something that an exclusively target-date fund portfolio will do automatically.In any case, lives, careers and even retirement realities can be as volatile as markets. A target-date fund may be fine for you but, as always with investing, the final responsibility remains with you.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tech Companies Face Greater Scrutiny for Paying Workers With Stock", "Date": "2016-04-17", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For the last few years, LinkedIn, the professional social networking company, has doled out increasingly large amounts of stock to pay its workers.In 2014, LinkedIn paid employees $319 million in stock, or 14 percent of revenue; in 2015, that rose to $510 million, or 17 percent of revenue. At the time, those figures were largely met with shrugs from Wall Street.Now that attitude may be changing.The Silicon Valley company\u2019s stock-based compensation \u201cprovides additional reason to remain cautious\u201d on LinkedIn, Mark May, an Internet analyst at Citigroup, wrote in a research note.The issue is not limited to LinkedIn. With tech earnings season kicking off on Monday, investors are paying more attention to stock-based compensation at many tech companies.Paying employees with stock is largely unquestioned when times are good, since the move theoretically aligns the interests of the workers with company performance. The practice is technically a corporate expense, but during boom periods, Wall Street typically focuses on a company\u2019s operating results that exclude that expense.Tech companies stand out as some of the most generous givers of shares to employees. While the median number of restricted shares granted at Standard & Poor\u2019s 1500 companies to executives and employees in 2014 equaled 450,198 shares, tech companies granted a median 798,000 shares of restricted stock to workers, according to data from Equilar, a research firm that provides data on executives, boards and compensation.As a result, there has been a \u201cheightened investor focus on the level of stock-based compensation among the Internet companies,\u201d Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a recent note.In an interview, Mr. Mahaney said stock-based compensation could \u201cdistort the quality\u201d of a company\u2019s earnings and \u201cmake them look stronger than they are.\u201dMr. Mahaney has identified Twitter, LinkedIn, Yahoo and Alibaba as among the tech companies that are highly dependent on stock to pay their employees. In a report, he wrote that Twitter\u2019s stock-based compensation over the last two years accounted for 39 percent of the company\u2019s revenue, on average, the highest percentage of any Internet company.LinkedIn, whose share price is down about 48 percent this year, did not respond to requests for comment. Twitter, whose stock is down more than 20 percent this year, also did not respond to a request for comment.Another tech company that Wall Street analysts are examining for its stock-based compensation expenses is Workday, which sells human resources and financial management software. The company is expected to increase its stock compensation about 48 percent in its 2017 fiscal year, which is faster than its revenue is projected to grow, according to Sarah Hindlian, an analyst at Macquarie Group.In an illustration of how stock-based compensation expenses can affect a company\u2019s results, Ms. Hindlian says Workday\u2019s margins are projected to be around negative 25 percent for fiscal year 2017. But when the company\u2019s $370 million in stock-based compensation is excluded from results, its operating margins are much better, coming in around zero.Workday\u2019s heavy reliance on stock-based compensation has been a factor in Ms. Hindlian\u2019s projections for the company\u2019s share price. Last month, she forecast that Workday\u2019s stock would trade at $49, down from its current price of about $77. She has a sell recommendation on the stock.Ms. Hindlian says that while it can be reasonable for companies to pay workers a lot in stock, the practice can become scary when the stock starts to fall. \u201cParticularly with software companies, you run the risk of losing your leading salespeople, engineers and developers when the stock falls, because employees feel like they\u2019re getting a pay cut,\u201d said Ms. Hindlian, who also rang the alarm on LinkedIn\u2019s use of stock-based compensation over a year ago.\u201cSomewhere along the way a management team may feel pressure to increase their share price to avoid loss of employees,\u201d Ms. Hindlian said, \u201cwhich can ultimately mean management goals and shareholder interests become misaligned.\u201dWorkday declined to comment.When companies authorize additional shares to pay employees and management, that also creates \u201cdilution,\u201d or a decrease in how much of the company a shareholder owns when new stock is issued. That effect is starting to push others on Wall Street to lower their price projections for tech company stocks. Mr. May of Citigroup lowered his price targets this month on Google, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, eBay, Yahoo and Twitter to \u201cfully capture the likely ongoing dilution from future share grants as part of employee compensation,\u201d he said.The increased scrutiny of tech companies that rely heavily on stock to pay employees is just one of many places where investors are taking a harder look as markets soften, said John Roe, a managing director at ISS Corporate Solutions, a group that advises shareholders on corporate governance issues.He noted that some shareholders had also submitted proposals asking companies to consider the impact of share buybacks on earnings, to figure out whether executives delivered better earnings by improving performance or by reducing the number of shares outstanding.\u201cYou see a brighter focus on certain practices when there is more volatility and markets are going down,\u201d said Mr. Roe. \u201cThe reliance on equity compensation is one of those things that you might always worry about, but recent events have amplified that concern.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The bank, which is based in Charlotte, N.C., said it had increased its consumer loans \u2014 extending 1.2 million new credit cards in the quarter \u2014 while also releasing millions of dollars it had set aside to cover potential losses from defaulting consumers.Much of the good news that came from the banks\u2019 consumer businesses, however, was overshadowed by issues in their commercial loan portfolios, where persistently low oil and gas prices have put pressure on the highly indebted energy industry.Bank of America said it had set aside an additional $525 million for oil- and gas-related loan losses, bringing its total energy reserves up to about $1 billion, covering about 4.6 percent of its energy loans.Wells Fargo increased its oil- and gas-related reserves to $1.7 billion in the first quarter, covering 9.3 percent of its energy portfolio, and began to record losses on some of the loans.Trading in stocks and bonds was hurt by volatility in world markets, as the outlook for the global economy darkened and the direction of interest rates became uncertain.Overall market revenue at JPMorgan fell 13 percent from a year earlier. At Bank of America, sales and trading revenue dropped 16 percent after accounting for certain debt valuation adjustments.Wells was less affected by the rough market conditions because its Wall Street operations are smaller than those of its peers.It is shaping up to be another grim year for the nation\u2019s biggest banks. They were hit hard by a bad environment for trading and deal-making.As the fortunes of their investment and consumer banking units seesaw, banks might seem tempted to increase their the most profitable businesses and take more risks on the strength of American consumer.But bank executives vowed they would stay prudent. Mr. Donofrio said Bank of America was able to expand its credit card business without extending loans to people with less than stellar credit.John Shrewsberry, Wells Fargo\u2019s chief financial officer, said the bank had been willing to give up market share in the red-hot auto market to avoid taking too much risk. Wells said it has capped its subprime exposure at 10 percent of total auto loans.\u201cWe drew a line and lost some share,\u201d Mr. Shrewsberry said in an interview. \u201cWe have stuck with the approach not to take any more credit risk.\u201dDespite the challenges, the quarter was better than expected. All three big banks reported higher profit than analysts polled by Reuters had forecast.Bank of America said its profit declined 13 percent from a year ago to $2.7 billion, or 21 cents a share. Analysts expected profit of 20 cents a share.\u201cWe are running this company so we can be a source of stability and strength,\u201d Mr. Donofrio said. \u201cWe are not trying to earn all of our money in good times only to give it back in tough times.\u201dAdvertisement"}

We get a rush from saving $5 at checkout, while leaving $500 on the table because we didn\u2019t sign up for a flex-spending account at work to pay for child care expenses.\u201dHer general points \u2014 for example, that the spending and saving habits we develop in our 20s have a significant impact on our financial future \u2014 are solid. And she is occasionally very witty. \u201cI sometimes spend my lunch break texting with my younger sister, urging her to skip the $50 massage and instead learn to relax in less expensive ways after a bad day, in between offering her dating advice and career guidance. I am a full-service sister.\u201dStill, it would have been better if she had provided even more specific advice.Mr. McCormick, a managing partner of the private equity firm HCI Equity Partners, which invests in companies that generate about $20 million to $200 million in revenue, specifies his focus in his book\u2019s subtitle: \u201cUsing Business Principles to Maximize Your Family\u2019s Wealth.\u201dWhere Ms. Palmer is supportive, Mr. McCormick is hard-nosed, perhaps fitting for a graduate of both West Point and Harvard Business School.In talking about his recommendations, Mr. McCormick assumes \u201cyou have the discipline and intellectual honesty to act rationally.\u201d He adds, by way of example: \u201cMany advisers suggest you pay off your mortgage as quickly as possible. On the contrary, I recommend you pay off real estate debt last, even after making other investments, given the relatively low after-tax cost of this debt. But this assumes you actually save and reinvest this increased cash flow and don\u2019t blow it on a new flat screen or vacation.\u201dIf you own a home, having additional real estate investments, like shares of a real estate investment trust, or REIT, is not a good idea, he adds. But, he says, you probably want to own more international stocks.\u201cToday U.S. equities represent about half the global economy, a percentage that has been consistently decreasing. Basing your equity allocations on relative global market capitalization values will ensure your allocations change with the changing dynamics\u201d of the global economy.Conversely, he believes, you may have too much money in fixed-income investments. His recommendation, which strikes me as aggressive, is if you are three or more years away from retirement, you need to have only 36 months of total living expenses in bonds, Treasuries and money market funds. \u201cSo long as you are more than three years from retirement, there is no need for more fixed income exposure.\u201d Everything else, he says, should be in stocks.And those stocks should be in index funds. Active investing \u201cis analogous to the joke about how good the technology is on new airplanes these days,\u201d he writes. \u201cInstead of two pilots, these new airplanes require one pilot and one dog. The dog\u2019s job is to bite the pilot if he tries to touch the controls. Many of us would be better off if we had a dog around to bite us when we are tempted to \u2018actively manage\u2019 our investments.\u201dBut for all that investing advice, Mr. McCormick devotes the first 50 pages of his book to the need to \u201cmaximize the value of your single biggest asset \u2014 your labor,\u201d making points such as, \u201cInvestments in education are one of the surest ways to financial security and wealth creation.\u201dArmed with that education, he adds, you want to \u201cmake career choices that extend your possibilities.\u201d You want to gain skills in fields like finance or marketing that are transferable to other industries as opposed to learning everything about one industry that could end up being disrupted out of existence.The proven principles of personal investing are important. But if you want to have a secure financial future, it will certainly help if you manage your career well. Neither Mr. McCormick nor Ms. Palmer advises that you choose a career based solely on what it pays, but it is certainly one factor to keep in mind.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Growing Ardor for Overseas Shopping", "Date": "2016-04-14", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsNelson Peltz sat on the board of Legg Mason, the $3.7 billion asset management company, for five years while his hedge fund, Trian Partners, scooped up 10 percent of the company\u2019s stock.Mr. Peltz shook things up as he always does. He ousted the chief executive and got Legg to cut costs and return billions of dollars to shareholders. When it came time to exit the investment, Mr. Peltz sold his shares to the Shanda Group.Wait, what? You heard right. Shanda is a Chinese investment company that started out as an interactive-gaming company but now \u201cseeks global opportunities that offer business growth or unique breakthrough potential.\u201d On Tuesday, it spent $340 million to buy Mr. Peltz\u2019s stake in Legg, which got its start selling stocks out of a back office in the Baltimore Stock Exchange in 1899.The logic of this deal is hard to follow \u2013 not least because Shanda paid a premium to the market price for the Legg shares, something that almost nobody ever does for a passive minority stake. Yet such situations are hardly unique at a moment when Chinese companies and investors are going wild for assets of pretty much any color or stripe in the world\u2019s developed economies.Indeed, the Chinese ardor for overseas shopping has become so fervent that there\u2019s a new mantra making the rounds of Wall Street bankers who have an asset to sell anywhere in the world: \u201cWho\u2019s the Chinese buyer we\u2019ve never heard of?\u201dThe biggest advisory companies like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs routinely fly China specialists across the ocean when they pitch companies for the mandate to help sell a business.The surge in Chinese buyers, many of them unknown in the West \u2013 sometimes even in Hong Kong \u2014 requires a new level of due diligence and heightened vigilance, from banks, lawyers and accountants. As the curious case of Anbang Insurance\u2019s aborted \u2013 and inexplicable from the start \u2013 $14 billion bid for Starwood Hotels suggests, it\u2019s harder for investment banks to really understand their Chinese clients\u2019 motivations.The examples cross nearly every industry and region. Though head-scratchers abound, not all of them are as hard to fathom as Shanda\u2019s Legg investment. Some reflect the overarching ambitions of Chinese Communist Party leaders. Some, like Alibaba\u2019s purchase of Hong Kong\u2019s South China Morning Post, look like vanity plays. Others just take a creative stretch of industrial logic to justify. Underpinning them all seems to be a lack of confidence about prospects in the People\u2019s Republic.The China National Chemical Corporation\u2019s $43 billion takeover of the agrochemicals giant Syngenta falls squarely into the first category. The state-owned enterprise was set up by the country\u2019s former Ministry of Chemical Industry. Its chairman, Ren Jianxin, undoubtedly has a red phone linking his desk to the Communist Party\u2019s top brass in Beijing.The Syngenta deal looks like it is intended to satisfy China\u2019s goals to bolster food production in the world\u2019s largest agricultural market. Syngenta\u2019s chemicals and patent-protected seeds are a strategic asset for a nation that has a population of 1.4 billion. This deal, China\u2019s biggest foreign acquisition, is a relatively logical pairing.The same cannot be said of Shandong Ruyi\u2019s surprise $1.2 billion purchase last month of SMCP, the operator of the second-tier European fashion chains Sandro, Maje and Claudie Pierlot. It\u2019s hard to argue, as Shandong Ruyi does on its website, that \u201cbeing involved in rabbit-hair spinning, textile & clothing, cotton textile, cotton printing and dyeing, knitting, fiber, jeans and real estate\u201d has made it a \u201cwell-known textile-related pluralism group.\u201d Still, kudos to the enterprising banker who alerted the firm to the willingness of the owner, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, to part with the French retailer.At least Shandong Ruyi has a website. In the auction of Dah Sing Financial\u2019s insurance business, more than two dozen suitors showed up for the first round of bids, half of them from the mainland, and some so obscure that bankers involved in the process had never heard of them.That\u2019s not unusual. When the private equity firm EQT was selling a German company that generates energy from waste matter, eight interested parties from the mainland showed up. And unlike banks or insurers interested in Dah Sing, they weren\u2019t highly regulated entities. In the end, the business sold for 1.43 billion euros to Beijing Enterprises Holding, a conglomerate listed in Hong Kong with three business lines: gas, beer and sewage treatment.China\u2019s lunge for foreign assets has hit $92 billion so far this year, according to Thomson Reuters, nearly reaching last year\u2019s $103 billion record with eight and a half months to spare.At that pace, it won\u2019t be long before Mandarin solidly displaces money as the language of opportunity on Wall Street.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After a Rough Quarter, Goldman Faces Questions on Strategy", "Date": "2016-04-19", "News": "Supported byGoldman Sachs has been betting that it will again see around the next corner better than its competitors.As other large banks have been cutting back the trading and investing businesses that have long defined Wall Street, Goldman has fearlessly stuck to its guns.But after Goldman on Tuesday delivered the worst first-quarter results of any major bank \u2014 the latest of many challenging quarters \u2014 the firm faced some tough questions about whether a raft of changes in regulations and financial markets might be making its focus on Wall Street businesses the wrong bet.\u201cWhen does Goldman say the time has come for transformational change \u2014 that we must do something radically different because we\u2019re getting nowhere?\u201d the banking analyst Richard X. Bove, asked Goldman executives on a conference call after the company announced its financial results for the first three months of the year.Goldman has already taken several steps to recalibrate its mixture of businesses. Most significantly, it has been looking at offering banking services to ordinary Americans, moving beyond its traditional business serving big companies.None of the new businesses, however, have come close to outweighing the old revenues that Goldman has lost.The first-quarter financial results from all the big banks have underscored the challenges facing the financial industry as it grapples with volatile markets and a wide array of new regulations that raise the cost of doing business.Goldman is in a particularly difficult situation. It has again become a target during this election season, with the Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders using the bank as a symbol of Wall Street greed.At the same time, its reliance on trading and underwriting has made it more vulnerable than other big American banks to the new regulations and volatile markets. On Tuesday, the bank reported the lowest first-quarter profit and revenue since 2004, with declines across almost all of the bank\u2019s major business lines.The firm earned $1.1 billion, or $2.68 a share, down 55 percent from the same period a year earlier. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had been expecting earnings of $2.45 a share. Some analysts said that including certain one-time items, Goldman did worse than they expected.Goldman\u2019s chief financial officer, Harvey Schwartz, defended the company\u2019s approach \u2014 and suggested that analysts not focus too much on one quarter, particularly with the slide in the price of oil and the unstable outlook for interest rates.But Mr. Schwartz also argued that the bank had been cutting employees and expenses to deal with the difficult environment.\u201cThis has been \u2014 and I admit it \u2013 this has been a tough period,\u201d Mr. Schwartz said on Tuesday. \u201cBut we have a long history of managing our business across the cycle.\u201dInvestors appeared to give Goldman the benefit of the doubt on Tuesday. The bank\u2019s stock ended the day up 2.3 percent. But it is still down 25 percent from a high reached last summer, and is far from the peaks reached before the financial crisis.Goldman has developed a reputation for making smart moves ahead of its competitors. After the financial crisis, for instance, when bond trading was hot, Goldman made cuts to its operation, correctly anticipating that the good times would not last.More recently, though, Goldman has been betting that there would be a revival in the fixed income markets where bonds are traded, even as rivals have cut back.So far, the situation in the fixed income markets has only grown worse for Goldman. In the latest quarter, revenue from fixed income trading fell 48 percent from the same quarter a year earlier.The company\u2019s equities trading desks, where stocks are traded, have been a bright spot over the last year. But revenue there also fell 58 percent in the first quarter.Goldman has now bowed to the challenging environment, later than most of its rivals, by making significant cuts to its fixed income unit.Goldman is also laying the groundwork to cut salaries and bonuses across the firm in 2016. The firm slashed the amount put aside for compensation and by 40 percent in the first quarter.It is shaping up to be another grim year for the nation\u2019s biggest banks. They were hit hard by a bad environment for trading and deal-making.Mr. Schwartz hailed the bank\u2019s success in cutting costs, which has helped the bank remain profitable. But lowering salaries could ultimately make it hard to continue competing for the smartest young recruits from top American colleges and graduate schools \u2014 perhaps the most frequently cited factor behind Goldman\u2019s success.This week, analysts and investors expressed an even more basic concern that the business lines where Goldman is focused are likely to be much less profitable moving forward because of the array of new regulations phased in since the passage of the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul legislation.\u201cHave you considered the fact that there might not be any relief on the regulatory side in the context of your longer-term strategy for the business?\u201d Steven Chubak, a bank analyst with Nomura Securities, asked Mr. Schwartz on Tuesday.Mike Mayo, an analyst at CLSA, put it even more bluntly: \u201cYou danced pretty well the last three to four years without revenue growth. But it seems like you\u2019re getting to the end of what you can do.\u201dIn response, Mr. Schwartz cautioned that the worst problems in the first quarter came in the first two months of the year, and that the outlook had improved since then, which could improve results in the rest of the year. And he pointed to the moves to expand its retail business.Still, Mr. Bove chastised Goldman for not doing more.\u201cWhen do you get control of your destiny as opposed to sitting here for nine years, letting the world control who you are and what you\u2019re doing?\u201d he said on Tuesday morning.\u201cI certainly wouldn\u2019t agree with your statement that we\u2019re sitting here waiting for the world to do what it does,\u201d Mr. Schwartz countered.\u201cIf we felt there was a client segment or a transaction we could do that would benefit our shareholders and we could deliver to those clients, we would do it,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re open-minded.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Investors Should Get More I.P.O. Data Earlier, British Regulator Says", "Date": "2016-04-13", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Britain\u2019s markets regulator said on Wednesday that investors should have more information available to them earlier in the initial public offering process. The call came as the regulator considers whether to revamp the system for public listings of stocks in Britain.Because of a blackout period of up to two weeks imposed by the underwriters, investors often receive access to an initial prospectus only within two weeks of a company\u2019s I.P.O., the authority found, and do not receive a final, approved prospectus until the first day of trading.By comparison, the United States only allows the prospectus, which is updated throughout the process, to be used to market an offering, the British regulator said.The regulator also suggested that research analysts not connected to the underwriters be given access to a company\u2019s management as part of the process. Of 169 transactions examined by the agency, only one included research not connected with the underwriters being published during the I.P.O. process.The proposed changes come as London is becoming an increasingly popular market for public listings.The Financial Conduct Authority said that it would seek public input on possible changes through July 13, and that it would issue a further consultation paper if it decides to pursue any specific policy changes.A vast majority of I.P.O.s in Britain are carried out through private placements to institutional investors, such as insurance companies and pension funds, with a few offerings including the sale of a small percentage of shares to retail investors.From 2011 to 2015, 460 companies raised 53 billion pounds, or about $76 billion at current exchange rates, through new listings on the London Stock Exchange, according to the regulator. That included 199 I.P.O.s last year.During the typical I.P.O. process in Britain, connected research is published around the same time a company publicly announces its intention to pursue an offering, the Financial Conduct Authority said.Next comes a 10- to 14-day blackout period, followed by the circulation of the initial prospectus and price range to a select group of institutional investors, the regulator said.Company management teams conduct roadshows with investors, and a book of potential investors is then put together in the two weeks that precede the I.P.O., with the final, approved prospectus published on the first day of trading, the Financial Conduct Authority said.Under a series of possible models cited by the Financial Conduct Authority on Wednesday, an approved prospectus containing no price information \u2014 similar to what is done in the United States \u2014 would be circulated first.That would most likely be followed by a blackout period of up to seven days after the initial prospectus is circulated, before connected research could be distributed, the regulator said.The Financial Conduct Authority also suggested the possibility of giving unconnected analysts access to management, perhaps at the same time that analysts connected with the underwriters meet with the company early in the process.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Brexit\u2019 Vote Has Investment Experts Advising Caution in Europe", "Date": "2016-04-09", "News": "Supported byThe British are going! Maybe.A referendum to determine whether Britain will leave the European Union has been set for June 23. Until voters decide whether they would rather be in or out, investors will have to decide whether to be in or out of assets in Britain and other parts of Europe.Neither decision will be easy. The referendum outcome is a tossup in polls, and analysts are divided on whether the country would be better off in or out of the 28-nation bloc.As for the markets, British stocks have fallen in the last year, like those in many countries, and the currency, the pound, has declined against the dollar and euro. But both have been stable since Prime Minister David Cameron announced the referendum date in late February.The European Union probably could carry on without Greece, as some members of European officialdom made clear to the Greeks during negotiations on their debt. Whether the union would do as well without Britain is more questionable.It\u2019s difficult for investors in international stocks and bonds to prepare for the referendum because professionals have diverging opinions on the economic and political fallout of a pro-Brexit vote. Mr. Muldoon foresees a long, fairly benign aftermath in which \u201cthe E.U. and U.K. would negotiate favorable trade deals.\u201d\u201cThe \u2018out\u2019 people say there would be a smooth transition,\u201d he said, \u201cbut despite a lot of history together, I could see a difficult situation with pain and losses on both sides.\u201dA report by the French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale predicted that a Brexit would take 0.5 percent to 1 percent a year off British economic growth for 10 years and result in an annual drop in exports of 2.5 percent. Britain\u2019s economy grew 2.2 percent last year.\u201cIt would be in the mutual interest of the U.K. and the rest of the E.U. to strike a reasonable second-best solution which would maintain access to much of the single market,\u201d the report said. \u201cBut one should not forget the need to renegotiate the U.K.\u2019s trade relationships with the major non-European countries, as well, in particular the U.S. and China. That could be a long and painful process, with the balance of power being tilted against the U.K.\u201dThat prospect has made a further decline in the pound a rare Brexit forecast that is nearly universally held. A vote in favor of leaving the European Union would drive the pound below $1.30, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale predicted, compared with $1.44 on March 31. It also would propel a decline in the euro to less than $1 from about $1.14, the bank said.A soft pound would depress the dollar value of British assets, but it may be possible to more than recoup the losses in certain types of stocks. Mr. Muldoon predicted that the falling pound \u201cwould act as a stabilizer to any economic deterioration.\u201d Industries like tourism would improve as the weak currency drew visitors to Britain who otherwise might have traveled to the Continent, he said.Mr. Maxwell, though wary, pointed out that companies in the blue-chip FTSE 100 index derive 75 percent or more of their earnings from outside Britain. That would cushion the blow from a plunging pound. Shares of companies that could benefit from it by producing goods at home and selling them abroad might be worth an investment.\u201cOwning things with U.K. costs and foreign revenues is good, but there are not many of those,\u201d he said, offering the beverage maker Diageo as one example.For all their concerns about the British economy, the strategists at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale have a positive outlook over all for British stocks thanks to the expected further declines in the currency. Yet they caution that British banks would be especially hard-hit in a Brexit because competing financial centers on the Continent would take over many of their activities.Whatever their commercial prospects, Mr. Muldoon finds bank stocks worth a bet. They have been sold heavily, taking their prices to low multiples of earnings, he said.Another casualty of a Brexit, in the view of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, would be British bonds; their yields, the bank predicts, would rise relative to those of core European countries like Germany. Not that it would be much consolation to owners of British bonds, but Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale envisions yield spreads widening even further for bonds in the Continental European periphery, places like Italy and Spain with persistently shaky economies.The potential fragility of much of Europe recalls that apocryphal weather report from the 1930s: \u201cFog in channel, Continent cut off.\u201d The rest of Europe may need Britain more than Britain needs it.\u201cPeople would have more confidence in the U.K. doing the right thing in the medium term than Italy or Spain\u201d if the European Union began to fracture, Mr. Muldoon said. \u201cThe great thing about the U.K. is that it\u2019s a proper economy, with diversified sources of industry. The market structure is very strong, and corporations are very shareholder-friendly. For all of Europe, the U.K. is closest to the American model of capitalism.\u201dBritain may decide that it needs the European Union enough to want to stay put. If the vote goes that way, \u201cWe\u2019d expect markets to calm down quite quickly,\u201d Mr. Zahn said. \u201cWe\u2019d also expect investments that had sold off could subsequently rally, and there could likely be some good opportunities to realize value.\u201dWith so much riding on an outcome so much in doubt, any investment decision involving Britain, Europe and even points beyond should be made with great care. If the British do decide that they\u2019re going, \u201cthis will be negative for growth around the world,\u201d Mr. Muldoon warned, and \u201cwe\u2019re going to have volatility leading up to June 23. Given the uncertainty, you might want to invest elsewhere.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Robber Baron Recessions", "Date": "2016-04-18", "News": "Supported byBut why doesn\u2019t Verizon want to invest? Probably because it doesn\u2019t have to: many customers have no place else to go, so the company can treat its broadband business as a cash cow, with no need to spend money on providing better service (or, speaking from personal experience, on maintaining existing service).The argument begins with a seeming paradox about overall corporate behavior. You see, profits are at near-record highs, thanks to a substantial decline in the percentage of G.D.P. going to workers. You might think that these high profits imply high rates of return to investment. But corporations themselves clearly don\u2019t see it that way: their investment in plant, equipment, and technology (as opposed to mergers and acquisitions) hasn\u2019t taken off, even though they can raise money, whether by issuing bonds or by selling stocks, more cheaply than ever before.How can this paradox be resolved? Well, suppose that those high corporate profits don\u2019t represent returns on investment, but instead mainly reflect growing monopoly power. In that case many corporations would be in the position I just described: able to milk their businesses for cash, but with little reason to spend money on expanding capacity or improving service. The result would be what we see: an economy with high profits but low investment, even in the face of very low interest rates and high stock prices.The obvious next question is why competition has declined. The answer can be summed up in two words: Ronald Reagan.True, there was a limited revival of anti-monopoly efforts during the Clinton years, but these went away again under George W. Bush. The result was an economy with far too much concentration of economic power. And the Obama administration \u2014 preoccupied with the aftermath of financial crisis and the struggle with bitterly hostile Republicans \u2014 has only recently been in a position to grapple with competition policy.For we aren\u2019t just living in a second Gilded Age, we\u2019re also living in a second robber baron era. And only one party seems bothered by either of those observations.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Looking for Signs of Life in Emerging Markets", "Date": "2016-04-09", "News": "Supported byFor years, many investors have been pining for a rebound in emerging-market stocks, only to be frustrated by the slide in commodity prices, which still drive many developing economies.The situation appeared to improve in the first quarter.After surviving another scare in January, crude oil prices rebounded about 40 percent, pulling up other commodities and emerging-market equities. Since Jan. 20, shares of companies based in rapidly growing economies like Brazil, the Philippines and Thailand have soared more than 20 percent, double the gains of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index of domestic equities during that time.Is the bear market in commodities and emerging-market stocks coming to an end?Not quite.Most economists say it could take years before a commodity \u201csupercycle,\u201d like the one that drove emerging-market stocks in the early 2000s, kicks in. Even if China, the world\u2019s biggest consumer of industrial commodities, were to regain momentum \u2014 a big if \u2014 the global economy would still require years to work through excess capacity, many market strategists say.Although commodities continue to be a drag, there are signs of subtle changes that make emerging-market stocks more appealing \u2014 at least more so than a year ago.\u201cComing into the year, there was this attitude: \u2018Why take on additional volatility with emerging-market stocks when you can get better returns for less volatility in the developed world?\u2019\u201d said Laurence Taylor, a portfolio specialist who works with global equities at T. Rowe Price.As it turned out, concerns about the slowing economy hit the developed markets harder than the developing world, as European stock funds lost 3.4 percent in the quarter versus a 4 percent average gain for diversified emerging market funds.\u201cThat, perhaps, would be a catalyst for people to reassess their emerging-world thesis,\u201d Mr. Taylor said.So too would the surprising advances seen in many of the most worrisome economies \u2014 the so-called fragile five nations of Turkey, India, Indonesia, South Africa and Brazil \u2014 which have improved their budget deficits, balance of trade and inflation outlook, he added.And the Federal Reserve\u2019s less aggressive stance on interest rates this year may reduce a major headwind for the emerging markets. At the end of last year, expectations were that the Fed would lift short-term interest rates four times in 2016, even as central banks abroad were still trying to stimulate growth.Because higher rates curb risk-taking and strengthen the dollar, this was expected to have a negative effect on emerging-market shares.\u201cThe change in tone represents more synchronicity with central banks in Japan, Europe and around the world,\u201d said Michael Kass, manager of the Baron Emerging Markets fund.That could represent an opportunity in the developing world, money managers say, though this risky asset would merit caution.Even assuming that emerging-market stocks will go back to being one of the best-performing asset classes, as was the case a decade ago, the countries that led the past rally might not lead a resurgence.Consider that the so-called BRIC countries \u2014 Brazil, Russia, India and China, which dominated emerging market funds a decade ago \u2014 gained more than 770 percent from 1999 through 2007. That\u2019s more than double the returns for other emerging-market stocks. Yet since the financial crisis of 2008, BRIC stocks have lost a third of their value while the rest of the emerging markets have held their ground.Then there is a valuation problem. \u201cYou can put emerging-markets stocks into a couple of buckets,\u201d said Jonas M. Krumplys, co-manager of the Ivy Emerging Markets Equity fund. In one bucket are the commodity-driven economies of Latin America and Russia. In the other bucket are stocks based in economies that are increasingly being driven by domestic growth and rising consumer spending. This includes markets like India, Indonesia, Mexico and the Philippines.The problem is, stocks in the latter bucket \u2014 which investors favor \u2014 are trading at price-to-earnings ratios that are typically 50 percent or greater than shares based in the commodity bucket.\u201cIn the aggregate, the emerging markets look cheap relative to history,\u201d said Scott Crawshaw, co-manager of the Harding Loevner Emerging Markets Portfolio fund. \u201cBut higher-quality areas of the market are trading at very different valuations to those stocks that are more caught up in the commodities downdraft.\u201dSome money managers say they are being very selective.Within that domestic growth-oriented bucket, for instance, \u201cyou\u2019re trying to find the gems left behind,\u201d said Charles Wilson, co-manager of the Thornburg Developing World fund.An example, he said, is Kweichow Moutai, a leading spirits maker, which produces a major brand of baijiu, a distilled Chinese liquor.\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most well-known brands in general in China,\u201d Mr. Wilson said. He notes that the company trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of just 15, based on this year\u2019s estimated profits. \u201cThat\u2019s five or six points cheaper compared to its European liquor peers,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it has a 2.5 percent dividend yield.\u201dMr. Kass at Baron has also been looking for companies with domestic growth potential that are trading at attractive prices.He said he had been focusing on growth companies that were affected by \u2014 but not directly participating in \u2014 the commodities business.These are companies like BM&F Bovespa, the Brazilian stock and derivatives exchange. Because equity-trading volumes are affected by the health of Brazil\u2019s commodity-driven economy, shares sank nearly 18 percent from November to January. But Mr. Kass said the company has a good balance sheet and attractive long-term growth prospects.And since late January, the stock has soared more than 50 percent.Arjun Divecha, who oversees emerging market equities at the asset management firm GMO, notes that even within faster-growing sectors in the developing world, like technology, there are still pockets of attractively priced stocks.\u201cChinese tech is all the Internet stuff, which is expensive,\u201d Mr. Divecha said. \u201cTaiwanese tech is filled with middlemen \u2014 suppliers who make parts and are cheaper.\u201dAn example is Hon Hai Precision Industry, also known as Foxconn, which manufactures component parts for information technology and wireless communications companies. Earnings per share at the company, based in Taipei, have climbed 15 percent a year for the last four years. Yet the stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of just 9, based on forecast profits.Yet another strategy is to seek out overlooked countries \u2014 and companies benefiting from domestic growth, rather than exports.For example, investors have identified plenty of economies helped by low commodity prices because those nations are net buyers of raw materials. This includes places like India and the Philippines.Yet also in that group is Thailand, which has been plagued by political instability, enduring a dozen coups since 1932 \u2014 the most recent one in 2014.\u201cWhen you think of a place like Thailand, you think, \u2018Oh man, another military coup,\u2019\u201d said Scott Klimo, co-manager of the Amana Developing World fund. \u201cBut the fact is, the country has been pretty well managed from a macro perspective.\u201dOne of his fund\u2019s top holdings is Bangkok Dusit Medical Services, which operates hospitals in Thailand. Mr. Klimo said that roughly 75 percent of the company\u2019s business was done with Thai residents, which means it reflects the health of the Thai economy, not global trade.At the same time, he said, \u201cHousehold spending on health care is a fraction of what it is in other economies.\u201d Such spending will increase as more families enter the middle class.Ultimately, that kind of demographic advantage has been fueling the developing-market theme for decades. And strategists say it will support an eventual rebound in emerging-market stocks, whenever that comes to pass.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Plans New Stock Class to Solidify Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Control", "Date": "2016-04-27", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Mark Zuckerberg nurtured Facebook from a dorm room idea into the world\u2019s biggest social network. Now the company is taking steps to ensure its founder remains in charge.Mr. Zuckerberg on Wednesday cited the Silicon Valley mantra of founders in explaining the new class of stock, calling Facebook a \u201cfounder-led company.\u201d In a conference call, he added, \u201cFacebook has been built on a series of bold moves. When I look out on the future, I see more bold moves ahead of us, not behind us.\u201dFacebook\u2019s shares, which are up more than 33 percent over the past year, soared 9 percent in after-hours trading.The new C shares effectively allow Mr. Zuckerberg to maintain 60 percent of voting power while still giving away large amounts of stock. Under the proposal, all holders of Facebook stock will get two C shares for each A or B share that they own. Importantly, the C shares come with no voting power. Holders of A shares are entitled to one vote per share, while holder of B shares have 10 votes a share.That means Mr. Zuckerberg, as the majority owner of Facebook shares, will obtain a large amount C shares that he can then donate without diluting his voting power in the company.\u201cIt is a rational, if somewhat eyebrow-raising way, for founders to distribute wealth without giving up operating control of the company,\u201d said Lise Buyer, founder of the Class V Group, which advises start-ups on initial public offerings. \u201cThis structure will continue to allow Facebook to make decisions that may not always look great in the short term, but may pay off for investors over time.\u201dFacebook\u2019s C shares may trade at a slight discount to A shares, which would still have one vote. Most investors currently hold A shares, which only have about a quarter of the overall shareholders\u2019 voting power, so they may not be forgoing much if they choose to sell their A shares versus their C shares.\u201cIt\u2019s almost like voting Republican in Massachusetts \u2014 you can do it, but it won\u2019t affect the outcome,\u201d said Rick Kline, a partner in the technology and capital markets practice of law firm Goodwin Procter.Investors getting new C shares will not gain economically because the same proportion of new stock will be given to all holders.Facebook, in contrast, has figured out how to wring billions of dollars from its members on mobile devices and other platforms, making the company\u2019s revenue-generation machine unstoppable.And while growth in new users on Facebook has slowed in recent years, the total is still getting larger. Facebook said 1.65 billion people visited the site on a monthly basis in the first quarter, up from 1.44 billion a year earlier. More than 1.5 billion people are monthly mobile-only users, up from 1.25 billion a year ago.Facebook\u2019s other big bets like WhatsApp, the messaging service, and Oculus, its virtual reality play, have yet to pay off with immense new revenue streams. But Facebook is comfortable gathering a critical mass of users \u2014 nearly a billion in WhatsApp\u2019s case \u2014 and then introducing advertising later on when it makes more sense.\u201cTo me, this is like Google 10 years ago,\u201d said Mark Mahaney, an Internet analyst at RBC Capital. \u201cThey really had such momentum, and they\u2019re proving how valuable they are to both advertisers and consumers.\u201dMike Isaac reported from San Francisco and Leslie Picker from New York.

GE Capital and MetLife are two of four nonbank financial institutions that have been labeled as systemically important. The Treasury Department, which leads the Financial Stability Oversight Council, said that it welcomed the opportunity to evaluate GE Capital and that it re-examined the designations every year. Still, the true impact won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be known until the MetLife ruling is unsealed. A ruling that disagrees with the council\u00e2\u0080\u0099s methods, rather than its right to identify systemically risky firms, could substantially embolden the anti-overhaul forces to strike elsewhere. end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "When Feelings of Comfort Trump Spreadsheet Math", "Date": "2016-04-04", "News": "Supported bySketch Guy\u201cCarl,\u201d my friend told me, in a heated moment of financial debate, \u201cYou need a new truck like you need a bullet in the head.\u201dI fired something back about how off base she was, how it would be a sound purchase, and who was she to say anyway?We went back and forth. It was very unproductive, and we let our tempers get the better of us before we finally walked away to cool off.With the benefit of some time and space, however, we figured out that it wasn\u2019t so much that she was wrong. And it wasn\u2019t so much that I was wrong. What we argued about boiled down to a matter of personal preference.Truth is a pretty rare thing in personal finance. More often than not, what we call truth is simply a state of mind or an opinion. Even when the math points at what seems to obvious truth, feelings can get in the way.For instance, take the common advice from some investment professionals to borrow as much as you can for your house at the lowest possible interest rate for the longest length of time. Then, take every extra dollar you have and invest it in the stock market instead of paying down your mortgage.The sales pitch goes like this. The overall stock market earns roughly 10 percent annually over long periods if you reinvest the dividends and don\u2019t trade. Let\u2019s say your mortgage only costs you around 4 percent. As long as you stick with your investment plan for the 30-year term of your mortgage, you\u2019ll end up with more money in your pocket than if you just paid off your home as quickly as possible.If that\u2019s true though, why have I been to way more mortgage-burning parties than portfolio celebrations? For many people, the cognitive comfort of having the home paid off as soon as possible is worth it \u2014 even if the spreadsheet says otherwise. There is security in being free of their largest debt, and that good feeling has real value.And before you jump on the rationalist bandwagon and criticize emotion-driven, illogical behavior, ask yourself a simple question: What is money for? In the end, isn\u2019t the point of money to make us feel more comfortable, more secure, more at ease and happier? If so, it may not make a lot of sense for us to try to talk our friends (or ourselves) out of mathematically incorrect behavior.We tend to forget that money is about feelings, and feelings don\u2019t always fit neatly into the \u201ctruth.\u201d So the next time you find yourself in a heated debate about money, feeling like a crusader for truth, put the sword down and remind yourself that what you\u2019re debating is probably not a matter of right or wrong, but one of personal preference.Take a step back, breathe and try again. But this time, leave the truth out of it.Advertisement"}
