{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s Cloud Business Lifts Its Profit to a Record", "Date": "2016-04-28", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 Amazon delivered a blowout quarter on Thursday, joining Facebook as one of the rare bright spots in a technology sector that has recently produced a string of disappointing earnings reports.Helped by its fast-growing Amazon Web Services business, the company jumped to the most profitable quarter in its nearly 22-year history.Amazon often flip-flops between showing profits and losses, depending on how aggressively it decides to plow money into big new business bets. Investors have granted the company much wider leeway to do so than other technology companies of its size often receive, because of its history of delivering outsize growth.Revenue at the company rose to $29.13 billion from $22.72 billion a year ago.\u201cThe fact that they\u2019re profitable is a big deal,\u201d said Christian Magoon, chief executive of Amplify Investments, a fund manager that counts Amazon as a top holding. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a big deal after some of the disappointing numbers from Apple and others.\u201dThe results were well above the average estimates of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters for earnings of 58 cents a share and revenue of $27.98 billion.\u201cI saw the number, and I thought, \u2018O.K., did I read this wrong?\u2019\u201d Mr. Magoon added. \u201cThe beat was big. On the income side, it was fantastic.\u201dFor the last four quarters, Amazon has run in the black, even if it is still not quite as profitable as some technology companies. Facebook, by contrast, reported that its net income for the first three months of the year tripled to $1.5 billion from a year earlier.The biggest source of the company\u2019s profits is Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing business that started just over a decade ago and is now on track to bring in more than $10 billion a year in revenue. A.W.S., as the business is known, is the most popular cloud service for start-ups and for a growing number of big companies that want to rent computing capacity, rather than run their own hardware and software.Cloud computing is also much more profitable than Amazon\u2019s North American retail business, which runs on thinner margins, and its international retail business, which runs at a loss. The operating income for A.W.S. more than tripled in the quarter to $604 million.The profits from A.W.S. represented 56 percent of Amazon\u2019s total operating income, even though the $2.57 billion in revenue from A.W.S. \u2014 up 64 percent from a year earlier \u2014 amounted to less than 9 percent of total revenue.On a conference call, Brian Olsavsky, Amazon\u2019s chief financial officer, said the company continued to make hefty long-term investments in initiatives, singling out original content for its Prime video service.In a statement announcing the earnings, Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, highlighted the performance of another growing area of investment \u2014 hardware devices \u2014 though with the lack of detail that has often characterized Amazon disclosures. He said customers bought twice as many Fire tablets during the first quarter as they did a year earlier, and he said the company could not keep its Echo intelligent speaker in stock.Last year, Amazon reached $100 billion in annual sales. Investors believe that even at that size, the company can become a lot bigger because online commerce still represents a relatively small portion of total retail sales. Online sales in 2016 are expected to reach about $385 billion in the United States, or 8 percent of total retail sales, according to eMarketer, a technology research firm.Amazon is the rare technology company of its size to still deliver double-digit revenue growth. The company\u2019s retail sales in North America jumped 27 percent to almost $17 billion for the quarter, while its international retail sales rose 24 percent to $9.57 billion.Amazon said revenue in the current quarter is expected to be between $28 billion and $30.5 billion, with operating income between $375 million and $975 million.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Magic Neorealism in World War\u2019s Wake", "Date": "2016-04-07", "News": "Supported byOn DVDThe brothers Paolo and Vittorio Taviani, now in their mid-80s, have had a long career in Italian cinema. Midway through, they enjoyed a relatively brief period in the international spotlight, following the success of \u201cPadre Padrone\u201d (\u201cMy Father, My Boss\u201d).Rossellini was a particular influence. As teenagers, the brothers had been inspired by his \u201cPaisan\u201d (1946); some three decades later, Rossellini, as president of the Cannes jury, was instrumental in securing the Palme d\u2019Or for \u201cPadre Padrone.\u201d Rossellini\u2019s campaign on behalf of two largely unknown filmmakers put him in conflict with festival officials who supported another Italian film, Ettore Scola\u2019s \u201cA Special Day.\u201d The acrimony was intense. According to Cari Beauchamp and Henri Behar\u2019s history of Cannes, \u201cHollywood on the Riviera,\u201d some blame the pressure on Rossellini for the fatal heart attack he sustained days after the festival.\u201cPadre Padrone\u201d not only received the Palme d\u2019Or but, in a rare confluence of opinion, also the International Federation of Film Critics prize. One of a kind, the movie has an archaic, almost mythological, feel that\u2019s enhanced by its use of elemental Sardinian locations under the blazing Mediterranean sun. A departure in style, it introduced the magic neorealism the Tavianis would develop further in \u201cNight of the Shooting Stars,\u201d a 6-year-old girl\u2019s memory of World War II, which, recounted to her own young daughter and framed by a zoom into a star-filled Disney heaven, immediately announces itself as a bedtime story.Set in the Tuscan countryside during the summer of 1944, with the American forces advancing and the Germans in retreat, \u201cNight of the Shooting Stars\u201d is an unpredictable, often comic blend of sentimental naturalism and skillful hyperbole. It\u2019s also quasi-autobiographical \u2014 some of the incidents occurred in the Tavianis\u2019 home village and were the subject of one of their early documentaries. Although the girl is an intermittent narrator, the emphasis is on the ensemble of townspeople, showing \u201cthe facts of that period transformed by the popular imagination,\u201d Vittorio Taviani explained in a 1983 Film Quarterly article.As in \u201cPadre Padrone,\u201d there is a scene in which a crowd\u2019s unspoken thoughts function like a chorus. Tenderness and violence are continuously juxtaposed. The ultimate evocation of confusion and death in a bucolic landscape is a scene wherein, impulsively running toward a startled battalion of Italian-American soldiers, a teenage girl is mortally wounded; she imagines that, rather than shooting her, the \u201cSicilianos de Brookalino\u201d have come to her rescue, presenting her with a Statue of Liberty snow globe.\u201cKaos,\u201d named not only for primordial disorder but also for the Sicilian town where Pirandello was born, is the rare anthology film in which the various stories serve to amplify one another. All are essentially fables \u2014 alternately heartbreaking and farcical \u2014 set mainly among the downtrodden peasantry. The characters are vivid, but the real star is the rugged Sicilian landscape, often shown in sweeping aerial shots, and the island\u2019s ancient towns, typically treated as if stage sets.The sense of eternity is palpable; was anything in Sicily ever new? In the epilogue, the aged Pirandello revisits his birthplace (immediately greeted by one of his characters, a younger man in an earlier episode). The writer converses with the ghost of his mother, who recounts a childhood memory of fleeing Sicily with her father, an exiled revolutionary. The tale echoes the movie\u2019s first story, of immigration and abandonment, resolving \u201cKaos\u201d on a note of poignant lyricism.The Tavianis followed with their first English-language film, \u201cGood Morning Babylon\u201d (1987), the cloying account of two Tuscan brothers who immigrate to America to build sets for D. W. Griffith\u2019s \u201cIntolerance.\u201d The movie flopped. The Tavianis thereafter flew beneath the radar, at least in the United States, until an international comeback, \u201cCaesar Must Die\u201d \u2014 a documentary about a production of Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cJulius Caesar\u201d in a high-security Roman prison \u2014 won the Golden Bear at the 2012 Berlin Film Festival. It was later released in the United States and is available on DVD from Adopt Films.Now perhaps some distributor will bring out the Tavianis\u2019 earlier, more political features: \u201cUnder the Sign of Scorpio\u201d (1969), a daringly prehistoric revolutionary ballet; \u201cSt. Michael Had a Rooster\u201d (1972), the tragedy of a romantic anarchist, freely adapted from Tolstoy; and particularly \u201cAllonsanfan\u201d (1974), a majestically farcical evocation of post-Napoleonic Italy starring Marcello Mastroianni as a repeatedly disillusioned Jacobin aristocrat.NEWLY RELEASEDAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Privacy Watchdogs Call for Changes to U.S. Data-Transfer Deal", "Date": "2016-04-13", "News": "Supported byThe agreement, the so-called E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield, which would allow companies to continue sending personal data back and forth across the Atlantic, is still widely expected to be ratified by early summer. But by sounding the alarm over the current deal, national privacy watchdogs from France, Germany and other European Union member states have served notice that American companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon could face protracted country-by-country legal battles.The regulators say they worry that companies could misuse data, including information from search engine queries and social media posts. They also say they fear that American law enforcement and intelligence agencies might gain access to European citizens\u2019 personal information without sufficient safeguards in place.\u201cFrom the outside, it must look like Europe can\u2019t speak with one voice on privacy,\u201d said Patrick van Eecke, a data protection lawyer at DLA Piper in Brussels. \u201cThis is becoming kind of a circus.\u201dAnd the protest from the regulators signals that they could open cases and levy fines on companies that rely on moving data such as employees\u2019 financial information or social media posts across the Atlantic.As part of their announcement on Wednesday, European national privacy regulators said the data-transfer agreement was an improvement on previous rules. But they added that they remained concerned over American intelligence agencies\u2019 seemingly indiscriminate access to citizens\u2019 personal data when it is transferred to the United States.That access, according to the privacy watchdogs, is not subject to protections that match those currently offered in Europe. The regulators also said that new legal mechanisms to allow Europeans to monitor how their data is used in the United States needed to be strengthened.Ms. Falque-Pierrotin called on the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union that negotiated the data-transfer pact, to make further changes to the deal to meet the regulators\u2019 concerns.Those included fears that the indiscriminate bulk collection of Europeans\u2019 data by United States and European intelligence agencies failed to comply with the region\u2019s data protection rules. The privacy agencies also said the independence of a United States ombudsman reviewing European data protection complaints had to be strengthened.Vera Jourova, the European justice commissioner, said in a statement on Wednesday that she would try to incorporate the regulators\u2019 views into the final Privacy Shield pact, though she did not say which of the proposals would be included.But Ms. Jourova also emphasized that attention should now turn to getting European countries\u2019 approval for the data-transfer agreement by next month.\u201cI count on data protection authorities to help ensure that the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield works well in practice,\u201d she said.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.American officials contend that new oversight mechanisms \u2014 including an ombudsman in the State Department to handle European data queries \u2014 sufficiently protect privacy. They also say that American safeguards over how national intelligence agencies gain access to personal data go beyond what is available in many countries in the European Union.Despite Europe\u2019s national regulators raising concerns over Privacy Shield, legal experts and policy makers still expect the agreement to be approved by European countries by early summer.That is because the European Commission has the sole power to agree to the new rules, and because some countries, particularly the likes of Britain and Ireland, where many American technology companies have headquarters, have given their support to the trans-Atlantic deal.It remains unclear how the European Commission will alter Privacy Shield to answer national regulators\u2019 concerns, though it is unlikely that European officials will reopen negotiations with their American counterparts.\u201cNo national regulator wants to put companies in a legal limbo,\u201d said Alexander Whalen, a senior policy manager at Digital Europe, an industry body whose members include Google and Microsoft. \u201cWe\u2019re now in a waiting game.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the surname of a senior policy manager at Digital Europe. He is Alexander Whalen, not Whelan.Advertisement"}

They didn\u2019t care about quality, health or taste. The aim was to get drunk as quickly as possible at the cheapest price.\u201cYou don\u2019t need ingredients, a shaker, shot glasses or bartending skills \u2014 it\u2019s pre-made and you can enjoy it almost anywhere,\u201d said Harley Bauer, who co-founded the company in 2013. It comes in five flavors.Millennials have been particularly receptive. About 62 percent already buy ready-to-drink alcoholic beverages for the convenience, according to a December 2015 report by Mintel, a market research group. And LIQS\u2019s natural juices and high-quality spirits appeal to the group\u2019s penchant for healthier ingredients.Industry experts say LIQS, short for \u201cliquor shots,\u201d is in the right space at the right time. Television shows like\u201cSex and the City,\u201d \u201cMad Men\u201d and, more recently, \u201cBoardwalk Empire\u201d and \u201cBillions\u201d helped bring high-quality spirits and cocktails into vogue, said Frank Coleman, senior vice president of the Distilled Spirits Council, a trade group.Also, the 2008 recession prompted a surge in consumers hunting for easy and cheaper ways to make cocktails at home, he said. Cocktails may be trending big, but at least one expert isn\u2019t sure cocktail shots will be equally fashionable.\u201cShots are not usually meant to savor or drink or sip,\u201d said Beth Bloom, a food and drink analyst at Mintel. \u201cShots are the thing you drink to get to the end \u2014 which is drunkenness.\u201d And millennials are shunning the drink-till-you-drop fad, preferring higher-quality drinks in moderation. \u201cBeer pong is pass\u00e9,\u201d she said.Mr. Bauer dismisses that idea. \u201cYou can sip it, you can shoot it, you can pour it over ice in a martini glass if you wanted to.\u201dLIQS sales hit $600,000 in 2015, up from $250,000 in its first full year in 2014. Mr. Bauer is projecting sales of at least $1.5 million in 2016, $4.5 million in 2018 and $7 million to $10 million in 2020.Mr. Bauer and Michael Glickman are the brains behind LIQS.Born in Brooklyn in October 1977, Mr. Bauer caught the entrepreneurial bug early on, watching his father, Victor, build a thriving beer and soda distribution company. As a teenager, he spent summers working for his father, delivering crates to bars and clubs. \u201cI was a scrawny 5-foot-9, 130-pound kid, and I\u2019d be hauling a keg of beer that weighed twice as much as I did,\u201d he said with a laugh.He honed his marketing skills, working at entertainment firms, including the William Morris Agency and Flutie Entertainment, before taking a job and an ownership stake in his brother Jason\u2019s Crumbs cupcake company in 2006. At Crumbs, he coordinated the company\u2019s West Coast expansion to 30 stores from four over 24 months. After the 51-store chain was sold and taken public in 2011, he left and searched for new investments.Mr. Glickman, 47, was born in the Bronx. At 17, he started his first business, creating a phone directory for the newly built Valley View Mall in 1985 in Roanoke, Va., where store owners paid him to list their numbers in his book. In 1986, he started a portrait photography business, and in 1989 he built custom computers to pay his way through college.After graduating from Georgia State University with a bachelor\u2019s degree in business administration and marketing in 1992, he started his own company, Performance Event Marketing, which served such clients as Chivas Regal, IBM, Amazon, and HBO. He sold the firm in 2004 and began consulting.It was during business trips, which kept him on the road four months of the year, that Mr. Glickman came up with the cocktail shots idea. He wanted a convenient way to grab a cocktail at the end of a long day that didn\u2019t require going to a bar, buying big bottles or mixing ingredients.When a graphic designer friend introduced Mr. Glickman to Mr. Bauer in 2012, Mr. Bauer loved the cocktail shots idea, and the two agreed to build out the concept. Mr. Bauer, his father and his brother invested $800,000 to start LIQS.Finding a distillery was the biggest hurdle. \u201cAlmost every distillery is set up to fill 750- milliliter bottles or a 50-milliliter airplane bottle,\u201d Mr. Bauer said. They approached more than 40 companies, before finding one willing to make custom molds and retool their machines to fill and seal the contoured shot glasses, Mr. Glickman said.In late 2013, LIQS debuted in Miami. The founders used coffee shops and rental cars as offices and went door-to-door, selling the shots to liquor store managers. \u201cMy rental car was like a storage facility \u2014 it carried the product, racks, posters, stickers, buttons and T-shirts,\u201d Mr. Bauer said. They hustled, handing out samples at more than 50 charity galas and hip Miami parties.They expanded into Massachusetts and Texas in August 2014, and into Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, and Alberta, Canada, in June 2015. By 2020, they expect LIQS to be in more than 30 markets in the United States.LIQS\u2019s closest competitor is Twisted Shotz, which offers 25-milliliter shot-size cocktails. It caters to the college crowd, with its high sugar levels, artificial flavors and neon-colored drinks carrying names like Porn Star, Sex on the Beach and Miami Vice.Another rival, BuzzBallz, makes ready-to-drink cocktails with premium spirits similar to LIQS, but they are packaged in 200-milliliter containers.Other companies attract a different customer. Ludlows offers cocktails in jelly shots, Gasolina sells them in 200-milliliter pouches and Daily\u2019s offers frozen pouches.\u201cLIQS is very different \u2014 nobody is really doing it,\u201d said Barbara Oaktree, owner of Diplomat Wines & Spirits in New York. She initially ordered three cases for one store. \u201cWithin two months, they were sold out.\u201d She now sells LIQS at all four of her company\u2019s stores.But David Manno, a buyer for Gramercy Wine & Spirits, thinks LIQS\u2019s $7.99 retail price for a three-pack is too high \u2014 especially when it contains only 20 percent alcohol. \u201cEight dollars for three weak drinks is kind of a lot,\u201d he said. Still, LIQS is \u201ccarving out something new,\u201d he said.Michael Weinstock, an angel investor, first heard about LIQS in 2014 but waited a year before investing. \u201cI wanted to see proof of concept before I invested,\u201d said Mr. Weinstock, who had previously invested in a craft beer business that failed. In May 2015, he jumped in.To date, the LIQS founders have raised $2.5 million, and they are in the process of raising $2 million more. Mr. Glickman expects the company to turn a profit by 2018. He anticipates growth through the addition of new flavors and expanding into new markets, music festivals, clubs and stadiums.Several investors speculate that the company will probably be bought by a deep-pocketed player in the spirits industry down the line. But most are in no hurry to exit. \u201cYou need to have patience,\u201d said Bill Wise, a LIQS investor. \u201cYou never want to sell too early.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cra-Z-Art Toy Jewelry Kits Are Found to Have High Lead Levels", "Date": "2016-04-22", "News": "Supported byThe New York State attorney general said on Friday that his office had opened an investigation into how toys with dangerously high levels of lead ended up for sale at retailers including Target, Kmart and Toys \u201cR\u201d Us.The attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, said that some jewelry-making sets from the arts-and-crafts brand Cra-Z-Art contained as much as 10 times the amount of lead permitted by federal child safety limits. Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s office said that one or more of the products was also sold at other retailers, including Amazon and Walmart, and called on all the retailers to immediately remove them from their shelves.Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s office has asked the stores to provide more information about the safety testing and certification for the toys, which it said were manufactured in China and sold throughout New York State.\u201cManufacturers, importers, distributors and retailers all have responsibility to ensure that products intended for use by children are safe,\u201d Mr. Schneiderman said in a statement. \u201cMy office\u2019s discovery of high-lead products on store shelves in New York points to an alarming breach in the safety net that is supposed to protect our children from dangerous chemicals.\u201dCharlie Zakin, the vice president for advertising at Cra-Z-Art, a division of LaRose Industries in Randolph, N.J., said the company was unaware of the investigation.\u201cHowever, the safety of our products is our highest priority,\u201d Mr. Zakin said, adding that all of the items in question had passed \u201crigorous\u201d safety testing and \u201cconform to all regulatory standards.\u201dIn a statement, Walmart said that it required suppliers to meet \u201call applicable\u201d safety standards.Target and Toys \u201cR\u201d Us said they were looking into the matter, and Kmart said it would cooperate with any investigation. Target and Kmart affirmed their commitment to safety, and representatives for Amazon could not be reached for comment.Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s office bought a number of products in October, November and February as part of a broader test for toxic chemicals in children\u2019s products. The office tested 10 boxes of three Cra-Z-Art jewelry-making sets and found that the included wristbands contained lead that exceeded the federal safety limit of 100 parts per million. Some contained as much as 980 parts per million.Mr. Schneiderman does not have the authority to order product recalls. That power lies with the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the federal agency that sets the standards for lead in children\u2019s toys. The safety commission usually works with companies to obtain voluntary recalls, and in rare cases, it can sue companies to block the sale of hazardous products. In a statement, the attorney general called on the commission to issue a nationwide recall for Cra-Z-Art.\u201cJust hours after receiving information about these jewelry-making kits, C.P.S.C. staff opened an investigation into the safety of these products,\u201d Elliot Kaye, the commission chairman, said in a statement. \u201cC.P.S.C.\u2019s investigation will be thorough and swift, and we will certainly take all warranted steps to protect the public.\u201dChina is a not-uncommon source of products that violate various American safety standards. But in recent years, more muscular federal laws have made it increasingly unusual for tainted toys to wind up at large national retailers, which have the resources to ensure that their products follow the rules.\u201cI would say it is rare these days to find that kind of a problem at major retailers,\u201d said Charles Margulis, a spokesman for the Center for Environmental Health, a nonprofit group.Most children\u2019s manufacturers that ship products must get their products tested by an accredited laboratory before they reach the United States, Mr. Wolfson said. These certificates of compliance must then be sent to stores. Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s office has asked the retailers to provide copies of the certificates, according to letters obtained by The New York Times.But lead remains one of the most persistent problems, and the agency has acknowledged that it lacks the resources to properly check the enormous stream of shipments that come through the nation\u2019s ports every day.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Michael C. Fina, Park Avenue Wedding Retailer, Bets on Amazon.com", "Date": "2016-04-04", "News": "Supported byMichael C. Fina helped popularize bridal registries, and its Park Avenue store was a destination for Manhattan elites. It provided silver for John F. Kennedy\u2019s inauguration festivities and catered to the likes of Frank Sinatra and Lennox Lewis.But with foot traffic falling more than 80 percent in the last decade, the writing on the wall became clear: If you can\u2019t beat Amazon, join Amazon.On April 16, Michael C. Fina, which had sales of $16 million last year, will close its sole brick-and-mortar store, laying off about 20 workers and bringing to an end an 81-year run in Manhattan.Instead, the retailer is moving entirely online, including teaming with Amazon.com as part of a planned revamping of the e-commerce giant\u2019s wedding registry service.\u201cThe initial reaction was definitely: \u2018What are you, nuts? How do you have a retail business, and no store?\u2019\u201d said Steven Fina, 35, current president and the grandson of the retailer\u2019s founder.\u201cBut we\u2019ve seen in our own lives that the way we shop has changed,\u201d he said.Michael C. Fina is hardly the first retailer to buckle to the ever-mounting shift of shopping to the web. But the company is one of the most storied retailers to take its business online-only as a way to survive.The luxury store\u2019s deal with Amazon provides a glimpse into one way the online retail giant is bolstering its luxury offerings. Michael C. Fina\u2019s wedding registry page on the new site will offer high-end brands, like Baccarat and Buccellati, that have so far been loath to make their goods officially available on Amazon.The partnership also illustrates how deeply Amazon has woven itself into the business of independent merchants. In recent years, the company has experienced huge growth in a service it calls Fulfillment by Amazon, in which independent sellers pay Amazon to hold and ship their products, which extends to customers the fast delivery benefits of Amazon\u2019s Prime membership.It is unclear how the Michael C. Fina brands and products will stand out on the sprawling site. An Amazon spokeswoman declined to comment about Michael C. Fina, but provided an invitation to an event on April 12 in New York to introduce the new wedding registry site.The invitation said the new site would provide gift ideas in 15 categories, including flatware, cookware, home d\u00e9cor and appliances. The site will feature collections of products including Le Creuset cookware sets, Sonos speaker systems and Black & Decker tools.For Michael C. Fina, going online-only was a difficult yet inevitable choice, Mr. Fina said. The retailer already operates an e-commerce site, but it can take up to 72 hours for a product to be shipped.\u201cIn this day and age, we recognize the fact that was too long,\u201d he said. Amazon has told him that its fulfillment centers will be able to ship an order in as little as two hours. Mr. Fina also said he expected shipping costs to fall by as much as 50 percent, because of Amazon\u2019s economies of scale.Shan-Lyn Ma, founder of Zola.com, said that because couples in the United States were marrying much later than ever, and because they increasingly lived with their partners before tying the knot, their wedding gift needs had shifted away from the housewares and appliances that traditionally went toward setting up a first home.\u201cCouples are really starting to value experiences rather than straight wedding products you might have seen in our mothers\u2019 and grandmothers\u2019 wedding registries,\u201d Ms. Ma said.On Zola.com, couples can list hiking trips, hot air balloon rides and food delivery subscriptions, as well as funds for puppies, honeymoons and even fertility treatments. Zola, started in 2013 by Ms. Ma, a former executive at Gilt, the flash-sales site, has also spent the past year courting Casper mattresses, Sonos wireless audio systems and other brands popular among young adults.But she has since realized that many couples want to add a few traditional items into their wedding registry mix. And a partnership with Michael C. Fina, she said, gave Zola access to brands that the site might have trouble courting.\u201cBaccarat, Georg Jensen: Michael C. Fina has longstanding relationships with brands that we don\u2019t currently offer,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of high-low mixing.\u201dMr. Fina said that the retailer\u2019s merchants, marketing team, graphic designers and other back-office employees would largely keep their jobs. Most of the job losses would occur on the sales floor, he said, and the retailer would assist those laid off in finding new jobs in retailing. The company told its employees on Monday.\u201cThis was the most difficult part of our decision,\u201d said Mr. Fina, who runs the retailer with his two brothers and a cousin. \u201cSome of these people have worked for us for decades; they\u2019ve been so loyal.\u201dHe added: \u201cBut we\u2019re doing this because this is what our customers are telling us. We may be 80 years old, but we have to stay ahead of the curve.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "For Indian Start-Ups, Tenacity Beats High Tech", "Date": "2016-04-11", "News": "Supported byBANGALORE, India \u2014 On a hot afternoon in a two-story house here, as dogs barked and auto-rickshaws sputtered outside, a venture capitalist grilled three entrepreneurs.Their start-up, DriveU, provides on-demand drivers for people with cars, differing from Uber or Olacabs, an Indian variant, which offer on-demand taxi services. The three parried questions about the business in a cramped conference room with doors and shutters painted in DriveU\u2019s company colors \u2014 shamrock green.\u201cWhat will it take for someone to come in and replicate this?\u201d asked Srikrishna Ramamoorthy, a partner for Unitus Seed, a venture capital fund started out of Seattle that invests in Indian companies. \u201cCouldn\u2019t the Ola guys come in and do this?\u201d\u201cEssentially they could,\u201d said Ashok Shastry, 25, a co-founder of DriveU, who with his long shorts and spiky hair looked as if he would be more at home in Palo Alto, Calif., than Bangalore. \u201cBut it would be taking away from their focus.\u201d The models for Uber and Ola, he said, are built on the premise that customers do not use their own cars.The venture capitalist persisted. If Uber and Ola were to enter the market, \u201cWhat would your response be?\u201d he asked.Amulmeet Chadha, another founder of DriveU, said, \u201cIt\u2019s about being a cockroach and surviving.\u201dThat kind of tenacity is what attracted Mr. Ramamoorthy to the DriveU team. And it illustrates that until now the Indian start-up market has been more about great execution than cutting-edge technology.\u201cIn Silicon Valley, the general investment thesis for a technology investor tends to be around how strong a company\u2019s underlying technology is and how defensible it will be over time,\u201d Will Poole, Unitus Seed\u2019s co-founder, explained later. \u201cVery rarely does a venture capital investor invest in an operating business that does not have an intellectual property moat.\u201dIn emerging markets like India, however, \u201cyou can build very large and profitable businesses on an operating basis without having a fundamental or long-term technological advantage because you are building in greenfield areas with little or no competition,\u201d he said.Last year was a heady one for venture investing in India; investments rose 61 percent, to $1.9 billion, from $1.2 billion in 2014, according to Venture Intelligence, a Chennai-based company that tracks Indian venture activity. About $95 million of the total represented investments and co-investments in the social impact space by traditional V.C.s and specialist firms like Unitus Seed.Most of the capital flowing into India comes from offshoots of American venture firms. This has led to a generation of homegrown versions of United States companies like Flipkart, the Amazon of India, getting funded.But that may be changing. Speaking in Bangalore last summer, Chamath Palihapitiya, the founder of the Palo Alto-based venture fund now known as Social Capital, said he would like \u201cto put a billion dollars to work in the next 10 years here, plus or minus.\u201dYet he told the crowd of entrepreneurs that the kinds of start-ups he would be investing in were companies that were \u201cso unique and unexplainable in a Harvard Business case to a bunch of Americans.\u201dFor its part, Unitus Seed has found that the plethora of have-nots in India means there are lucrative opportunities to put money into Indian companies that offer a much-needed service at a low price point.Among venture capital investors in India, Unitus Seed, with $23 million in capital, is a speck. It is eclipsed by far larger players like Sequoia Capital, SAIF Partners, Accel Partners, SoftBank of Japan, Alibaba of China and Lee Fixel of the investment firm Tiger Global.But what Unitus Seed lacks in firepower, it makes up for in star power.Its investors include Bill Gates; the billionaire investor Vinod Khosla; the ex-Infosys manager Mohandas Pai; and Diego Piacentini, a top Amazon executive. The drug maker Pfizer and the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation are also investors in Unitus Seed.Broadly speaking, Unitus Seed\u2019s portfolio companies fall into two categories. One is composed of companies that offer affordable products and services in areas like health care, education and financial services to India\u2019s masses, giving them access to services that are otherwise too costly or simply unavailable.Examples in this category are investments in UE LifeSciences, which offers breast scanning for a couple of dollars through its portable iBreastExam device; Welcare Health Systems, which delivers low-cost eye screening; and Hippocampus Learning Centers, which provide affordable kindergarten and after-school facilities.A second category of companies includes those that offer \u201clabor as a service,\u201d thus moving labor from chaotic, more disorganized sectors to more formal employment, and increasing financial and other benefits to low-income workers.DriveU fits into that category, giving its best full-time chauffeurs health insurance, something that is nearly unheard-of in India.In assessing start-ups like DriveU, Unitus Seed first asks if the management team has \u201cwhat it takes to persevere in the world\u2019s most competitive market,\u201d Mr. Poole said.\u201cIf you have a great idea, you have to be able to run really hard and fast,\u201d he added, in order to compete with someone who is as good at the same thing.The approach could pay off soon.The fund has \u201cclosed one transaction for a partial exit \u2014 a very profitable exit for us \u2014 and we have another transaction which is in the final negotiations for a complete exit,\u201d said Mr. Poole, who declined to name the companies.For months, Unitus Seed\u2019s investment team had been wrestling with the threat that Uber and Ola presented to DriveU. Ultimately, it was something Mr. Shastry\u2019s father Ramprasad, who goes by Rahm, said that convinced Unitus Seed\u2019s Mr. Poole and the team that the threat was manageable.Rahm Shastry, who is the company\u2019s chief executive, explained that Uber and Ola drivers have high fixed costs (their cars) and the possibility of earning a higher hourly wage. If Ola and Uber offered on-demand chauffeurs, the drivers would still have high fixed costs but would then earn a lower wage. DriveU chauffeurs earn less than Ola and Uber drivers.DriveU was \u201cgoing to operate in a place that is painful for its competition to copy its business model,\u201d Mr. Poole said. \u201cThat is the fundamental argument of why Ola and Uber are not going to do this right away.\u201dWhen DriveU started in July 2015, it met with some of the bigger venture capital firms like Sequoia and Matrix Partners.Rahm Shastry had become well known after selling a company he had invested in, TaxiForSure, to Olacabs for about $200 million last year.He was also an experienced operator. Until recently, he worked in Silicon Valley, rotating in and out of a succession of technology companies as their chief executive. His specialty was start-ups and turning around companies. (Most entrepreneurs that venture funds encounter in India are starting companies for the first time.)In 2015, after more than three decades in America, Mr. Shastry and his wife, Glenda, a Midwesterner, moved to India at the prodding of Ashok, who had an idea for a start-up: Parking on Demand.One path to fast growth is to drop prices, but Rahm Shastry is adamant about keeping the cost of the ride at 99 rupees an hour (less than $1.50), rather than dropping it to 49 rupees, which was suggested by potential investors. \u201cThe extra 10,000 rupees a month our driver earns he can send his daughter to a better school,\u201d he said, defending his decision.Last month, Unitus Seed announced that it was investing in DriveU.Though it did not disclose the amount, people with knowledge of the matter say DriveU has received $1 million from Unitus Seed and other Silicon Valley angel investors.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Microsoft\u2019s Cloud Business Falls Short of Investors\u2019 Hopes", "Date": "2016-04-21", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 Cloud computing is seen by many investors as Microsoft\u2019s salvation, the growing business that has convinced many there\u2019s a bright future for the company beyond the troubled PC market.But Microsoft\u2019s cloud business didn\u2019t grow quite fast enough during its last quarter to keep investors happy. The company missed Wall Street estimates, though Microsoft executives said it would have beaten them without the impact of unexpectedly high taxes.Weak PC sales are affecting many large tech companies. On Tuesday, Intel, the chip maker that for many years was Microsoft\u2019s inseparable partner in the PC business, reported disappointing earnings and said it would cut about 11 percent of its work force, roughly 12,000 people.The revenue Microsoft gets from licensing Windows to PC makers did better than the market over all, but it still fell 2 percent, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.Yet Microsoft has convinced many investors that it has found a way to adapt to technology changes, in part by vigorously embracing cloud computing. Shares of Microsoft, which is based in Redmond, Wash., are still trading near their price in 1999, their high, even with a 5 percent drop in value Thursday evening.The optimism stems from its success in transitioning legacy software businesses like Office to a cloud business model in which customers subscribe to the applications. There are now 22.2 million subscribers to Office 365, the subscription version of its Office business, up from 12.4 million a year ago.Microsoft has become a credible No. 2 to Amazon in the business of renting computing infrastructure to other companies in Microsoft-owned data centers, a business it calls Azure. \u201cIt remains clear we\u2019re one of two leaders in this market,\u201d Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, said in a call with investors on Thursday.One of the brightest spots at Microsoft during the last quarter was its intelligent cloud business, which includes Azure. Revenue in that group increased 8 percent, excluding the impact of foreign currency, to $6.1 billion.Brad Reback, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, said that the company didn\u2019t do quite as well as he had forecast in its cloud business, but that he believed that area was still performing well.\u201cI think they\u2019re doing a good job of focusing on areas where they can make healthy returns,\u201d Mr. Reback said.To some extent, Microsoft\u2019s success in the cloud has overshadowed its struggles in the mobile market. The company tried for a time to compete in handset sales against Apple and others by acquiring the mobile business of Nokia, but it has greatly scaled back the number of phones it sells and laid off many of the employees in that business after weak sales.Microsoft said its phone revenue fell 46 percent in the quarter, excluding the impact of foreign currency. On the positive side, revenue from Surface, the company\u2019s family of mobile computers, increased 61 percent.Microsoft\u2019s results reflected a $1.5 billion deferral of revenue related to its Windows 10 operating system. Without the impact of that deferral, the company\u2019s earnings were 62 cents a share and revenue was $22.1 billion.Microsoft\u2019s quarterly results were slightly shy of the 64 cents a share that was the average earnings estimate of Wall Street analysts, compiled by Thomson Reuters. The average revenue estimate was $22.09 billion.In an interview, Amy Hood, the chief financial officer, said Microsoft would have exceeded analysts\u2019 estimates without a 4-cent-a-share negative impact from changes in its tax rate.Ms. Hood said the tax rate stemmed from an unexpected shift in Microsoft sales to countries with higher tax rates, along with a shift to revenue from cloud computing, which is taxed at a higher rate than traditional software licenses.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Anna Wintour Adds to Her Body of Film Work", "Date": "2016-04-14", "News": "Supported byOn the RunwayAnna Wintour, editor of American Vogue and artistic director of Cond\u00e9 Nast, continues apace her campaign to shape public perception of fashion. She uses her magazine to do it, of course, but she is also doing it on a different scale through film \u2014 for the big screen and small.The latest example is \u201cThe First Monday in May,\u201d a documentary directed by Andrew Rossi, which opened the Tribeca Film Festival on Wednesday night. (Mr. Rossi also directed \u201cPage One,\u201d a documentary on The New York Times.) The new movie tells the behind-the-scenes story of the 2015 Met Gala, the opening party of the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s annual Costume Institute show, as well as the exhibition it celebrated, \u201cChina Through the Looking Glass.\u201dIt\u2019s an interesting body of work mostly because it covers Ms. Wintour\u2019s highly effective and efficient persona, her magazine, the need to nurture the next big American designer and the importance of fashion to the Met, all of which adds up to what looks like an extended argument that fashion is not the superficial pastime it is so often labeled \u2014 \u201cFirst Monday\u201d being no exception.Mr. Bolton is a charming, authentic presence. And the film is full of fashion world and celebrity cameos: John Galliano, Jean Paul Gaultier, Kate Hudson, the above-mentioned Rihanna. However, none of them can compete with Ms. Wintour onscreen, in part because at this stage, and after all those films (and as her brief appearance in \u201cZoolander II\u201d demonstrated), she has perfected playing her own character.As the director Baz Luhrmann, a consultant on the China show, pointed out in \u201cFirst Monday,\u201d \u201cAnna Wintour\u201d is as much a creation as any dress: one that takes an external stereotype \u2014 Mr. Rossi implicitly links it to the \u201cdragon lady\u201d of clich\u00e9 \u2014 and turns it to her own end.Watching her bend Met curators to her will provides some of the film\u2019s most dramatic moments \u2014 whether telling Harold Koda, the then-Costume Institute chief curator (he has since retired), that he will \u201cfigure out\u201d how to disinvite some guests to the dinner to keep numbers down, or suggesting that the museum will have to close the Temple of Dendur the day before the party, even if that means barring tourists, or dismissing anyone\u2019s need to see a Tiffany pillar, because the space is needed for a table representing money for the museum.(Also: She even wears those dark Chanel sunglasses at home, when she is otherwise in jeans and loafers.)Now the challenge is whether, with this film, she can also convince viewers of the absolute legitimacy of her chosen field as artistic artifact. If so, it may be the real measure of the movie\u2019s success.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Billing by Millionths of Pennies, Cloud Computing\u2019s Giants Take In Billions", "Date": "2016-04-10", "News": "Supported byBitsSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Imagine building an enormous beach resort, maybe the best in the world. Instead of renting the rooms, you charge guests based on the grains of sand they touch. You charge very little per grain, but if they lie on enough of them, it adds up.That is one way to think about what is going on at the world\u2019s biggest cloud-computing companies. Instead of grains of sand, think about computing cycles, the activity that goes on in a computer server that is running software. For a price, think about one line of software code for two one-millionths of a penny.When tolls that tiny are paid often enough, they can make a billion-dollar business. At Amazon Web Services, which pioneered this method late last year, there is no charge for the first million times a customer runs code. Thereafter, A.W.S. charges by the million times, or for the hundreds of milliseconds the computer is used.\u201cThe scale at which we operate allows us to do innovative things,\u201d said Matt Wood, general manager of product strategy at A.W.S. \u201cWhen we get better economies of scale, we\u2019ll use that to our advantage.\u201dThis economics of tiny things demonstrates the global power of the few companies, including Microsoft and Google, that can make fortunes counting this small and often. In other words, you have to be really big to worry about making money off things that are really tiny.Google charges pennies for search ads and spends $9.9 billion annually building out a global computing business. Given enough software, in the realm of millionths of pennies, it could do even better. Good luck to any new entrant without the scale of these tech giants, however, as customers come to expect that sort of cheap metering.Cloud-computing companies are not the only ones focused on the small. Banks, of course, have for years been content taking a sliver of big transactions, so long as there are many of them. Uber, which enables private cars to temporarily become taxis, can monitor drivers and riders to adjust prices and routes, changing the value of things throughout the day. An auto insurance company called Metromile charges customers based on how many miles they drive a year.As tech companies get better at measuring things, other businesses can pick up on the techniques, and the fine counting at the big clouds augurs for more precise measurements and pricing everywhere. Mitch Hedberg\u2019s joke about rice being a good meal when you are hungry for 2,000 of something may turn out to be a prophecy.A.W.S. was an early leader in public cloud computing, or renting access to computing equipment or software over an Internet connection. It started in 2006 as a barely noted fluke by Amazon. It now has over two million computer servers and a million customers, including Netflix, Shell and Brooks Brothers.The per-millionth pricing began last November, in the A.W.S. product Lambda. Lambda runs a customer\u2019s line of code in response to a request, like looking up a ZIP code when given an address. Customers never rent servers, but pay for the moments of computing.Microsoft last month announced that it would have its own \u201cserverless\u201d product. Google has something similar in early release, which is likely to be a product by the third quarter of this year.Microsoft is even trying to do A.W.S. one better by microslicing the cost to rent some of its software licenses into the minutes of actual use. \u201cWe\u2019re renting the sand and charging for the sun\u2019s UV rays that hit you,\u201d said Scott Guthrie, who runs Microsoft\u2019s cloud.For the big clouds, microslicing is also a way of coping with a tough task: Customers have to feel like they can rent all the computing they want, and the providers must always run at near full capacity. If someone is using cycles, and not whole machines, more people can be packed in.\u201cThe secret to cloud economics is utilization \u2014 every minute unsold is money you don\u2019t get back,\u201d said Greg DeMichillie, the head of product for Google\u2019s cloud. \u201cThere are very few of us who can work at this scale.\u201dLike any important new tech trend, the microsliced, serverless model is already attracting investors and start-ups eager to work in the new world \u2014 and in this case, wary of what the giants will do next.An Oakland, Calif., company called Serverless makes software that other engineers can use to develop products for computing in Lambda and its ilk. \u201cWe think this could be the focal point of A.W.S., even though I have no idea how they make money charging this little,\u201d said Austen Collins, the founder of Serverless.One way they make money is by adding on other products and servers. So does Mr. Collins think A.W.S. could thwart his business? \u201cIt\u2019s a mistake to think Amazon won\u2019t be in everything,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t say, \u2018What if Amazon does it?\u2019 We assume they will, and try to do something a little better and faster.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It\u2019s awkward and clumsy and can lead to the uncomfortable gestation of a small human.But if love between two adults is a mess, consider what happens when you throw in a couple of dependents who do not have control of their excretory functions. This is where the equally sweet and filthy Season 2, appearing Friday on Amazon Prime, finds the couple.Specifically, it finds them in bed, a couple of years later, she hugely pregnant, he trying to coax her into a quickie. \u201cMy old-lady bra turns you on?\u201d she asks.\u201cIt\u2019s like being in bed with one of my aunt\u2019s friends,\u201d he says. \u201cIt feels dirty and wrong.\u201dIt may be early for them to be having another baby.

Life will chuck more problems at you anyway, so what the hell, might as well throw another on the pile.Where the first season was frank about the physical pitfalls of pregnancy, the second gets real about early parenting, which is 90 percent about the management of bodily discharges. (Along with diaper humor, the show breaks new ground in lactation slapstick.) Meanwhile, Sharon\u2019s father (Gary Lilburn) is beginning to show signs of dementia, and Rob\u2019s self-involved mother (Carrie Fisher) has arrived for an extended and unhelpful visit.Rob continues to hate his job making ads for a comically evil pharmaceutical firm.

Ms. Horgan is a comic actress, while Mr. Delaney is a comedian who happens to be acting, but they have a natural rapport.

Even at that, some subplots feel extraneous, and like the first season, the second ends on a dissonant cliffhanger.But \u201cCatastrophe\u201d has not become a dramedy about parenting. It\u2019s a comedy about being parents, weathering the emotional and medical terrors that come with responsibility for small lives, yet remaining partners, lovers, allies.On one of the rare occasions when someone gives Rob and Sharon useful advice, Sharon\u2019s mother (Frances Tomelty) tells them that, when she and her husband had kids, \u201cWe decided that we had to put our love for each other above everything else, because we were man and wife before we were mother and father.\u201dThey agree that she\u2019s out of her mind.

{"Headline": "\u2018Alibaba: The House That Jack Ma Built,\u2019 by Duncan Clark", "Date": "2016-04-15", "News": "Supported byWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.The personal-computer and Internet revolution that began in the late 20th century eventually took over most of the world, but its most prominent players \u2014 Amazon, Apple, eBay, Google, Microsoft \u2014 were distinctly American. In the 21st century, it is not impossible to imagine an Internet revolution beginning in China.That possibility is, as with so many aspects of China, a function of scale. Alibaba, the sprawling Chinese digital marketplace, is already by some measures larger than Amazon. Its payment tool Alipay alone accounts for one-third of the $2.5 trillion global online payments market. The dizzying rise of the company is a crucial part of China\u2019s ascension as a global economic power, and if you\u2019ve never heard of the company, rest assured that you will. When the Alibaba founder Jack Ma appeared onstage last year at a summit in Manila with Barack Obama, Obama interviewed him.We often think of successful tech C.E.O.s climbing from the nerdy ranks of tinkering programmers, like Bill Gates, but as \u201cAlibaba,\u201d Duncan Clark\u2019s engaging biography explains, Ma\u2019s humble origins gave no clue to his future \u2014 then again, in 1970s China, the very idea of a homegrown technology business executive was inconceivable. Born in 1964 to a photographer and a factory worker, Ma grew up a mediocre student in the city of Hangzhou. About the only thing that set Ma apart was learning English, which he would practice by speaking to tourists passing through his hometown. One of these tourists, a vacationing Australian Communist, became a generous benefactor who even helped buy a house for young Ma and his wife.After a stint teaching English, Ma began running a tiny translation business, focused on Chinese companies \u2014 beginning to flourish under Deng Xiaoping \u2014 seeking to do business with the West. During his first visit to the United States in the mid-90s, a friend in Seattle logged Ma onto the Internet, and it occurred to him that listing Chinese companies online might be a good idea.If you think early American web pioneers had a tough time persuading investors and consumers to embrace the scary new world of e-commerce, imagine the challenge Ma\u2019s start-up faced: Most of China had no Internet, so his early clients were handing him thousands of dollars to create web services they themselves could not see. \u201cI was treated like a con man for three years,\u201d Ma said.Soon enough, though, his clients answered their phones to find curious Western customers on the line. In the late \u201990s, as the Chinese government began a delicate program of encouraging Internet growth without giving up state control, Ma\u2019s \u201cChina Pages\u201d and several other Chinese start-ups began to attract the attention of outside investors. That money, some of which came from the Japanese billionaire Masayosha Son, was rocket fuel for what became Alibaba, which has a massive shipping-logistics arm on top of its e-commerce services. When Alibaba went public in 2014, the $25 billion it raised made it the largest I.P.O. in world history (the next two, incidentally, were Chinese state-controlled enterprises).Clark is a China-based investment adviser and onetime consultant to Alibaba; he notes that his failure to exercise stock options he was given as payment became a $30-million mistake. The access he got to the company pushes his breezy account more toward the business than to Ma\u2019s personality. Still, Ma emerges as an unpretentious, self-deprecating leader, fond of quoting martial arts novels and \u201cForrest Gump.\u201d Yet he is clearly also shrewd and extremely driven. And his company has acquired enough wealth to begin to reshape the Western business world; he has announced a Netflix-style video streaming service and now has a movie division that invests in Hollywood blockbusters. The Chinese government\u2019s control over the Internet may still make political dissent difficult, but Ma and some others have demonstrated that there are few limits to building world-beating companies.James Ledbetter is the editor of Inc.

{"Headline": "Fintech Firms Are Taking On the Big Banks, but Can They Win?", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported byDealBookBanking has long been viewed as one of the last traditional, old-school, stuck-in-the-past industries. When you think of banking, you might still think of wood-paneled walls and pinstripe suits.That impression may increasingly be misguided.If you spend more than 15 minutes with any senior executive of a large bank these days, it is almost impossible not to hear the phrase \u201cfintech\u201d uttered. It is usually spoken with a sense of optimism, but sometimes with a sense of dread.\u201cFintech,\u201d of course, is short for financial technology, a catchall for a near-revolution of new technologies aimed at upending parts of the financial world, including payments, wealth management, lending, insurance and currency.The fintech phrase itself is actually not new \u2014 it dates to the late 1980s and early 1990s \u2014 though it has taken on a heightened sense of importance and urgency now that it has been embraced by Silicon Valley as the new new thing. An estimated $19 billion of investment poured into the fintech bucket last year, according to Citigroup, up from just $1.8 billion five years earlier.\u201cThe real threat to banks is not from Washington or Brussels but from start-ups all over the country creating interesting fintech start-ups that are chipping away at key parts of their franchise,\u201d said Steve Case, a founder of AOL and an entrepreneur with investments in several fintech businesses, who just wrote a book about the future, \u201cThe Third Wave.\u201dThe promise of all these new technologies is to fundamentally disrupt the biggest players in finance. Companies like Stripe, a payments company, hope to become replacements for PayPal and others. Lending Club wants to make getting a loan cheaper and easier. Wealthfront wants to advise you and manage your money from your phone. And, of course, Bitcoin and its many derivatives wants to be the new gold, or better yet, digital cash.If they succeed, Wall Street as we know it may become an outpost of Palo Alto. According to a Citigroup report last week, fintech may be on the cusp of an \u201cUber moment,\u201d as Antony Jenkins, the former chief executive of Barclays, predicted last year. Some 800,000 people will have lost their jobs at financial services companies to some of the newly dreamed up software in a decade, the report said. \u201cRoughly 60 to 70 percent of retail banking employees are doing manual-processing-driven jobs,\u201d the report explained. \u201cIf all the current manual processing can be replaced by automation, these jobs can disappear or evolve.\u201dThe ripple effects are enormous: Consider not just the employees but the impact on commercial real estate, for example, if banks shut their coveted branches on the corners in major cities.Others are less convinced. Wall Street denizens like the banking investor J. Christopher Flowers have declared that the fintech frenzy is simply that: hype that defies common sense and will leave a trail of failed companies in its wake.A third view may have the highest likelihood of coming true: The big banks, so powerful and yet so anxious about the possibility of being disrupted by the upstarts, will gobble them all up in a spate of mergers and acquisitions that puts the disrupters squarely inside the institutions they were supposed to overtake.Witness JPMorgan Chase\u2019s recent alliance with OnDeck, an online lending platform for small businesses. Rather than build the technology to squash OnDeck or, worse, let OnDeck\u2019s runaway growth continue unchecked, JPMorgan became OnDeck\u2019s \u201cpartner.\u201d It has been couched as an early joint venture. But inside JPMorgan, it\u2019s considered an experiment, a way to gather information and get educated about the nascent fintech lending space, and yes \u2014 assuming all goes well \u2014 possibly to acquire the company or one of its rivals.That\u2019s not to say OnDeck will be a willing seller, but given the money sloshing around in the financial services industry, it\u2019s hard to believe that banks won\u2019t be willing to pay big premiums. After all, even the most successful fintech companies are still tiny. OnDeck is worth about $500 million; JPMorgan\u2019s market value is $214 billion.Indeed, the valuations of fintech companies have recently fallen like those of other private Silicon Valley companies. That has led to speculation about a new round of investment and deal making.\u201cI\u2019m starting to look at opportunities outside,\u201d Patrick Gauthier, vice president of Amazon Payments, said to CNBC this week at a conference in Europe about the prospect of making acquisitions. \u201cAfter a number of years where fintech has been a little bit ahead of itself in terms of valuations, things have come back to earth.\u201dThe crucial question for the fintech industry is whether these businesses can grow fast enough while maintaining a disciplined approach and navigating the thicket of regulatory hurdles that very likely will stand in the way. Silicon Valley has long shunned regulated industries, but having conquered so much of the landscape in other industries, it is now turning to finance.The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency recently said it thought a new regulatory framework needed to be created to help foster innovation among fintech companies while ensuring compliance.Given that the 2008 financial crisis is still so fresh, it is hard to see the rules loosening too much.Which perhaps may be the most compelling reason for why there is probably going to be a wave of deals among these companies soon. With the cost of compliance so high and many large institutions already having built an enormous compliance infrastructure \u2014 the big banks now employ thousands of lawyers \u2014 it will only make sense for smaller upstarts to end up as part of a bigger company.\u201cSome banks will be smart and figure out how to partner with some of these entrepreneurs or acquire some of these companies or do joint ventures, but if they just think it\u2019s going to stay the way it is, they will be surprised,\u201d Mr. Case added.Advertisement"}

The shift reflects a reprioritization of his time from managing the firm to grooming the next generation of leaders.While Mr. Doerr will continue to focus on the investments that he has already made and the board seats he currently holds, he is no longer responsible for the success of new investments made out of new funds.It\u2019s unclear who will replace Mr. Doerr as the person who oversees Kleiner Perkins, a 45-year-old investment firm that helped put the venture industry on the map and made Silicon Valley the center of the technology start-up world. Mr. Doerr raised the profile of the firm in the late 1990s and in the early 2000s with his hugely profitable investments in Amazon and Google.In his blog post, Mr. Doerr said his management duties will be split for now among several Kleiner partners \u2014 Ted Schlein, Beth Seidenberg and Mary Meeker. Mr. Doerr also highlighted the firm\u2019s younger generation, including Mike Abbott, Eric Feng, Wen Hsieh and Mood Rowghani.At the same time that Kleiner Perkins was focused on clean technology, rival firms including Accel Partners and Greylock Partners were betting on new Internet companies including Facebook, which ended up proving to be hugely successful. Kleiner Perkins has since de-emphasized its investing in green technology and has refocused on tech investments.Mr. Doerr did not refer to the case in his blog post.\u201cThe venture industry is changing all the time,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe must keep changing to better compete and serve entrepreneurs.\u201dAn article on April 1 about a changing of the guard at the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers described incorrectly a change in the role of John Doerr, who has been its day-to-day manager and will become its chairman. Mr. Doerr will continue to invest in new start-ups; it is not the case that he will not make such investments. However, he will no longer have fiduciary responsibility for the success of those investments.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Chris Hardwick, King of the Nerds, Is Expanding His Empire", "Date": "2016-04-07", "News": "Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 It was a typical Tuesday for Chris Hardwick, the excitable ringmaster of nerd culture.Most people know him as the host of AMC\u2019s \u201cTalking Dead,\u201d which has 6.5 million viewers each week, but on this March day the stand-up comedian, podcast pioneer and digital media entrepreneur was devoting a 16-hour stint to the geekier outposts of his empire. In the writers\u2019 room at \u201c@Midnight,\u201d the Comedy Central game show in which he and guest comedians riff on Internet culture, Mr. Hardwick cracked jokes about the just-announced return of Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones. Across the studio lot, he recorded his weekly Nerdist podcast with the comedian and musician Reggie Watts, confessing that weed-induced paranoia keeps him from smoking pot. And late in the evening, he delivered new material about make-out burps, temptress nannies and Linux-based operating systems at the stand-up comedy workshop he hosts in the back of a Hollywood comics store.\u201cI\u2019ve just channeled all that energy that went into drinking into time-management skills,\u201d said Mr. Hardwick, 44, of his packed-to-the-gills schedule (he\u2019s been sober for nearly 13 years).After riding high in the 1990s as a co-host of MTV\u2019s dating show, \u201cSingled Out,\u201d only to see his career sputter for the next decade, he decided to embrace his obsessions with zombies, superheroes, video games and tech. And with his instinctive understanding of connecting with fans over social media, he\u2019s transformed those once-niche interests into an ever-growing kingdom.In the process, he\u2019s become the model of an entertainment brand for a multiscreen generation, seeding every sort of outlet and venue (no matter how small) with a constant barrage of fanboy content. Besides the millions who watch him each week on \u201cTalking Dead\u201d after every episode of \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d (and starting on Sunday, April 10, \u201cFear the Walking Dead\u201d), 5.5 million people download his Nerdist podcast each month, while the Nerdist website draws close to 10 million visitors. He has 2.8 million followers on Twitter and another million on Instagram. Then there\u2019s his embrace of Snapchat, Periscope, Facebook Live and Twitch. As nerd culture has become more mainstream, he is its attractive, welcoming emissary.And later this year, he will try to cross over to network television when he hosts an NBC trivia game show called \u201cThe Wall.\u201d\u201cChris has been able to build a brand because he is genuine, and authentic,\u201d said Thomas Tull, the chief executive of Legendary Entertainment, the company behind \u201cJurassic World\u201d and the Christopher Nolan Batman trilogy. (It bought Nerdist Industries in 2012 and in turn was purchased in January by a Chinese conglomerate for $3.5 billion.) \u201cIn a world with plenty of white noise, he cuts through because he loves what he does, and the fans sense that.\u201dOf course, the building of a media empire comes with its share of possible pitfalls. If Mr. Hardwick gets stretched so thin he can\u2019t keep up with the latest twists in the Marvel Universe or the time-jumps of Doctor Who, his bond with the audience could fray. After all, his fans know a real nerd when they see one. Here\u2019s what it was like to follow him around for a week.\u201cNothing makes me hotter than dividing the circumference of a circle by its diameter,\u201d Mr. Hardwick said. \u201cIt\u2019s the only thing that can bring me to cli-math.\u201d (Puns, preferably drenched in sexual innuendo, are a favorite of Mr. Hardwick\u2019s.) \u201cThat, and reciting pi to the one-hundredth decimal.\u201dDuring rehearsal that afternoon, Mr. Hardwick suddenly splayed his fingers over his closed eyes and reeled off, rapid fire, pi to more than 100 places.The show\u2019s writers and producers, jaded sorts, began to clap. A \u201cwow\u201d was even heard.\u201cYou\u2019ve always said you were a nerd, but I didn\u2019t believe it till now,\u201d said Josh McDermitt, who plays the mullet-sporting Eugene on \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d when the host repeated the trick on the show.Mr. Hardwick was one of those chess club kids who actually got stuffed in a garbage can. Nine pounds of Dungeons & Dragons dice live in a vase in his \u201c@Midnight\u201d dressing room. And his love of the British science-fiction show \u201cDoctor Who\u201d is so intense that half of the cake at his August wedding (to the actress and publishing heiress Lydia Hearst) will be a re-creation of the Tardis, the time machine masquerading as a police call box.But for the first chunk of Mr. Hardwick\u2019s career, such animating interests had little connection to the jobs he filled. His first break came in 1995, when he, along with Jenny McCarthy, was chosen to host \u201cSingled Out.\u201dThe show lasted three years, and Mr. Hardwick\u2019s image in Hollywood seemed cemented: the snarky comedian trafficking in generic pop-culture jokes. He filmed a string of unsuccessful pilots, often as the host of a dating show. There were auditions for lots of Jack Black-type roles on sitcoms, at least until he quit drinking and got in shape. (In his self-help book, \u201cThe Nerdist Way,\u201d Mr. Hardwick jokes that through his dissolute 20s \u201cI was consuming a baby elephant\u2019s weight in alcohol every day.\u201d) And the smattering of TV and movie appearances (like \u201cZoey 101,\u201d \u201cHouse of a Thousand Corpses\u201d) did little to provide professional fulfillment.It all came to a head in 2007. He couldn\u2019t get work, his stand-up career was going nowhere, and he owned a house he could barely afford. \u201cEarly one morning, I just had this moment of clarity: I need to just do the things I love,\u201d he said. \u201cAt least I\u2019ll be happy.\u201dEmbracing his inner nerd, Mr. Hardwick immediately got himself a job hosting \u201cWired Science\u201d on PBS. Next came a gadget reviewer gig on G4\u2019s \u201cAttack of the Show,\u201d which led to \u201cWeb Soup.\u201d His zombie expertise, and a connection with a top AMC executive from his MTV days, helped him land \u201cTalking Dead\u201d in 2011, and \u201c@Midnight\u201d followed in 2013. All the while, the Nerdist blog he began in 2008 grew into a full-fledged digital media company, with a news website, nearly 50 podcasts, a YouTube channel and even an improv and sketch comedy academy.That Mr. Hardwick now has a career that allows him to hang out with the likes of Weird Al Yankovic never ceases to amaze him: \u201cSo much of my life are moments my 12-year-old self wouldn\u2019t be able to fully process.\u201d\u201cHow\u2019s everyone feeling?\u201d Mr. Hardwick asked as he convened what he calls his \u201cweekly ritualistic therapy session.\u201dOn display was what makes Mr. Hardwick an in-demand host (and moderator for Comic-Con panels): his natural rapport with his guests. Stand-up comedians don\u2019t always make the best television hosts. They\u2019re typically both the author and executor of their material, not collaborators, and their interviewing skills often leave much to be desired.Mr. Hardwick is a good listener, and his deep familiarity with his guests\u2019 work allows him to be quick on his feet. \u201cHe is very adept at making his guests funnier,\u201d said Kent Alterman, who\u2019s the president of original programming at Comedy Central. He also likes to hang out with them after the show. After tapings of \u201cTalking Dead,\u201d he revels in taking his guests down into the bowels of CBS Television City so they can (surreptitiously) spin the wheel from \u201cThe Price Is Right.\u201dMr. Hardwick, who was glued to game shows in his youth like \u201cMatch Game\u201d and \u201cJoker\u2019s Wild,\u201d will get to host his first non-comic one when NBC airs the LeBron James-produced \u201cThe Wall.\u201d Two-person teams \u2014 chosen for their inspiring back stories \u2014 will answer trivia questions as a ball is dropped down a giant wall lined with slots marked with monetary values.But today\u2019s host \u2014 or any rising entertainment personality, really \u2014 can\u2019t just call it a day when the TV taping is done.So Mr. Hardwick quickly changed out of his Theory suit, plopped down on the couch with his laptop and opened his iPhone to a Facebook video app. It was time for a Facebook Live chat with \u201cTalking Dead\u201d fans.\u201cThis is basically \u2018Talking Talking Dead,\u2019\u201d Mr. Hardwick said.Though he mentioned he\u2019d be doing the session at the end of \u201cTalking Dead,\u201d all told it drew more than 110,000 viewers and 23,000 comments.The imperatives of being an entertainment personality now require more than unmediated conversations with the audience. There has to be new content, tailored to the different social-media platforms.At the SXSW festival last month in Austin, Tex., Mr. Hardwick filmed an episode of \u201c@Midnight\u201d that appeared only on Periscope, Twitter\u2019s live streaming video project. There\u2019s also a weekly \u201c@Midnight\u201d show for Snapchat called \u201cStupid Points.\u201d\u201cWe had it so easy for so long because we only ever had to focus on one platform,\u201d Mr. Hardwick said. \u201cBut particularly in television, you\u2019ve got to chase the audience a bit.\u201dIn the back of Meltdown Comics, on a forlorn stretch of Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, Mr. Hardwick popped onto the stage of the Nerdist Showroom just past 9 p.m. on Tuesday night. Beta Test, a regular comedy workshop he runs for himself and his comedian pals, was now in session.Mr. Hardwick loves mixing it up with the audience at his comedy gigs. Greeting the folks individually in the first row, he riffed rapid-fire about their occupations. To the woman who said she was on sabbatical: \u201cThat\u2019s a very romantic term for unemployed. It makes it sound like it was your choice.\u201dBut Mr. Hardwick\u2019s barbs are directed more at himself than at the audience. It\u2019s all up for discussion \u2014 his anxiety, his love life \u2014 as his comedy has become much more personal in recent years. The Funcomfortable Tour, which culminated in January with two shows at the Palace of Fine Arts Theater in San Francisco (filmed for a Comedy Central special on April 30), dealt with his most cringe-inducing moments.\u201cSome of the things that I actually admit on stage are kind of odd when I think about it,\u201d Mr. Hardwick said.Like losing his virginity to a blowup doll in high school.Steve Martin and Joan Rivers were among Mr. Hardwick\u2019s comedy gods growing up. Raising him in Memphis, his parents \u2014 his father a professional bowler and his mother a real estate agent \u2014 placed no restrictions on what he could watch or listen to, even buying him Mr. Martin\u2019s albums. When his father took him along to tournaments in Las Vegas, he remembers seeing Ms. Rivers in concert. He wasn\u2019t yet 10.Mr. Hardwick\u2019s comedy, though, is more nakedly autobiographical than theirs \u2014 the death of his father in 2013 runs like a backbone through the \u201cFuncomfortable\u201d special. He comes across to his fans as one of them, even if he is marrying Ms. Hearst and just moved into an $11 million home with breathtaking views of the city. (Mr. Hardwick\u2019s design sense \u2014 he calls it \u201cVictorian gentleman serial killer\u201d \u2014 meshes with Ms. Hearst\u2019s; she owns a creepy wheelchair straight out of \u201cThe Changeling.\u201d)Mr. Hardwick\u2019s stand-up career has him jetting around the country nearly every weekend for a gig. And those 50 dates don\u2019t include his drop-in sets at clubs in Los Angeles. \u201cIf you sat next to Chris on an airplane and asked him what he did for a living, he would say he was a stand-up comedian,\u201d said his manager, Alex Murray, of Brillstein Entertainment Partners.Mr. Hardwick\u2019s commitments add up to one seriously crazed schedule. One that could damage, or derail, a painstakingly built career built on authenticity. If he doesn\u2019t know as much as his fans (or more) about the their favorite TV shows, movies, comics and other hallmarks of geek culture, he could be pegged as a poser \u2014 or \u201ca fake nerd\u201d as some of his online critics put it \u2014 who isn\u2019t worthy of their attention.Mr. Hardwick is aware of the problem. He\u2019s cut back on the number of Nerdist podcasts he records each week, from three to one. He doesn\u2019t play the time-sucking video games he dearly loves much anymore. And he insists he turns down plenty of projects.\u201cI\u2019m not so psychotic that I don\u2019t know how to say no to things,\u201d he said.Earlier on Tuesday, Mr. Hardwick arrived just before 6 p.m. at the offices of Funny or Die, the humor website and production company that boasts Will Ferrell and the director Adam McKay among its co-founders. It was the second official gathering of Spitball, a previously unannounced venture that aims to offer fledgling companies media consulting and comedic video-production services.It was not your typical business meeting. Yes, there may have been cash-flow projections displayed on a screen, and buzzwords like \u201cpublic facing\u201d bandied about. But there were also tasteless jokes about colonoscopies.Diversifying outside the entertainment world is the motivation for Mr. Hardwick and his partners, which include Funny or Die. The pitch: The people behind Spitball understand both comedy and social media and how to combine the two to build a brand. \u201cThe advantage we have is we know how to talk to people,\u201d Mr. Hardwick said.Spitball is but one part of Mr. Hardwick\u2019s plan to build his off-camera career.His latest contract with Comedy Central calls for him to be a digital guru of sorts for the network. \u201cIt\u2019s great for us to tap into his brain,\u201d said the network\u2019s Mr. Alterman.And he\u2019s getting into TV production himself, through Nerdist Industries.

{"Headline": "European Union Calls for Big Companies to Disclose More Tax Data", "Date": "2016-04-12", "News": "Supported byBRUSSELS \u2014 European Union officials on Tuesday waded into the fight against international tax dodging, calling for the world\u2019s biggest companies to disclose more data about their tax arrangements with the bloc\u2019s member governments and to share information about offshore havens where they shelter money.A long political fight may lie ahead for the proposals to become law. The proposed rules will very likely meet resistance from some business groups and possibly even European governments that use tax inducements to attract companies and jobs.And the authorities in popular tax havens like the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands or the Channel Islands off Britain, might lobby to avoid being labeled \u201ctax jurisdictions which do not respect international tax good governance standards\u201d \u2014 as a European Union memo on the proposed rules stated, without naming any names. Deciding which jurisdictions end up on the European Union\u2019s blacklist could prove diplomatically sensitive.\u201cDrafting these lists, and pulling up the right names for tax havens, is a very political process, that\u2019s clear,\u201d said Guntram B. Wolff, the director of Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. \u201cBut the commission toughened up since the release of the Panama Papers, partly as the mood shifted and partly because of backing from France and Germany.\u201dCommission officials emphasized on Tuesday that no decisions had been made about which countries might be included on the blacklist. And they promised to hold open discussions with any country under scrutiny.But in a news conference on Tuesday in Strasbourg, France, Jonathan Hill, the European commissioner for financial services, hinted at one country that could receive a close look. \u201cIf large multinationals active in Europe are paying tax in somewhere like Panama, to take one example,\u201d Mr. Hill said, \u201cthey\u2019d need to make that public.\u201dRay Smith, a lawyer in London with Clyde & Company who advises large companies on their tax affairs, said the Panama Papers scandal had \u201cadded grist to the mill of E.U. politicians calling for urgent reform.\u201dBut he also urged caution. \u201cThe concern is, as with any populist reforms, that any new rules made in haste may overlook the fact that low-tax jurisdictions often play an important and legitimate role,\u201d Mr. Smith said.The proposals might also be brandished by groups in favor of Britain\u2019s leaving the European Union as evidence of \u201cthe strain of ever increasing E.U. regulation,\u201d he said.There also was immediate opposition to the proposals from one major lobbying group for European businesses, which said the initiative went too far by usurping the role of the national tax authorities and by forcing companies to reveal too much.The proposals would make the European Union \u201ca lone front-runner in terms of public disclosure\u201d and they \u201crisk undermining our attractiveness as a location for investment, particularly from overseas,\u201d said Markus J. Breyer, the director general for BusinessEurope in Brussels.To become law, the rules need the approval of the European Parliament and a majority of European Union governments. The rules would apply only to multinational companies with global revenue greater than 750 million euros a year, or about $855 million. That would include an estimated 6,000 companies doing business in Europe.Rather than establishing a central registry, the proposal would leave it to the bloc\u2019s member states to enforce rules requiring companies to publish tax information on their corporate websites.The information, which would be broken down by country, would include the number of employees; net revenue, including money exchanged between third parties and between business units of a group; profit before tax; and income tax due and paid each year.High levels of accumulated earnings, such as profits that are not distributed but are held in certain countries, could signal attempts to avoid taxes.The European Commission chose not to require the public releases of even more information after business groups warned against putting companies with European operations at a competitive disadvantage compared to other parts of the world.But for some advocates of tax overhauls, the rules do not go far enough because companies would mostly be allowed to publish aggregated data about their payments outside the European Union.\u201cWe still won\u2019t know anything about the activities, tax payments and potential tax agreements by multinationals across most of the world,\u201d said Elena Gaita, a policy officer in Brussels for Transparency International, which monitors corruption. \u201cAnother problem is that this environment is highly competitive,\u201d she said, \u201cso one country may not be a tax haven today but might become one tomorrow.\u201dBut the commission said the information would be sufficient to shame the companies that shift their profits mainly for tax purposes and would force them to consider changing their business practices.The overall transparency would \u201chelp the public see whether companies are acting in the best long-term interests of their shareholders from a reputational point of view,\u201d Mr. Hill said at the news conference.The European Union accelerated its efforts to curb tax avoidance after the financial crisis, which forced many governments to adopt austerity budgets, reduce public services and raise nominal tax rates.Critics contend that because tax engineering by big corporations allowed some multinationals to skirt taxes, small businesses and individual citizens bore the brunt of the impact. Politicians and policy makers sensitive to that criticism have called for banks and big corporations to pay more tax and to be less secretive about where their money goes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Drones Marshaled to Drop Lifesaving Supplies Over Rwandan Terrain", "Date": "2016-04-04", "News": "Supported byHALF MOON BAY, Calif. \u2014 From a bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean, a loud pop signals the catapult launch of a small fixed-wing drone that is designed to carry medical supplies to remote locations almost 40 miles away.\u201cThe concept of drone ports is something that a very small decision-making unit in the country decided they were going to do,\u201d said Michael Fairbanks, a member of the Rwandan president Paul Kagame\u2019s presidential advisory council. \u201cIt took a very short time. It\u2019s something that America could learn from.\u201d\u201cRwanda has a vision to become a technology hub for East Africa and ultimately the whole continent of Africa,\u201d said William Hetzler, a founder of Zipline, which is based in this seaside town. \u201cProjects like ours fit very well with that strategy.\u201dThe new drone system will initially be capable of making 50 to 150 daily deliveries of blood and emergency medicine to Rwanda\u2019s 21 transfusing facilities, mostly in hospitals and clinics in the western half of the nation.The drone system is based on a fleet of 15 small aircraft, each with twin electric motors, a 3.5-pound payload and an almost eight-foot wingspan. The system\u2019s speed makes it possible to maintain a \u201ccold chain\u201d \u2014 essentially a temperature-controlled supply chain needed to provide blood and vaccines \u2014 which is often not practical to establish in developing countries.The Zipline drones will use GPS receivers to navigate and communicate via the Rwandan cellular network. They will be able to fly in rough weather conditions, enduring winds up to 30 miles per hour.When they reach the hospitals, they will not land but will drop small packages from very low altitudes. The supplies will fall to earth suspended by simple paper parachutes. The planes will then return to a home base, where they will be prepared for a new mission by swapping in a new battery and snapping in a new flight plan stored in a SIM card.\u201cThis is the new face of the aerospace industry,\u201d said Jay Gundlach, president of FlightHouse Engineering, an Oregon-based aviation consulting firm. \u201cEstablished unmanned aircraft companies should learn from Zipline\u2019s agile and innovative culture.\u201dLike Zipline, others are trying to solve the problem of the autonomous distribution of medical supplies. Many other systems being developed, however, are based on less-efficient multicopter or quadcopter designs that have shorter range and less ability to fly in all-weather situations.Zipline began in 2014 when two of its founders, Keller Rinaudo and Mr. Hetzler, visited a young public health worker in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The worker had created a text-messaging system that enabled hospital workers to urgently request medical supplies in life-or-death situations.But Mr. Rinaudo said he realized that what he was looking at was a long list of death sentences. Today in many places worldwide, attempts are made to deliver medical supplies by motorcycle or pickup truck over roads that are frequently impassable.The public health worker \u201cshowed me the database that had entries every time someone texted, and it was thousands of names long,\u201d Mr. Rinaudo said. \u201cIt was mostly infants, and there was no response. The supply chain had no way of taking them into account.\u201dMr. Rinaudo and Mr. Hetzler set about to find an airborne alternative to automate a supply chain. They met Keenan Wyrobek, a Stanford-trained roboticist who was instrumental in the design of the PR1 robot, a pioneering general purpose mobile robot with arms, and later the more advanced PR2 robot developed by Willow Garage.The three technologists assembled an engineering team with aerospace industry experience, attracting talent from Space X, Aurora Flight Sciences, Boeing and Lockheed Martin, as well as Stanford and Google. The start-up has raised $18 million from investors including Sequoia Capital, GV (formerly Google Ventures), SV Angel, Subtraction Capital, Stanford University and individuals including Jerry Yang, a founder of Yahoo, and Paul Allen, a founder of Microsoft.Mr. Hetzler said that by placing engineers who have consumer electronics expertise in close collaboration with roboticists and aerospace engineers, it had been possible to rapidly build a highly automated system that would be operated by a staff of five to eight.In February, Zipline signed a contract with the Rwandan government to begin operating the drone service this summer. A small team will be based in a city near the Rwandan capital of Kigali to oversee the service.\u201cI always think of Peter Thiel, the venture capitalist, who said, \u2018They promised us flying cars and all we got was 140 characters,\u2019\u201d said Paul Willard, a former Boeing aerodynamics engineer who is now an investor in Zipline, referring to the social media service Twitter. \u201cThis feels a little bit more like flying cars.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "With Gas Station\u2019s Closing, a Fuel Desert Expands in Manhattan", "Date": "2016-04-15", "News": "Supported byThe gas station at the corner of Lafayette and East Houston Streets in SoHo is an industrial outpost in a Manhattan neighborhood of luxury lofts and even more luxurious shopping. It has existed on the corner for decades \u2014 first as Gaseteria, later as BP, but nearly always selling gas. For cabdrivers, it was a way station in an unruly city, where they could fill up, use the restroom, or kneel for afternoon prayers on one of the communal kilims the owner let them keep stowed beside the convenience mart.It closed on Thursday, to be replaced by a glass-and-steel luxury office building, turning some four square miles at the southern end of the borough into a gasoline desert. Today, the only reminder that this stretch of SoHo was once a forest of filling stations known as Gasoline Alley is a coffee shop of the same name that sells single-origin coffee beans from Burundi.The closing of the inelegant station, its shabby convenience store invariably full of drivers dancing in place while waiting in line for the restroom, has a familiar feeling. As New York City\u2019s molten property values have made selling off a parcel of land often more profitable than operating the grocery, hardware store or gas station sitting on it, the gas station\u2019s passing appears to be the latest example of a common trope. And while Amazon and FreshDirect may fill the hole when the corner store goes condo, there is no doubt it is getting harder in Manhattan to get many of the basics that make life livable.What happens now if you are downtown and the needle is on E?\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be easy for the drivers, and the people who are using this facility,\u201d Sunkanmi Alaka, a cabdriver, said as he waited for the restroom a few days before the station closed. \u201cYou\u2019re going to travel miles before you see a gas station.\u201dToday there is not a single operating gas station left on the city\u2019s East Side from the southern tip of the island to 23rd Street, a chunk of Manhattan that includes some of the most highly trafficked portions of the city, like the truck-packed transverses between the bridges to the east and Holland Tunnel to the west, and the taxi-filled corridors of Wall Street and NoHo. With the exception of a small station in the West Village, the West Side is similarly parched.In Manhattan, there are 50 gas stations that can be used by the public, according to the Fire Department. Over the past eight years, about 30 have disappeared. A 2014 analysis by The Wall Street Journal said there were just 12 below 96th Street, but several have closed since then.The math makes the decision to pack up shop and build simple. \u201cIf you own the gas station and you own the land, and you can get 30 or 40 million dollars for that, you could run that gas station for 100 years and never make that kind of money,\u201d said Ralph Bombardiere, executive director of the New York State Association of Service Stations and Repair Shops, which lobbies on behalf of the industry in New York.The gas station that closed Thursday was owned by Marcello Porcelli, whose father bought the corner plot for $100,000 about four decades ago and built up the Gaseteria brand, whose red-and-blue signs became a fixture of the city\u2019s 1970s streetscape.In the early 2000s his father\u2019s company, LargaVista, shifted its goals to prioritize developing its more than 60 parcels citywide, \u201cin order to maximize its extremely valuable portfolio of prime locations,\u201d according to its website. LargaVista has formed a partnership with Related, a development company, to build the office building, a seven-story, $200 million project of zigzagging glass designed by the architect Rick Cook.\u201cEveryone is nostalgic when you look at something that\u2019s been there for a while, maybe even a gas station,\u201d said Lisa Linden, a spokeswoman for LargaVista, which is Spanish for \u201clong view.\u201d\u201cThere are many things that people need, the question is, Is this location going forward?\u201d she added.The building will bring jobs to the city, Ms. Linden said, adding: \u201cCabdrivers will be dropping people off there. So.\u201dFor many, the closing is a nonissue, including those who rely on the subway system or believe New York is still too car-oriented. Many neighbors are happy to see the station, which they see as an eyesore, go, including members of Community Board 2, which approved the new building. Board members did not respond to requests for an interview.Woolworth\u2019s and the Gristedes supermarket chain are among the service-oriented businesses that have sold as the value of their land has eclipsed profits. But while disappearing grocery stores have provoked public outcry and even street demonstrations, the loss of one charmless gas station \u2014 even if it is the last one for miles \u2014 seems to induce little clamor beyond the cabdriver community.Maqsood Ahmad, 49, a former cabdriver who owns Little Lahore, a restaurant on Crosby Street next to the gas station that has sold Pakistani cuisine to a mostly cabby clientele for two decades, believes gas stations have evaporated unchecked in part because their most loyal clients are working-class immigrants who often feel voiceless. The city, he said, needs \u201cthe lower people, middle-class people and upper-class people.\u201d\u201cThey need all the mix,\u201d he added. \u201cBut right now they are running on the path that they need only money.\u201dMr. Ahmad\u2019s rent for his 175-square-foot subterranean restaurant has risen from $1,100, when he started in 1995, to $10,000 a month today. He will have to close, he believes, when the cabs no longer have a pit stop.Gas station attrition is widespread. A decade ago, there were nearly 300,000 gas stations nationwide; there are now fewer than 140,000, according to Michael J. Fox, the executive director of the Gasoline and Automotive Service Dealers of America, the industry association for New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. Consolidation is partly responsible for the decline, as are new environmental regulations that make updating underground gas reservoirs a burdensome expense, he said, but in increasingly expensive cities, like New Canaan and Greenwich, in Connecticut, and San Francisco, booming real estate values are most often to blame.Mr. Fox\u2019s organization has fought for states to pass laws, or to add tax incentives for stations that stay, that might thwart the decline. \u201cThe Manhattan circumstance is going to keep spreading,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember one time when Brooklyn was considered the garbage dump, now Brooklyn is the new Manhattan. You want to get the law passed so that it doesn\u2019t come to be that within a 40-mile radius you have no service stations at all because of the real estate situation.\u201dThe mood at the gas station a few days before its closing was bitter. \u201cI worry about my mayor: Where is his driver going to fill up the gas?\u201d Janusz Krawczynski, 65, said as he sat in his cab in the station\u2019s lot, his voice loaded with sarcasm. \u201cRight now, any place he goes, he\u2019s late,\u201d he said, referring to the mayor\u2019s well-documented history of tardiness. \u201cThe driver is going to have to go to fill up the gas in New Jersey, Brooklyn, the Bronx,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019ll never go to a meeting!\u201dNot all see that vision as bad. In the West Village, where Athanasios Hondros, who goes by Tommy, runs a six-pump Mobil station, business has been booming, and though people have come with envelopes of cash, he said, the station is not for sale.\u201cDoesn\u2019t bother me,\u201d he said. \u201cI plan on being the last gas station left.\u201dSusan C. Beachy contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Seventh Generation Taps Maya Rudolph for Its Biggest Campaign Yet", "Date": "2016-04-17", "News": "Supported byAdvertisingWHEN Seventh Generation began selling environmentally sustainable products almost three decades ago, it was dedicated to the relatively few consumers who were interested in recycled toilet paper and paper towels. These days, green is mainstream, and companies like Walmart and Clorox promote their natural lines.So this month, Seventh Generation, which is based in Vermont, began a $15 million advertising campaign \u2014 the biggest in its history and only the second time it has used television \u2014 to introduce itself to potential customers and reclaim those who may have strayed.\u201cThere was a time Seventh Generation owned this market, and little by little, competitors chipped away at it,\u201d said Joel Makower, chairman of GreenBiz, a media company that tracks corporate sustainability and green marketing. \u201cThe holy grail of green products is to break into the mainstream, and not many make a run for it \u2014 it looks like that\u2019s what Seventh Generation is doing.\u201dThe perception people have of these kinds of products is \u201cthat they don\u2019t work as well and that the prices are a little higher,\u201d said Norm Borin, a professor of marketing at California Polytechnic State University who has written about consumer reaction to green marketing.Seventh Generation is often more expensive than its nongreen counterparts, but that depends on the product and \u201cusually it\u2019s no more than a 10 percent premium,\u201d said Joey Bergstein, Seventh Generation\u2019s chief marketing officer.And what about the effectiveness of green laundry detergents? Seventh Generation and about 15 other green detergents landed in the middle of a list of about 75 tested, according to Consumer Reports current ratings.The green market expanded more quickly from 2007 through the beginning of 2010 as mainstream mass marketers introduced products like Clorox Green Works, Arm & Hammer Essentials and Purex Natural Elements. So Seventh Generation and other environmentally friendly companies like Method answered by introducing new products and increasing the places where consumers could buy their goods.The recession hurt, however, and consumers bought these products less frequently, often choosing cheaper options.But the market has revived since then, especially with Walmart introducing its own green label, Great Value Naturals, three years ago.Seventh Generation has experienced growth every year since its inception, except for fiscal year 2009, Mr. Bergstein said, and total company growth has nearly doubled in the last six years.Much of the impetus for the campaign is that consumers who want to buy Seventh Generation items can now actually find them not just at places like Whole Foods, where they have traditionally been, but through Amazon and at Target.\u201cThe availability is so much more than it was five to 10 years ago,\u201d Mr. Bergstein said.The ads take aim at conventional detergents \u2014 \u201cblue goo,\u201d as Ms. Rudolph calls it in one commercial \u2014 and are intended especially for consumers who already buy organic food and maybe want their deodorant, body wash and toothpaste to be organic as well.People are first concerned about \u201cwhat they eat, then the products they put on their skin, and then the products they use around the house,\u201d Mr. Bergstein said.Seventh Generation, however, has been around a lot longer than most green goods and has built trust. The trick now is to get its name out there, as well as convince people that buying green does not imply a drop in performance, Mr. Makower said.\u201cAt one point, the perceptions were true,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir toilet paper was not as friendly as Charmin. But they\u2019re saying it\u2019s now time to take another look.\u201dAdvertisement"}

For those in the fashion industry, where rumors of Mr. Vaccarello\u2019s appointment have been front-row chatter for months, the news was no surprise; to those outside the industry slipstream, a little more explanation may be helpful.The designers who have stewarded Yves Saint Laurent since its founder and namesake stepped down from couture in 2002 (and ready-to-wear before that) are now well known: Besides Mr. Slimane, they include Tom Ford, Alber Elbaz (late of Lanvin) and Stefano Pilati. Here is a primer on Mr. Vaccarello in advance of his first collection in October.Mr. Vaccarello, 36, was born in Brussels to Italian parents. He studied at La Cambre, the Brussels design school also attended by C\u00e9dric Charlier and the Paco Rabanne creative director Julien Dossena.16 PhotosIn 2006, he presented his graduate collection at the Hy\u00e8res Festival in C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur, a fashion and photography fair known for spotlighting emerging designers, where it won a Grand Prix. He went on to work for Karl Lagerfeld at Fendi until he struck out on his own with his Anthony Vaccarello label, presenting his first collection in 2009.That, along with the support of high-profile editors like Emmanuelle Alt of Paris Vogue, helped bring Mr. Vaccarello acclaim early and often. He won the Andam, the leading French fashion prize, in 2011. In 2013, Donatella Versace invited him to be one of the guest designers of Versace\u2019s rock \u2019n\u2019 roll sister collection, Versus Versace; in 2015, he was named its creative head.Yves Saint Laurent is to be his single-minded pursuit. Mr. Vaccarello has left Versus Versace as of this week, with Ms. Versace\u2019s blessing, and Yves Saint Laurent confirmed that he will pause his own label when he begins his tenure at the house.The Anthony Vaccarello line, which is stocked at stores including Colette in Paris, Kirna Zab\u00eate in New York and Net-a-Porter worldwide, had become a growing draw during Paris Fashion Week, with Noomi Rapace, Lou Doillon, Lucky Blue Smith and Kanye West sitting front row.An earlier version of this article, relying on information provided by Anthony Vaccarello\u2019s representatives, misstated Mr. Vaccarello\u2019s age.

{"Headline": "Kindle Oasis From Amazon Promises \u2018Months and Months\u2019 of Battery Life", "Date": "2016-04-13", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 When Amazon introduced Kindle, its pioneering e-reader, in 2007, society was on the cusp of being changed by mobile devices.The iPhone had only just come out, and in the years to come smartphones and tablets asserted themselves as the primary devices for people who wanted to communicate, play games, browse the web and get stuck in the flytrap of social media.But Amazon\u2019s Kindles, which now seem quaint in their singular focus on reading, found their niche. And on Wednesday, the company introduced its eighth-generation Kindle for people willing to pay a tidy sum for an ultralightweight device that is meant for reading and not much else.The product, Kindle Oasis, will cost $289, placing it at the very top of Amazon\u2019s family of e-readers. The previous top-of-the-line e-reader, Kindle Voyage, is $200. Kindle Oasis is very light, weighing just 4.6 ounces \u2014 about 20 percent less than any other Kindle. For comparison, the latest iPad Mini is more than 10 ounces.Amazon is charging a premium for Kindle Oasis because it comes with a leather case containing a battery that significantly extends the charge time of the device. Magnets in the battery pack on the cover solidly click together with the Kindle Oasis. With the cover, Kindle Oasis gets \u201cmonths and months\u201d of battery life, more than any other device in the family. Without it, it lasts weeks, Amazon says.In an interview at Amazon\u2019s headquarters last week, David Limp, the senior vice president in charge of the company\u2019s devices business, said that Amazon\u2019s Kindle business was still growing, despite all the challenges it faced from other mobile devices.Mr. Limp said there was enduring appeal for a dedicated reading device that is a sanctuary from the hailstorm of distractions on other gadgets.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with reading on a phone or a tablet but in the modern world, when you read on a tablet, you are bombarded,\u201d he said. \u201cIncoming email. I might get a notification, a text message from my family. I might get a notification from Clash of Clans. It takes away from our original vision, which is to get lost in an author\u2019s story.\u201dIt\u2019s worth noting that Amazon has no qualms about bombarding people electronically since it makes the Fire family of general-purpose tablets, and used to offer a Fire phone that did not succeed with consumers.Kindle Oasis is all about reading, though. The device has an unusual asymmetrical back, which substantially thickens the device on one side. When the device is held, the slope between its two thicknesses acts as a grip for the hand. Mr. Limp compared it to the spine of a book.Holding the Kindle Oasis is more comfortable than holding any other Kindle, but Amazon has accomplished that partly by moving some of its battery capacity out of the device proper and into its cover. Kindle Oasis comes with Amazon\u2019s Paperwhite display, which closely mimics the resolution of print.At $289, the new e-reader is likely to appeal only to the staunchest electronic book fans. The least expensive Kindle costs $80.One hard-core reader, Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, could not quite contain his excitement after seeing the device last week. Mr. Limp said he was with Mr. Bezos when his boss did the very un-Amazon thing of tipping the world to the imminent arrival of a new Kindle over Twitter. Amazon is normally extraordinarily secretive about such things.\u201cHe\u2019s very passionate about reading,\u201d Mr. Limp said.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why There\u2019s Hope for the Middle Class (With Help From China)", "Date": "2016-04-15", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewAmerica has often thought of itself as a middle-class nation \u2014 one in which most people are merely comfortable and neither very rich nor very poor.That notion has come under siege lately. Income inequality has been rising since the early 1980s, and the median household income is now lower than it was in 1999. The status of the middle class has become a highly charged political issue. Nonetheless, a sober look at the trends of recent years reveals some reason for optimism: Pathways that already exist offer some chance of rejuvenating the middle class.The weakness of recent middle-class wage growth has stemmed from a number of factors, including foreign competition, technological changes that favor highly skilled workers and persistent poverty. Let\u2019s consider each in turn.Better times may be ahead, though. Higher wages in China \u2014 and other emerging nations \u2014 are now limiting the competitive advantage of those economies. And perhaps more important for Americans, as China reaches technological maturity, it is likely to shower innovations on consumers, creating a net gain for people in the United States.This would mean more competition from China, of course, and lost jobs in some fields, but to simply focus on the negatives would be shortsighted. The reality is that innovators do not capture all or even most of the benefits they bring to the world. Once an idea emerges, its benefits begin to expand, and those benefits will surely spread to the United States.What economists call skill-based technical change may also shift in a more egalitarian direction. The advent of information technology increased the value of workers and managers who could manipulate these new talents effectively, while smart software eliminated the jobs of many travel agents and paper-filing clerks. But consider a universe in which all it takes to work with a computer is to talk to it. That could lower the wages of technicians, while opening a new world where less skilled laborers could work with information technology effectively.Finally, income inequality may begin to reverse itself through the evolution of social norms. Poor people who see no way out of their plight won\u2019t all be able to advance without outside help, but some of the impoverished will succeed despite the barriers they face.Mormons have done relatively well in economic terms, perhaps, at least in part, because their religious culture encourages behavior consistent with prosperity, such as savings, mutual assistance, family values and no drug and alcohol abuse.I am not a Mormon and am not advocating that religion or any other. But it seems reasonable to observe that changing social norms, sometimes associated with religion, can help improve living standards.All of these mechanisms involve some degree of speculation, and the speed at which they will develop will vary. Still, these processes can already be found around us to a limited degree. Furthermore, all of them could happen without requiring any major change in American public policy and thus they could bypass possible government gridlock.Most people agree there is plenty of unfairness built into the current political system, such as bad public policies, which often favor the well-off and erect barriers to the advancement of poorer and less educated individuals. How to change these policies will no doubt continue to be a matter of political debate.But there is reason to believe that when inequality trends start to run in reverse \u2014 whenever that might be \u2014 it will be because of processes that are operating largely outside of politics. Technology, trade and even religion may help restore prosperity to the middle class.TYLER COWEN is a professor of economics at George Mason University.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Some Online Bargains May Only Look Like One", "Date": "2016-04-13", "News": "Supported byAmazon has some unbelievable bargains on its virtual shelves.You say you don\u2019t believe that a plastic cat pan could ever have been sold to anyone for a couple of thousand bucks? Or that a six-ounce bag of Zuke\u2019s Lil\u2019 Links pork and apple sausage bits ever cost more than dinner at a five-star restaurant?It\u2019s all part of the bizarre world of Internet \u201cdiscounts,\u201d which let retailers and brands assert that you are getting a stupendous deal because someone somewhere else \u2014 exactly where is never explained \u2014 is being charged much more.So if you are the sort of consumer who cares about such things, how can you guard against such pressure? When does e-commerce deliver on low prices, and when is it merely coasting on its reputation?These are particularly significant issues now, as Internet retail shifts from being mostly about price to being largely about convenience. That will make it much harder for customers to judge independently if they are getting a deal or merely being encouraged to think so.First, realize that the problem is at least as pervasive online as offline \u2014 and even less regulated. California, which has relatively strict laws about deceptive advertising, brought a successful case against Overstock.com for illusory discounts. But authorities elsewhere seem to have little interest.Over the last month, more research has been done on the shadowy world of Internet discounts that underline how random or even whimsical list prices are.Boomerang Commerce, a retail analytics firm, compared the list prices of dozens of pet items on Amazon and the specialist pet site Chewy.com. In only a handful of cases did the retailers even agree on what the list price was. So a 22-pound bag of Blue Buffalo Basics Limited Ingredient Grain-Free Duck and Potato dog food had a list price of $131 on Amazon and $84 on Chewy. Yet the retail price at both sites was the same: $49.49.\u201cA perceived deeper discount creates a higher conversion event \u2014 in other words, more buyers,\u201d said Boomerang\u2019s chief executive, Guru Hariharan, who previously worked at Amazon.Blue Buffalo declined to comment and Chewy did not respond to messages seeking comment. Amazon removed the $131 list price for the dog food and the 99 percent deals I asked about. An Amazon spokesman, Craig Berman, declined to answer any questions.A little over 44 percent of the products \u2014 some sold directly by Amazon, others by third parties \u2014 were billed as discounted, Ripen said. \u201cIt\u2019s less than I expected, actually,\u201d said Dave Rekuc, Ripen\u2019s director of marketing. \u201cConsidering you can basically name your own list price.\u201dSome e-commerce experts said nothing needed to be done about illusory discounts, because the merchants needed them so much.The process \u201ccan seem dishonest to consumers, but let\u2019s consider the retailer\u2019s side,\u201d said Daniel Green of CamelCamelCamel.com, an oddly named but useful site that tracks Amazon prices. \u201cIf they weren\u2019t using the list price as the benchmark, what would they use?\u201dRetailers could choose the most recent price as the comparison, Mr. Green said, but then \u201cthey would just jack the price way up before the sale. I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a good solution here, particularly as consumers apparently respond to large M.S.R.P.-based discounts.\u201d\u201cThe fact that plaintiff may have been manipulated into purchasing the items because she believed she was getting a bargain does not necessarily mean she suffered economic harm,\u201d United States District Judge F. Dennis Saylor IV wrote.For others, however, e-commerce is not living up to its promise of being transparent and pro-consumer.Her site tracks litigation against the retailers. Wayfair, an online furniture retailer, has been sued in a pricing case that is pending. A case against Amazon faltered because its customers waived their rights to sue in favor of arbitration.E-commerce is in flux. The selling point is increasingly getting something now rather than getting it cheap. Online shoppers are encouraged to live in an ecosystem where they buy as much as possible from one company. The pioneer of this, of course, is Amazon, with its annual Prime fee that covers shipping.In an ecosystem, prices are much harder to calculate, or perhaps even impossible. Customers have to trust the retailer, a problematic situation.\u201cPricing can be complex,\u201d said Mr. Hariharan of Boomerang Commerce. \u201cIn some places it\u2019s highly transparent. But there are others where you have to do the math. You have to check the impact of shipping costs, promotions, coupons and loyalty rewards.\u201dSome consumers feel manipulated. Charlie Allenson, a New Yorker who teaches business skills using improv comedy, was recently shopping for an audio interface that would turn his computer into a recording studio.On one e-commerce site, the list price was $170. At another, it was more. At a third, it was much less.\u201cI felt like someone was playing three-card monte with me,\u201d Mr. Allenson said. \u201cThere\u2019s a dishonesty factor with all those different list prices.\u201dEven though the final sale price was exactly the same \u2014 $100 \u2014 he did not buy any of them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.U. Charges Dispute Google\u2019s Claims That Android Is Open to All", "Date": "2016-04-20", "News": "Supported byGoogle has long stressed that Android, its popular mobile software, is open for anyone to use, including its rivals.Margrethe Vestager, the European Union\u2019s antitrust chief, said Google had required some of the cellphone manufacturers to preinstall the company\u2019s services, including its Google Play smartphone application store, and had given them unfair financial incentives to favor Google\u2019s services on their mobile devices. Those practices undermined competition and consumer choice, she said.\u201cGoogle has abused its dominant position,\u201d Ms. Vestager said on Wednesday. The company\u2019s \u201cbehavior has harmed consumers by restricting innovation in the wider mobile space.\u201dThe company denies it has broken European competition rules, and the charges may not lead to financial or other penalties against Google, which now has three months to respond to the accusations.By taking aim at Android \u2014 the mobile software that holds more than 80 percent of the worldwide market share for smartphone operating systems \u2014 Europe has opened the latest chapter in its continuing battle with American technology companies.Europe\u2019s antitrust claims highlight Google\u2019s increasingly thorny relationships with smartphone manufacturers such as HTC and Samsung, among others. Ms. Vestager said Android\u2019s prominent role in the mobile market was not in question but that she was concerned the contracts the company signed with smartphone manufacturers had made it difficult, if not impossible, for rival search engines and smartphone app stores to compete in the European Union.\u201cIf a company is dominant, that\u2019s fine,\u201d Ms. Vestager told reporters. \u201cBut if that dominance is abused, then we have an issue.\u201d She declined to name which cellphone manufacturers might be affected, citing their right to privacy.The device makers, already struggling against cutthroat competition, have become reliant on Google\u2019s digital services available on Android, even as they have tried to persuade consumers to try their own mobile services or those of Google\u2019s competitors. Some, including Samsung, have backed rival operating systems to loosen Android\u2019s grip, but such efforts have so far proved unsuccessful.And while global cellphone manufacturers once profited from using Android to expand rapidly, particularly in emerging markets, their growth has since slowed.Analysts say these cellphone makers\u2019 inability to wean consumers off Google\u2019s popular mobile mapping, email and other services has potentially shut them out of billions of dollars in extra revenue as people\u2019s digital habits \u2014 including online search and e-commerce purchases \u2014 shift to mobile devices.\u201cTheir attempts at beating Google\u2019s services haven\u2019t worked,\u201d said Neil Mawston, a mobile analyst at the technology research group Strategy Analytics. \u201cFor most companies that want to operate in the smartphone market, there isn\u2019t another option but to use Google.\u201dRepresentatives from the leading smartphone manufacturers declined to comment on their relationship with Google.The dominance of Android, at least in Europe and the United States, is almost absolute.The basic Android software can be downloaded for free and modified by device makers and telecom operators.In total, Google\u2019s version of Android powers more than 98 percent of the Android-based smartphones in Europe and the United States, according to Ian Fogg, a senior director at IHS, a technology consultancy in London.Only in China, where Google is banned, and Russia, where the local search engine Yandex holds a significant market share, does Google not dominate in mobile.\u201cIf someone buys an Android device in Europe or the U.S., it\u2019s almost certainly Google\u2019s version,\u201d said David McQueen, research director at ABI Research in London.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.If Google is found to have broken European rules, the company may face fines of as much as 10 percent of its annual revenue. Given the company\u2019s recent annual revenue, that could be roughly $7 billion. Such a high financial penalty is unlikely, however, according to legal experts.The company could also be forced to alter its Android software to give competitors a greater position in its mobile software or to change its existing contracts with cellphone makers.That would potentially provide Europeans with a wider choice of mobile services than would be available to their American counterparts. Most people in the 28 member states of the European Union, though, still rely primarily on Google services for many daily activities.Paulo Trezentos, chief executive of Aptoide, a rival Portuguese Android app store that is one of the complainants in the European competition case against Google, said his company would welcome greater access to Android users.\u201cGoogle makes it difficult for people to install applications from rivals,\u201d Mr. Trezentos said. \u201cIt\u2019s actively making it harder to compete.\u201dIn the United States, some lawmakers on Wednesday called on the Federal Trade Commission to more closely scrutinize Google after Europe\u2019s charges. In 2013, the F.T.C. closed a two-year antitrust investigation into Google\u2019s search business, citing a lack of evidence for pursuing a case. The F.T.C. said it did not comment on or confirm investigations.Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, who is a member of the Judiciary Committee, said regulations and laws differed in Europe and the United States but \u201cthe spirit and goal of our laws is very similar.\u201d\u201cThere is now clearly a need for exacting and penetrating scrutiny,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal said in an interview. \u201cPerhaps it is overdue. But it is now clearly necessary.\u201dAn article on Thursday about European Union antitrust charges against Google misstated the process though which Google receives revenue related to its Android operating system. Google earns revenue from, among other sources, advertising generated from services like mobile search that are included in the software. It does not receive fees from device makers.Cecilia Kang and Farhad Manjoo contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

What\u2019s the name of that sandy place in the south with the snakes? Oh, right, Dorne.The opening title sequence plays the very practical role of providing viewers the only guide through the physical landscape, not to mention the earworm so closely associated with the show.

The idea was to help viewers place where each scene was happening in the big, confusing world.\u201cIt was awful, and it ended up disrupting the narrative rhythm,\u201d he said, explaining why the scenes never made it to air.But that highlighted viewers\u2019 need for some kind of legend to understand the layout of the world, to remind them this wasn\u2019t happening on Earth, Mr. Wall said.

{"Headline": "Reaching Peak Greek at the Met Museum", "Date": "2016-04-14", "News": "Supported byArt ReviewBut the show also offers something less often encountered: history viewed at ground level, from inside. From that perspective, it\u2019s about binding, not sorting, about single lives threaded together day by day. And it\u2019s not about statistics, but about impressions, personal sensations, evoked by the sight of sculpted cloth falling over vulnerable flesh and the worry lines etched into the brow of a portrait head.Grand exhibitions and historical epochs alike often revolve around a magnetic personality. The Met show does too: King Alexander III of Macedon, better known as Alexander the Great. Although he was born far from Athens, he deeply identified with Greek Classical culture (having Aristotle as a personal tutor helped). At the same time, he moved beyond it with the creative confidence of a superstar.Gorgeous and beauty-loving, culturally inquisitive and ravenous with ambition, Alexander embarked on what amounts to a world tour based on military conquest. Within a few years, he exerted political control over Greece, staked claims to sovereignty in Egypt and Persia, and reached the edges of India. He spread the Hellenic spirit as he went, but he also absorbed influences from the cultures around him, and shipped those influences home in the form of gold, jewels and precious objects.The Greek Classical tradition was based on an aesthetic, which was also an ethic, of idealization, austerity and emotional restraint. It represented, at least to some degree, the effort of a peninsular culture to distance itself from, and elevate itself above, what it perceived as a barbaric outside world. Alexander plunged into that outside world and the cargo of exotic fabulousness he sent back from it altered the character of Classical art. By the time of his death in 323 B.C., at 32, a new, hybrid, internationalist art, now known as Hellenistic, had begun to coalesce, and would flourish for nearly three centuries.Its history is the subject of the Met show and is, to say the least, a complex one. Alexander himself is everywhere in the opening gallery. A marble portrait head \u2014 possibly a Roman copy of an original bronze by his court artist, Lysippos \u2014 likely reflects what the ruler looked like: generically dishy with a designer haircut, Justin Bieber with gravitas. Two small bronzes suggest distinctive personas that Alexander, a born performer, wanted to market: in one he\u2019s a buff hunk inviting worshipful admiration, in the other an armored equestrian, eyes wide, hair flying, sword-arm raised.Objects around him give a sense of globalist environment he relished and promoted. Asian elephants lumber over silver coins and glazed plates. Persian courtiers circle a monumental vase. A shimmering myrtle wreath of hammered gold, each light-catching leaf, twig and flower exquisitely formed, seems to await the wealthy wearer who, wherever he lived and whatever he did, was a cosmopolitan member of Hellenistic society.A flair for the theatrical in this new art often expressed itself through exaggerated scale. In a gallery further along in the show, a marble statue of Athena, carved around 170 B.C., towers more than 13 feet tall. A two-foot-high head of Herakles is a fragment of an image that, when intact, must have projected muscle-bound immensity. Both sculptures were found at Pergamon in modern Turkey. The site was the capital of the Attalid dynasty, one of several post-Alexander kingdoms that fought among themselves and eventually faced off with Rome. It\u2019s most famous, though, for its frieze-covered Great Altar, one of the most dramatic of surviving Hellenistic monuments.The group makes a startling first impression: of fallen bodies strewn across the ground, as if in the wake of an execution squad that has just moved on. A marble figure of an Amazon lies dead on a patch of earth, her face slack, her limp body thrown open. Nearby is the famous sculpture, on loan from the National Archaeological Museum in Naples, of \u201cDying Gaul,\u201d an image of a nude man, felled by wounds, making one final, futile effort to rise.These sculptures are not to meant to inspire pure pity. Their subjects \u2014 a mythically fierce female warrior, a real Celtic tribesman of a kind known to pillage Greek settlements \u2014 embodied cosmic forces seen as ever-threatening to the Hellenic civilization. They are outsiders, the enemy. But pathos is pathos: The dying man, head hanging down as if he were staring into the earth, is a pitiable sight. One of the grand beauties of Hellenistic art is its insistence on confusing our feelings, on replacing the Classical certainty with emotional complication.The exhibition\u2019s organizers \u2014 Carlos A. Pic\u00f3n and Se\u00e1n Hemingway of the museum\u2019s department of Greek and Roman art, leading a curatorial team of Ariel Herrmann, Kyriaki Karoglou, Christopher S. Lightfoot, Joan R. Mertens, Lillian Bartlett Stoner and Paul Zanker \u2014 have done well to emphasize this complex dynamic, one that gives Hellenistic art an exceptionally modern savor. But after the high Pergamon moment, there\u2019s still a lot of ground to cover, and the show broadens out in a series of mini-surveys devoted to specific features of Hellenistic art: jewelry, glass production coins and intimate sculpture.Each yields astonishments: onyx cameos with 10 layers of carving, glass bowls with inserted gold sheets and sculptures like the famed \u201cLo Spinario,\u201d which turns the image of a child pulling a thorn from his foot into a tight Baroque tangle of coiled lines.In some eras, art loses steam, repeats itself, sputters out. Hellenistic art seemed increasingly fueled by audacity. Decorative glassware goes psychedelic. Portraits turn slightly psychotic. The margin for oddity, always wide, grows wider, and is rife with jokes and surprises. Look at the back of a life-size carving of a sleeping hermaphrodite and you see the smooth planes of an Ingres odalisque, Classical Venus; look from the front and you see an erection.This marble sculpture is a Roman copy of a Greek original, done sometime in the second century B.C. By then, global political balances had long since shifted. Rome, that power mower of an empire, had picked off the Hellenistic kingdoms one by one. The last Attalid monarch handed over the keys to Pergamon without being asked. With Cleopatra\u2019s suicide in 30 B.C., Alexander\u2019s one remaining direct successor left the scene. The new Roman emperor, Augustus, was a Classicist. He liked pure, was comfortable with composed. Unruly emotion in art was out.Or was it? After centuries, the Hellenistic spirit had permanently changed art\u2019s DNA. There could be no more Classicism, only Neo-Classicism and Post-Classicism. At the end of the show we find a bronze caldron, made somewhere in the Greek world during the Augustan years: its basic form is old-style but from its surface a little satyr pops out like a jack-in-the-box, snaps his fingers and smiles a gleaming silver inlaid smile. And at a late date we find one of the exhibition\u2019s most moving portraits, the bronze head of a young African king named Juba II, on loan from the Archaeological Museum of Rabat in Morocco.Juba\u2019s father, the king of Numidia, had killed himself after losing a battle against Julius Caesar in Africa. The boy was brought to Rome as part of the victory spoils, paraded through the streets, then raised in the imperial household. Augustus eventually made him ruler of the African lands to which he was already the natural heir. Records tell us that Juba remained close to Augustus and lived a long life as a loyal Roman citizen. In the portrait, though, as intimate and unguarded as a snapshot, he\u2019s still young, somewhere in his teens. He stares off as if lost in thought. His lip curls in something like anger. His face swells as if he were about to cry.An art review on Friday about \u201cPergamon and the Hellenistic Kingdoms of the Ancient World,\u201d at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, misidentified the institution from which the \u201cDying Gaul\u201d sculpture is on loan. It is from the National Archaeological Museum in Naples, not the Capitoline Museums in Rome. The review also misstated part of the title of another sculpture, of a child pulling a thorn from his foot. It is \u201cLo Spinario,\u201d not \u201cIl Spinario.\u201d\u201cPergamon and the Hellenistic Kingdoms of the Ancient World\u201d opens Monday and runs through July 17 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art; 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org.

{"Headline": "Taking Shelter in Old-School Dividend Stocks", "Date": "2016-04-09", "News": "Supported byOver the last several years, growth stocks, like Amazon and Netflix, have brought much momentum to the market. But in the first quarter, those kinds of stocks lost some of their sizzle, as old-school dividend payers came back into favor.That is where three of the quarter\u2019s top-performing mutual funds found some of their better stock picks.Cheapness is not enough, though. A company must also have a durable, defensible business and a burly balance sheet. That is not to say they avoid wading into situations that some investors might consider scary. Part of their strategy is to hunt in sectors where \u201cfear and anxiety\u201d have depressed prices, Mr. Sertl said.Thus, a couple of years ago, they bought gold-mining stocks \u2014 a first for their 10-year-old fund. \u201cGold and gold stocks went into a horrific bear market, and that\u2019s when we got involved,\u201d he said. \u201cGoldcorp peaked at $55 in 2011 and bottomed out in January at under $10.\u201d The stock ended up being one of the fund\u2019s better-performing holdings in the first quarter.A period of disfavor for media companies likewise drew the fund\u2019s managers into CBS and Time Warner shares, which also have done well lately. Some consumers have been dropping cable TV in favor of online video streaming, and media companies have responded by offering \u201cskinnier bundles\u201d of services and channels, Mr. Sertl said. That could mean less revenue, which has prompted some investors to scurry away. But Mr. Sertl said he and his colleagues believed that companies with popular programming, like CBS\u2019s sports broadcasts and the Time Warner division HBO, would continue to thrive.\u201cSome people say, \u2018Content is king,\u2019 and we believe that,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you have good content, you\u2019ll be able to monetize it.\u201dThe Artisan fund, whose investor shares have an expense ratio of 1 percent, returned 6.38 percent in the first quarter, compared with 1.35 percent for the S.&P. 500.The managers assemble the portfolio annually and replace a stock in the interim only if its yield falls below the median yield of the S.&P. 500 or if a company is taken over, Mr. Pettee said. Otherwise, they leave the holdings alone.\u201cA big part of our success is the fact that we reconstitute the fund only once a year,\u201d he said. \u201cThat cuts down on our opportunities to make mistakes.\u201dThe strategy has led to the fund owning an abundance of companies in traditional sectors like industrials and energy, and fewer in higher-flying ones like health care and information technology. But as tech companies mature, more of them are finding their way into the fund \u2014 and even more will most likely end up there in the future, Mr. Pettee said.\u201cThink about Apple,\u201d he said. \u201cIt declared a dividend in 2012, so it\u2019s now in my world. It didn\u2019t score well in our model \u2014 the valuation was too rich \u2014 so it\u2019s not in the portfolio. But I\u2019m looking forward to the day when I own Apple as a Dog of the Dow.\u201cMicrosoft was the Apple of the \u201980s, and in 2013, we bought it as a Dog of the Dow.\u201dThe SunAmerica fund, whose A shares have an expense ratio of 1.07 percent, returned 6.29 percent in the first quarter.Croci (pronounced \u201ccroaky\u201d) stands for \u201ccash return on capital invested,\u201d she said. That is a measure that Deutsche Asset Management, a division of Deutsche Bank, developed to compare stocks across industries and countries. It was conceived as an improvement over traditional measures like the price-to-earnings ratio, Ms. Kumble said.\u201cEarnings are based on accounting numbers,\u201d she said. But accounting rules can vary across industries and countries, making earnings and thus P/E ratios tough to compare. \u201cWith Croci, we make adjustments to transform accounting reports into economic values,\u201d she said.The fund\u2019s managers apply a series of screens to winnow their potential holdings from among large-cap domestic stocks.\u201cWe start with the S.&P. 500 and exclude financials and any stock that pays no dividend,\u201d Ms. Kumble said. The managers then seek stocks with low financial leverage and low price volatility as well as above-average dividend yields and low prices based on their proprietary calculations. All of the stocks they buy are given an equal weight in the portfolio, and they are rebalanced and, as needed, replaced quarterly.The methodology produces a portfolio that can yield picks that might seem surprising when viewed via traditional metrics.Consider Exxon Mobil and Coca-Cola, Ms. Kumble said. Back in 2013, Coke had a price-to-earnings ratio of 19, while Exxon\u2019s was 12. \u201cSo on the surface, Exxon was cheap,\u201d she said. \u201cBut our Croci economic P/E was higher for Exxon Mobil than Coke. So our methodology said Coke was actually the cheaper stock.\u201d The Croci approach made a number of adjustments, including, for example, counting Coke\u2019s advertising and brand as assets, which differs from the traditional approach, Ms. Kumble said.Coke was also among the fund\u2019s most recent reported holdings, though Exxon Mobil was not. Apple, too, was a holding.The Deutsche fund, with a net expense ratio of 1.08 percent, returned 6.45 percent in the first quarter.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Our Natural History, Endangered", "Date": "2016-04-01", "News": "Supported byWhen people talk about natural history museums, they almost always roll out the well-worn descriptive \u201cdusty,\u201d to the great exasperation of a curator I know. Maybe he\u2019s annoyed because he\u2019s spent large sums of his museum\u2019s money building decidedly un-dusty climate-controlled storage sites, and the word implies neglect. (\u201cLet me know,\u201d the curator advises by email, \u201cif you want to hear me rant for an hour or so on this topic.\u201d)This view of the natural history museum as moribund is a terrible misunderstanding, on many counts. Natural history museums do indeed store specimens from millions or even billions of years in the past. (They even store dust, only it\u2019s called \u201cpollen.\u201d) Their collections, one museum director told me, are where \u201cwe have placed our entire three-dimensional record of the planet that sustains us.\u201d But these collections are less about the past than about our world and how it is changing. Sediment cores like the ones at the Illinois State Museum, for instance, may not sound terribly important, but the pollen in them reveals how past climates changed, what species lived and died as a result, and thus how our own future may be rapidly unfolding.Natural history museums are so focused on the future that they have for centuries routinely preserved such specimens to answer questions they didn\u2019t yet know how to ask, requiring methodologies that had not yet been invented, to make discoveries that would have been, for the original collectors, inconceivable.THE people who first put gigantic mammoth and mastodon specimens in museums, for instance, did so mainly out of dumb wonderment. But those specimens soon led to the stunning 18th-century recognition that parts of God\u2019s creation could become extinct. The heretical idea of extinction then became an essential preamble to Darwin, whose understanding of evolution by natural selection depended in turn on the detailed study of barnacle specimens collected and preserved over long periods and for no particular reason. Today, those same specimens continue to answer new questions with the help of genome sequencing, CT scans, stable isotope analysis and other technologies.These museums also play a critical role in protecting what\u2019s left of the natural world, in part because they often combine biological and botanical knowledge with broad anthropological experience. So when museum curators travel to a difficult habitat to conduct an environmental inventory, said Debra Moskovits of Chicago\u2019s Field Museum, a team will typically work at the same time to understand the needs of surrounding communities.After one such inventory in Ecuador, Dr. Moskovits stood up to withdraw from a meeting when it seemed as if an outsider should not be part of the discussion. The attendees told her to sit down again, saying: \u201cYou have no nationality. You are scientists. You speak for nature.\u201d Just since 1999, according to the Field Museum, inventories by its curators and their collaborators have been a key factor in the protection of 26.6 million acres of wilderness, mainly in the headwaters of the Amazon.It may be optimistic to say that natural history museums have saved the world. It may even be too late for that. But they provide one other critical service that can save us, and our sense of wonder: Almost everybody in this country \u2014 even children in Denver who have never been to the Rocky Mountains, or people in San Francisco who have never walked on a Pacific Ocean beach \u2014 goes to a natural history museum at some point in his life, and these visits influence us in deep and unpredictable ways.Maybe it was a trivial detail. Maybe most of our visits to natural history museums can seem trivial, just a way to pass Sunday afternoon with the family. But standing beneath the figure of Tyrannosaurus, or staring back at the skull of an early primate, or reliving the feats of Polynesian mariners, we dimly begin to understand the passage of time and cultures, and how our own species fits amid millions of others. We start to understand the strangeness and splendor of the only planet where we will ever have the great pleasure of living.Richard Conniff is the author of the forthcoming book \u201cHouse of Lost Worlds: Dinosaurs, Dynasties, and the Story of Life on Earth\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Players\u2019 Examines Crossroads of Sports and Money", "Date": "2016-04-22", "News": "Supported byBook EntryNo part of the media and entertainment industry has seen a more substantial economic transformation than sports.It is hard to believe that in 1990, when Hearst bought 20 percent of ESPN for a song, RJR Nabisco had long been trying to unload the stake. The remaining 80 percent share today represents the largest part of the largest media conglomerate in the world: the Walt Disney Company. And sports plays an increasing role in more than just the corporate realm. The seemingly perpetual growth of the price of sports rights has relegated a shocking percentage of American families to effective poverty once they have paid for the basic cable video bundle that incorporates these costs. This phenomenon implicates public policy considerations as well.Given this backdrop, the subtitle of a new book by Matthew Futterman, \u201cPlayers: The Story of Sports and Money, and the Visionaries Who Fought to Create a Revolution\u201d (Simon & Schuster), could not be more timely. Mr. Futterman, a sportswriter for The Wall Street Journal, takes us on a half-century tour spanning a variety of widely recognized and lesser-known sports figures and competitions that have played roles in the industry\u2019s development. Mr. Futterman is right that understanding the history is crucial to understanding the current state of sports and the possibility of change.As enjoyable as the journey sometimes is, the problem with the book is reflected in the title itself of \u201cPlayers.\u201d Mr. Futterman focuses on one level of a complex, multilayered industry whose economics are not primarily driven by how individual athletes negotiate their salary and licensing deals.Much more consequential is the structure of the games, teams, leagues and federations and their relationships with brands, broadcasters, cable channels and increasingly diverse potential distribution outlets. It is simply not possible to tell \u201cthe story of sports and money\u201d without broadening the narrative.Unfortunately, half of the book is taken up with tales of the players in golf, tennis and baseball who fought pivotal battles to improve their respective sports\u2019 compensation structures. The topic of escalating rights fees is taken up, only in the final chapter, and then perfunctorily. There is no mention at all, for instance, of the young Fox network\u2019s unexpected decision to submit a huge pre-emptive bid for N.F.L. rights in 1993. That move upended a relationship between football and CBS that dated back to the 1950s and fundamentally altered the trajectory of the cost of all sports rights since.Mr. Futterman\u2019s emphasis on the players has the virtue of lending itself to interesting personal histories. But the frequent flashbacks are disorienting, and the detailed descriptions of various sports matches are only sometimes relevant to the plot. The success of a goofy show in the 1970s called \u201cThe Superstars\u201d in which famous athletes from diverse disciplines competed against each other in a series of haphazardly organized events makes a good story. It demonstrated the increasing importance of the individual athletes\u2019 celebrity relative to the games or teams themselves. This point could be made, however, without a play-by-play of the relay races or tug-of-war competition.\u201cPlayers\u201d does not provide readers with the tools to understand why this might be. There is also no mention of the overall size of the industry or the mix of revenues between gate, media rights, sponsorships and merchandising. And the relative size of the various sports within the industry is not discussed and bears no relation to how much time Mr. Futterman spends on each.Mr. Futterman is as much a sports fan as he is a sportswriter, and the narrow preoccupations of \u201cPlayers\u201d reflect this perspective. The early chapters champion the interests of the exploited players who dare to wrestle a fair share of the pie from the team owners and leagues. Mr. Futterman argues that \u201cempowering\u201d the players \u201callowed them to transform modern sports\u201d by improving the quality of play and professionalism of the overall enterprises.The tone changes in the latter part of the book as the impact of excessive focus on individual celebrity comes at the expense of team performance and the broader values that sports should promote.In the absence of a fuller examination of the overarching industry structure, Mr. Futterman can only offer exhortations rather than any solutions: \u201cFans, who have sustained the industry \u2026 don\u2019t want much \u2013 just the ability to enjoy the games they love and the athletes they admire without getting ripped off, lied to, or insulted, either by the athletes who play sports or the people who run them.\u201dWho could argue with such sentiments? Although it may not seem like much to ask for, nothing in \u201cPlayers\u201d suggests that it will be made available any time soon.Jonathan A.

{"Headline": "A Plea for Patience Probably Resonates With Phil Jackson", "Date": "2016-04-07", "News": "Supported byOn Pro BasketballHe told a reporter that he would continue to use Phoenix, his warm-weather home, as his base of operations, while Sam Hinkie, the Stanford graduate and analytics guru, would preside over daily operations in Philadelphia as president and general manager.\u201cThese days, with all the technology, you can do that as long as everybody\u2019s on the same page,\u201d Colangelo said, the caveat suggestively tacked on to the end of his quotation.No matter where he is stationed, Colangelo has long been used to owning or overseeing things \u2014 over decades, the Phoenix Suns, the Arizona Diamondbacks, U.S.A. Basketball and the Basketball Hall of Fame, among other influences and interests.Except for this: Some of the points made by Hinkie, verbose though they were, Jackson would have to nod affirmatively to, given the increasingly discordant critiques of his two-plus years in New York.Here\u2019s a rather salient assertion from the letter, which was obtained by ESPN.Hinkie wrote: \u201cJeff Bezos says that if Amazon has a good quarter, it\u2019s because of the work they did three, four, five years ago \u2014 not because they did a good job that quarter. Today\u2019s league-leading Golden State Warriors acquired Draymond Green, Andrew Bogut and Klay Thompson almost four years ago, nearly four years ago, exactly, and almost five years ago. In this league, the long view picks at the lock of mediocrity.\u201dHe might have also mentioned that Stephen Curry was drafted in 2009 and didn\u2019t become the N.B.A.\u2019s most spectacular player and marketable personality until last season, but Hinkie instead chimed in about plans for a 10,000-year clock to be placed inside a mountain in West Texas.\u201cWhy?\u201d he wrote. \u201cBecause to design something that lasts that long makes us all consider what the world will look like between now and then. In return, we might be inspired to do something about it.\u201dTherein was Hinkie\u2019s problem in his three-year attempt to reconstruct a team draft pick by draft pick, no matter how many lopsided defeats and hopeless (or tanked) seasons it was going to take.Given the personnel choices he made (lane-inhabiting big men in a league more into exploiting perimeter skills), along with some bad luck with injuries, Hinkie\u2019s critics would now argue the mountain clock would cease ticking before the 76ers\u2019 ever began.Often unavailable to the news media (though pleasantly chatty in casual or off-the-record conversations), Hinkie developed the air of a resolute academician, furiously drawing computations on a chalkboard while behind him the students (or young players) were left to deal with the ignominious assaults on their egos, without veteran peer guidance in the room.Enter Colangelo, who vowed to rectify that as best he could, signing Elton Brand, who was 36 at the time, and promising more experience to support the young talent \u2014 with more top draft choices on the way \u2014 by next season.Colangelo, a chronological 76er, or double Hinkie\u2019s age, is no dinosaur. He didn\u2019t get to where he is in the sports industry by ignoring evolutionary trends. He understands that Hinkie was right to recognize that the N.B.A.\u2019s free-agency system is not designed to encourage movement, especially to bad teams, because it allows an incumbent franchise the right of first refusal and the ability to pay its own players much more.But Colangelo is also a child of Italian working-class Chicago. Hinkie\u2019s methodology \u2014 the resignation-by-treatise pretty much said it all \u2014 did not match his old-school ethos. Colangelo, who was the Suns\u2019 general manager before he was 30, has been around long enough to want to mix some old-fashioned instinct with the new-age numbers.Working from Phoenix, who better to trust as his on-site executive than his son, Bryan, who is reportedly in line for the general manager\u2019s job, nepotism implications aside?Bryan Colangelo is respected for his front-office work in Phoenix and Toronto \u2014 though not without haunting blemishes. In Phoenix, he traded Jason Kidd for Stephon Marbury, and in Toronto, he selected Andrea Bargnani first in the 2006 draft ahead of LaMarcus Aldridge.He also built the Steve Nash-led Suns team that was the forerunner to today\u2019s Warriors and acquired the current core of Toronto\u2019s fine club. Though to Hinkie\u2019s point about the long view, the architect stepped down before the players could develop and the city could applaud his work.Jackson is six years Jerry Colangelo\u2019s junior but a first-time executive. Despite howls of protest from the news media and fans, he is said to want Kurt Rambis back as Knicks coach next season. Despite his West Coast ties, Jackson has largely operated from New York, but, like Colangelo, seems to prefer to work with a loyal son (of his triangle system) in what he is discovering is a minefield of an occupation.As Hinkie essentially said, in 7,000 words, so much of the front-office game is about commitment, timing and racing the ticking clock to acquire and cultivate the one or two stars who will become your franchise faces, your talent magnets.Hinkie might have chosen Kristaps Porzingis last June instead of Jahlil Okafor but left him for Jackson to claim as his one indisputable prize in two years on the job. Then again, Porzingis has faded down the stretch, and who knows if Jackson will be around to crow if and when the Latvian giant reaches full-blown stardom.In Hinkie\u2019s case, he will certainly be remembered for three miserable seasons. But he might eventually be credited, if not celebrated, should two or three of the players and picks he assembled become the core of a Philadelphia contender.If nothing else, it would be worth a few thousand words on his next job application.The On Pro Basketball column on Friday, about the resignation of the Philadelphia 76ers\u2019 general manager, Sam Hinkie, misstated, in some copies, their record at the time they hired Jerry Colangelo as their chairman of basketball operations in December. They were 1-20, not 1-26.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon Challenges Netflix by Opening Prime to Monthly Subscribers", "Date": "2016-04-17", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 Amazon is introducing new options to subscribe to its Prime membership service on a monthly basis, a change that could make the company\u2019s video service a tougher competitor to Netflix.Amazon Prime, by most accounts, has been a huge success for the company, but one of the biggest hurdles for anyone thinking about joining the service is that it has required customers to pay $99 up front for an annual membership. The new options do away with the need for an annual commitment to Prime, widening its appeal to people who are more comfortable joining it on a short-term basis.The new monthly options will not save people money, though. Customers who subscribe month-to-month for the full Prime service will pay $32.88 more a year than if they subscribe on an annual basis, while subscribers to the video service will pay $8.88 more a year while getting substantially fewer benefits, like free two-day shipping, than annual Prime members.Now, by broadening the monthly options for Prime to anyone and introducing a video-only service, the company is making it easier for people to compare the price of Prime to that of Netflix, the dominant subscription streaming provider, with more than 75 million subscribers globally.Netflix has long been available on a monthly basis, without an annual commitment, offering several plans ranging from $7.99 to $11.99 a month, depending on video quality and the number of screens to which customers can stream video at the same time.The company\u2019s decision to offer a video-only version of Prime reflects a growing confidence at the company in the quality of the service. Amazon got started in video streaming much later than Netflix, and its catalog of movies and television shows was initially anemic by comparison.For a time, Amazon\u2019s video service seemed like little more than a nice additional benefit to the main attraction of the Prime service, two-day free shipping.But Amazon has steadily chipped away at skepticism of its seriousness in video by expanding the amount of content available for streaming.It has nabbed rights to popular series like \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d and \u201cMr. Robot,\u201d which are not available to stream on Netflix. Like Netflix, Amazon has poured money into producing original content, including award-winning shows like \u201cTransparent\u201d and \u201cMozart in the Jungle.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Yahoo\u2019s Suitors Uncover Few Financial Details", "Date": "2016-04-14", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 As Yahoo prepares to accept first-round bids for its core Internet business on Monday, potential buyers have found themselves facing one big problem: How do you value a company with a declining business when the company appears reluctant to share vital financial details?But several big companies are expected to place bids for Yahoo anyway, according to people briefed on the matter. Verizon Communications, which has publicly expressed interest in buying Yahoo\u2019s core Internet business and merging it with its AOL division, plans to press forward with a bid, some of these people said.The Daily Mail, a British tabloid newspaper and website, said publicly that it had considered joining with potential investors, including one or more private equity firm, for a bid. And the private equity firm TPG plans to make a bid in the first round on its own, according to a person briefed on the matter.Yet other huge companies plan to sit out the bidding. Google, which competes with Yahoo on search and display advertising and has a search partnership with the company, considered making an offer, but is unlikely to proceed because it fears any deal would draw stiff antitrust scrutiny, according to people briefed on the company\u2019s thinking.Other notable businesses, including AT&T, CBS and the investment firms Silver Lake, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and General Atlantic, are unlikely to bid, according to others briefed on their plans. And SoftBank, the Japanese telecommunications giant that controls Yahoo Japan, does not plan to bid despite press reports to the contrary.A 90-slide presentation shown to potential Yahoo bidders is dense with figures, but even people familiar with the company\u2019s operations have struggled to make sense of them. At the same time, Yahoo devoted just a couple of slides to important strategies, like its costly Hail Mary project to create an entirely new mobile search experience to leapfrog competitors like Google, Apple and Amazon.Representatives of Verizon, Google, AT&T and CBS declined to comment. A Yahoo spokeswoman also declined to comment on the sales process.Marissa Mayer, Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, is expected to face questions about the bidding on Tuesday, when the company reports its latest quarterly earnings. The report should offer a window into how Yahoo is weathering the upheaval caused by the layoff of 15 percent of its work force announced in February. The total value of Yahoo shares is now about $35 billion.The company may also disclose sales of patents and real estate, which it began shopping a couple of months ago in the hope of raising $1 billion to $3 billion.One reason for Yahoo\u2019s reluctance to share information may be that the business is worse than the company has publicly disclosed. That has added to confusion regarding the intentions of a board of directors that, just a few months ago, publicly said it had no intention of selling.Ms. Mayer has often said she wants to make Yahoo services a \u201cdaily habit\u201d for Internet users. But after nearly four years of effort, only about 10 percent of the one billion monthly visitors to Yahoo sites return every day, suggesting little attachment to the brand, according to people who have seen confidential internal data. At Facebook, by comparison, 65 percent of users visit daily.Yahoo is in a difficult position. Ms. Mayer\u2019s four-year turnaround effort has failed to deliver significant improvements at a company that has been in decline for a decade. Ms. Mayer argues that she is turning the tide with new investments in areas like video and native advertising.Activist investors, led by the Starboard Value hedge fund, have run out of patience and are pressing the board to sell the core business, separating it from the company\u2019s far more valuable investment stakes in Alibaba, China\u2019s leading e-commerce company, and Yahoo Japan, a separate, publicly traded company.Yahoo\u2019s board, which spent more than a year working on other plans to separate the investment stakes, reluctantly agreed to explore a sale of all or parts of the company and hired three investment banking firms to run the process. Starboard has formally threatened a proxy fight to replace the entire board at the next shareholder meeting if the directors do not follow through on a sale.Ms. Mayer has publicly laid out a path for an independent Yahoo and made the case to potential bidders that they should retain her as chief to carry out the plan.Abandoning previous forays into video and digital magazines, Ms. Mayer, who formerly headed search at Google, is now focused on returning Yahoo to its glory days as a search engine. Although comScore says that Yahoo is currently the No. 3 player in desktop searches, behind Google and Microsoft, Ms. Mayer argues that Yahoo can leap ahead through a \u201ccomplete reimagination of mobile search.\u201dMs. Mayer has assigned about 1,000 people to search products, or about 10 percent of the company\u2019s staff, according to people briefed on the business. The mobile effort, code-named Project Index, has officially been underway for two years and aims to create a search tool similar to Google Now on Android phones, Apple\u2019s Siri, Microsoft\u2019s Cortana and Amazon\u2019s Alexa.But the team has little to show for its work, and many at Yahoo wonder whether it is a hopeless quest. Industry experts as well as Yahoo insiders say that without the location and personal data that Apple and Google have, Yahoo will have a difficult time predicting what people want with enough accuracy to get them to switch from other services.As Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, Ms. Mayer acquired more than 20 companies, but ultimately struggled to turn around the web pioneer.\u201cThere is a massive opportunity for mobile search,\u201d said Keith Rabois, a partner at Khosla Ventures, who invests in search start-ups. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think Yahoo has the core assets or skills you would need to succeed or thrive right now.\u201dA Yahoo spokesman said that the company was exploring many search ideas, including the use of software bots that would fetch information on behalf of users.Ms. Mayer\u2019s vague plans for reversing Yahoo\u2019s decline, along with the lack of disclosure about the company\u2019s finances, have made prospective bidders nervous.Though several private equity firms have been looking at the company, people involved in the bidding process said that they were unlikely to prevail against a determined corporate buyer.Verizon is viewed by analysts as the leading bidder for Yahoo, but its likely offer comes despite trepidation among its executives, according to the people briefed on the bidding.Verizon is still struggling to digest its $4.4 billion acquisition last year of AOL, and some executives worry that buying Yahoo would simply be doubling down on integration troubles.Verizon could certainly combine the content properties and ad products and networks run by Yahoo and AOL.The company, with more than 112 million cellphone customers on top of its landline Internet subscribers, would have the ability to preinstall Yahoo services and distribute them widely.However, the contracts governing Apple iPhones and phones running Google\u2019s Android operating system generally restrict what phone carriers can do to promote alternatives for major services like search and email. So Yahoo would still need to build products good enough to persuade people to switch.Wall Street is hoping for a quick sale, to anybody, at any reasonable price.\u201cWe continue to believe that one of the greatest risks in the stock is the core being a \u2018melting ice cube,\u2019 as a prolonged sale process draws on, creating questions for employees, advertisers and partners,\u201d wrote Robert Peck, an analyst with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, on Wednesday.Because of an editing error, an article on Friday about Yahoo\u2019s reluctance to share financial details with prospective buyers misstated the amount the company hoped to raise by selling patents and real estate. The amount is $1 billion to $3 billion, not $1 billion to $35 billion.Conor Dougherty contributed reporting from San Francisco, and Emily Steel from New York.Advertisement"}

Dash Buttons are now pressed more than once a minute in total by Amazon customers, Mr. Rausch said.Amazon charges its customers $4.99 per Dash Button, but refunds that same amount after their first order using the device, almost guaranteeing that customers use it at least once. The device is available only to people who pay for Amazon\u2019s $99-a-year Prime service, and items are delivered to customers with Prime\u2019s two-day free shipping.Each Dash Button has a strip of adhesive for sticking it somewhere around the house, and a colorful logo for Tide, Orbit gum or whatever brand the button exists to serve. The widgets are effectively in-home advertisements for the brands, leading some analysts to believe that the brands are subsidizing the cost of the Dash Buttons bearing their names \u2014 something Amazon will not confirm.Amazon\u2019s founder and chief executive, Jeffrey P. Bezos, has been on a mission to eradicate every conceivable obstacle to shopping online since the 1990s, when he patented Internet ordering with a single mouse click. With the Dash Button, Amazon is removing the headache of one-click ordering on a PC or smartphone \u2014 as questionable as that burden may seem \u2014 and putting the button on a pantry wall, countertop or medicine cabinet.Scott Galloway, a professor of marketing at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business, said Amazon would one day go even further by analyzing customer shopping patterns and proactively sending people replenishments of common household items.\u201cI think that\u2019s where this is all headed,\u201d he said. \u201cI will get a box once a week with stuff they figure I need.\u201dTo some, the Dash Button is another symptom of a creeping societal laziness, though Mr. Galloway says he sees the device as no more insidious than a television remote control.One obvious risk of making online shopping so easy is inadvertent ordering. By default, the Dash Button won\u2019t allow a repeat order of a product until after an earlier order of the same item is delivered, a rule intended to prevent situations in which, say, a husband orders pet food right after his wife.But a child with a Dash Button can be a dangerous thing. Before Mr. Horn recently installed his Dash Button for Tide, one of his children got hold of it.\u201cWhen our 6-year-old picked it up, my wife and I both yelled \u2018Don\u2019t push the button!\u2019\u201d Mr. Horn said. He was just in time: No unwanted shipment of Tide has shown up at his door.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Online Media Is Tested When Social Platforms Come to Town", "Date": "2016-04-21", "News": "Supported byBitsFacebook now hosts articles created by outside publishers, as well as videos and live broadcasts. Snapchat, with its Discover product, has created a sort of online media in miniature, with TV, newspaper and magazine companies angling to have a channel on the platform. And, of course, media companies publish constantly to Instagram and Twitter, amassing giant audiences.Mr. Hagiu spoke at length with The New York Times about what changes when a platform comes to town, and what it might mean for online media. The interview was condensed and edited for clarity.Would you define a publication as a multisided marketplace?Yes \u2014 we can say it\u2019s a two-sided platform, if we count the two sides as being the readers on one side and the advertisers on the other. Now, there\u2019s a separate question \u2014 we can talk about the \u201cthird side,\u201d which would be the writers.Something like a Tumblr or Medium \u2014 a place where people can just post? Yes, where there\u2019s clearly a direct interaction, and there\u2019s a lot more control by the two sides \u2014 it\u2019s truly on the platform, not a lot of control exerted by the publication as an aggregator.How would you then describe, in similar terms, what a company like Facebook is \u2014 or a company like Snapchat?Facebook, I always say it\u2019s at least a four-sided platform. They have users, they have advertisers, they have third-party application developers, and then finally they have websites that use the Facebook Connect system \u2014 which is to say that you can log in with your Facebook credentials.Where does a company that is producing professional video or journalism for Facebook \u2014 publishing those directly on Facebook and getting some kind of revenue \u2014 fit in?So, basically they\u2019re adding one extra side, which we can call \u201cpremium content publishers,\u201d broadly. It makes sense, and it\u2019s very similar to the transformation that YouTube has gone through. They went from having pretty much one side \u2014 when they started off, for the first few years, everyone was a user. As a user you could watch videos or post videos. But everyone was the same. Sometimes I watch, sometimes I post; some people just watch, some people just post. But they are all the same users. Now they\u2019ve become a lot more sophisticated, with advertising and revenue sharing, and with professional video producers.If a publication-style business becomes a participant in a marketplace like Facebook, what has changed for it?This has been an ongoing concern. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re an established company, and now there\u2019s a multisided platform in your business, what happens? And say you have to play on that multisided platform, because they\u2019re big and everyone else is playing, so you need to get on top of it. The concern is always commoditization. I think partly it\u2019s true \u2014 what a platform does, to some degree, is introduce a lowest common denominator. In particular, they make the substitution, or the switching cost, between the different players a lot lower. I think that\u2019s undeniable. It\u2019s much easier to switch between, say, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal as a user, and as an advertiser by the way, if those are on top of Facebook.When Amazon emerged as the pre-eminent e-commerce platform, a lot of big companies said, we need to find a way to play with them \u2014 it seems like there\u2019s a lot of e-commerce going on there, and we can\u2019t ignore it, so we need to do something. Toys \u201cR\u201d Us struck a deal that turned out later to be not very advantageous. Initially, it was a good deal for Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, and it gave them access to Amazon\u2019s customers. But afterward what happened was Amazon found ways to take advantage of Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, using the relationship, and its presence on their platform, to start a toy category on Amazon, to figure out how to sell toys on Amazon, and then to invite a lot of competing companies on the same platform to compete with Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, which made it a lot less attractive for them to be there.Essentially, they overlooked the possibility that Amazon would just use them as a way to start a category of toys \u2014 they somehow assumed it would be exclusive, without putting it in the contract. And, obviously, if I\u2019m a platform, of course I don\u2019t want to be exclusive with anyone, right? I mean, that\u2019s the point of a platform. I want to have as much competition between whatever participants as possible.So if we grant some sort of comparison between a publishing partner\u2019s relationship with a large distribution platform and a retailer\u2019s relationship with Amazon, that might sound alarming? How do pre-existing companies typically make the transition from being an independent participant in a particular category to being, basically, a platform constituent? That\u2019s a broad question, but \u2014 is there an industry that might have useful parallels to the media industry with something like a major social platform?I don\u2019t think it\u2019s true that transitioning from independence to life on a platform necessarily has to make things worse. One thing that I think a lot about \u2014 in conversations with venture capitalists and others \u2014 is the notion that platforms or marketplaces inherently commoditize. I think more likely what\u2019s happening is the following: I think platforms, or marketplaces, make it a lot easier for, say, the content providers or app developers that are very, very good to rise to the top, and pretty much commoditize everyone else. So if you\u2019re average, it\u2019s definitely going to be very bad. Life is going to be worse on a platform, because you\u2019re exposed to more competition. If you\u2019re very good, life on a platform is a lot better.It\u2019s a little bit like, if you ask drivers how they rate their driving ability, you know, 80 percent say they\u2019re above average. The important qualifier to what I said earlier, about how the best rise to the top, is that, inherently, the platforms force a lot more specialization than before. Previously, in the independent world, players were able to afford to be a little bit broader. I think the problem is, now, you really have to think very deeply, a lot more carefully \u2014 what, exactly, are the one or two things we\u2019re really good at, and focus on those. So there\u2019s going to be a lot of forced specialization, because on a platform, competition will be vertical by vertical.In a case like Facebook, the content was largely there before \u2014 in the form of links.It makes perfect sense, right, to bring more of that content inside, because they can increase engagement.Things load faster, it\u2019s a better experience, and posts and videos are created with Facebook in mind, which means they might feel better inside the platform.Yes, and they want to do as much as possible \u2014 ideally, for them, they want to get as much content as they can to increase readership. There\u2019s probably a function between the well-being of the platform and the quality of the content that they have.This is harder \u2014 for video games, right now, the large game developers are nonexclusive. They used to be more exclusive, and I think this has decreased over time \u2014 it\u2019s become very hard to convince, say, Electronic Arts to give up the Xbox One market to work with the PlayStation. So that has definitely played against the platforms. Game platforms always try to buy or produce their own games for differentiation, but it\u2019s very hard.A different example, the other way, is online video \u2014 Netflix and Amazon. The problem there is very similar. Everyone has, basically, the same movies by now. So this has pushed Netflix and Amazon to start producing their own content. If I\u2019m one of the original providers \u2014 studios, I guess \u2014 then I\u2019m not happy, because now you have this high-quality production from Netflix and Amazon, who are stealing viewers from you.You take this down to the level of articles and shorter videos, and you have different considerations, no? Especially around exclusivity. I\u2019m trying to imagine any sort of leverage.Well, let\u2019s say the content in question requires a lot less investment. First of all, there\u2019s going to be a lot more competition. It\u2019s very hard to compete with the video game Call of Duty. It\u2019s a lot easier to come up with close substitutes for something that requires a lot less investment. The substitution concern on a platform is a lot higher.The most profound piece of this \u2014 the trend that I find fascinating \u2014 is that every year, people look at this and say, these are the products and services that are right now being transacted on these multisided platforms, but there\u2019s a limit. There\u2019s always higher-level, higher-value products and services that are extremely out of reach. Now we\u2019re saying, oh, there are all these on-demand economy platforms like Taskrabbit, but, surely, this is limited to low-skill labor or things that very easily contractable. The reality is, there will be platforms for pretty much everything \u2014 pretty much any product or service that we can imagine. It\u2019s going to happen.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chorus Lines", "Date": "2016-04-19", "News": "Supported byAuthor\u2019s NoteMost of what I know about writing comes from my experience as a card-carrying chorus boy. Let me explain: This month my third novel was published within days of my debut as a Broadway book co-writer. (For the uninitiated: The \u201cbook\u201d of a musical is the \u201cscript,\u201d a.k.a. the part where the audience checks their Playbills to see when the next song is.) But I didn\u2019t go to college for creative writing, let alone earn an M.F.A. Instead, I played a fish in \u201cThe Little Mermaid,\u201d a polar bear in the \u201cRadio City Christmas Spectacular\u201d and, for a change of pace, an actual human in the Bernadette Peters revival of \u201cGypsy.\u201d Those years spent standing in the wings taught me a great deal about where to find stories, and how to tell them. Here\u2019s what I discovered along the way:Everything that got me picked on in middle school gets me paid now.Thirteen-year-old me was short, \u201csensitive,\u201d and sat with the sopranos in choir. I was prone to singing \u201cSunday in the Park With George\u201d in the back of algebra class \u2014 not the most socially advantageous move for a Midwestern seventh-grade boy \u2014 and, naturally, was deeply unpopular with the lacrosse players (I did coach their girlfriends on how to walk in heels, though). I couldn\u2019t throw a punch, but I could throw a punch line, which remains my most reliable resource as a writer now. Getting teased tends to either harden your shell or sharpen your wit, and my sarcastic \u201cvoice\u201d became a launchpad for my young adult fiction. It\u2019s tough to be the underdog in real life, but everyone roots for him as a fictional hero.Take the note.Musicals are living organisms whose performances change from night to night. Along with the blessing of this most immediate art form comes its own curse. Over the course of a show\u2019s run, actors begin taking long pauses during monologues, dancers start straying from their onstage marks and shows tend to grow lethargic faster than you can say \u201cWednesday matinee audience.\u201d I learned, the hard way, early on to just \u201ctake the note\u201d \u2014 that if my dance captain tells me my energy is lagging in a production number, or that I\u2019m doing some new, weird thing with my arms, to just say thank you and not offer an excuse or explanation. Nobody cares, not really; they\u2019ve got 20 other dancers to monitor and give notes to on any given night. The same principle applied when I began receiving editorial comments on my novels. If your editor sees room for improvement in your work, they\u2019re usually on to something. It\u2019s their job to keep you in line. And to cut your adverbs. Ruthlessly.Confidence is overrated. Courage is underrated.Everything I\u2019ve accomplished that I\u2019m actually proud of was born of initial terror. When, at age 20, I took the bus from Pittsburgh to New York to crash an audition for a Super Bowl halftime show \u2014 wearing, God help me, a green Polo shirt and black tights (not all gay guys are born with a robust fashion gene) \u2014 my knees shook like crazy, but the one thing bigger than my fear was my desire. Same when I began writing books. I was 8 when I was told I had a way with words, which you develop when you\u2019re the last boy picked in gym in a town that favors soccer over Sondheim. If I\u2019d waited till I actually felt \u201cready\u201d to pursue my dreams, I\u2019d never have started.Critics gotta critic.I\u2019ve been in flops that got raves and hits that got panned. My job as a dancer was to keep my head down and show up at work eight shows a week, no matter the reviews. My job as a writer is to keep my chin up and show up at the blank page, no matter what people are saying. In fact, I sort of want to know what they\u2019re saying. The best outsider critiques can help you discover your own bad habits, and I\u2019ll still occasionally have a beer or six and scan my Amazon page. That said, my skin is thin in places, and so I\u2019ve taken to bookmarking the one-star reviews of various classic novels. After a critic doesn\u2019t respond to my own best efforts, it\u2019s comforting to read that \u201cThe Catcher in the Rye\u201d was called \u201cunequivocal trash\u201d by an Internet citizen known as Thanks Nietzsche. To be criticized is to join the club known as your heroes.Everybody is always starting over.There\u2019s nothing like kicking off a brand new year unemployed, which is what happened to the Broadway cast of \u201cChitty Chitty Bang Bang\u201d when we closed on Dec. 31, 2005. A primary lesson of being a dancer is that if you\u2019re lucky enough to be employed, you\u2019ll soon be unlucky enough to be unemployed. Same goes for novelists. Hell hath no fury like a blinking cursor, which might as well be your editor\u2019s index finger jabbing your shoulder to inquire \u201cHow\u2019s the new book coming?\u201d I suppose the reason I\u2019m somewhat comfortable with writing fast, messy first drafts is that I\u2019ve never had a job for longer than a couple of months. When you\u2019re a gypsy, bouncing from job to job, \u201cstarting things\u201d is your specialty. It\u2019s slogging it out to \u201cThe End\u201d that separates the boys from the chorus boys.Tim Federle is the author of the young adult novel \u201cThe Great American Whatever,\u201d and aco-writer, with Claudia Shear, of the book of the Broadway musical \u201cTuck Everlasting.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Intel to Cut 12,000 Jobs as PC Demand Plummets", "Date": "2016-04-19", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Intel, the world\u2019s largest maker of semiconductors, said on Tuesday that it was laying off 12,000 people, about 11 percent of its work force, as it continues to reel from a long downturn in global demand for personal computers.The company\u2019s chief executive, Brian Krzanich, announced the layoffs as part of a larger corporate restructuring, which will result in a $1.2 billion charge. Intel also reported lower-than-expected first-quarter earnings and reduced its projected revenue for the year.\u201cIntel has been known as the PC company,\u201d Mr. Krzanich said in an earnings call with Wall Street analysts. \u201cIt\u2019s time to make this transition and push the company all the way over\u201d to supplying chips for things like smartphones, cloud computing, sensors and other devices.Yet Intel still gets 60 percent of its revenue from chips supplied to PCs, and its profit margins there are not as good as in data center chips, its other major business. The company\u2019s other businesses have small profits, or else lose money.That means PCs are still core to what Intel does. Most of the layoffs, along with things like consolidating facilities and cut projects, are expected to be inside the PC business. Employees who are affected by the restructuring will be notified in the next 60 days, the company said. The layoffs are the largest since 2006, when the company let go 10,500 employees.\u201cThe hope was that PC demand, which has fallen for years, would be flat, and other segments would start filling in,\u201d said Mark Hung, an analyst with Gartner. \u201cThis threw a monkey wrench into that.\u201dFor the first quarter, Intel had net income of $2 billion, or 42 cents a share, and revenue of $13.7 billion. Wall Street analysts had projected that Intel would earn 47 cents a share on revenue of $13.8 billion, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters.Revenue at the PC group fell 14 percent from the previous quarter, indicating Intel had to cut prices as demand fell.Intel faces other potential stumbling blocks. The company is unique as much of the tech industry counts on it continually delivering chips with more transistors for the same money. The process, known as Moore\u2019s Law after Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, has generally happened in two-year intervals. The next generation of chips, however, is likely to arrive in two and a half years, or more, leading to fears that Moore\u2019s Law is slowing.Mr. Krzanich, who previously had played down the significance of his production schedule, took pains on Tuesday to say that Intel wanted to pick up its pace. \u201cWe are continuously striving to get back to two years,\u201d he said.Intel had better do so, Mr. Hung said. \u201cIts competitors don\u2019t seem to be slowing down,\u201d he said. \u201cThey may get to the next generation of chips at the same time as Intel. That would be unheard-of.\u201dBesides cutting its operating expenses by $700 million this year through the restructuring, Intel may be seeking to sell different types of chips in combined ways for better efficiency and profit.\u201cWe\u2019re moving from a company that was at the center of the PC market to being a company at the center of cloud computing,\u201d said Stacy Smith, Intel\u2019s chief financial officer.On Tuesday, Mr. Smith was named to run Intel\u2019s sales, manufacturing and operations, another indication of how Intel needs to tighten its relationship with a few big cloud companies, like Amazon and Microsoft.This would involve integrating the production and sale of things like chips for computer memory along with computer processors. The company also wants to build a business in connecting things like automobiles to cloud computing, and needs to build faster wireless computing technologies for that. Intel added that it would begin a search for a new chief financial officer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook Aims to Drive Down Tech Prices to Expand Its Reach", "Date": "2016-04-24", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, is clear about his vision for his company: He wants to triple the size of his social network, which now has 1.6 billion members.But to reach that new audience, he has to find a way to change telecommunications networks to make connecting to the Internet more affordable, since many of those would-be Facebook users live in developing countries.That could be bad news for the companies that make equipment for those networks, whether they are Silicon Valley giants like Cisco Systems or little widget makers that produce the parts to tie different pieces of the network together.\u201cThere is definitely going to be some pressure, some consolidation\u201d for many tech equipment suppliers, said Akshay Sharma, research director at the technology advisory firm Gartner. \u201cIf you\u2019re in hardware, you\u2019re going to reduce head count from thousands to maybe 10 people, a hundred at most.\u201dNo doubt, Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s grand \u2014 some would say grandiose \u2014 vision could take years to realize. But if he manages to make the way people connect to the Internet more affordable, it would be just the latest instance of how the company has quietly upended the traditional economics of the technology industry.Facebook has changed the way people interact with their friends on the Internet. But less understood outside tech circles is how the social network has come to be perhaps the most aggressive example of a growing number of companies that are unwilling to pay top dollar for products made by traditional technology suppliers.Mr. Zuckerberg has embraced so-called open-source concepts, which have helped him play catch-up with the giant computer networks of companies like Amazon and Google.Open source typically refers to freely shared code or even development plans that companies and people collectively create at a fraction of the price of traditional tech products. Bits of open-source technology can be found in all sorts of things, including Google\u2019s Android operating system and web browsers.Companies like Facebook often contribute to open-source projects since they don\u2019t make money selling products \u2014 instead, they have to buy products that help them offer their service. Keeping tech costs down helps the bottom line.When Facebook reveals the financial results for its most recent quarter on Wednesday, investors will no doubt scrutinize how much the company is spending, particularly since Mr. Zuckerberg has promised to invest more money in searching for new users. One big key to keeping those costs down has been open-source technology.It should not be surprising, then, that Mr. Zuckerberg is relying on open source to reduce the price of building and running the world\u2019s telecommunications networks, a business estimated to be worth about $150 billion a year.\u201cOur rule is 10 times faster or 10 times cheaper or both,\u201d said Jay Parikh, Facebook\u2019s vice president for engineering. \u201cWe want to get a full Facebook experience to every end user, whether that is video, or eventually virtual reality.\u201d\u201cThere is a new force in the system,\u201d said Dave Ward, Cisco\u2019s chief architect. \u201cWe\u2019d rather be on the train than in front of it.\u201dIn the future, Mr. Zuckerberg imagines that \u201ca physical thing, like a TV, will just be a $1 app\u201d inside virtual reality on Facebook, he recently told a conference of software developers building apps for Facebook. But that may be 10 years off, by Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s own admission. People who do not work at Facebook might say it is a fantasy.Facebook even appears willing to turn the price-crushing model on itself. To get virtual reality to every place in the world, Facebook\u2019s Oculus VR headsets, currently $600, may have to cost $5, said Mike Schroepfer, the company\u2019s chief technology officer.Is that another fantasy? For Facebook, getting those costs down could mean controlling the next big communications platform, since Mr. Zuckerberg believes virtual reality may eventually supplant smartphones as a primary connection to the online world.\u201cThe world is making enough phones.

But Facebook would rather control a crucial technology than have to build on top of another company\u2019s products, as it has had to do with PCs and smartphones.\u201cIt\u2019s more opportunity to show ads,\u201d said Danny Sullivan, founder of the technology website Search Engine Land, who is a close watcher of the industry. \u201cIt\u2019s more opportunity to gather data on what we do or who we are connected with. It\u2019s more opportunity to build a new platform where Facebook serves as the broker of connectivity.\u201dAt the same Facebook developers\u2019 conference there were talks on the latest open-source efforts, including an urban wireless network that checks its performance 125,000 times a second, and a long-range wireless system that Facebook says can send a gigabit of data a second, about 10 times the rate of today\u2019s good-performing networks and enough for virtual reality.Both technologies, Mr. Parikh said, will be tested this year, with an eye to releasing them as open-source projects. \u201cWe\u2019ll be into all this stuff,\u201d he said. Facebook does not want to own or sell the gear, he added, but plans to work with \u201chundreds\u201d of local phone companies worldwide on cheaper high-speed connections.But others dismiss some of Facebook\u2019s efforts as hype. \u201cWe are connecting 700 million to 1.5 billion people a year via smartphones and tablets,\u201d said Ulf Ewaldsson, chief technical officer at Ericsson, one of the world\u2019s largest makers of telecommunications hardware.\u201cThey say they can do a 90 percent cost reduction, but that is from phone bills for high-cost customers,\u201d he said. \u201cPoor people need to be covered, and the industry is working on that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "It\u2019s Probably Cheaper on the Web, Adobe\u2019s Online Price Index Shows", "Date": "2016-04-14", "News": "Supported byIs the Internet making everything cheaper?Well, not everything, but a lot of things, according to Adobe, which has come up with a new index to track the price of goods. The company gets its results by crunching data on millions of online transactions it tracks through its online marketing service.The same held true for the price of household appliances like refrigerators and dishwashers. Online, appliance prices dropped 5.7 percent in the year to February, compared with a 2.7 percent decline in the government\u2019s price index equivalent.Furniture and bedding prices showed less of a fall online and in physical stores, but the spread between the two was still wide: a 2.5 percent decline, according to Adobe, compared with a 0.5 decline in the Consumer Price Index.The new price index from Adobe is meant to be a complement to the price index released by the Labor Department, which tracks fewer goods online, offering economists new data points. The numbers released on Thursday were the second monthly numbers from the company.The lower prices suggested by the digital index are good news if you\u2019re in the market for a new television or refrigerator. The index also has implications for our understanding of the wider economy.Austan Goolsbee, a former chairman of President Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, who has been helping Adobe develop its index, said the Adobe figures suggest that the government\u2019s index could be underestimating deflation, or the overall fall in prices, in the economy.\u201cLarge parts of the economy, a fast-growing part, is now e-commerce-oriented,\u201d Mr. Goolsbee said. \u201cAnd Amazon\u2019s prices are much cheaper, and if everybody\u2019s doing their shopping on Amazon, then that should properly be taken into account in the inflation rate in a way it isn\u2019t now.\u201dHe said it could help explain why inflation remained low, for example, despite a booming jobs market.Researchers at the Bureau of Labor Statistics periodically conduct surveys with shoppers to figure out what products they buy and where, and based on those surveys, build a basket of goods. Then each month, inspectors go out to stores to check the prices of those goods \u2014 about 94,000 individual items.To try to keep the basket of goods current, the bureau updates about an eighth of the basket every six months. If consumers report buying items online, those items have a chance of being picked for the basket.But the bureau\u2019s own economists are the first to acknowledge there are several drawbacks to the process. Because these surveys take time, the composition of the basket of goods probably reflects consumer behavior from a few years ago, said Steve Reed, an economist with the bureau\u2019s consumer price program.So the index could lag in reflecting the shift in shopping to the web \u2014 and the lower prices that follow.\u201cIt\u2019s always been the case that we\u2019ve trailed actual consumer behavior,\u201d Mr. Reed said.In comparison, the Adobe index tracks about 1.7 million consumer goods, all online, in real time. It can incorporate new goods quickly, and pick up price trends over days, not just months. For example, data from Black Friday last year showed that TV prices really did fall over all during that holiday weekend. So Black Friday may really be the best time to buy a new TV.And not all online prices were lower. Groceries bought online logged a cumulative inflation of 0.75 percent in the 12 months to February. Over the same period, the Consumer Price Index for that category fell 0.31 percent.That could be because shoppers who do their grocery shopping online tend to skew richer, Ms. Gaffney said, and are less likely to shop around on different sites to find the best prices. Shoppers may also be less likely to invest effort into finding a good deal for a carton of milk online as opposed to, say, a tablet.Over all, though, brick-and-mortar stores are facing pressure to match the low prices of their online rivals. Shoppers regularly use smartphones to compare prices right in the store\u2019s aisles.The importance of online prices will continue to grow as shopping shifts online, Ms. Gaffney. Since the Adobe index was introduced last month, Adobe has begun tracking appliances, toys and furniture, and will continue to add more categories, she said.\u201cA lot of things you\u2019d think aren\u2019t online are starting to move online, like restaurant orders. So it\u2019s always possible that something you think of as purely offline could become more trackable via digital big data,\u201d she said.Still, the government index tracks products we don\u2019t buy online and most likely won\u2019t for a long time, like gas or hospital services. That makes the index a good measure of prices in the wider economy.\u201cPeople will always pay attention to the C.P.I. as a measure of inflation,\u201d Mr. Goolsbee said. \u201cBut I\u2019d think everybody who cares about the cost of living \u2014 like the Fed making monetary decisions, the government making forecasts and people evaluating how incomes have changed in real terms \u2014 have to at least wonder in their minds whether they\u2019re measuring things correctly.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Taking the Stigma Out of Buying Used Electronics", "Date": "2016-04-27", "News": "Supported byTech FixWHEN you sell a used video game console to the retailer GameStop, it goes on a long journey before winding up in the pre-owned section inside a store.The product travels to one of GameStop\u2019s repair facilities, like its enormous refurbishment operations center in Grapevine, Tex., where it undergoes a litany of tests. A used PlayStation, for example, would be checked for every component, from the disc-loading tray to the laser that reads the games. Any malfunctioning component would be replaced, and with the console inspected, cleared of personal data and cleaned, it becomes offered for sale.\u201cWe have to somewhat be like a doctor and ask a lot of questions,\u201d said Bruce Kulp, GameStop\u2019s senior vice president for supply chain and refurbishment. \u201cThe worst thing in our world is to have something go out that\u2019s been pre-owned and a consumer has an issue with it.\u201dThere are no firm numbers indicating how many Americans buy used electronics. About 25 percent of GameStop\u2019s revenue last year consisted of sales of used products, which was flat compared with the previous year. Amazon said that more customers are shopping in its used products store, though it declined to provide numbers. Many organizations dealing with used electronics sell to those that cannot easily afford technology, like public schools or economically disadvantaged countries.Yet used electronics often face a bad rap \u2014 people may lack trust in a pre-owned product because it has been used by someone other than themselves. To see whether such stigma is warranted, I compared the pre-owned products programs of three retailers: Amazon, GameStop and Gazelle. My takeaway is that you can buy pre-owned products from reputable brands with as much confidence as you might buy a used car from a certified dealer.Glenn Ramsdell, director of Amazon\u2019s Warehouse Deals, said every item was checked by hand for its physical and functional condition. A wireless speaker, for example, would be tested for its connectivity features and checked for included accessories; repairs are made if necessary.Then the items get a grade. \u201cLike new\u201d means it was probably untouched and in perfect condition; \u201cvery good\u201d describes an item that was well cared for and lightly used; a \u201cgood\u201d item might show signs of wear and tear but works perfectly; and \u201cacceptable\u201d would be something that has cosmetic issues like scratches and dents but otherwise works.Dave Maquera, the president of Gazelle, said that similar to the inspection programs used by certified pre-owned car dealers, Gazelle\u2019s process creates a new level of confidence in buying used phones and computers. Though he declined to provide specific numbers, he noted that sales of used devices to consumers had jumped a double-digit percentage compared to last year.At GameStop, the product testing gets intense. Mr. Kulp, the supply chain executive, said the company takes up to 100 game consoles a month, refurbishes them and puts them through stress tests, running them for thousands of hours to see if its repairs are long-lasting. These test units are never sold to consumers.\u201cIt\u2019s just like the way a car company would do a crash test,\u201d he said.As for used video games, the company buffs out any light scratches from the discs, but if the game is so deeply scratched that it becomes unplayable, it heads to the shredder.The trade-offs for buying used games at GameStop are fairly obvious. For one, after a new game releases, you will have to wait awhile to buy it used: In other words, you will be a late adopter. For another, the product will probably lack its original packaging and there might be light cosmetic wear. But for the average consumer, all that matters is that your gaming experience will be exactly the same as if you had bought the product new.What if something goes wrong? Amazon and GameStop give customers 30 days to return used products, the same amount of time they allow for returns of new products. Gazelle offers a free 30-day warranty for each device and the option to buy an extended warranty.Consumers should always consider checking out the used section of retailers for most electronics, including smartphones, laptops and desktop computers, said Dr. Mars of the Sustainability Consortium. In my personal experience buying used video games, computers and even home gadgets like vacuum cleaners from GameStop, Gazelle and Amazon, I have never regretted buying used items.But Dr. Mars said to beware of buying used televisions and computer monitors, since a lot more can go wrong with larger screens than with computer equipment. The jury is also still out on buying used wearable devices like Fitbit trackers because they make up a fairly new category, she added.\u201cTurn over that old device so that somebody can get a second life out of it,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for it to go into a drawer.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Chic Businesses Are Abandoning Landlines", "Date": "2016-04-20", "News": "Supported byTo New Yorkers, greater Mulberry Street is typically considered NoLIta, unless it\u2019s northern Chinatown, or to those old enough to remember Sinatra at the Paramount, Little Italy.Maybe now it\u2019s time to scrap those distinctions and give it a new nickname: NoPho, for no phones.\u201cI don\u2019t need it, so I don\u2019t have it,\u201d said Brendon Babenzien, Noah\u2019s owner, referring to a landline phone in the store during a call that took several days to arrange. \u201cI don\u2019t have a landline at home, either.\u201dIt is no secret that tweens and millennials long ago decided that person-to-person phone calls were decidedly retro, and not in that fashionable old-Dylan-vinyl-albums way.It\u2019s different for businesses, which presumably want to keep as many channels of potential customer interaction open as possible. Even online behemoths like Zappos have made their live call centers a cornerstone of their business (their parent company, Amazon, less so).At least some forward-thinking proprietors prefer the online algorithms to handle the busywork \u2014 reservations, directions \u2014 so they can carve out time to run a restaurant.This shift from the phone to the Internet dovetails with a speakeasy-chic ethos that has long been a part of New York night life. Over the last decade or so, there was Milk & Honey, a temple of mixology hidden behind a Lower East Side storefront. Milk & Honey was almost impossible to find, and even harder to book with its unlisted phone number, exchanged like a secret handshake among in-the-know types.Even before that, in the \u201990s, Keith McNally\u2019s Balthazar \u2014 then a white-hot nexus of the celebrity class and the media elite \u2014 was known to have a secret insiders-only reservations number, which could actually help power brokers secure a table.Nowadays, withholding a phone altogether can still help foster, in some small way, a sense of clubby exclusivity.At Two Hands, the cafe on Mulberry Street that emphasizes its \u201ccommunity focus\u201d on its website, the lack of a phone functions as a velvet rope, allowing management to make sure it can accommodate neighborhood regulars before day-trippers looking to call ahead for reservations.\u201cWe have a lot of locals, we know their names, they say hi, we have a conversation,\u201d said Nick Duckworth, a surfer-ish young manager during a recent visit, as diners sampled dishes like ricotta toast with coconut and chia amid hanging lamps modeled after puffy clouds and walls covered with framed art.\u201cEveryone\u2019s welcome, and no one deserves to call ahead and reserve,\u201d he said. \u201cIt all comes back to community.\u201dAnd at Noah, in a space as coolly minimalist as a West Chelsea art gallery, shoppers never need fear a phone call violating their discerning appreciation of the Earth Uber Alles T-shirts and shoes trimmed with pony fur.\u201cPeople come in, they like the music we\u2019re playing, they have a nice conversation,\u201d Mr. Babenzien said. \u201cA ringing phone is really disruptive to the vibe.\u201dBesides, patrons have other options to connect. Many options. In addition to email, which itself seems old-fashioned these days, many restaurants, for example, now interact with customers continuously through Instagram and Twitter (say, exchanging snapshots of the latest specials).Unlike a phone or email, \u201cthose channels give people a feel of a person\u2019s presence,\u201d said Jason Wang, who tweets and \u2019grams with the fervor of a Kardashian in support of his buzzed-about regional Chinese restaurant chain, Xi\u2019an Famous Foods.This is not to say that dumping the phone always makes life easier. There are, after all, times when shoppers actually want to get someone on the phone quickly (say, to check if a certain item is in stock), instead of sending an email and praying for a response that may or may not come.Mr. Marazzo decided to go phone-free at Virgola, based on his experiences as a headwaiter at a prominent New York restaurant.\u201cEveryone calls with these crazy requests: \u2018I\u2019m coming with a group,\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m coming with a celebrity,\u2019\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cFifty percent of the time they don\u2019t show up.

And the extremely brief window for keeping \u201cLemonade\u201d \u2014 a so-called video album whose one-hour companion film had its premiere on HBO on Saturday night \u2014 restricted to Tidal shows how intense the pressure is for a star of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s stature to reach as many fans as she can.For Beyonc\u00e9, and for the business closely monitoring her moves, the effect of \u201cLemonade\u201d was not immediately clear on Sunday.

{"Headline": "J.F.K. at Dawn\u2019s Early Light of Reality TV", "Date": "2016-04-22", "News": "Supported byOn DVDRonald Reagan was a movie star who became a politician; John F. Kennedy was a politician who took on the glamour of a movie star.The process began before Senator Kennedy\u2019s election to the presidency in 1960, when he gave Robert Drew, a producer of news films for Time Inc., permission to document his campaign during the Wisconsin primary. Kennedy\u2019s opponent, Senator Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota, had no choice but to follow that lead.Of the four, \u201cPrimary\u201d has the most historical value \u2014 not just as a record of Kennedy in campaign mode but also as a pioneering example of American cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9. In 1961, Film Culture magazine awarded \u201cPrimary\u201d its third independent film award, for heralding an era \u201cwhen a filmmaker can shoot his film, with sound, alone and by himself and unobtrusively, almost the same way as a poet observing a scene.\u201dCertainly, \u201cPrimary\u201d helped change the nature of documentary filmmaking. Empowered by hand-held cameras and portable sound equipment, three members of Mr. Drew\u2019s team \u2014 Richard Leacock, Albert Maysles and D. A. Pennebaker \u2014 would soon be recognized as leading practitioners of the form.Cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 supported the sense, prevalent in the 1960s (and again current with reality TV) that life itself was a sort of movie. Anything captured on film was part of the spectacle; anyone was potentially worth watching. Thus \u201cPrimary\u201d is mainly a study in personality types. Humphrey, whose first conversation with a supporter includes an enthusiastic \u201cYou betcha!,\u201d seems like a character out of \u201cFargo,\u201d while Kennedy, a magnet for crowds, already has the aura of a celebrity. Each campaign has its own theme song, both adopted from soundtracks: Humphrey\u2019s reworked \u201cThe Ballad of Davy Crockett,\u201d from a Disney television mini-series, while Kennedy\u2019s peppier anthem drew on \u201cHigh Hopes,\u201d from the 1959 Frank Sinatra film \u201cA Hole in the Head.\u201dKennedy, not surprisingly, was pleased and, once president, facilitated a second Drew documentary. Broadcast early in his administration, \u201cAdventures on the New Frontier\u201d is basically a puff piece; its most revealing scoop is the self-portrait Kennedy has up in the Oval Office. \u201cCrisis,\u201d produced two and a half years later, is more performative \u2014 although here Kennedy is upstaged by Alabama\u2019s new governor, George C. Wallace.An inflammatory segregationist, Wallace flew the Confederate flag over his statehouse and promised to defy federal law by personally turning away any black student who tried to integrate the University of Alabama. As with \u201cPrimary,\u201d Mr. Drew secured permission to document both sides of the conflict.Wallace postures and invokes the Civil War, while Kennedy; his brother Robert, at the time the attorney general; and Nicholas Katzenbach, the deputy attorney general, map their legal strategy. The promised physical confrontation never occurs. Instead, the movie ends with the president, in a televised address to the nation, taking a personal stand against segregation. (Hours later, the N.A.A.C.P. leader Medgar Evers was assassinated in Mississippi, a political murder that the movie does not mention.)Shown at the first New York Film Festival on a program with Robert Bresson\u2019s \u201cThe Trial of Joan of Arc,\u201d and subsequently broadcast by ABC, \u201cCrisis\u201d was not well received. The New York Times television critic Jack Gould called it \u201ca prime example of governmental surrender to the ceaseless and often thoughtless demands of the entertainment world.\u201d If, in some ways, \u201cCrisis\u201d remains current, Mr. Gould\u2019s criticism is even more so.\u201cPanic in Year Zero!,\u201d a quintessential Kennedy-era movie, was released to drive-ins by American-International in the summer of 1962 (on a double bill with Roger Corman\u2019s \u201cTales of Terror\u201d). Now on disc from Kino Lorber, it anxiously ponders both the threat of nuclear war and the survival of the nuclear family.Mr. Milland, who also directed the film, plays the paterfamilias with a dyspeptic bossiness appropriate to his dual capacity. Thanks to his unrelenting grouchiness, \u201cPanic\u201d is an occasionally risible nightmare version of \u201cFather Knows Best,\u201d but the temper of the times may be gauged by the tone of Variety\u2019s reviewer: \u201cThe aftermath of a nuclear attack is the subject pursued by this serious, sobering and engrossing film.\u201d Like a documentary waiting to happen.NEWLY RELEASEDAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Regulators Approve Charter Communications Deal for Time Warner Cable", "Date": "2016-04-25", "News": "Supported byYet, the orders to approve the deals were coupled with many restrictions that illustrate how regulators are increasingly using their power to further policy goals that are not covered by current regulations for the industry. The Federal Communications Commission and Justice Department imposed mandates on the acquisitions aimed at protecting streaming video companies and providing cheaper broadband services to low-income families, some of which go far beyond regulations for the entire cable and Internet sectors.Mr. Wheeler circulated his approval order to other F.C.C. commissioners and was expected to get enough votes to close the deals. The deals still await final approval from regulators in California.\u201cEach player has a lot more scale to shape broadband and online video going forward,\u201d said Amy Yong, an analyst with Macquarie. \u201cAbout 80 to 90 percent of broadband homes are now in the homes of three players. It is starting to look like a tri-opoly.\u201dThis time, the F.C.C. and Justice Department asked Charter to agree to abstain from negotiations with programmers that would keep shows and movies off competing streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.Charter also promised that for seven years it would not impose data caps on broadband users who can run up big bills when watching online video, and that it would not charge companies like Netflix extra to connect to Charter customers. In addition, Charter agreed to expand its Internet footprint to two million more homes and to offer a cheaper broadband service to low-income households.Justin Venech, a Charter spokesman, said in a statement that the conditions ensured the company\u2019s \u201ccurrent consumer-friendly and pro-broadband business practices,\u201d adding that the combined entity \u201cwill be a leading competitor in the broadband and video markets.\u201dRegulatory approval would be a major win for Charter, which had circled Time Warner Cable for the last three years. Comcast stepped in with a rival bid for Time Warner Cable that collapsed under regulatory pressure last year. After that, Charter announced its pair of deals for Time Warner Cable and Bright House in May 2015.The approvals will have enormous implications on the telecommunications, media and technology ecosystem, with the combined company set to have greater influence over program pricing, new technologies in broadband infrastructure, and business models emerging in streaming video. Consumers have also come to rely on the Internet as a utility, but see prices increase with few options for providers.On Monday, Dish declined to comment on the regulators\u2019 move to approve the Charter deals. Dish is part of the Stop Mega Cable Coalition, which was formed to raise awareness of the harms that could result from the deals, and which on Monday said in a statement that the conditions proposed by the F.C.C. fell short of \u201caddressing all of the threats to competition and consumers posed by this transaction.\u201dThe coalition said Charter should be required to offer a stand-alone broadband service.Some consumer advocates also opposed any approval of the deals, fearing that a combined entity would eliminate competition and increase prices for customers.\u201cCreating broadband monopoly markets raises consumer costs, kills competition, and points a gun at the heart of the news and information that democracy depends upon,\u201d Michael Copps, a former Democratic member of the F.C.C. and a special adviser to the Common Cause public interest group, wrote in an email. \u201cF.C.C. approval of this unnecessary merger would be an abandonment of its public interest responsibilities.\u201dThe F.C.C. has the broad mandate of protecting the public interest, which gives it the ability to create conditions that may seem unrelated to antitrust reviews but could make a deal good for consumers, said Gene Kimmelman, a former antitrust official at the Justice Department who is now president of Public Knowledge, a nonprofit media advocacy group.\u201cOffering to extend their broadband footprint and offer subsided broadband to some low income customers furthers existing F.C.C. policy efforts and serves the public interest,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article gave an outdated value for the Charter Communications deals.

{"Headline": "Dude, Where\u2019s My City?", "Date": "2016-04-01", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 I tend to ignore the usual measurements of what makes a city robust and healthy, the urban bragging points. Along the West Coast, these superlatives roll out with regularity. Seattle, two years ago, was proclaimed the fastest growing city in the United States. San Francisco usually tops the list of most expensive places to live. And Portland, Ore., just posted the highest percentage rise in home prices among major cities.This is great, for realtors and tax collectors. Hooray \u2014 we\u2019re shiny, new and less affordable than most cities of the world! Try the kale smoothie.I look for something else: Could Kramer still live in my city? Yeah, Kramer, the \u201cSeinfeld\u201d character who never held a real job, but had a fairly cool apartment. His source of income was suspect. His schemes were sitcom-absurd. His ambition was, I don\u2019t know, to publish a coffee-table book about coffee tables.Every town needs its Kramers. And in Seattle, where I was born and still live, where my grandmother spent her last days in subsidized housing with a view of Puget Sound, I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re losing ours.Job growth is steroidal. The big urban carnivore is Amazon.com, with its global headquarters now gobbling up enough office space in the formerly funky South Lake Union district to fill almost two skyscrapers the size of the city\u2019s tallest building, the 76-story Columbia Center. Twice that amount is in the pipeline, as Amazon seeks to become the world\u2019s largest retailer. Google just announced grand plans for the same neighborhood. A metro area of 3.5 million is adding 60,000 people a year.Growth, even the metastatic kind, is usually trumpeted with a lot of rah-rah. The opposite \u2014 the sad decline of a Detroit, a Cleveland or a Baltimore \u2014 is much worse. So who wouldn\u2019t want the fresh money and talent flowing into the vibrant urban centers of the West Coast? Well, this city. And Portland. And San Francisco as well.Rising rents threaten to push out the quirky and creative types who make these places eternally young and resilient. You saw the pattern in Brooklyn \u2014 that urban tipping point. An average wage earner living in Brooklyn would somehow have to spend 120 percent of his or her monthly income to make rent.In the Bay Area, there\u2019s a desperate effort to keep the last un-gentrified neighborhoods from being taken over by techies, a quixotic mission. In Portland, where young people go to retire, that Krameresque option is fading. What\u2019s next: homeless hipsters in \u201cPortlandia\u201d? It\u2019s already happening. And here in Seattle, it can seem like Amazon is a large foreign presence growing inside of us \u2014 a transplant that has yet to take.During a laser-vision-clear spring week like we\u2019re having now, a forest of construction cranes blocks views of the snowcapped Olympic Mountains to the west of the clangorous technopolis. The views, at least, used to be free. A downtown neighborhood that once featured a bar with a 6 a.m. happy hour and a refuge for sailors called the Catholic Seamen\u2019s Club is now better known for the gleaming new building that was home to the overcompensated creep in \u201cFifty Shades of Grey.\u201dFor all of that, bald eagles nest in city parks and boys and girls in boats still glide over Lake Washington. On Puget Sound\u2019s shore, a working waterfront remains, with foghorns and a briny grittiness. Nature has not been entirely neutered.Seattle used to want to be like San Francisco, albeit with six months of steady rain. No more. What\u2019s become of San Francisco \u2014 the nation\u2019s most childless city, traffic that is frozen all hours of the day, a surfeit of sketchy and unprosecuted property crimes, and 4,300 people on the street \u2014 is nothing to duplicate. Talented young people are living in tents, garages, vans, even a wooden box, home for someone paying $400 a month for said confinement. Kramer would need a trust fund.I\u2019m not against the brogrammers walking the canyons of the Amazon compound in Seattle. I welcome the newcomers who challenge the civic xenophobia of the natives. I\u2019m proud to share a hometown with a philanthropy attempting to give away more money than any private entity has ever tried to do. Two of the great stories of modern America \u2014 Amazon and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation \u2014 define the Seattle of 2016.But I also wonder if there is any way to slow or mitigate the pace of change, to ensure that the city\u2019s soul is not swept out by the new. How do you contain the excesses of entrepreneurial capitalism and nurture the things you like \u2014 original music, food, businesses and literature, affordable homes for cops and Kramers? Unfettered growth just produces more inequality. So does taxing the middle class to death.A great city has to give space for people to fail, for its Kramers. Other places, much older than the urban adolescents on the West Coast, have grappled with these same problems, with limited success. But that\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s still so invigorating about the West \u2014 the past has never been seen as a barrier to inventing a better future.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cloud Services Show Their Value in Earnings Reports", "Date": "2016-04-29", "News": "Supported byBitsThe star of the show was Amazon Web Services, or AWS, that cloud business. Amazon breaks out that sector from the rest of its business, and it makes for impressive reading: Operating income as a percentage of sales for Amazon\u2019s retail business was 3 percent; for AWS it was 24 percent.AWS is still a relatively small part of the company\u2019s total business, but that outsize profitability is reshaping Amazon. Over all, the company\u2019s operating income is 3.6 percent of revenue, but that is up from 1.1 percent a year ago. A big reason is that AWS has doubled its profitability.Cloud computing makes a lot of money in part by automating things: A large data center, supplying potentially thousands of customers, may be run by just a half-dozen people. The people engineering these systems have become very clever about running them efficiently too, devising special semiconductors and software.Google and Facebook are also cloud-based companies, though for now they get most of their money from advertising.As we near the end of the tech earnings season, it is useful to look at net income earned per employee at the company. Microsoft had profits of about $32,200 per person in the quarter, a healthy performance considering how many employees it still has in older businesses. It came in just ahead of Goldman Sachs, on a profit per employee basis.There are two lessons from that: If you do sell retail products, it helps to sell highly profitable fetish objects, like iPhones \u2014 which, not incidentally, have a lot of value because of the cloud-based apps running on them.And if you are selling bargain retail, it\u2019s a very good idea to be in the cloud computing business, too.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Dyson Wants to Create a Hair Dryer Revolution", "Date": "2016-04-27", "News": "Supported byWILTSHIRE, England \u2014 Sir James Dyson, the British designer and engineer, sporting sneakers, cobalt blue spectacles and a voluminous thatch of silvery hair, stood in his vast glass office in the depths of the English countryside one recent Tuesday afternoon. He was clutching a device that he contends could change the monotony of bathroom routines forever.\u201cThere has been zero innovation in this market for over 60 years,\u201d said Mr. Dyson, 68, a billionaire who was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2006.\u201cMillions of people use contraptions daily that are hideously inefficient, waste their time and are causing them long-term damage,\u201d he said. \u201cWe realized that we could \u2014 and should \u2014 sort this situation out.\u201dHe triumphantly held up what appeared to be a sleek black and pink plastic doughnut on a stick. \u201cFour years, 100 odd patents and 600 prototypes later, I think we might have found the answer.\u201d11 PhotosKnown as the Dyson Supersonic and unveiled in Tokyo on Wednesday, the device is his response to a question many never thought to ask: Is it possible to make a better hair dryer?This may not seem like a big deal. A few burned scalps and frizz issues aside, people have been doing just fine with the standard hair dryer for decades. But, as Dai Fujiwara, a Japanese fashion designer who collaborated with Mr. Dyson on an Issey Miyake runway presentation, wrote in an email, \u201cBecause everyday life is too common, people rarely realize there is a problem.\u201dAbout 92 percent of British women regularly use a hair dryer (according to the consultancy Mintel), while 75.5 percent of all women and 24.5 percent of men in the United States and 97 percent of women and 30 percent of men in Japan use one (according to Dyson), and most spend an average of 20 minutes on each session. So changing even a small percentage of that behavior could have outsize repercussions.Mr. Dyson, Britain\u2019s best-known living inventor, is the Steve Jobs of domestic appliances. He has built a fortune from making otherwise standard products seem aesthetically desirable, in the process persuading untold numbers of consumers that they really, really want cordless and bagless vacuum cleaners, air purifiers, bladeless fans and even household robots.\u201cHis inventions are disruptive \u2014 beautifully so,\u201d said Terence Conran, the British restaurateur, retailer and furniture designer. \u201cWho would have imagined that a bagless vacuum cleaner could become a highly covetable status symbol? He has made other businesses think differently about how to use design, creativity and innovation.\u201dMr. Dyson studied furniture design and architecture at the Royal College of Art in London. He is currently provost there. \u201cHis advocacy for the discipline and for British manufacturing has had a profound influence on the British national psyche,\u201d said Dr. Paul Thompson, rector of the Royal College. Now Mr. Dyson is trying to extend that influence into hitherto unchartered territory: the global beauty and grooming sector.Dyson said there were 103 engineers involved in the creation of the Supersonic, which included the taming of over 1,010 miles of human hair tresses and 7,000 acoustic tests as teams tackled three core issues: noise, weight and speed.Ground zero for the project was the Dyson research facility, a Willy Wonka-like world deep in the rolling Wiltshire hills, with a Harrier fighter jet and spliced Mini car in the visitors\u2019 parking lot.Projects are kept firmly under lock and key from virtually all outsiders \u2013 as well as many within the walls itself (which, like those owned by Roald Dahl\u2019s flamboyant fictional chocolate factory owner, are often painted a lurid purple).Matt Kelly was one of many young engineers milling around the plant in near identikit uniforms of hoodies, jeans and sneakers or battered brogues. \u201cYou can sit next to someone in the cafeteria here for years and not have the first idea what they are working on, and they will have no clue what you do, either,\u201d Mr. Kelly said. \u201cDiscretion and an ability to keep secrets are essential traits if you want to work at Dyson.\u201dEspecially when doing something so counterintuitive as moving from the practical question of what to use to clean carpets to the more touchy-feely question of what to use to style a personal image.Ed Shelton, a design manager for the Supersonic, said: \u201cIt was the hardest project I\u2019ve ever worked on. Beyond having to crack the science of hair, we\u2019ve had to tackle a highly subjective user psychology.\u201cTrust me when I say there are many more approaches and angles to blow-drying than vacuuming in the world. British women want volume. Japanese women want straightness. No one wants hair damage. And then we had to create a fleet of robots specifically to test that over and over again.\u201dThe company says the key to the Supersonic is its high-speed 13-blade motor. About the size of a quarter, the motor is small enough to fit in the base of the hair dryer handle, rather than in the conventional motor position at the top of the device, a shift that creates its unorthodox streamlined aesthetic.The smaller motor allows for high velocity flow but not pressure, the company says, which is how temperatures shoot up on traditional hair dryers and users burn themselves if the dryer is too close to the head.The company says the positioning of the motor in the hand also limits the so-called dumbbell effect of old-guard models, where top-heavy weighting can cause arms to ache. Weighing just 370 grams, the new structure allows for a longer silencer tube and smaller fan, cutting down drastically on noise.Coupled with the high motor speed, the fusion of new technologies gives rise to Dyson claims that the sound waves can operate at an ultrasonic level \u2013 in other words, at frequencies higher than the upper audible limit for humans. It also has magnetic heatproof nozzles and intelligent heat sensors to prevent hair burn.\u201cFrankly, I\u2019m rather terrified,\u201d Mr. Dyson said. \u201cWe had to learn a great deal with the Supersonic, and there have been a lot of firsts on all fronts, including the fact that I had to grow my hair especially for a launch.\u201d\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been this long since my \u201960s student days, when I wore flowered shirts and flares,\u201d Mr. Dyson said.Despite his newly flowing locks, both Dyson the man and Dyson the company are conscious that they may not come across as the most convincing of beauty gurus.Consequently, the company has enlisted the services of Jen Atkin, a celebrity hairstylist with a client Rolodex that includes Kim Kardashian, Jessica Alba and Katy Perry and a social media following of millions. Her job is to decode the appliance and its styling power to viewers via online tutorials following the introduction (i.e., she\u2019s a brand ambassador), but her input was also instrumental in its creation.Jake Dyson, the oldest son of Mr. Dyson and heir apparent to the Dyson helm, said the company understood that personal care \u201cwas a radically different market from the ones we are used to competing in. Cleaning floors is much less glamorous than styling hair.\u201dMs. Atkin, who can see up to 30 clients a day, said she had initially begun the relationship by \u201cgiving her two cents\u201d to Dyson engineers on the model and what it needed.\u201cThat back-heavy feeling that usually makes your arms ache completely disappears with this, whether working on your own hair or blow drying someone else,\u201d she said. \u201cFor me, or any woman, that is a game changer. This is the \u2018break the Internet\u2019 dryer.\u201dAs with any other Dyson device, research and development didn\u2019t come cheap: The investment, including a state-of-the-art hair laboratory, reached \u00a350 million (about $72 million).As a result, the Supersonic will retail at $399 when it arrives in the United States at Sephora stores in September, a price at stark odds with the low-priced high-volume business model that has traditionally defined the competitive hair dryer market.Currently, hair dryers sold by Amazon in the United States retail for $12.99 to $219.98.Still, Dyson has a convincing track record in persuading fans to pay hundreds of dollars on domestic status symbols that spend most of their working lives in the cupboard under the stairs or next to the dog basket.So the hair dryer stakes are high and the market deeply fragmented, not least by the popularity of newer hand-held electrical appliances like straightening irons and curling tongs. Can Dyson really pull off another product revolution?\u201cThis all does feel a lot more personal than usual,\u201d Mr. Dyson said. \u201cWhich I suppose makes me a little nervous. But actually, I have found everything we are learning with the Supersonic very exciting. It\u2019s the start of a new push into this sector for us. Though I can\u2019t tell you more than that.\u201dWhat he can say is that the company is set to spend \u00a31.5 billion (about $2.2 billion) investing in future technology and recently announced the development of four new portfolio sectors. While bullish, he also knows that not all his 21st-century inventions could be winners.\u201cI actually believe that success teaches you nothing; failures teach you everything,\u201d he said, surrounded by sketches and prototypes in his meticulously cluttered office. One hundred new products are in the pipeline in the next four years around the world, he said. The hair dryer is just the beginning.\u201cFor decades, people have just accepted a subpar experience because no one was offering them anything else,\u201d said Stephen Courtney, concepts director at Dyson and a leader on the hair project. The company wants to change that, one locker room, spa and beauty salon at a time.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Twitter Gains Rights to Stream Thursday N.F.L. Games", "Date": "2016-04-05", "News": "Supported byLeave it to the N.F.L. to sell the same product three times.A decade ago, the league began showing Thursday night games on its fledgling NFL Network. Then CBS, and later NBC, agreed to pay the league hundreds of millions of dollars a year for the right to broadcast some of those games as well.The games shown on Twitter will be the CBS or NBC broadcasts, depending on which network is showing the game, and will include pre- and postgame highlights only available on Twitter. Twitter and the N.F.L. have not announced how the games will look on individual feeds.The partnership speaks volumes about the power of the country\u2019s most powerful sports league, which wants to expand its footprint overseas and reach younger consumers who may never pay for a cable or satellite package, or even own a television.It also illuminates the sharp-elbowed race to survive in Silicon Valley, where Twitter and other technology companies like Facebook, Amazon and Netflix are rushing to find ways to offer consumers must-see content everywhere and at any time. By joining a sports behemoth that garners the highest ratings in television, Twitter hopes to pump air back into its sagging fortunes.\u201cThey need to give people more reasons to come back to Twitter to get their info-of-the-day fix,\u201d said Eric Jackson, managing director of SpringOwl Asset Management and a close watcher of the company. \u201cIf these N.F.L. games go well, they can expand into other types of content and give users more reasons to spend more time on Twitter properties each day.\u201dMajor League Baseball, the N.B.A. and other sports leagues already stream national packages of games for $100 or more a season. But they, like the N.F.L., will be watching to see how fans consume games on their smartphones and tablets and whether the alliance with Twitter can generate profits.Even as the nation\u2019s largest sports league with $13 billion in annual revenue, the N.F.L. is trying to anticipate shifts in the media landscape. For decades, the league has relied on a tested model: Collect billions of dollars from television networks that broadcast games for free over the air, or from cable and satellite networks.Most of the league\u2019s television agreements with these networks expire in the next five years, so the N.F.L. wants to find new ways to market its games for the next generation of fans.\u201cThere are huge swaths of young people who never watch broadcast television,\u201d said Ed Desser, a sports media consultant. The streaming experiment \u201callows them to plan ahead.\u201dFor now, along with appearing on Twitter\u2019s mobile and desktop apps, the company said it will show games on video game consoles that use Twitter apps, such as Microsoft\u2019s Xbox.At the N.F.L.\u2019s annual meeting last month, league executives told team owners and executives that the biggest opportunities for new revenue would come from digital and international businesses. Selling the streaming rights to live games to Twitter appears to fill both of those categories, without upsetting CBS, NBC and other networks that pay dearly for media rights.To assuage them, Twitter will show the networks\u2019 ads. But to make money it will sell ads for the time normally reserved for local spots. This let Twitter pay less than it might have otherwise, and it will allow NBC and CBS to reach more viewers.\u201cThe attraction wasn\u2019t just revenue, it was a reach decision,\u201d said Joe Lockhart, a league spokesman. Other bidders, he added, had offered more money than Twitter.By signing a one-year deal with Twitter, the N.F.L. will retain the flexibility to look elsewhere for the long run.Roger Goodell, the N.F.L.\u2019s commissioner, announced the deal, appropriately enough, on his Twitter feed, his first Tweet in 19 months.The league might have had a receptive ear at Twitter. The company\u2019s chief financial officer, Anthony Noto, held the same position at the N.F.L. from February 2008 to October 2010.The move is a significant strategic shift for Twitter, which last month celebrated its 10th anniversary. While Twitter has grown to hundreds of millions of regular users, for years the company has been on a quest to boost its slowing growth by making significant changes to the product and by spending millions in marketing campaigns.So far, little has helped. Twitter user growth was flat at the end of 2015, compared to the third quarter of the year, at 320 million monthly visitors.\u201cWe wanted to focus on what we do best,\u201d Noto said, explaining the sports push. For Twitter, he added, that focus was \u201clive\u201d content.The league experimented with live-streaming last season when Yahoo paid about $20 million for the rights to show a Buffalo Bills-Jacksonville Jaguars game played in London in October. In a sop to its broadcast partners and fans, the Bills-Jaguars game was still shown on television in the Buffalo and Jacksonville markets.But streaming games free to the more than 180 countries where Twitter is available might attract fans in places where the N.F.L. does not have major broadcast partners.But according to one mathematical conversion that Yahoo disputes, the 15.2 million unique users for the Bills-Jaguars game amounts to the television equivalent of 2.36 million average viewers, about 1.6 million of whom were in the United States.Still, Twitter hopes that the magnetism of the N.F.L. provides them with a sorely needed boost.\u201cThis to me is much more about publicity and marketing for Twitter than selling ads,\u201d said Richard Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG Research.Advertisement"}

Early on, one editor in the Metro section, Jack Kadden, leaned over my shoulder as I was running late on a 500-word story about a hearing for a riverfront park and warned, \u00e2\u0080\u009cRevkin, this ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t no seed catalog.\u00e2\u0080\u009d (He later told me he picked up this expression from Susan Edgerley, a rapid-fire editor fondly nicknamed \u00e2\u0080\u009cEdge.\u00e2\u0080\u009d)The original logo reflected that conundrum.But then came a twist. In one phone call with the newsroom, from the sea ice, an editor suggested we do an online forum for readers. Questions would be solicited on The Times\u00e2\u0080\u0099s homepage. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099d call to relay them and type out my answers.It was funky, for sure, but it gave me my first taste of the interactivity with audiences that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve enjoyed, and benefited from, ever since.Is This the Right Room for an Argument?All along, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve grappled with the eternal problem of fostering constructive commentary and dialogue in an online world quick to devolve into name-calling.Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the most germane part of the resulting exchange between Michael Palin (Man) and John Cleese (Arguer):M: An argument isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just contradiction.A: It can be.M: No it can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. An argument is a connected series of statements intended to establish a proposition.A: No it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the first one, from Wang Suya in Tokyo:I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d love to find a way to revive this practice. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m convinced that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s harder to sling mud when you see the person you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re debating.The challenges in blogging, and managing commentary, persist.On Dot Earth, some regulars immediately gamed the system, posting strings of comments, while others sat in a queue awaiting my approval (which often happens too slowly because of my work flow).There is hope for the world.I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d love your input on next steps.

{"Headline": "\u2018Horace and Pete,\u2019 Keeping You on the Edge of Your Seat, Right Up to Last Call", "Date": "2016-04-04", "News": "Supported byCritic's NotebookOn Saturday, he sent another message, in what was by now a weekly series, that \u201cEpisode 10\u201d was available. Not until the episode\u2019s wrenching conclusion and the postcredits curtain call was it clear this stunning experiment was over. It felt too soon.For 10 weeks the series used television\u2019s simplest and oldest format, actors on a stage, to suggest new possibilities for what the medium can become.Before I begin the spoilers, a word to readers who haven\u2019t seen the show. Maybe you haven\u2019t watched because \u201cHorace and Pete\u201d costs money: $31 for the full season. (Louis C. K. sold the episodes weekly through louisck.net, starting at $5, dipping to $2, then settling at $3 apiece.)Is it worth it? For $31, you could buy a generous round of beers at a Brooklyn dive like the one in the series, or a couple of schmancy cocktails at one of the hipster bo\u00eetes are crowding out that sort of place. It\u2019s more expensive than a month of Netflix or Hulu, but cheaper than a typical night of theater, to which the \u201cHorace\u201d experience is comparable. It\u2019s about what you\u2019d pay for a season of many series on iTunes and better than most of them.I can\u2019t set your budget, but I can say that if you\u2019re willing to pay for art that challenges and moves you, and for the actors who give it life, you will do many, many worse things with $31 in your lifetime than to buy this series. (In which case, go now and read the rest of this later.)No drama since \u201cMad Men\u201d has landed weekly with so little sense of where the next episode would go. \u201cHorace and Pete\u201d might dive into the past or riff on the week\u2019s headlines. It might collect a series of set pieces or \u2014 as in the astonishing third episode guest-starring Laurie Metcalf \u2014 showcase a single performance.But in the end, the surprise was in service of the story about a family for whom the mistakes of history would return, generation after generation, as predictably as happy hour \u2014 or in this case, unhappy hour.The dysfunction in the Wittel family is layered, like cheap wallpaper in an apartment. The bar (from which the series takes its name) has been around for a century, a record that seems less a legacy than a sentence. It\u2019s been run by a chain of Horaces and Petes who had sons named Horace and Pete. Louis C. K.\u2019s Horace, we learn in the finale, is the eighth in the line, the son of Horace VII (also played by Louis C. K.), an abusive tyrant.It takes a moment to realize the finale opens with a flashback, because the apartment set looks essentially the same. So does the bar, painted in the dingy browns and yellows of cigarette-stained teeth. It\u2019s always a kind of 1976 at Horace and Pete\u2019s, even in 2016, weighted with malaise, the only difference being the names on the cover of The Daily News and the barflies arguing over them.There\u2019s Budweiser on tap because there was always Budweiser. Things are the way things are because that\u2019s the way things were. History is handed down from father to son like a punch in the arm. As for the daughters \u2014 Horace\u2019s sister, Sylvia (Ms. Falco), summed up the bar\u2019s history in the pilot: \u201cHow many wives have been beaten up here?\u201dMs. Falco plays Horace and Sylvia\u2019s abused mother as well, which is an efficiency of casting \u2014 wouldn\u2019t you use this actress as much as possible? \u2014 but also, like Louis C. K. as Horace VII and Mr. Buscemi as the younger Uncle Pete, underlines the idea of eternal return. It\u2019s as if there were one version of each of these people, and they just keep being reborn. (It\u2019s a kind of perversion of the Resurrection story of Easter, the holiday that looms largest in this series.)There\u2019s a sense in the finale of the chain finally being broken, for (slightly) better and (horribly) worse. Each generation of Wittel men, it seems, has left the next a little worse off, until finally Pete (Mr. Buscemi), broken and off his meds, kills Horace, the cousin he grew up believing was his brother.There won\u2019t be another Horace and Pete; the bar is packed up and Pete left no descendants we know of. There is a Horace IX (Angus T. Jones), Horace\u2019s estranged son, to whom Sylvia gives a wonderfully tart eulogy of sorts for her brother: \u201cHe was nothing, really. He was no kind of man. He was not particularly funny or smart or kind or \u2014 you know, he was just some guy. But he was your father.\u201dLouis C. K. is reportedly submitting \u201cHorace and Pete\u201d for the Emmys as a drama. If it gets a nomination \u2014 Mr. Alda, Mr. Buscemi, Ms. Falco and Ms. Metcalf would all be strong picks \u2014 that would be a landmark for an independent show. Few artists have Louis C. K.\u2019s resources or multi-hyphenate ability, but the series could at least expand the possibilities.But in its short life, the show has already left a legacy. Louis C. K. has never drawn sharp lines between drama and comedy. His work is about provoking strong feelings, whether a laugh or a cry or a scare. His FX series, \u201cLouie,\u201d lives by that idea and \u201cHorace and Pete\u201d extended it, drawing strong performances out of comics like Aidy Bryant and Kurt Metzger.Like its bar, \u201cHorace and Pete\u201d operated out of old, dusty traditions. It recalled the staging of 20th-century sitcoms and the earliest live-theater days of 1950s television. But it was also hypercurrent. Like modern \u201climited series\u201d (the seasons of \u201cFargo,\u201d e.g.), it wasn\u2019t obligated to spin out its story for years; like Netflix and Amazon series, it was free of network scheduling. Both on the episode and series level, it was only as long as it needed to be.\u201cHorace and Pete\u201d did not end happily, leaving us with the sobs of Sylvia, a survivor of both cancer and her family. But it was a gorgeous snapshot of humanity and a bracing preview of television\u2019s future, a story that exemplified how, to move forward, sometimes you have to go into the past.Advertisement"}

To sum up the life of Bill Campbell, who died peacefully in his sleep this week with his family by his side, is a daunting and fundamentally impossible task - Bill&aposs life and accomplishments were so vast and varied that even those\n                                        who knew him best were only lucky enough to have witnessed a portion of them. Tributes to his astonishing legacy in Silicon Valley have already been pouring in, and rightly so. It is a legacy that is difficult to\n                                        fathom. He had a hand in almost every consequential technology company of the past 30 years, either through direct relationship or through his coaching and mentoring of the company&aposs key players, (and, in the\n                                        case of Intuit, Claris, and Go, through his own tenure as CEO). From Apple to Google to Amazon to Twitter, from his mentorship of the iconic venture capitalists who helped shape the Valley to his under-the-radar\n                                        involvement with legions of nerdy and unsexy companies barely known outside the tech community, but whose presences and innovations changed the technology landscape - Bill was always there, all smiles and hugs,\n                                        his essence embedded in the company&aposs DNA, pushing everyone involved to be better managers, more creative, and, most importantly, better people, to be the most authentic and truest versions of themselves. He\n                                        is probably best known for being \"the Coach,\" a mentor to legends; as the legends themselves would be the first to tell you, he was so much more than the sum of those he advised. He was himself a legend.\n                                        He was the legend. Bill was a man of beautiful and almost impossible contrasts. He was profane in a way that was unacceptable in many barrooms, let alone in church, and a devout Catholic who rarely missed Sunday\n                                        Mass. A workaholic who pushed himself and those around him beyond their natural and professional limits, and a devoted husband and quite possibly the best father in history, who never, no matter what momentous occasion\n                                        was on his schedule, missed an important event in his kids&apos lives. Famously honest and blunt (and sometimes even harsh), he would never hesitate to let you know when you were \"messing up\"; but when\n                                        you were messing up, he&aposd be the guy who&aposd answer your call at all hours of the night and, with inspiring patience and empathy, talk you through whatever mistakes you had made and how you were supposed\n                                        to rectify them. He preached teamwork and compassion and love. In many ways he seemed a throwback to a different era, a manly man, a jock&aposs jock, gruff, aggressive, macho, old-fashioned, and yet he was comfortable\n                                        and even thrived around dorks, dweebs, outcasts of all types- a \"nerd whisperer,\" as one journalist put it. His identity as \"the Coach\" was derived from both his general football-coaching demeanor\n                                        and his time as an actual football coach, with all the good and bad that that particular stereotype entails; he was a passionate advocate for the advancement of women in Silicon Valley and for the LGBT community.\n                                        He was never happier than at the annual 8th grade graduation at Sacred Heart Schools in Atherton, CA, when, year after year, a stream of students, boys and girls alike, would offer remembrances and speak movingly\n                                        of by far their most meaningful experience at the school: getting the chance to play flag football for Coach Campbell, absorbing the lessons he taught them, lessons that were, perhaps not surprisingly, essentially\n                                        identical to the lessons Coach had imparted to those he&aposd coached in the adult world. Teamwork. Structure. Integrity. Accountability. Passion. Hard work. Empathy. Love. Traits he&aposd learned growing up in\n                                        Homestead, PA, where he would end up donating millions of dollars to education and youth projects. A final common refrain about Bill: Everyone who knew Bill thought of him as their best friend. Bill was a people\n                                        person. He oozed charisma. When he talked to you he made you feel like you were the only person that mattered. It might be tempting for those who didn&apost know Bill that well to conclude that all this was just\n                                        some act. How could one person be so overflowing with joy, with the amount of joy and love requisite for connection with such a staggering number of people on such a profound level - Obviously it had to be an act.\n                                        It wasn&apost. He really did love people the way they loved him. New friends were made wherever he went. Often they were baristas, waiters, and, let&aposs face it, bartenders, people who didn&apost know initially\n                                        who he was and in some cases never would. He had friends in high and low places and everywhere in between. It was infectious. He was a uniter, he imparted his worldview onto his friends and mixed his groups of friends\n                                        together, so that friends in California became close with friends from Homestead and New York and elsewhere; wealthy friends grew to love friends who were less well off and vice versa; tech friends, academic friends,\n                                        and football friends were molded into one great big Bill Campbell group. Bill Campbell never saw wealth or social status or anything artificial when judging the merits of people. He sought in others the same qualities\n                                        he himself so fully embodied. Bill&aposs friends, and there were many, by definition embodied his values; he wouldn&apost have been friends with them if they hadn&apost. Bill Campbell really did believe that\n                                        everyone who lived by his values, friend or not, was fundamentally the same, of equal goodness, of equal worth. On this last point, sadly, he was somewhat mistaken. Indeed when you get down to it most people are\n                                        essentially the same, most of their differences are artificial. But Bill Campbell was better than everyone. And all of his friends are infinitely better off for having known him. William Vincent Campbell Jr., who\n                                        was born August 31, 1940 in Homestead, PA and who died April 18, 2016 in Palo Alto, CA, is survived by his wife Eileen Bocci Campbell, his two children Jim and Maggie, and his three step children Kevin, Matthew,\n                                        and Kate Bocci. A Funeral Mass will be held Monday, April 25th at Sacred Heart Preparatory in Atherton, CA at 11am.

{"Headline": "San Francisco Approves Fully Paid Parental Leave", "Date": "2016-04-05", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 San Francisco on Tuesday became the first city in the United States to approve six weeks of fully paid leave for new parents \u2014 mothers and fathers, including same-sex couples, who either bear or adopt a child.Before the vote, the supervisors amended the proposal to make employees eligible only when they have worked for a company 180 days. The ordinance goes into effect on Jan. 1, 2017, for companies with more than 50 employees, and a year later for those with 20 or more workers.The new law will make San Francisco\u2019s policy far broader than that of New York City, which has also expanded its parental leave policy. In December, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York ordered that 20,000 nonunionized workers be given six weeks of fully paid parental leave, but that amounts to a sliver of the total municipal work force of around 300,000.Except for a group of small-business owners, the ordinance here had wide support. The San Francisco Chamber of Commerce said that while it favored expanded parental leave benefits, there was a \u201cstrong belief among many business owners that once again, to the financial detriment of small businesses, a mandate is being adopted in San Francisco that would be better dealt with at the state or federal level.\u201d In a letter to the Board of Supervisors, the chamber declared itself \u201cneutral\u201d on the issue.Scott Wiener, the supervisor who introduced the measure, said that San Francisco lawmakers had chosen to take up the issue partly because there was little hope of change at the national level.\u201cWhether it\u2019s paid parental leave, infrastructure investment, minimum wage, paid sick leave or addressing carbon emissions, we know the states have to act,\u201d Mr. Wiener said in an interview before the vote.The ordinance requires a second vote by the supervisors next week and approval by Mayor Edwin M. Lee. Legislators described both as formalities given the unanimous vote on Tuesday.Only two states besides California \u2014 New Jersey and Rhode Island \u2014 mandate paid parental leave, and none at full pay. The funds for parental leave in all three come from employee-funded public insurance systems.Supporters of the measure rallied on the steps of City Hall on Tuesday.Julia Parish, 33, a lawyer with the Legal Aid Society who is eight and a half months pregnant, said the measure would be particularly helpful to lower-income residents who do not work for companies with generous benefits. \u201cWe are ahead of the curve in California, but globally, we are way behind,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s shameful.\u201dIndeed, by global standards, the San Francisco ordinance is a modest step. The United States is one of two countries out of 185 listed by the International Labor Organization that do not have a national law providing some form of paid parental leave. (The other is Papua New Guinea.)The parental leave measure is one of several pro-worker initiatives emerging from California. Gov. Jerry Brown signed a law Monday that would progressively raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2022. Separately, the leader of California\u2019s Senate is pushing to offer tax-free retirement savings plans for the 7.5 million workers in California who do not have employer-provided retirement plans.At a time of great divisions at the national level, amplified by the bitterness of the presidential election campaign, California\u2019s Democratic leaders say they see an opening to push hard on liberal issues inside the state.\u201cWith the presidential election in the background \u2014 with so much anger and anxiety \u2014 California is going in a vastly different direction,\u201d said the Senate president pro tempore, Kevin de Le\u00f3n, who wrote the retirement savings plan. \u201cWe are proving that despite the large legislative vacuum in Washington, D.C., that California can lead on its own.\u201dGavin Newsom, the state\u2019s lieutenant governor, said the country\u2019s divisions were making action by the states more urgent and necessary.\u201cThe nation is alive from the bottom up,\u201d Mr. Newsom said. \u201cFor all the disproportionate focus on Washington, D.C., there\u2019s a whole other America out there, and it should give pause to the pessimists.\u201dPro-labor battles have been hard fought in Washington. The federal parental leave law, known as the Family and Medical Leave Act, provides for 12 weeks of parental leave \u2014 unpaid.The law, vetoed or blocked for a decade, was passed in 1993 and signed by President Bill Clinton.Paid family leave, including parental leave, is scheduled to start in New York State in 2018 as part of a budget passed last week by the Legislature; in the first phase of the law, workers will get 50 percent of their wages during eight weeks of leave.In addition to parental leave, experts point to a growing number of states and municipalities that are passing laws governing sick leave and retirement plans.California\u2019s retirement savings plan addresses what experts say is the looming problem across the country of underfunded retirements. Under the program, called Secure Choice, a yet-to-be determined amount \u2014 around 3 to 5 percent \u2014 would be automatically deducted from workers\u2019 paychecks and placed in an investment fund that they can maintain throughout their careers.The fund would be overseen by portfolio managers chosen by the state. Employers will not add funds to the plan \u2014 the savings come entirely from employees.Employees can opt out of the savings plan.The program passed unanimously through a vetting committee led by the state\u2019s treasurer, but still needs to pass the full Legislature and be signed by the governor.Karen Friedman, the policy director of the Pension Rights Center, an advocacy group in Washington, said that while Secure Choice was a modest start to address the country\u2019s savings shortfall, it was also a \u201cblueprint\u201d for similar programs being proposed in about 25 other states.\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of proposals out there, but California became the state leading the effort,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a recognition that most people are retiring without adequate income.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a political branding opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile others fiddle and diddle, California moves.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Eat, Pray, Love\u2019 and Travel", "Date": "2016-04-29", "News": "Supported byQ and A.Elizabeth Gilbert has written several best-selling books of fiction and nonfiction, but she is best known for \u201cEat, Pray, Love,\u201d her 2006 memoir of travel and personal discovery in Italy, Indonesia and India. To celebrate the book\u2019s 10th anniversary, Riverhead Books has published \u201cEat, Pray, Love Made Me Do It,\u201d a collection of 47 essays written by people inspired by the book. Following are edited excerpts from a conversation with Ms. Gilbert.Q. Which elements of travel seem to resonate most with people you encounter?One writer in \u201cEat, Pray, Love Made Me Do It\u201d realized a teenage dream to visit Dublin after a broken engagement, the travel version of seeking out a youthful romance. Is this a good idea?Sometimes that more innocent and true version of yourself gets pushed aside in adulthood, and travel can be an important way to revisit that part of yourself you left behind. It could even be the best part of yourself.Several essay writers described how adventure can come in many forms and doesn\u2019t necessarily take money or even much time. Do you agree?Absolutely. My favorite moment in the book is where a newly divorced mother with children for whom travel is impossible starts to take better care of herself. She wrote: \u201cThe gym was my Italy, a weekend away with girlfriends was my Indonesia and spending quiet time reading or running or just going for a coffee was my India.\u201d That is the epitome of finding answers to the questions.Another writer started traveling at age 50 and now celebrates every year with a road trip. Do you meet people who start traveling later in life?My mother, for one! She was 55, and finally had the freedom and the means, and she woke up to the reality that my dad\u2019s not a traveler. Now she and her sister-in-law do a trip every year. They\u2019ve been to Chile, Turkey, Thailand, up the Amazon River. They\u2019re really adventurous. Fifty is the age women start to become invisible, but the flip side of that is: Invisibility is a super power \u2014 it makes them safer to travel.What are some of your recent travels?My husband\u2019s older than me and he has grandkids in Australia. We took the family of four to Tasmania and also spent two months in Australia and New Zealand. I\u2019ve also started this ritual where I take my mom traveling every year. We\u2019ve been to Greece and London, and this year we\u2019re doing a walking trip through Wales. Although my dad isn\u2019t a traveler, he does hike, and I took him hiking in the Dolomites.You and your husband sold your import shop Two Buttons in Frenchtown, N.J., last year. What are your plans now?We want to travel more and enjoy the fact that we can. My husband\u2019s been traveling his whole life, and I have too, but there are just huge parts of the world we haven\u2019t seen yet. I\u2019ve never been to Japan, Iceland, South Africa and other places that it would be a pity to come to this earth and miss. I\u2019m getting more comfortable with the idea of not necessarily living anywhere. I do need to sit in one place with a book, and my plan for this autumn is to do that with a novel I\u2019m working on.Generally speaking I feel like I want to encourage people to have the most expanded version of their life they can possibly have in every way \u2014 spiritually, creatively and geographically. That\u2019s the bell I keep ringing: to live a bigger and broader life. The smaller your world gets, the smaller your mind gets, and the more your fear grows and the worse your decisions get.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Former Girl Soldier in Colombia Finds \u2018Life Is Hard\u2019 as a Civilian", "Date": "2016-04-27", "News": "Supported byCALDAS, Colombia \u2014 M\u00e9lida was only 9 when guerrilla fighters lured her away with the promise of food as she played on the floor. For the next seven years she was held hostage by the rebels, forced to become a child soldier.Her family thought she had died in battle. Then M\u00e9lida suddenly returned to her village at 16, carrying a pistol and a grenade. Only her grandfather recognized her \u2014 from a birthmark on her cheek.The very next day, the military surrounded her house, called by an informant seeking the bounty on her head.\u201cI found out my own father had turned me in,\u201d she recalled.Colombia is nearing a peace agreement with the rebels to end a half-century of fighting, one of the longest conflicts in the world.More than 220,000 people have been killed, leaving a country bitterly divided over what role, if any, former rebels should play in society once they drop their weapons for a new, unarmed life outside the jungle.That includes thousands of rebel fighters who were raised since childhood to carry out armed struggle. Many of them know little else but war.\u201cThere are times when I think about returning to the guerrillas because this life is hard here,\u201d said M\u00e9lida, now 20, who, like other former child soldiers, asked that her last name not be used because she fears reprisals over her links to the rebels.She is now caught between two worlds, she says, belonging to neither. \u201cTrue, we were children waiting for our deaths. But I\u2019m always thinking about returning.\u201dThe rebels, known as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, say they don\u2019t recruit children. Yet during a recent visit to a FARC camp by The New York Times, a half-dozen soldiers as young as 15 said they had been recruited by the rebels only months earlier.In government rehabilitation centers throughout Colombia, minors told similar stories of being spirited away to camps by rebels. Now they face a future for which they are thoroughly unprepared.Fabio said he was kidnapped by rebel fighters at the age of 9. By the time he was 13, he said, his commanders began sending him on solo missions to slit the throats of government soldiers as they slept. He said his own family did not look for him or inform the authorities of his abduction.\u201cThey would have been killed,\u201d said Fabio, who is now 19.Freddy said he joined the FARC at 14 to avenge the killing of a cousin by paramilitary forces. He deserted at 16 with two dozen other soldiers. But he said his aunt, fearing reprisals from the guerrillas, told him never to return to his village.Finding a place for these former soldiers is vital to the success of any peace deal, analysts say.At the rebel camp, one FARC commander, who goes by the name Te\u00f3filo Panclasta, defended the use of child soldiers, saying that many joined to escape trouble at home.\u201cIf a girl comes at 15 as a prostitute and wants to join us to stop being a whore, what are we going to say?\u201d he asked.M\u00e9lida said that when her captors came to her house along the river, they drew her attention by saying they had soup in their canoe.The guerrillas brought her up the river until they reached a distant camp. She woke up alongside several other children, each around 10 or 11. Their first lesson was hiding in trenches during bombings by the military.M\u00e9lida\u2019s father, Mois\u00e9s, a traditional healer of the Amazon\u2019s Cubeo group, was away at the time and did not return to their village for another month. He quickly left again to find the girl.Mois\u00e9s went to the guerrilla camp near the village and asked to meet the commander, a tall FARC fighter in fatigues.\u201cI said, \u2018I came for my daughter,\u2019 \u201d Mois\u00e9s recalled. \u201cHe said she wasn\u2019t there.\u201dIn the camp, M\u00e9lida had been renamed Marisol and began her schooling. A Dutch woman who had joined the fighters and spoke broken Spanish taught lessons on the history of communism, the FARC and Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution, something M\u00e9lida had never learned in her indigenous village.M\u00e9lida was also learning to make land mines. One \u201clooked like a fish\u201d and was triggered with a tripwire made of string, she said. Another was called the \u201cquiebrapatas,\u201d or the \u201cleg-breaker,\u201d because it maimed rather than killed its victim.\u201cI said, \u2018I want to go home,\u2019 \u201d she remembered saying. \u201cBut they told me, \u2018Once you enter a camp, you cannot leave.\u2019 \u201dM\u00e9lida said she saw the fate of runaway fighters firsthand. Once, a 20-year-old and his 14-year-old sister disappeared before dawn and soon found themselves trapped on the edge of a muddy river. They had not learned to swim.M\u00e9lida joined the search for them. When the pair were found, they were shot dead. \u201cFirst the brother, then the sister,\u201d M\u00e9lida recalled.She remembered feeling no remorse that day. \u201cI said to myself, \u2018Yes \u2014 yes they should be killed.\u2019 \u201d She was 12 years old.Years after she was kidnapped, FARC rebels passed through her village and mentioned M\u00e9lida to her family.\u201cThey said she had died in an attack,\u201d her father recalled. \u201cAfter that, I just forgot about her. I thought it was best to forget.\u201dIn reality, a commander in his 40s had taken an interest in her. At first, he followed her around the camp. Then one day, when she was 15, he asked her to wash his clothes in his tent.\u201cGive me a kiss,\u201d she recalled him saying.\u201cI don\u2019t know how,\u201d she said.\u201cThen I\u2019ll teach you,\u201d the commander said.She was later given a birth control implant in her arm and the commander forced her into a relationship, she said.\u201cImagine waking up next to someone who was that old when you are that young,\u201d she said.At 16, she asked the commander if she could visit her family. She was surprised when he agreed. Carrying the pistol and the grenade, she made her way back home for what was meant to be a short reunion.The village was unrecognizable. A warship was now stationed near the dock. The home from which she had been abducted was abandoned.\u201cI told the first person I saw that I was Mr. Mois\u00e9s\u2019 daughter, and they said I couldn\u2019t be because that daughter was dead,\u201d she said.M\u00e9lida says she does not know why her father turned her in to the military the next day.\u201cHe wanted me not to go back perhaps,\u201d she said. \u201cHe wanted the best for me.\u201dBut Mois\u00e9s, sitting in his daughter\u2019s living room on a recent afternoon, offered another explanation.\u201cI wanted to buy a motorcycle,\u201d he said. After a moment he added, \u201cThey never gave me the reward I was promised.\u201dThe soldiers interrogated M\u00e9lida at one base after another, she said. What was her real name, they asked? Who were her commanders? Where were the FARC bases?After two weeks, M\u00e9lida was taken to a government rehabilitation center for indigenous youth who had left the FARC. It was on a mountainside in an alien part of the country for M\u00e9lida, who had never seen the Andes before she was captured.The center was home to about 20 other former child soldiers. Daily classes and chores, meant to adjust them to civilian life, were new to her. Other requirements, like another birth control implant, reminded her of the FARC.War was constantly on M\u00e9lida\u2019s mind. \u201cWhen I would get up, I would reach beside me to take my rifle and realize there wasn\u2019t one there,\u201d she said.V\u00edctor Hugo Ochoa, the center\u2019s director, said M\u00e9lida arrived angry and often threatened to run away. \u201cIt was hard to intervene,\u201d he said. \u201cShe formed her own constellation of kids who turned on us.\u201dAt night, M\u00e9lida began sneaking out of the center with a man named Javier, whose mother was a cook there. He was nine years older than M\u00e9lida, but the two would go out drinking and partying in a nearby town.Javier had a bad history with the rebels. In 2004, his brother, a soldier, was killed by a FARC sniper. His family never forgave the guerrillas, a tension at the heart of any peace deal.Despite this, M\u00e9lida and Javier realized they were falling in love.\u201cWhy did it have to be her?\u201d he said. \u201cFrom the people who killed my brother?\u201dM\u00e9lida was forming another relationship \u2014 with her father, who began visiting to get to know her again.After turning M\u00e9lida in, Mois\u00e9s now wanted a role in his daughter\u2019s life. But even communicating was a challenge: M\u00e9lida had lost some of her fluency in Cubeo, the indigenous language they had spoken when she was a child.\u201cShe was just some young lady I didn\u2019t know,\u201d he said.The new ties were changing her, Mr. Ochoa said. She was getting to know her two cousins, Mar\u00eda and Leila, themselves former FARC members who had left the center. Javier\u2019s mother, Dora, was teaching M\u00e9lida to cook and clean, taking on a mother\u2019s role.Dora took M\u00e9lida\u2019s FARC history in stride. \u201cMy daughter is married to a policeman; another is with a soldier,\u201d she said. \u201cJavier is with an ex-guerrilla. The only thing we\u2019re missing in this family is a paramilitary.\u201dOne day M\u00e9lida\u2019s birth control implant failed and she became pregnant.Dora pulled M\u00e9lida aside. \u201cI told her, \u2018Now you have something to fight for that\u2019s not the revolution.\u2019 \u201dHer daughter, Celeste, was born last year.The daily tasks of motherhood consumed M\u00e9lida for weeks. But the anger remained.\u201cShe told me she was raised for war, not to care, not to be a lover,\u201d Javier said. \u201cShe would tell me, \u2018I love you, but understand my life hasn\u2019t been easy.\u2019 \u201dOne day, Javier returned to find that M\u00e9lida and the baby were gone.Days before, M\u00e9lida had mentioned returning to rebel territory to see her sister, but now Javier thought it was a ruse to return to the FARC fold.It wasn\u2019t the case. Instead, her bus had been stopped at a checkpoint by rebels who questioned each of the passengers.\u201cI thought they would catch me again,\u201d said M\u00e9lida, who realized then she did not want to go back, at least not that day.M\u00e9lida\u2019s relationship with her father remains strained. They rarely talk about her life in rebel hands.On a recent day, M\u00e9lida was recovering from a blow to her face. \u201cShe started to argue with me and I hit her,\u201d said Mois\u00e9s, looking at the ground.Recently, M\u00e9lida\u2019s cousin Leila, the former FARC member, committed suicide. M\u00e9lida sometimes travels to visit the unmarked grave.Dora says M\u00e9lida is too strong to take her own life. But she worries M\u00e9lida might return to the guerrillas.\u201cShe is a good mother and puts her daughter first,\u201d Dora said. \u201cBut she also tells me she is bored and doesn\u2019t like this life. And I tell her: \u2018If you want to leave, then leave. But think of the girl. Leave Celeste with me.\u2019 \u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the age of Fabio, a man kidnapped by Colombian rebels.

{"Headline": "Dilma Rousseff Targeted in Brazil by Lawmakers Facing Scandals of Their Own", "Date": "2016-04-14", "News": "Supported by\u201cI\u2019m against all the dubious horse-trading this government does,\u201d said Mr. Maluf, 84, a former S\u00e3o Paulo mayor who faces charges in the United States that he stole more than $11.6 million in a kickback scheme.But some of the most vocal lawmakers pushing to impeach Ms. Rousseff are facing serious charges of graft, electoral fraud and human rights abuses, uncorking a national debate about hypocrisy among Brazil\u2019s leaders.\u201cDilma may have dug her own grave by not delivering on what she promised, but she is untainted in a political realm smeared with excrement from top to bottom,\u201d said Mario Sergio Conti, a columnist for the newspaper Folha de S. Paulo. \u201cShe didn\u2019t steal, but a gang of thieves is judging her.\u201dMs. Rousseff is deeply resented in Brazil, having presided over the worst economic crisis in decades, a huge corruption scandal engulfing the national oil company and the fall of millions of middle-class Brazilians into poverty.In the impeachment case, she is not facing charges of graft. Instead, she is accused of using money from giant public banks to cover budget gaps, damaging Brazil\u2019s economic credibility.Ms. Rousseff, then, is something of a rarity among Brazil\u2019s major political figures: She has not been accused of stealing for herself.Vice President Michel Temer, who is expected to take over if Ms. Rousseff is forced to step aside, has been accused of involvement in an illegal ethanol-purchasing scheme.Renan Calheiros, the Senate leader, who is also on the presidential succession chain, is under investigation over claims that he received bribes in the giant scandal surrounding the national oil company, Petrobras. He has also been accused of tax evasion and of allowing a lobbyist to pay child support for a daughter from an extramarital affair.The issue has even become a part of the president\u2019s defense strategy. In particular, Ms. Rousseff and her supporters have argued, how can the impeachment process be directed by someone who is going on trial for corruption himself?On Thursday, Jos\u00e9 Eduardo Cardozo, the solicitor general, said that his office had appealed to the Supreme Federal Tribunal in an attempt to block the impeachment proceedings.He said the effort to oust Ms. Rousseff had become so sprawling that it was \u201ca true Kafkaesque process in which the defendant cannot figure out with any certainty what she is being accused of or why.\u201dIn a session that went past midnight and into the early hours of Friday, a majority of justices on the high court rejected the Rousseff administration\u2019s request to annul this weekend\u2019s impeachment vote.No one can dispute that Ms. Rousseff is very unpopular around the country, as reflected in her nearly single-digit approval ratings, the broad ire over bribery and kickbacks within her Workers\u2019 Party, and the regular street protests demanding her ouster.Even so, some Brazilians argue that the impeachment upheaval has less to do with stamping out corruption than with an effort to shift power by lawmakers with questionable records themselves.Almost daily, prosecutors reveal accusations involving Ms. Rousseff\u2019s allies and adversaries in Congress, saying they pocketed bribes in the colossal graft scheme surrounding government-controlled energy companies.Graphic photos even circulated this month of prostitutes operating in a wing of Congress reserved for committee deliberations, reminding Brazilians of the institution\u2019s circuslike atmosphere these days.Luis Almagro, secretary general of the Organization of American States, criticized the impeachment process, saying the accusations against Ms. Rousseff \u201care not crimes, but they are related to poor administration.\u201dDilma Rousseff, Brazil\u2019s president, is facing removal from office. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the proceedings.He said that the president\u2019s missteps were \u201cactions that other presidents in the past took themselves,\u201d but that Brazil\u2019s politicians were \u201cjudging her differently.\u201dMr. Almagro also criticized the politicians who were pushing for impeachment but facing corruption accusations themselves.\u201cI am worried about the credibility of some of those who are going to judge or decide this impeachment process,\u201d he said.Mr. Maluf, the former mayor who supports the president\u2019s removal, spent weeks in jail a decade ago on charges of money laundering and tax evasion.But he was released under a law allowing people older than 70 to face such accusations at home. Then Mr. Maluf won a seat in Congress, giving him the privileged judicial standing that keeps nearly all senior Brazilian politicians with such privileges out of jail.Despite Mr. Maluf\u2019s claims in recent days that he could travel outside Brazil without being arrested, he remains wanted by Interpol for the case against him in the United States, according to the United States Justice Department. France also has an outstanding warrant for his arrest in a separate case involving organized money laundering.\u201cMy public life was always the opposite of all that,\u201d Mr. Maluf said last week, criticizing the bad deeds in Ms. Rousseff\u2019s government, including her scramble to offer cabinet posts to legislators on the fence over impeachment.Scholars note the sweeping legal protections enjoyed by about 700 senior officials, including cabinet ministers and every member of Congress. Only the Supreme Federal Tribunal can try them, producing years of appeals and delays.\u201cWinning election to Congress is a license to steal for certain figures,\u201d said Sylvio Costa, the founder of Congresso em Foco, a watchdog group that tracks legislative corruption. \u201cIn this grotesque system, the biggest thieves are those who wield the most power.\u201d\u201cThe bandit I\u2019m rooting for the most is Eduardo Cunha,\u201d Mr. Jefferson said. (Several lawmakers seeking to oust Ms. Rousseff, including Mr. Cunha, either declined requests for comment or did not respond.)One prominent supporter of Ms. Rousseff is Fernando Collor de Mello, the disgraced former president who resigned in 1992 over an influence-peddling scandal. He resurrected his political career as a senator, only to face charges now of taking bribes in the graft scheme around the national oil company.Mr. Collor\u2019s father, Arnon de Mello, set a precedent after fatally shooting a fellow senator on the Senate floor in 1963. Arnon de Mello managed to avoid prison after a court ruled that the episode was an accident \u2014 because he was aiming at another senator.As tempers flare over impeachment, some cite the example of Ivo Cassol, a senator from the Amazon. He was sentenced to more than four years in prison in 2013 by the Supreme Federal Tribunal on corruption charges related to contracts granted more than 15 years ago. (Mr. Cassol considers himself innocent in the case, a spokesman said.)Simon Romero reported from Bras\u00edlia, and Vinod Sreeharsha from Rio de Janeiro.Advertisement"}

Starboard was spun off from the financial firm Ramius five years ago. It started off pressuring the Internet company AOL, demanding that it shut its Patch local news arm and sell off its patents. AOL eventually did exactly that, though Starboard did not gain any board seats.

More tech companies have been adopting different stock classes to allow their founders to cement their voting power. The new C shares allow Mr. Zuckerberg to maintain 60 percent of voting power while still giving away large amounts of stock.

{"Headline": "Bob Dylan-Inspired Drama Is in the Works", "Date": "2016-04-15", "News": "Supported byThe biggest star behind a spate of new streaming television shows is no celebrity or top-flight director, but rather innovative music deals.\u201cBeat Bugs,\u201d which will have its premiere in August, follows five young creatures on adventures set to classic Beatles songs like \u201cAll You Need Is Love\u201d and \u201cMagical Mystery Tour\u201d \u2014 to be sung by Eddie Vedder, Sia and other pop stars \u2014 that are woven into the plot. For example, in one episode, a character is trapped under glass while the song \u201cHelp!\u201d plays.The other shows are to involve even deeper kinds of musical integration. \u201cTime Out of Mind,\u201d planned as an hourlong drama, will include characters and settings drawn from the lyrics of Mr. Dylan\u2019s songs, and each episode of the Motown show \u2014 whose theme song is the Jackson 5\u2019s \u201cABC\u201d \u2014 will revolve around a different song from that catalog.\u201cTime Out of Mind\u201d and the as-yet-untitled Motown show have not been formally announced, but entertainment executives involved in their production, who were not authorized to discuss contractual details publicly, said that in both cases deals were close to being completed. Representatives of Amazon and Netflix declined to comment on those productions.When producers approach music publishers or record labels for licensing rights, they usually seek permission for only a handful of songs. But the deals around these shows break new ground, music executives say, by securing rights to a large pool of songs that the producers can draw on.For \u201cBeat Bugs,\u201d that means the catalog of more than 250 songs written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, and for \u201cTime Out of Mind,\u201d it involves Mr. Dylan\u2019s full catalog of more than 600 songs, including not only the right to record the material with new singers but \u2014 in an arrangement that people close to Mr. Dylan called unprecedented \u2014 to make use of song lyrics for characters, situations and themes in each episode\u2019s plot.\u201cIt\u2019s highly unusual, and you could only do it with a catalog that has a distinct feel and a distinct meaning,\u201d said Martin Bandier, the chief executive of Sony/ATV, the giant music publisher that controls the Beatles and Motown catalogs.The central force behind each of the new shows is Josh Wakely, a 34-year-old Australian writer and director who has secured extensive licensing arrangements with the songs\u2019 music publishers.Mr. Wakely, whose production company is called Grace: A Storytelling Company, approached Sony/ATV through its Australian office for \u201cBeat Bugs,\u201d and has said that it took him three years to complete the licensing deal. He was then introduced to representatives of Mr. Dylan, who controls his own songwriting rights but uses Sony/ATV as an affiliate in Australia.The deals reflect the ever-growing willingness of music publishers \u2014 who control songwriting rights, as opposed to recordings \u2014 to find new sources of income as music sales dry up, as well as the expanding popularity of streaming television.After the success of Netflix in recent years, Amazon Studios has made an aggressive push into television. In addition to shows like \u201cTransparent\u201d and \u201cMozart in the Jungle,\u201d each of which has won a Golden Globe for best comedy, the streaming service will also release a highly anticipated Woody Allen comedy later this year.The streaming services\u2019 big push into TV \u2014 along with more cable channels producing original content \u2014 has sent industry executives into a frenzied competition to gobble up talent, and take bigger risks on new projects. Last year, there were 412 scripted television shows, the most ever.An article on April 16 about three streaming television shows that draw on valuable song catalogs from the Beatles, Bob Dylan and the Motown label gave an incorrect age from a publicist for Josh Wakely, the Australian writer and director who secured the licensing arrangements with the music publishers. Mr. Wakely\u2019s age at the time the article was published was 34, not 31. The error was only recently discovered by The Times.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Netflix\u2019s Forecast for Growth Disappoints Wall St.", "Date": "2016-04-18", "News": "Supported byNetflix is now available in most countries around the world, putting more pressure on the company to continue its fast-paced growth abroad as well as at home.On Monday, Netflix announced that it expected to add just two million members outside the United States in the second quarter this year \u2014 less than the 3.5 million analysts had expected. The figure also represents a decrease from the 2.4 million members the streaming service added internationally in the same period the previous year.That cloudy forecast sent shares down more than 10 percent in after-hours trading, as Netflix has tied its future to its bold global push. The company has been pouring resources into its expanding international footprint, telling investors that it would run at break-even profitability until the end of 2016 as it continued to roll out the service abroad and increased its investment in content.As the company experienced slowing growth in the United States over the past year, executives pointed to the rest of the world as the next frontier for streaming television to hundreds of millions more potential customers. While the United States counts about 100 million broadband households, for instance, there are about 730 million broadband households worldwide, according to analyst estimates.On Monday, Netflix executives said that they had just skimmed the surface of that growth potential and that there was still a big opportunity ahead. The executives attributed the soft international forecast for the second quarter this year to a tough comparison from the previous year, when Netflix started the service in Australia and New Zealand.Reed Hastings, chief executive of Netflix, said the company had yet to reach its full potential in many countries because the service in most regions is only in English and available only via international credit cards.\u201cWe cannot wait to break through 100 million subscribers sometime next year,\u201d Mr. Hastings said during an earnings call.At the same time, Netflix said that it expected to add just 500,000 members in the United States in the second quarter because of what it described as a \u201cmodest impact\u201d from price increases. The company characterized the forecast as \u201cin line\u201d with previous years; it added 900,000 members in the United States during the same period in 2015.On the fast-changing competitive landscape, Mr. Hastings said in a letter to investors that the \u201cmarket for relaxation time and disposable income is huge, and we are but a little boat in a vast sea.\u201dHe added, \u201cWe earn a tiny fraction of consumers\u2019 time and money, and have lots of opportunity ahead to win more of your evenings away from all those other activities if we can keep improving.\u201dThat uncertainty over the competitive landscape, as well as fears about growth prospects both inside and outside the United States, overshadowed the generally positive first-quarter financial results that Netflix announced on Monday.The company beat expectations for profit and revenue growth during the first quarter. Profits totaled $28 million, up 16 percent from the same period last year, and total revenues increased 24 percent to nearly $2 billion.Netflix added a record 6.7 million total streaming members during the first quarter, bringing its total to 81.5 million, with about 42 percent outside the United States. Netflix had forecast that it would reach nearly 80.9 million total paid members in the quarter.In the United States, Netflix surpassed its forecasts for subscriber growth during a period in which price increases went into effect for some customers. The company added 2.23 million subscribers in America during the quarter, bringing its paid membership in the country to 45.7 million.Outside the United States, Netflix also beat its expectations for growth, adding 4.5 million international streaming subscribers.The company said it was planning to spend more than $6 billion on programming in 2017, up from $5 billion this year.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tech Companies Face Greater Scrutiny for Paying Workers With Stock", "Date": "2016-04-17", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For the last few years, LinkedIn, the professional social networking company, has doled out increasingly large amounts of stock to pay its workers.In 2014, LinkedIn paid employees $319 million in stock, or 14 percent of revenue; in 2015, that rose to $510 million, or 17 percent of revenue. At the time, those figures were largely met with shrugs from Wall Street.Now that attitude may be changing.The Silicon Valley company\u2019s stock-based compensation \u201cprovides additional reason to remain cautious\u201d on LinkedIn, Mark May, an Internet analyst at Citigroup, wrote in a research note.The issue is not limited to LinkedIn. With tech earnings season kicking off on Monday, investors are paying more attention to stock-based compensation at many tech companies.Paying employees with stock is largely unquestioned when times are good, since the move theoretically aligns the interests of the workers with company performance. The practice is technically a corporate expense, but during boom periods, Wall Street typically focuses on a company\u2019s operating results that exclude that expense.Tech companies stand out as some of the most generous givers of shares to employees. While the median number of restricted shares granted at Standard & Poor\u2019s 1500 companies to executives and employees in 2014 equaled 450,198 shares, tech companies granted a median 798,000 shares of restricted stock to workers, according to data from Equilar, a research firm that provides data on executives, boards and compensation.As a result, there has been a \u201cheightened investor focus on the level of stock-based compensation among the Internet companies,\u201d Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a recent note.In an interview, Mr. Mahaney said stock-based compensation could \u201cdistort the quality\u201d of a company\u2019s earnings and \u201cmake them look stronger than they are.\u201dMr. Mahaney has identified Twitter, LinkedIn, Yahoo and Alibaba as among the tech companies that are highly dependent on stock to pay their employees. In a report, he wrote that Twitter\u2019s stock-based compensation over the last two years accounted for 39 percent of the company\u2019s revenue, on average, the highest percentage of any Internet company.LinkedIn, whose share price is down about 48 percent this year, did not respond to requests for comment. Twitter, whose stock is down more than 20 percent this year, also did not respond to a request for comment.Another tech company that Wall Street analysts are examining for its stock-based compensation expenses is Workday, which sells human resources and financial management software. The company is expected to increase its stock compensation about 48 percent in its 2017 fiscal year, which is faster than its revenue is projected to grow, according to Sarah Hindlian, an analyst at Macquarie Group.In an illustration of how stock-based compensation expenses can affect a company\u2019s results, Ms. Hindlian says Workday\u2019s margins are projected to be around negative 25 percent for fiscal year 2017. But when the company\u2019s $370 million in stock-based compensation is excluded from results, its operating margins are much better, coming in around zero.Workday\u2019s heavy reliance on stock-based compensation has been a factor in Ms. Hindlian\u2019s projections for the company\u2019s share price. Last month, she forecast that Workday\u2019s stock would trade at $49, down from its current price of about $77. She has a sell recommendation on the stock.Ms. Hindlian says that while it can be reasonable for companies to pay workers a lot in stock, the practice can become scary when the stock starts to fall. \u201cParticularly with software companies, you run the risk of losing your leading salespeople, engineers and developers when the stock falls, because employees feel like they\u2019re getting a pay cut,\u201d said Ms. Hindlian, who also rang the alarm on LinkedIn\u2019s use of stock-based compensation over a year ago.\u201cSomewhere along the way a management team may feel pressure to increase their share price to avoid loss of employees,\u201d Ms. Hindlian said, \u201cwhich can ultimately mean management goals and shareholder interests become misaligned.\u201dWorkday declined to comment.When companies authorize additional shares to pay employees and management, that also creates \u201cdilution,\u201d or a decrease in how much of the company a shareholder owns when new stock is issued. That effect is starting to push others on Wall Street to lower their price projections for tech company stocks. Mr. May of Citigroup lowered his price targets this month on Google, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, eBay, Yahoo and Twitter to \u201cfully capture the likely ongoing dilution from future share grants as part of employee compensation,\u201d he said.The increased scrutiny of tech companies that rely heavily on stock to pay employees is just one of many places where investors are taking a harder look as markets soften, said John Roe, a managing director at ISS Corporate Solutions, a group that advises shareholders on corporate governance issues.He noted that some shareholders had also submitted proposals asking companies to consider the impact of share buybacks on earnings, to figure out whether executives delivered better earnings by improving performance or by reducing the number of shares outstanding.\u201cYou see a brighter focus on certain practices when there is more volatility and markets are going down,\u201d said Mr. Roe. \u201cThe reliance on equity compensation is one of those things that you might always worry about, but recent events have amplified that concern.\u201dAdvertisement"}

To sum up the life of Bill Campbell, who died peacefully in his sleep this week with his family by his side, is a daunting and fundamentally impossible task - Bill&aposs life and accomplishments were so vast and varied that even those\n                                        who knew him best were only lucky enough to have witnessed a portion of them. Tributes to his astonishing legacy in Silicon Valley have already been pouring in, and rightly so. It is a legacy that is difficult to\n                                        fathom. He had a hand in almost every consequential technology company of the past 30 years, either through direct relationship or through his coaching and mentoring of the company&aposs key players, (and, in the\n                                        case of Intuit, Claris, and Go, through his own tenure as CEO). From Apple to Google to Amazon to Twitter, from his mentorship of the iconic venture capitalists who helped shape the Valley to his under-the-radar\n                                        involvement with legions of nerdy and unsexy companies barely known outside the tech community, but whose presences and innovations changed the technology landscape - Bill was always there, all smiles and hugs,\n                                        his essence embedded in the company&aposs DNA, pushing everyone involved to be better managers, more creative, and, most importantly, better people, to be the most authentic and truest versions of themselves. He\n                                        is probably best known for being \"the Coach,\" a mentor to legends; as the legends themselves would be the first to tell you, he was so much more than the sum of those he advised. He was himself a legend.\n                                        He was the legend. Bill was a man of beautiful and almost impossible contrasts. He was profane in a way that was unacceptable in many barrooms, let alone in church, and a devout Catholic who rarely missed Sunday\n                                        Mass. A workaholic who pushed himself and those around him beyond their natural and professional limits, and a devoted husband and quite possibly the best father in history, who never, no matter what momentous occasion\n                                        was on his schedule, missed an important event in his kids&apos lives. Famously honest and blunt (and sometimes even harsh), he would never hesitate to let you know when you were \"messing up\"; but when\n                                        you were messing up, he&aposd be the guy who&aposd answer your call at all hours of the night and, with inspiring patience and empathy, talk you through whatever mistakes you had made and how you were supposed\n                                        to rectify them. He preached teamwork and compassion and love. In many ways he seemed a throwback to a different era, a manly man, a jock&aposs jock, gruff, aggressive, macho, old-fashioned, and yet he was comfortable\n                                        and even thrived around dorks, dweebs, outcasts of all types- a \"nerd whisperer,\" as one journalist put it. His identity as \"the Coach\" was derived from both his general football-coaching demeanor\n                                        and his time as an actual football coach, with all the good and bad that that particular stereotype entails; he was a passionate advocate for the advancement of women in Silicon Valley and for the LGBT community.\n                                        He was never happier than at the annual 8th grade graduation at Sacred Heart Schools in Atherton, CA, when, year after year, a stream of students, boys and girls alike, would offer remembrances and speak movingly\n                                        of by far their most meaningful experience at the school: getting the chance to play flag football for Coach Campbell, absorbing the lessons he taught them, lessons that were, perhaps not surprisingly, essentially\n                                        identical to the lessons Coach had imparted to those he&aposd coached in the adult world. Teamwork. Structure. Integrity. Accountability. Passion. Hard work. Empathy. Love. Traits he&aposd learned growing up in\n                                        Homestead, PA, where he would end up donating millions of dollars to education and youth projects. A final common refrain about Bill: Everyone who knew Bill thought of him as their best friend. Bill was a people\n                                        person. He oozed charisma. When he talked to you he made you feel like you were the only person that mattered. It might be tempting for those who didn&apost know Bill that well to conclude that all this was just\n                                        some act. How could one person be so overflowing with joy, with the amount of joy and love requisite for connection with such a staggering number of people on such a profound level - Obviously it had to be an act.\n                                        It wasn&apost. He really did love people the way they loved him. New friends were made wherever he went. Often they were baristas, waiters, and, let&aposs face it, bartenders, people who didn&apost know initially\n                                        who he was and in some cases never would. He had friends in high and low places and everywhere in between. It was infectious. He was a uniter, he imparted his worldview onto his friends and mixed his groups of friends\n                                        together, so that friends in California became close with friends from Homestead and New York and elsewhere; wealthy friends grew to love friends who were less well off and vice versa; tech friends, academic friends,\n                                        and football friends were molded into one great big Bill Campbell group. Bill Campbell never saw wealth or social status or anything artificial when judging the merits of people. He sought in others the same qualities\n                                        he himself so fully embodied. Bill&aposs friends, and there were many, by definition embodied his values; he wouldn&apost have been friends with them if they hadn&apost. Bill Campbell really did believe that\n                                        everyone who lived by his values, friend or not, was fundamentally the same, of equal goodness, of equal worth. On this last point, sadly, he was somewhat mistaken. Indeed when you get down to it most people are\n                                        essentially the same, most of their differences are artificial. But Bill Campbell was better than everyone. And all of his friends are infinitely better off for having known him. William Vincent Campbell Jr., who\n                                        was born August 31, 1940 in Homestead, PA and who died April 18, 2016 in Palo Alto, CA, is survived by his wife Eileen Bocci Campbell, his two children Jim and Maggie, and his three step children Kevin, Matthew,\n                                        and Kate Bocci.

{"Headline": "Sensitive Skin? These Products Can Help", "Date": "2016-04-26", "News": "Supported bySkin DeepWhen Kim Moffitt uses most eye creams, they sting. If she tries to layer sunscreen and moisturizer, she breaks out. Traditional exfoliators like fruit enzymes or glycolic acid leave her looking as if she had sandpapered her face.The one time she tried an eyebrow wax, \u201cit looked like I had rug burns around my eyebrows,\u201d said Ms. Moffitt, an illustrator in Portland, Ore., who has hunted over the years for products for her sensitive skin.Lately, though, the search has been easier. Companies large and small are racing to serve the growing number of adults in the United States with skin like Ms. Moffitt\u2019s \u2014 anywhere from 25 percent to 80 percent of the population, depending on which survey you read. (People generally self-diagnose sensitive skin; it\u2019s a marketing term, not a medical one.)Roughly a quarter of product debuts in 2014 and 2015 were for sensitive skin, according to the market research company Mintel.Why is the incidence of sensitive skin rising? It may be because of pollution or a rise in allergies or too many samples. (One doctor called this \u201cthe age of Birchbox.\u201d)But one reason is that, like a complicated food intolerance, a comparison a lot of dermatologists make, sensitive skin is trendy, even if for sufferers it\u2019s no joke.\u201cPeople want to feel special,\u201d said Zoe Diana Draelos, a dermatologist and the founder of Dermatology Consulting Services, a company working in association with the skin products industry, which has tested dozens of products for sensitive skin.To screen potential volunteers, all of whom said they had sensitive skin, she applies water to one nasolabial skin fold (a.k.a. a smile line) and lactic acid to the other and asks if anything stings. Only about half identify correctly, meaning they truly have what scientists call heightened neurosensory awareness.To make products suitable for so-called reactive skin, a lot of companies just mix in the anti-inflammatories allantoin (a comfrey plant extract) or bisabolol (a chamomile extract) and call it a day. These ingredients may help, but it depends on what else is in the formulation, Dr. Draelos said.The company\u2019s founder, Patti Pao, a sensitive skin sufferer, paid $25 million for 20 years of exclusive rights to the hydrolyzed salmon roe protein, which she discovered in Norway when she insisted on visiting a hatchery while trying to avoid a corporate-bonding hike. Ms. Pao, who has worked in product management at Avon and Guerlain, immediately noticed how smooth and even-textured the workers\u2019 hands were compared with their weather-beaten faces, and set out to investigate.The enzyme, she says, can exfoliate sensitive skin without causing redness, itchiness or flakiness because unlike traditional exfoliators, it dissolves only dead skin cells: It stops working when it encounters living tissue. Because the enzyme itself is living (\u201cnot to gross you out,\u201d Ms. Pao said), it\u2019s constantly working, \u201cas if your aesthetician were constantly following you around sloughing off dead skin,\u201d she said.A Restorsea-funded double-blind study published in the Journal of Drugs in Dermatology found that the line of products, of which Gwyneth Paltrow is a fan, worked as well as those containing either 4 percent glycolic acid or 8 percent glycolic acid plus 2 percent citric acid, but with no stinging and burning.\u201cI was kind of skeptical, so it was a big surprise to see this natural substance hold its own against glycolic acid, something that\u2019s a gold standard of the cosmetic dermatology,\u201d said Anne Chapas, a dermatologist in Manhattan, one of four authors of the study.Like Ms. Pao, Amy Wechsler, a Manhattan dermatologist, has reactive skin \u2014 in her case, so much so that she travels with her own soap. When Chanel skin care brought her on as a consultant five years ago, she tentatively broached the subject of a product without fragrance, a major source of irritation, figuring that a house that makes some of the world\u2019s best-known perfumes wouldn\u2019t go for it.\u201cIf anyone in our test got so much as a pimple, we started over,\u201d Dr. Wechsler said. Chanel also tested the cream in Beijing to see if it would help skin handle the so-called oxidative stress of pollution. Eighty percent of subjects felt soothed instantly, according to company figures.The cream, as its name suggests, has just 10 ingredients, compared with the usual 20 or 30, which plays to the myth that minimalism makes for gentler products.A third company, London-based Pai, also has a product developer with sensitive skin: its founder, Sarah Brown. Over the years, Ms. Brown spent thousands of dollars on hypoallergenic and natural creams and serums to treat her skin, without success. \u201cI felt quite duped,\u201d she said of promises most of them made. (\u201cHypoallergenic\u201d and \u201cnatural\u201d are marketing terms, not regulatory ones.)What made it tricky was that salicylic acid and most other spot-treaters are harsh and drying, and Ms. Brown wanted a serum without alcohol, which damages the skin\u2019s barrier but is a skin-care m.v.p. for its ability to keep formulas stable and to thin out heavy products, making them feel weightless.After rejecting dozens of plant-based ingredients because it turned out they had been preserved using alcohol, she found copaiba essential oil, which is made from resin tapped from trees in the Amazon jungle in the manner of maple syrup, and has molecules that fight both infection and inflammation. A company-funded study showed a \u201cstatistically significant\u201d reduction in blemishes over a nearly two-month period.You don\u2019t have to believe the study. In a nod to her history as a frustrated consumer, Ms. Brown allows buyers to return products within 30 days, however much they\u2019ve used.\u201cI don\u2019t mean to be dramatic, but you feel quite powerless when you have to keep buying more products to try,\u201d Ms. Brown said. \u201cIt\u2019s liberating to take at least a bit of the control back.\u201dConvinced you have sensitive skin? You may be scrubbing too hard.\u201cRemember that Irish Spring commercial \u2018clean as a whistle?\u2019 You actually don\u2019t want that,\u201d Dr. Wechsler said. \u201cIf your skin is squeaky clean, you\u2019ve removed the bad oils, but you\u2019ve also removed the good ones.\u201d She recommends washing your face for no longer than 30 seconds, using only your (clean) hands, not a cloth or device.Some other tips:You don\u2019t need to feel a tingle for a product to work. \u201cPeople think that\u2019s a sign, but I don\u2019t agree,\u201d Dr. Wechsler said.Two mild products can sometimes make an irritant. \u201cIt can happen where you\u2019re using an exfoliant or something that by itself doesn\u2019t bother your skin, but you strip off enough dead skin that the second product causes irritation,\u201d said Mr. Schueller.\u201cUnscented\u201d isn\u2019t a synonym for \u201cfragrance free.\u201d Products that are the former can have fragrances to mask the smell. \u201cHaving fragrance isn\u2019t the kiss of death,\u201d Mr. Schueller said. \u201cBut for people who have sensitive skin, fragrances are the smoking gun.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The N.F.L. Has Seen the Future, and It Is WWE Wrestling", "Date": "2016-04-08", "News": "Supported bySports BusinessA four-hour-plus extravaganza, WrestleMania 32 culminated with a title match that pitted Roman Reigns against Paul Levesque, a.k.a. Triple H, a villain turned fan favorite who is also a top WWE executive and is married to Stephanie McMahon, the daughter of Vince McMahon, WWE\u2019s billionaire chief executive. Although Triple H controlled the match most of the way, he lost the world championship after his wife leapt into the ring, which flustered him, allowing Reigns to win. Boos rained down as the victor hoisted his championship belt.Although professional wrestling does not exactly qualify as a real sport, nearly 102,000 fans showed up at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Tex., to watch WrestleMania 32, which grossed a record $17.3 million from the live event alone. Tens of thousands of additional fans paid $59.95 to watch on pay-per-view television. Many more watched it on a streaming app called WWE Network, which costs subscribers $9.99 a month.In mid-February, during its quarterly earnings call, the company announced that the WWE Network had 1.22 million subscribers. After WrestleMania 32, that number jumped to 1.82 million. Although some of those subscribers will fall away \u2014 the WWE Network offers a monthlong free trial to potential customers, some of whom undoubtedly signed up just to watch WrestleMania for free \u2014 that is still nearly a 50 percent increase in six weeks.But strategically at least, what the N.F.L. is doing is not all that different from what WWE has done with its digital app. With more and more people watching movies and television shows that are streamed to digital devices rather than shown via traditional platforms like cable and satellite, the N.F.L. is preparing for the day when the same is true for live sports.Right now, live sports are the single most important reason the transition from traditional television to online streaming isn\u2019t happening even faster. There are advertisers who will air commercials only during live events, which mostly means sports; they know that many viewers will avoid ads by seeking out their favorite shows on on-demand streaming services. And there are many viewers whose desire to watch sports is the only thing keeping them from cutting the cord.But the N.F.L. isn\u2019t in the business of propping up traditional television\u2019s business model; it\u2019s in the business of getting people to watch football games. And when the day comes that most of them prefer to have those games streamed, well, the N.F.L. wants to be ready.WWE started its own streaming business in 2014. For more than two decades, its television home has been USA Network, which airs WWE\u2019s flagship show, \u201cRaw,\u201d every Monday night. (A second show, \u201cSmackdown,\u201d runs on Thursday nights.) USA, which is owned by NBC Universal, is one of the top-rated cable networks, in no small part because \u201cRaw\u201d is among the top-rated cable shows. The programming WWE doesn\u2019t air on USA \u2014 premium content like WrestleMania \u2014 has historically consisted of pay-per-view events.Around 2011, WWE started thinking about starting its own HBO-style cable channel, according to George Barrios, the company\u2019s chief strategy and financial officer. (Barrios went to WWE from The New York Times Company, where he was the treasurer.) But by 2013, WWE executives had done research showing that wrestling fans \u2014 most of whom are not wealthy \u2014 were big users of broadband, watching shows from streaming services like Netflix and Hulu considerably more often than most people. They were also voracious watchers of YouTube. (Barrios said the WWE gets more YouTube views for its short-form content, such as highlights, than any other sports channel.) So the company decided to abandon the cable channel idea and develop a streaming service instead.\u201cWe thought if this is where our consumers are going, we needed to be there as well,\u201d Barrios said. Streaming has undeniable advantages over traditional television. The subscribers belong to WWE, not to a cable company, so it can market to them more directly. It can sell WWE clothing and paraphernalia directly from its app. The WWE Network allows it to make money on its popular archives. And it gets steady, monthly checks from its subscribers, rather than having to count on less-reliable pay-per-view revenue.\u201cThey thought they needed one million subscribers to make it work,\u201d said Brandon Ross, an analyst who covers the stock for BTIG, an investment firm. \u201cFor them, it was a no-brainer.\u201d The WWE Network hit the million mark in 2015. WWE still offers its premium events on pay per view \u2014 so as not to lose fans who don\u2019t yet have broadband \u2014 but that income stream is declining as more wrestling fans turn to the WWE Network.What you won\u2019t find on the WWE Network is either \u201cRaw\u201d or \u201cSmackdown,\u201d which remain on USA. But that doesn\u2019t mean that USA executives aren\u2019t nervous. In May 2014, a few months after the launch of its new streaming service, WWE signed a new rights deal with the cable network that was considerably lower than expected. Clearly, the lower amount was a result of USA\u2019s fears that streaming would cut into its ratings. Wall Street panicked, and WWE\u2019s stock dropped almost 50 percent in a day. Though the stock eventually recovered, McMahon lost his billionaire status for a while.Today, \u201cRaw\u201d and \u201cSmackdown\u201d have a combined viewership of well over 10 million. That\u2019s still a lot higher than the WWE Network\u2019s 1.82 million subscribers. And WWE\u2019s television rights remain its largest single source of revenue. But the ratings for \u201cRaw\u201d are down somewhat \u2014 as are the ratings for the entire USA Network \u2014 and if the WWE Network continues to gain subscribers at the pace it is on, it\u2019s worth wondering how long WWE will remain committed to a cable network whose profits are dependent on an eroding business model.If I were an executive at CBS, NBC, Fox or ESPN, I would be nervous, too. The N.F.L.-Twitter deal might not look like much in financial terms, but it offers the N.F.L. a cheap and easy chance to experiment with putting football games online in a way that is untethered to a television network or a cable or satellite subscription. Over time, that can\u2019t possibly lead anyplace good for the networks.Indeed, Twitter got the deal over other Internet companies \u2014 some of which offered more money \u2014 precisely because it was willing to let the N.F.L. do pretty much anything it wants as it tries to work out a business model for streaming.For the N.F.L., Twitter offers a young, sports-minded audience (the Twittersphere lights up during major sports events); a way to reach football fans, and potential fans, internationally; and a chance to lure the many millennials who refuse to subscribe to cable even if it means missing pro football. As for Twitter, the N.F.L. allows the company to offer something no other social media service can claim, which it needs as it tries to reinvigorate its stalled subscriber base. Having professional football will increase user engagement; one can easily imagine people watching the game and posting to Twitter on the same screen. And it will give the company the chance to rethink how it generates advertising, which it desperately needs to do. For both parties, the deal makes sense.\u201cThe N.F.L. has a long history of finding the next wannabe,\u201d said Jay Rosenstein, a former executive at CBS Sports who now consults for Headline Media, a television talent and programming company. By that he means the N.F.L. finds entities yearning to carry pro football and turns that desire into money.The NFL added \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d for ABC (now on its corporate sibling ESPN), brought in Fox for Sunday afternoons, created \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d for ESPN (NBC now televises that package of games), moved games to Thursday night for its own network (which are now also shown on CBS and NBC), and sold its Sunday Ticket package to DirecTV. The N.F.L. is looking to streaming for the next wannabe.Rosenstein noted that all the N.F.L.\u2019s major television deals would be up for grabs at the end of this decade and the beginning of the next. Is it possible that a big Internet player, like Amazon, whose $100 billion-plus in annual revenue dwarfs that of, say, CBS ($13.9 billion last year), could decide to outbid one of the television networks for exclusive rights to one of the N.F.L.\u2019s packages of games? It is.As the N.F.L. gets savvier about streaming games thanks to its Twitter experience, could it decide to create its own subscription-only digital app for another package of games? It could. HBO now has a streaming app that viewers can pay for without needing a cable subscription. Why couldn\u2019t the N.F.L. do the same thing? It\u2019s not going to happen next week, or even next year, but if I were a betting man, I\u2019d say it will happen someday. If its fans eventually abandon old-fashioned television, so will the N.F.L.\u201cSports is what keeps people coming to television,\u201d said Ross, the securities analyst.Until it doesn\u2019t.An earlier version of this article misidentified the network for which \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d was created. It was ESPN, not NBC. (NBC gained the rights to that package of games in 2006.)Email: nocera@nytimes.comTwitter: @NoceraNYTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Was Your Dog Walked? Your Phone Can Show You", "Date": "2016-04-24", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 Some parents find peace of mind in the location-tracking features in smartphones that let them keep tabs on their children. There are also the dog owners who can rest easy knowing that hired dog walkers are doing their job, and that the dogs are doing their business.And then, there is the comfort of tracking your pizza delivery.When Lora Mastrangeli orders one from Pizza Hut every other week, she does not just wait for it. She stalks it.The moment her order leaves the nearest Pizza Hut, about 30 minutes from her home in Plano, Tex., the restaurant sends Ms. Mastrangeli an alert on her smartphone with a link to a map showing an image of a pizza delivery car driving toward her house. Since she knows her driver\u2019s location, she knows precisely when to scoop her two small dogs up and sequester them in a back room to keep them from yapping at the driver.\u201cMy husband and I absolutely love it,\u201d said Ms. Mastrangeli, who works in sales for Nordstrom. \u201cWe\u2019re walking out the door when he pulls up.\u201dPeople were amazed six years ago when the ride-hailing service Uber let them track the location of their drivers on a real-time map as they waited for a ride, rather than accepting the vague assurances of taxi dispatchers. Other tech start-ups followed with maps to pinpoint the location of all sorts of things, from shoes to food and the dog walkers.And new services from Comcast and Time Warner Cable allow customers to see the exact location of the cable repairman on the way to the house.So does tracking your pizza on a map just make you feel better?\u201cIt\u2019s pure psychological effect,\u201d said Nicholas Goubert, head of project management at Here, a digital maps company that provides location data to Amazon and other businesses. \u201cYour pizza is not going to come any sooner. But it\u2019s moving.\u201dSoon UPS, the world\u2019s largest package delivery company, may also begin showing customers exactly where their stuff is. UPS is exploring giving location maps of its familiar brown trucks to customers and could begin a trial of the service within a few months, according to a person briefed on the plan who asked for anonymity because it is still private.Executives at big, established companies concede that their moves are inspired by on-demand businesses like Uber, which have changed what customers expect from all kinds of services.\u201cIt brings that visibility and transparency that they\u2019re starting to come to expect with the Ubers and Lyfts,\u201d said Baron Concors, global chief digital officer for Pizza Hut, which began sharing the location of delivery drivers with customers in some markets about six months ago. \u201cThere\u2019s a new bar for experience when it comes to delivery and transportation that everyone is going to have to meet.\u201dIn many cases, companies that provide customers with live tracking information have a practical motivation. The service is intended to eliminate situations when someone misses a knock on the door by stepping into the shower or backyard. A missed delivery or service call is a logistical headache companies want to avoid.\u201cIf they have to come back, they lose money,\u201d said Bryan Trussel, chief executive of Glympse, a location-tracking start-up in Seattle that is working with companies like Pizza Hut, Comcast and Time Warner.Joshua Viner, chief executive of Wag, said the map allows pet owners to verify that their dog is getting the amount of exercise the owner is paying for.\u201cThere\u2019s no way to cheat the system,\u201d said Julien LoPresti, who works in sales and operations for a technology company in New York and has used Wag to find walkers for Reptar, his Labrador mix. \u201cIt gives you extra confidence.\u201dIn the next month, Wag will go even further by allowing walkers to commemorate where pets relieve themselves by tapping the screens on their smartphones. Corresponding emojis will materialize on the apps of pet owners.\u201cIt\u2019s all real time \u2014 it\u2019s almost like you\u2019re part of the experience,\u201d Mr. Viner said.Comcast was after a different experience when it began letting customers track the locations of technicians last year, part of a much broader initiative to improve customer satisfaction.The company used to have four-hour appointment windows when technicians could arrive at customers\u2019 homes, which confined the customers there for a good chunk of the day. Now Comcast has cut the appointment windows to two hours.\u201cThe overall premise is we should always be respecting customers\u2019 time,\u201d said Charlie Herrin, executive vice president of customer experience at Comcast.About 30 minutes before the two-hour window, Comcast sends the customer a notification through the Comcast mobile app giving a narrower, half-hour window when the technician expects to arrive. About 15 minutes before the technician pulls up at the home, Comcast sends a link to a map that shows the vehicle en route.Dr. Frei, the Harvard Business School professor, said customers would be happier if Comcast were more precise with its appointment estimates from the start.\u201cWhat I\u2019d like them to do is say, \u2018We will be there at 3 p.m.,\u2019 and then what I\u2019d like to have happen is they\u2019re there at 3 p.m.,\u201d she said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t need any transparency.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Some Top Nonprofits, Changing the World Begins in Seattle", "Date": "2016-04-08", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 Inside the factory buildings at Cascade Designs, just south of downtown Seattle, camping and hiking gear for the rugged outdoor life of the Pacific Northwest has been manufactured since the early 1970s. But turn a corner and something new is coming off the shop floor: a compact, no-frills water purifier designed to bring clean water to struggling populations in rural Africa.\u201cIt\u2019s a new frontier for us,\u201d said David Burroughs, the vice chairman of Cascade Designs, which was co-founded by his father, a former engineer at Boeing. Though the company\u2019s old style lives on \u2014 buildings are named for well-known mountains, employees show up for work in hiking boots \u2014 20 percent of the research and development budget, thanks to the grants, is now going to global health-related products.Microsoft, co-founded by Mr. Gates and Paul G. Allen, put Seattle on the map as a tech-rich city before the boom of dot-coms. Mr. Gates and Mr. Allen then took some of the billions they made and, starting in the early to mid-2000s, set out to work on global health at the Gates Foundation, and fundamental science in cell and brain research at the Allen Institute.The result: In trying to change the world, they are also changing their backyard. Their causes, such as clean water, sanitation and health, are spawning a new ecosystem of global health care companies, research institutes and academic expertise at places like the University of Washington.\u201cThe fact that we are physically located in Seattle has had an effect on us, and on the local community,\u201d said David Bley, the director of the Gates Foundation\u2019s Pacific Northwest Initiative, which works on issues of poverty, homelessness and education. \u201cA lot of both nonprofits or university-based efforts have grown with great momentum since our inception.\u201dIn addition, there are growing networks of second-generation, nonprofit leaders who were schooled at the Gates Foundation or Allen Institute, and have now filtered out to form a kind of self-reinforcing army. Seattle is first in the nation in private foundation revenue per capita, according to the Urban Institute, with two and a half times the amount of the No. 2 city, San Francisco, where philanthropic technology wealth has also soared.This is just a small part of the wave of money that is washing through Seattle and other tech cities these days, as companies like Amazon, the online retail giant, expand with new facilities and armies of engineers, software composers and deal makers.\u201cIt\u2019s in large part due to these partnerships,\u201d said Greg Allgood, the group\u2019s vice president for water.Another group called PATH, started in Seattle in the mid-1970s to work on family planning, has become \u2014 with the Gates Foundation providing half its budget \u2014 one of the world\u2019s biggest nonprofit developers of vaccines, medical devices and treatments. The company has 450 employees in Seattle, including 100 hired in the last year.And the reach of these post-Microsoft ambitions is still growing. Mr. Allen has charged his Allen Institute for Cell Science with creating an animated virtual model of human cells which would then be donated to the scientific community. Last month, Mr. Allen announced a global initiative called Frontiers Group to search for breakthrough ideas in bioscience \u2013 and then committed $100 million to support the best ideas.An important part of how nonprofit science works here, Mr. Allen said, is its concentration in the South Lake Union area, where The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, the Center for Infectious Disease Research and the neighboring University of Washington have provided a foundation in health science expertise that Mr. Gates and Mr. Allen later built on.\u201cThe neighborhood already had a long history of innovation,\u201d Mr. Allen said in an email. \u201cIn the early 20th century, Bill Boeing tested seaplanes off the lake, and Henry Ford built a Model T assembly line there. Today what we\u2019re doing in South Lake Union is taking on some of the challenges of the 21st century,\u201d he added. \u201cI believe this proximity breeds serendipity, and expect that great ideas will continue to emerge from South Lake Union.\u201dTime has also multiplied those effects, through a second generation of nonprofit workers who were trained at places like the Gates Foundation, which has more than 1,100 employees in Seattle.\u201cThese big philanthropies are changing the city and the region by bringing people in, and so being another magnet for talent,\u201d said Margaret O\u2019Mara, an associate professor of history at the University of Washington who studies modern capitalism and urban affairs.Philanthropies of Seattle\u2019s stripe also need different skills, Ms. O\u2019Mara said, in science, medicine and international affairs \u2014 not just tech workers and engineers. The third factor, she added, is that people move here and stay, further pushing out the wave of ripples. \u201cWhen Seattle gets people, it tends to keep them,\u201d she said.Still, there has at times been a steep learning curve for players in this new philanthropic arena.When a prototype for Cascade Designs\u2019s water purifier was sent to Kenya a few years ago for testing, for example, designers built the units in black. For the U.S. military and outdoor community the company served, black was \u201csexy and sleek,\u201d said Martin Maisonpierre, Cascade\u2019s communication director. The Kenyans, however, from a different cultural perspective, reacted badly.\u201c\u2018Why is it the color of death?\u2019\u201d Mr. Maisonpierre said, quoting the testers.So after a gasp at the misunderstanding and trip back to the drawing board, the next generation of water purifiers became cool and culturally neutral blue.Advertisement"}

I mean, other than what our bosses pay you?Oh also, I started watching back episodes of \u201cHalt and Catch Fire\u201d on Netflix and man, that show rules. It deals with the rise of the PC and the era when IBM, or Big Blue, reigned supreme. A different era entirely.Here\u2019s what matters: Aside from the $100 million Uber said it would pay drivers involved in the suit, the company conceded to a bunch of new rules and policies that make things at least slightly better for drivers.For one, drivers can ask for tips now, something they weren\u2019t able to do before (unlike Lyft, where they can get tips inside the app). Uber will also create a union-style \u201cdrivers association\u201d in California and Massachusetts \u2014 just don\u2019t call them unions! \u2014 so that drivers can air their grievances. And drivers won\u2019t automatically be deactivated for canceling too many trips over time.That seems like a list of ways Uber can defend itself in other states in which it faces lawsuits. Essentially, the further away Uber gets from acting like actual employers with drivers \u2014 that is, the less control it exerts over the work force \u2014 the more room it has to call its drivers \u201cpartners\u201d and not employees.This settlement sounds a bit like that situation: Uber drivers get some perks of employment, including people to complain to, and some measure of job security (even if it\u2019s probably pretty weak). But they don\u2019t get to be full employees \u2014 meaning the company does not have to pay them benefits, and the drivers are free to work as much or as little as they\u2019d like.Am I wrong to see this as a pretty good middle-of-the-road fix to a thorny problem that had been vexing lots of on-demand companies?The counterargument for some of this is that Uber can still shut drivers out of the app for short periods of time if they make too many trip cancellations. That\u2019s a level of control that one could argue should be reserved for an employer-employee relationship.Anyway, the moral of the story is this seems to have been largely defused, though not entirely over and done with. Watch other states and the subsequent litigation closely.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Presses for Open Market for Cable Set-Top Boxes", "Date": "2016-04-15", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama on Friday announced his support for opening the market for cable set-top boxes, singling out the devices in millions of homes as a clunky and outdated symbol of corporate power over consumers, as he introduced a broad federal effort to increase competition.In an unusual step, Mr. Obama weighed in personally on a pending proposal at the Federal Communications Commission, having his administration file comments that applauded the effort to loosen cable companies\u2019 grip on the boxes.The president, in an interview with Yahoo Finance, said it was an example of the kinds of actions government agencies should take in response to an executive order he signed on Friday calling for administrative action to promote competition and to better protect consumers.\u201cThe cable or satellite box is just one example of an area where, because it\u2019s been tied to the provider and you rent it, and consumers spend billions of dollars on it every single year, there hasn\u2019t been much innovation,\u201d Mr. Obama said, adding that the private sector becomes less effective \u201cif we get closed systems or if people are gaming the system.\u201dThe announcements are the newest moves by Mr. Obama to push back against the forces of consolidation and monopoly, and to shift power away from large corporations in an array of industries.They are also the latest to place the president squarely on the side of technology companies \u2014 some led by executives who have contributed to Mr. Obama\u2019s campaigns, hired his former aides and spoken to him often. Among the supporters of the set-top box proposal are companies like Google, Amazon and Apple, which are eager to establish a broader foothold in the TV market.\u201cAn industry that had previously been considered untouchable \u2014 the cable guys \u2014 is now subject to criticism from the president,\u201d said Susan Crawford, a Harvard Law School professor who is a former aide to Mr. Obama. \u201cThis is like weighing in against Big Tobacco or Big Pharma.\u201dCable industry leaders lashed out at Mr. Obama, arguing that he was rewarding political friends and benefactors like those at Google, and undermining the independence of the F.C.C.Jim Cicconi, a senior executive vice president at AT&T, said the president\u2019s move was \u201caimed at muscling Democratic commissioners to support the Google proposal.\u201dThe administration can comment on any proposal by the F.C.C., an independent agency, but it does so sparingly, and it is rare for the president himself to speak out on a pending matter. In this case, his advisers said he felt that the issue merited his involvement because of the broad impact the changes could have on the cable market, one that touches many American households.In comments submitted on Friday, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, part of the Commerce Department, urged the F.C.C. to take a \u201cmeasured and balanced\u201d approach to injecting competition into the set-top box market, including enabling alternative providers to provide their own user interfaces, as well as other features.In a blog post, Jason Furman, the chairman of Mr. Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, and Jeffrey D. Zients, the director of the National Economic Council, called the set-top box rule the \u201cmascot\u201d for Mr. Obama\u2019s new pro-competition executive order.The president\u2019s aides gave no examples of the kinds of rules Mr. Obama would like to see agencies propose in response to the executive order. Mr. Furman said White House officials had already notified the agencies of the coming call for recommendations, so some of the regulations were already underway.The push announced on Friday is in line with Mr. Obama\u2019s promise in his State of the Union address this year to find ways to help workers, small businesses and entrepreneurs. In a report issued on Friday, the Council of Economic Advisers said that competition was declining in many industries and argued that the decrease was having a harmful effect on consumers and workers.Mr. Obama has acted several times to combat the trend, including signing legislation to unlock cellphones, which allows consumers to switch providers while keeping the same device.The Transportation Department has pressed airports to open slots to more airlines, while the F.C.C. adopted rules for auctioning wireless spectrum intended to allow smaller players more opportunities to participate.The report released on Friday listed several areas that the president\u2019s advisers said they thought could be ripe for pro-competition regulations, including so-called Big Data, the consumer information that includes buying habits and Internet browsing histories, price transparency and common ownership of stock by large institutional investors.Advertisement"}

Over time, with swagger and an unwavering belief in the value of physical bookstores, he turned it into the country\u2019s largest bookselling chain.On Wednesday, the company announced that Mr. Riggio, the founder and executive chairman of Barnes & Noble Inc., would retire in September.He initially planned to retire at 40, but got swept up in the excitement of building the company, Mr. Riggio, now 75, said in an interview on Tuesday.\u201cI had never planned to be a business person for life,\u201d he said. \u201cI had always wanted to do something different after I\u2019d been in business for a while and made some money.\u201dDuring his tenure, Mr. Riggio steered the company through heady days of explosive growth in the 1980s and 1990s, when Barnes & Noble expanded nationally and opened its first superstores.Brash and sporting a sleek mustache, Mr. Riggio brought outsize ambition to the bookselling trade as he built his retail empire. His biggest innovation \u2014 turning his bookstores into a destination where people could meet up and linger \u2014 helped transform bookselling from a genteel, fusty calling into big business.In recent years, he has also been the company\u2019s most stable and visible leader during a prolonged period of turmoil. The company has closed 80 of its outlets around the country in the last six years, leaving a base of 640 retail stores. Barnes & Noble shares, which traded above $45 in 2006, closed at $12.42 on Tuesday.Its heavy investments in the Nook e-reader and its doomed effort to take on tech giants like Amazon and Apple in the digital book market proved financially disastrous. Last summer, the company brought in a new leader, Ron Boire, who became Barnes & Noble\u2019s third chief executive in just six years.Despite those setbacks, Mr. Riggio says he feels confident that the company he built will recover its footing, as it continues to cut losses from the Nook and experiments with a new store prototype. \u201cThe company\u2019s in a very good position,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to be the best bookseller we can be.\u201dMr. Riggio, who will keep a seat on the board, said he has no plans to sell his stock. He remains the company\u2019s largest individual shareholder, with 17.5 percent.Born in Little Italy, Mr. Riggio grew up in Bensonhurst, the son of a professional boxer turned cabdriver. His career as a bookseller began in the early 1960s, when he took a job at New York University\u2019s college bookstore to help pay for his tuition. He dropped out of college to open a rival bookstore, SBX, for Student Book Exchange, and started managing several other campus bookstores. A few years later, he bought Barnes & Noble, a bookstore on Fifth Avenue, with a $1.2 million loan.In the mid-1970s, Mr. Riggio began acquiring smaller chains. In 1986, he bought the B. Dalton bookstore chain and took over its roughly 800 stores across the country.Mr. Riggio took Barnes & Noble public and became the chief executive in 1993. He held the post until 2002.With its ubiquitous outlets \u2014 giant stores with comfy seats, a cafe and bathrooms with changing tables \u2014 Barnes & Noble became a place to loiter as much as buy books. Some in the literary world scoffed at Barnes & Noble\u2019s deep discounts and its cookie-cutter, superstore formula, but Mr. Riggio saw the store\u2019s nationwide expansion and low prices as a \u201cdemocratization\u201d of the marketplace.\u201cOur bookstores were designed to be welcoming as opposed to intimidating,\u201d Mr. Riggio said. \u201cThese weren\u2019t elitist places. You could go in, get a cup of coffee, sit down and read a book for as long as you like, use the restroom. These were innovations that we had that no one thought was possible.\u201dThe strategy worked so well that for a time, Barnes & Noble was vilified as a greedy monopolist that was crushing independent booksellers. Thousands of independent stores closed during the mid- to late 1990s, as Barnes & Noble expanded. It opened multifloor superstores with more than 100,000 titles.Mr. Riggio still bristles slightly at the criticism. \u201cThey would say, \u2018You\u2019re homogenizing bookselling,\u2019 which was ridiculous because we were carrying 5,000 to 10,000 more titles than would be in a typical bookstore,\u201d Mr. Riggio said.But lately, as independent bookstores have enjoyed a resurgence, Barnes & Noble has itself become something of an underdog.The company waged a fierce battle for dominance in the e-book marketplace, and was badly beaten by Amazon.\u201cWe\u2019re great booksellers; we know how to do that,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Riggio said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t constituted to be a technology company.\u201dMr. Riggio said that once he retires, he might write a book, though not a conventional business memoir. He wants to travel to South America and visit museums and galleries (he is a passionate art collector).\u201cI don\u2019t want to run any more businesses,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a great idea for a sock store, but I\u2019m not going to do it. I\u2019m done making money.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Losing Ground\u2019 Meditates on Art as It Examines a Marriage in Peril", "Date": "2016-04-15", "News": "Supported byOn DVDBarely released in 1982 and all but unseen for over three decades, Kathleen Collins\u2019s \u201cLosing Ground\u201d is a lively movie \u2014 as well as a ghostly one. Ms. Collins and her two male leads, Bill Gunn and Duane Jones, died long before the film resurfaced at Lincoln Center in early 2015 as part of a survey of independent African-American cinema produced in New York between 1968 and 1986.Ms. Collins, a civil rights activist in her youth, was nearing 40 and a member of the faculty at City College in Manhattan when she began working on the film, which concerns the foundering marriage between Sara (Seret Scott), a buttoned-up philosophy professor who is introduced giving a lecture on existentialism, and Victor, an ebullient painter of abstract works played by Mr. Gunn, himself a talented filmmaker. During the course of a summer spent vacationing in a Hudson River town, their searches intertwine: Sara is seeking to understand \u201cthe ecstatic experience,\u201d while Victor, a man with a roving eye, is looking to add some emotional content to his work.That neither Sara nor Victor always inspires audience sympathy adds complexity to the characters. Ms. Scott (who appeared in the Broadway cast of Ntozake Shange\u2019s \u201cFor Colored girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow Is Enuf\u201d and has had a long career as a theater director) plays Sara as a 19th-century schoolmarm. Awkward, unfulfilled and living inside her head, she is at once patronized by and patronizing of her glib, superficially easygoing husband.The making of this low-budget production brings out Ms. Collins\u2019s comic gifts even as it allows Sara to blossom. The part of Frankie suits her, as do the attentions of her dashing co-star, played to the hilt by Mr. Jones, featured in the original \u201cNight of the Living Dead\u201d and one of the title characters in Mr. Gunn\u2019s 1973 cult film, \u201cGanja & Hess.\u201dThe film within the film also enabled Ms. Collins to contrive an ersatz Hollywood ending for \u201cLosing Ground.\u201d An abrupt denouement is dramatically satisfying, and sobering: It foreshadows Ms. Collins\u2019s own tragically foreshortened career. (She died of cancer at 46, in 1988.)The death of the director Chantal Akerman (who, like Ms. Collins, taught film at City College) in October has made her already personal films seem even more so \u2014 none as much as \u201cDown There\u201d (2006), now available in a five-DVD box, \u201cChantal Akerman: Four Films,\u201d out from Icarus.Long, contemplative compositions \u2014 usually mediated by the thin slats of a bamboo shade \u2014 are accompanied by ambient street noise or one side of the filmmaker\u2019s phone conversations. Unlike the protagonist of Hitchcock\u2019s \u201cRear Window,\u201d Ms. Akerman does not construct fantasies regarding her neighbors; it is her family history and her own alienation, not least as a Jew who feels estranged in Israel, which she seeks to understand.Echoing that of J. K. Huysmans\u2019s 19th-century novel, the movie\u2019s French title, \u201cL\u00e0-Bas,\u201d has intimations of damnation as well as depression. What\u2019s remarkable is the degree to which Ms. Akerman uses the interplay of place and displacement to wrest beauty from despair.The three other documentaries in the Icarus set may be the most political films in Ms. Akerman\u2019s oeuvre. \u201cSouth\u201d (1999) explores the Texas countryside where James Byrd Jr. was dragged to his death in a 1998 race killing; \u201cFrom the Other Side\u201d (2002) is another landscape study, documenting the Arizona-Mexico border.And \u201cFrom the East\u201d (1993), previously released as a stand-alone DVD, is among Ms. Akerman\u2019s greatest films. A travelogue across the once-restricted post-Communist territory of Eastern Europe and Russia, it is a series of microdramas with the simplicity and freshness of the Lumi\u00e8re brothers\u2019 earliest one-shot motion pictures.Ms. Akerman was an articulate commentator on her own work. The box includes \u201cChantal Akerman, From Here,\u201d an hourlong conversation with the filmmaker from 2010, and a booklet with new essays by two of her most eloquent critical champions, Amy Taubin and Jonathan Rosenbaum.NEWLY RELEASEDAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Switch to iPhone From Android: Patience and Persistence", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported byGadgetwiseThe iPhone has obviously come a long way since then. It can now be used on any carrier. Its voice and data quality are stellar. Some of its built-in apps, such as Apple Pay, are best in class. There are 1.5 million apps created by outside developers.I have finally caved in: My phone is now an iPhone.Faced with slowing sales growth, Apple is counting on millions of people like me to give up their Android phones, which can be bought new for as little as $30 in some countries, to purchase iPhones, which cost $400 or more.\u201cWe were blown away by the level of Android switchers that we had last quarter,\u201d Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, told Wall Street in January. \u201cWe see that as a huge opportunity.\u201dAs someone who has since 2010 used high-end phones based on Google\u2019s Android operating system, I have experienced a rocky transition, like moving to a faraway city. The landmarks are unfamiliar, the customs are different, and I miss my old haunts even as I explore new ones.Switching phone operating systems should in theory be simple. First you transfer your data from the old phone to the new one. Then you reinstall your favorite apps. Finally you customize the settings for features like ring tones and notifications and learn the quirks of your new device.But as I learned, many things can go wrong, and my experience is not unusual.\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to go through the things that are most valuable to you and make sure it\u2019s all there,\u201d said Jonathan S. Geller, editor in chief of BGR, a tech news site that reviews phones and writes frequently about switching. \u201cFor a normal consumer, it\u2019s reasonably frustrating.\u201dHere\u2019s what happened when I switched:A lot of contacts and photos never made it through. It was as if a moving company had lost half my stuff during a cross-country haul.Apple later told me that I could have called a toll-free number for help, gone to an Apple store or erased everything and started over. The company lent me another iPhone 6S to try the Move to iOS app again \u2014 and this time it did transfer my data. But it failed to do the other half of the job: download the Apple versions of my Android apps to the new iPhone.The most fundamental difference between iPhones and Androids is the level of conformity dictated by each company. This is where personal preferences play a big role in customer satisfaction.Apple exercises great control over the look, feel and features of iPhones to deliver its idealized version of what it thinks people want. Android is free-form and adaptable \u2014 so much so that the look and feel can vary widely from one phone maker to the next, especially in Asia.One consequence of Apple\u2019s approach is that the iPhone is more stable. Every Android phone I have ever used has suffered mysterious hardware and software problems like random reboots and crashing apps. These happen much more rarely in iOS.But Apple\u2019s control has its downsides. The company makes its apps the permanent default options for common services like maps, web browsing and email.In my case, I have a Windows laptop; my employer, The New York Times, uses Google\u2019s enterprise apps; and I depend on Google\u2019s search technology to find airline tickets, email addresses and old photos stored in my various digital pockets. My life is deeply enmeshed in the Google ecosystem.To make my iPhone more familiar and my data easier to find, I put my favorite Google apps on my home screen and mostly use them instead of Apple\u2019s apps. Google has knitted its iPhone apps together so that Gmail uses Google\u2019s browser, Chrome, when you click on a link in an email, and Google\u2019s calendar uses Google Maps when you click on an address.Given the headaches of switching, most people avoid it.Michael R. Levin, partner and co-founder of Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, which surveys smartphone users in the United States, said only about one out of five people activating a new iPhone or Android was switching from the other platform. \u201cIn the past two years, the loyalty and switching rates have gotten very, very set,\u201d he said.Over all, I am getting more comfortable with my iPhone. I like Apple\u2019s fingerprint reader and have finally figured out how to align my fingertips precisely enough to unlock the phone (at least most of the time).Will the iPhone ever feel like home? Check back in two years, when I am due for my next upgrade.An article on the Personal Tech pages on Thursday about switching to an iPhone from an Android device misstated the content of a Google web page. It has tips for those switching from an Apple iPhone, not to it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Forget Too Much TV. It\u2019s Too Big TV We Should Worry About.", "Date": "2016-04-25", "News": "Supported byCritic's NotebookIt may have been \u201cTiny House Nation\u201d that finally broke me. Last month this offbeat real estate show on the FYI network began its third season of cramming homeowners into trailers, bungalows and other mini abodes.The homes are little. The season premiere was not. The running time was nearly 65 minutes uninterrupted \u2014 a full hour and a half with ads.As a critic, I\u2019m used to championing greater options for artists. We\u2019re lucky to live in a time when TV creators have freedom from arbitrary constraints. But more and more of my TV watching these days involves starting an episode, looking at the number of minutes on the playback bar and silently cursing.Historically, network television was like a container ship; the product had to fit standard boxes for ease of shipping. Networks needed predictable schedules and had to turn over specific time slots to affiliates.It was a process \u2014 15-minute episodes were a presence in the early days of television \u2014 but 30 minutes generally came to mean comedy, and 60, drama. Episodes used to be longer, in that commercial breaks were shorter, but the journey from beginning to end stayed the same. And networks occasionally tinkered with length. NBC supersized its popular Thursday night sitcoms in the early aughts; Fox inflated \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d like a Macy\u2019s parade balloon. But those stunts were exceptions.Meanwhile, basic cable channels realized that there was no reason their \u201chourlong\u201d series needed to end on the hour. If they pushed a 10 p.m. drama\u2019s end to, say, 11:17, they could give their creators the kind of narrative real estate available on ad-free HBO and Showtime.The most dramatic early claimer of elbow room was FX\u2019s biker-gang drama, \u201cSons of Anarchy,\u201d which piled on plot and ended its plus-size episodes with music montages. Now it\u2019s common for cable hits to plump up. The most recent season finale of \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d ran 90 minutes, though I have rarely seen an episode of \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d that needed its full 60. Like its zombies, it could be hacked down by a third and shamble along just as well.At best, extended episodes can make room for complexity. But focus and showmanship still matter. In a peak-TV era, being able to hook an audience is more important, not less.Louis C. K. may have earned the right to go long by proving he could also go short; his FX comedy, \u201cLouie,\u201d included stories that would run only a few minutes if that was all they needed. AMC\u2019s \u201cBetter Call Saul,\u201d a more conventional drama, regularly overstays its one-hour slot by a few minutes. But it uses its time mindfully, to suspend tension and let character moments play out.There\u2019s a certain be-careful-what-you-wish-for aspect to longer episodes, even with great shows. When the sixth season of the sitcom \u201cCommunity\u201d moved to Yahoo from NBC, it was finally free of time-slot constraints \u2014 and something was off. The pacing was sluggish; the jokes were less crystalline. Maybe \u201cCommunity\u201d \u2014 a product of the fractious network-TV compromise between art and business \u2014 needed limits in order to transcend them.Those time constraints and network scissors, much as writers love to bash them, can be the Marie Kondo method of comedy. The first season of Netflix\u2019s \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\u201d was originally made for NBC, and like its spiritual forebear \u201c30 Rock,\u201d it was packed like a diamond. The second season, made for streaming, is still funny, but you can feel the drag in some of its 30-minutes-plus episodes.TV was raised with rules, the product of technology and business models that had little to do with art. It\u2019s shedding those strictures as it grows up, which is good \u2014 that\u2019s given us anarchic comedies like \u201cBroad City\u201d and low-and-slow dramas like \u201cRectify.\u201dBut freedom also proves the values of the discipline you learn under restrictions. I appreciate ambitious storytelling. But I also appreciate getting a full night\u2019s sleep.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Case Against Google Might Help Rivals More Than Consumers", "Date": "2016-04-28", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseIn a persistent (and thus far fruitless) effort to hobble giant American technology companies, the European Union has again taken aim at Alphabet\u2019s Google search engine.At first blush, it might seem the Europeans are onto something. If device manufacturers want to preinstall the Google Play app, they must agree to install Google search and its Chrome browser as well \u2014 and make Google the default search engine.With some manufacturers, Google pays to have its search function preinstalled as the default option \u2014 an estimated $1 billion a year to Apple, according to a court filing last year.If these claims seem a little like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, that\u2019s because anyone over the age of 20 has seen this before: Microsoft embedded its Internet Explorer browser in its Windows desktop operating system, a so-called tying arrangement. In the late 1990s, the Justice Department and European Union regulators accused Microsoft of illegally trying to extend its dominant position in operating systems to Internet browsers and search. (Microsoft ultimately settled the cases.)But the rapid rise of mobile and tablet devices has pretty much rendered all that irrelevant. The latest version of Internet Explorer still has the largest market share for desktop Internet browsers, but it has only a negligible share for fast-growing mobile and tablet devices, where Google Chrome is far ahead.Technological change has also undermined the superficial similarities between the old Microsoft case and the new Android one. Back then, consumers who wanted a rival browser like Netscape to run on their Windows operating system rather than the (free) Explorer had to go to a store, pay for a disk with a rival program and then install it.Today, a free rival browser is a tap away. When I checked into Google Play this week, there were more browser choices than I knew what to do with, including some I\u2019d never heard of (Maxthon?). But I\u2019m satisfied with Google\u2019s offering and have no interest in further cluttering my phone\u2019s display screen.It\u2019s so easy to substitute or add apps that it\u2019s not even clear Google\u2019s agreements with manufacturers would be deemed tying arrangements. \u201cI don\u2019t think they meet the requirement,\u201d said Herbert Hovenkamp, an antitrust expert at the University of Iowa College of Law. \u201cThere\u2019s almost no limit to your ability to add additional apps or to delete the Google app and substitute a different one.\u201dOf course, there\u2019s obviously an advantage to being the default app, or else Google wouldn\u2019t be paying Apple such a large sum. \u201cOn the other hand, anyone can change if they\u2019re unhappy,\u201d Professor Hovenkamp said.Nor do manufacturers have to preinstall any Google apps on devices using Android, which is an open source system, available free. Amazon\u2019s Fire was an Android mobile device with a built-in Amazon shopping app, but it didn\u2019t come with Google Play or Search preinstalled. Fire was deemed a flop, in part because it lacked popular Google apps like Gmail and Maps.Even if Google is found to be using a tying arrangement, that\u2019s not necessarily illegal or bad for consumers. Scott Hemphill, an antitrust professor at New York University School of Law, said tying arrangements are common across a wide array of products and industries. \u201cNo one complains because they don\u2019t have a choice of transmission manufacturers in their cars,\u201d Professor Hemphill said.These same issues were raised last year in a class-action suit in a Federal District Court in California.The two named plaintiffs both bought Android phones, one in Louisville, Ky., the other in Des Moines, Iowa, and complained that they hadn\u2019t realized they came with Google search already installed. Judge Beth Labson Freeman of Federal District Court struggled to find any evidence that either had suffered any harm.So who exactly is being hurt by Google\u2019s behavior? It\u2019s not, apparently, consumers, in whose name this battle is being fought. Google\u2019s search engine is even more popular in Europe, where it has a more than 90 percent market share, according to the European Union, than it is in the United States.The driving force pushing the European action was a consortium of Google\u2019s corporate rivals \u2014 foremost among them, ironically, Microsoft, which once complained loudly about European overreaching. It has backed a lobbying group called FairSearch, which hailed the European action against Google as \u201ca crucial step to end abusive business practices.\u201d(Microsoft and Google said this week that they were burying the hatchet and would withdraw regulatory complaints about each other around the globe. Microsoft has said it will no longer back FairSearch.)If Microsoft really wants to compete with Google\u2019s search engine in Europe, it has the wherewithal to outbid Google and pay manufacturers to make Bing their default search engine.The Russian Internet company Yandex has been the most vocal in urging European action against Apple, which is even more ironic considering that Russia is not a member of the European Union and has been sanctioned over its annexation of Crimea. Yandex has dominated Internet search in Russia but has recently been losing ground there to Google. It filed \u2014 and, no surprise, won \u2014 similar claims in Russia. (Google is appealing that outcome.)Even if competitors like Yandex would stand to benefit, \u201cthe purpose of antitrust law, at least in the U.S., is to protect consumers, not competitors,\u201d Professor Hemphill said.Professor Hovenkamp echoed that thought. \u201cEurope is moving pretty far into left field with this case,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems like over-regulation for the benefit of competitors that won\u2019t end up doing consumers any good.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Virtual Reality Lures Media Companies to a New Frontier", "Date": "2016-04-19", "News": "Supported byMedia and entertainment companies want to help shape the next entertainment platform: virtual reality.Some media and entertainment companies are also starting to invest in virtual reality companies themselves.HBO was recently the lead investor in an addition to a funding round for Otoy, a Los Angeles-based special effects start-up. Otoy, whose LightStage facial rendering technology, used in films like \u201cThe Curious Case of Benjamin Button,\u201d has won an Academy Award, has also gotten into virtual reality. Discovery Communications and Liberty Media participated in the funding, which raised as much as $37 million and was an extension of financing that took place in 2014, according to VC Experts, a venture capital research firm.\u201cNot a single media company isn\u2019t thinking about what happens when the rectangle goes away,\u201d said Jules Urbach, 41, the founder of Otoy, referring to a future when videos are experienced in virtual reality rather than watched on screens. \u201cEveryone needs a strategy.\u201dOtoy, whose name is short for \u201conline toy,\u201d lets people capture virtual reality video, process it and then distribute it to viewers with its technology. Otoy also makes a virtual reality player that is free to download; the company wants to become the open standard for virtual reality distribution.\u201cThink of them as the cloud system similar to what Pixar would use to create incredible graphics,\u201d said Matt Miesnieks, whose firm Super Ventures invests in virtual and augmented reality start-ups. Otoy could eventually become a platform, like an Amazon Web Services for graphics, he said.Michael Lombardo, HBO\u2019s president for programming, said most video created for virtual reality currently \u201cleans toward marketing stunts or promotional opportunities,\u201d but that could change when companies like Otoy become more integrated into the process of creating programming.With the additional funding, Otoy\u2019s valuation of more than $300 million did not change from 2014, according to VC Experts, which added that the start-up had raised a total of $101 million.Otoy, founded in 2009 as a company whose software is used to make 3-D graphics, declined to comment on financial details. Its previous investors include Ari Emanuel, co-chief executive of William Morris Endeavor, and the enterprise software company Autodesk.Of the 133 virtual and augmented reality investments made in 2015, media companies participated in six, according to the venture capital research firm CB Insights.Discovery Communications introduced a service last August called Discovery VR, which is available via Apple and Android apps, as well as through other outlets. Discovery VR has more than 75 virtual reality experiences about such topics as sharks, gold mining and surfing. The app has been downloaded nearly 600,000 times and has been viewed more than 23 million times, according to the company.Suzanne Kolb, executive vice president of Discovery Digital Networks, said the deal with Otoy should give Discovery a front-row seat to new technological developments and ways to tell stories. \u201cIt is an evolving space,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

Revenue, at $20.26 billion, was about $120 million less than expected. Earnings per share, excluding certain items, were $7.50 when the consensus estimate was $7.96.The result: The stock fell about $46, or about 6 percent, in after-hours trading.Shares of Google were priced for perfection, and the first quarter was a little less than perfect. Whether that means anything substantive is more doubtful.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with this company,\u201d said Colin Gillis of BGC Partners. \u201cThey spent a bit more and took in a bit less than we thought, so Mr. Market is having a mood swing. But it was a fine quarter.\u201dThe Silicon Valley company, which reorganized itself into a holding company called Alphabet last year, gets nearly all of its revenue and all its profits from the core Google search and advertising business.Google is in the middle of a multiyear transition from desktop ads to the harder game of mobile ads. In the latest quarter, aggregate cost per click fell 9 percent from a year ago.Revenue from what the company calls \u201cOther Bets\u201d \u2014 including its fiber business and the Nest thermostat \u2014 was $166 million, more than double what it was in the first quarter of 2015.

For one thing, it can afford to. Its cash on hand is now $75 billion, up $10 billion in a year.\u201cWhat seemed like a moonshot a decade ago has grown into a booming community of engaged users, creators and brands, unlike any other video platform,\u201d said Sundar Pichai, the chief executive. He was referring to YouTube, of course. He noted that on mobile alone, YouTube now reaches more 18- to 34-year-olds in the United States than any broadcast or cable network.A question hanging over Google is its ventures in cloud computing. This is the growth market where Amazon is far ahead of everyone. Amazon Web Services is more exciting to investors than the retailer\u2019s core business. Microsoft, meanwhile, is mounting an aggressive challenge.\u201cThis is their third try to really become a cloud powerhouse,\u201d Mr. Rymer said. \u201cThey certainly seem more serious this time, but we\u2019ll have to see if they move beyond digital natives to airlines, utilities, trucking companies, governments \u2014 the enterprises where the real money is.\u201dAs for Europe, no mention was made of it by either Ms. Porat or Mr. Pichai, and not a single analyst asked about it.An earlier version of this article misstated the amount by which Alphabet missed analysts\u2019 forecasts for revenue.

{"Headline": "Bill Campbell, Coach of Silicon Valley Stars, Dies at 75", "Date": "2016-04-18", "News": "Supported byBill Campbell, one of the most influential background players in Silicon Valley, who was known as \u201ccoach\u201d there for his work advising technology industry stars like Steve Jobs at Apple and Larry Page at Google, died on Monday at his home in Palo Alto, Calif. He was 75.His family said the cause was cancer.Mr. Campbell had exerted a strong influence on Apple and Google, two of the world\u2019s most valuable companies, since the 1980s. Operating in a network of billionaire technology innovators, he was known for making informal but lasting personal connections that helped shape the industry.The term \u201ccoach\u201d was a reference to his days coaching the Columbia University football team from 1974 to 1979 \u2014 he had also played for Columbia \u2014 but it applied as well to his business career.As recently as the end of March, John Doerr, one of the valley\u2019s leading venture capitalists, publicly cited \u201cCoach Bill Campbell\u2019s\u201d advice when Mr. Doerr announced that he would give up his executive role at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and become its first chairman.Mr. Campbell was an Eastman Kodak executive in Europe when he was recruited to Silicon Valley in 1983 by Apple\u2019s chief executive at the time, John Sculley. Mr. Sculley named him vice president of marketing. Mr. Campbell later played a significant role in Apple\u2019s spectacular turnaround when Steve Jobs, who had been fired by Mr. Sculley, returned to the company in 1997. Apple went on to revamp its Mac computer line and introduce the iPod, iPhone and iPad.Mr. Campbell was an Apple director from 1997 until 2014.It was Mr. Doerr who brought Mr. Campbell to Google to serve as an informal adviser to the two founders, Mr. Page and Sergey Brin. Mr. Campbell was instrumental in the hiring of Eric Schmidt to be Google\u2019s chief executive in August 2001.Strikingly, Mr. Campbell\u2019s advisory role was often unpaid, at his insistence; he said he wanted to pay back what he felt was a debt to the nation\u2019s technology region.At Google, for example, he helped shape its leadership for a generation or more but, except for a single stock grant, never had a formal financial relationship with the company, according to Mr. Schmidt, who is now Google\u2019s chairman.\u201cGoogle would not be the company it is today without the influence of Bill Campbell,\u201d Mr. Schmidt said, \u201cand my guess is Apple wouldn\u2019t be, either.\u201dMr. Campbell also worked early on with Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, as well as Ben Horowitz and Marc Andreessen before they founded one of the country\u2019s top venture capital firms, Andreessen Horowitz.Mr. Campbell was deeply involved in Silicon Valley\u2019s start-up culture as well. In 1987 he led a group of Apple executives in setting up a software subsidiary, Claris, with the ultimate goal of spinning the company off as a start-up. When Apple decided not to let Claris become a separate public company, many of the executives, including Mr. Campbell, left.He later became chief executive of Go Corporation, a pioneering tablet computer company that fought a long and ultimately unsuccessful battle with Microsoft. From 1994 until 1998 he was chief executive of Intuit, a personal finance software company.William Vincent Campbell Jr. was born on Aug. 31, 1940, and grew up in Homestead, Pa., near Pittsburgh. He excelled in football in high school.Mr. Campbell ended his coaching career in 1979 with an overall record of 12-41-1. He then went to work for J. Walter Thompson, the advertising agency, before joining Kodak.In 2009, the National Football Foundation and College Hall of Fame announced that its annual award given to the top scholar-athlete would be renamed for Mr. Campbell.He was chairman of Columbia University\u2019s board of trustees from 2005 to 2014 and donated $10 million to help fund the Campbell Sports Center on the university\u2019s campus. As a philanthropist he also donated millions in support of education in the Pennsylvania steel country where he grew up.His survivors include his wife, Eileen Bocci Campbell; a daughter, Margaret; a son, Jim; and his stepchildren, Kevin, Matthew and Kate Bocci.Mr. Campbell was known for his informality. Randy Komisar, a partner at Kleiner Perkins who had been a young lawyer at Apple, recalled Mr. Campbell running down a hall one day and dragging him into a dark conference room to tell him he was starting the software company that would become Claris. Without saying anything about title or compensation, Mr. Campbell looked at him across the table and simply asked, \u201cAre you in, or are you out?\u201dAn obituary last Tuesday about Bill Campbell, an adviser to executives in the technology industry, misstated his history with the tablet computer company Go Corporation. While he was a former chief executive of the company, he did not help found it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "TV as New York Growth Industry: \u2018Quantico\u2019 Is Coming to Town", "Date": "2016-04-22", "News": "Supported byJust as he was hitting his stride as a television writer in 2002, Joshua Safran had to move to Los Angeles to work on a network show that was all about his hometown, New York City. Now, he is moving a different hit show with a New York theme to New York.Mr. Safran, the executive producer of \u201cQuantico\u201d on ABC, said the show\u2019s relocation for its second season was the latest evidence that Hollywood is no longer the irresistible magnet it had long been for the entertainment industry\u2019s talent. New York is playing an increasingly important role as a home base for television shows at a time when the demand for video content is soaring.\u201cThere\u2019s a resurgence here,\u201d Mr. Safran said from his office in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn. \u201cMore production brings more jobs, brings more money, brings more happiness.\u201dGov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced on Friday that \u201cQuantico,\u201d which had been written and produced in Brooklyn but shot on location in Montreal, will cross the border and bring more than 200 jobs with it. When it begins filming in New York in July, \u201cQuantico\u201d will be able to take full advantage of the tax credit that the state offers to film and TV productions.\u201cNew York State knows no creative bounds, and provides an unrivaled opportunity to work with the very best in the industry,\u201d he said.Mr. Safran said the credit of up to 30 percent of many of the costs incurred in production, including salaries paid to crew members, was not the deciding factor in the decision to relocate. The reason was largely creative. But he said the move would help to offset the higher cost of shooting in New York.Officials said 46 episodic shows were now being produced in the city, up from 29 just over a year ago. But they are not all on traditional networks. Shows in the Marvel Defenders series that can be viewed on Netflix are being produced in Brooklyn. The Netflix sitcom \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\u201d and Amazon\u2019s \u201cMozart in the Jungle\u201d series, which won a Golden Globe, are also filmed in the city.Julie Menin, commissioner of the Mayor\u2019s Office of Media and Entertainment, said the growth of TV production in the city had been \u201cexplosive\u201d and had created thousands of high-paying jobs that support small businesses.As an example, she cited Caf\u00e9 Grumpy, a coffeehouse across the street from the Broadway Stages studios in Greenpoint, which has added five locations. Ms. Menin, in her second month as commissioner, said she had been encouraging producers to shoot in more locations in boroughs other than Manhattan and to patronize local businesses when they do.\u201cYou can actually be a person who works in the film community in New York and not have to take a waiting job,\u201d said Tim Nolan, a partner at the consulting firm, who oversaw the study. \u201cThat\u2019s different today than it was 16 years ago.\u201dMr. Nolan said he had no doubt that the state tax credit paid for itself in jobs and spending. But some economic analysts would disagree.Donald J. Boyd, a senior fellow at the Rockefeller Institute of Government, co-wrote a report in 2013 that concluded the credit amounted to an overly generous subsidy to entertainment producers.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to justify distorting a tax system so that it favors one industry over another,\u201d Mr. Boyd said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re not getting when you do that.\u201dWhether or not the tax credit is good policy, there is no dispute about its popularity. Since Mr. Cuomo became governor, the state has received nearly 1,200 applications for credits for production and postproduction spending. (Postproduction includes the editing and scoring of a film or video after it is recorded.) The state projects that the applications will yield almost $2.8 billion in credits.The credit for postproduction costs had been just 10 percent, but in 2012, it was raised to match the production credit of 30 percent. For postproduction work done upstate, the credit is higher, at 35 percent.The credits are intended to apply only to local spending and wages. They exclude the salaries of many of the highest paid members of a production team, including actors, directors and writers.\u201cThe program\u2019s consistent growth has brought substantial benefits to local economies in both spending and employment,\u201d said Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat. \u201cGiven the impact it is having, I am proud to be part of the industry\u2019s resurgence in New York.\u201dDefending the wisdom of the credits, state and city officials point to the expansion of the city\u2019s studios. Steiner Studios has added to its presence in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Silvercup Studios said last summer that it would build a new studio in the Bronx, and Broadway Stages said it would add a location on Staten Island.\u201cWe want neighborhoods that have not seen a lot of production to benefit economically from this industry as well,\u201d Ms. Menin said.She added that Warner Brothers spent $45 million filming the movie \u201cThe Intern\u201d across 17 neighborhoods in Brooklyn and that she would encourage other production companies to follow a less-beaten path.Ms. Menin also noted the shift from the days when companies saved money by shooting films and shows in other cities even though they were set in New York. These days, she said, several shows, including \u201cThe Good Wife,\u201d \u201cMadam Secretary\u201d and \u201cThe Americans\u201d are being produced in New York even though they are set elsewhere.When it came to the second season of \u201cQuantico,\u201d Mr. Safran said, he did not want to take that tack. The first season depicted a group of fledgling agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation with sites in Montreal passing for Virginia.But the next set of episodes will focus much more on New York, and Mr. Safran, who grew up in Manhattan and attended film school at New York University, said, \u201cWe didn\u2019t need to fake New York.\u201dHe recalled that when he was hired as a writer and consulting producer on \u201cGossip Girl\u201d \u2014 a show about Manhattan society \u2014 he had to relocate to Los Angeles, where the producers were based. Now, he said, he would not leave New York again.He said the pilot for \u201cQuantico\u201d revolved around a terrorist attack at Grand Central Terminal. \u201cIn Season 1, we sort of destroyed New York locations,\u201d he said. \u201cSeason 2 is going to be very much more a New York story.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the name of a studio in Greenpoint. It is Broadway Stages, not Brooklyn Stages.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Selling Luxury in Iran", "Date": "2016-04-05", "News": "Supported byBypassed for decades by the luxury industry, Iran and its explosive market growth potential have recaptured the attention of global luxury heavyweights in the last 12 months.After more than 30 years of isolation and austerity, the country re-entered the global economy when economic sanctions were lifted in January, something Morgan Stanley described as the biggest thing for the global economy since the fall of the Berlin Wall.Now, with an educated, surging middle-income population of almost 80 million \u2014 many of whom possess a budding appetite for high-end consumer goods and mobile phones \u2014 Western brands are sizing up the opportunities, and risks, of setting up shop in Iran.\u201cIran as a prospect had interested us for some time, but once the sanctions went, we accelerated the process of setting up our boutique inside its borders,\u201d said Renato Semerari, chief executive of Roberto Cavalli, the first sizable luxury brand to enter the market with the opening in February of its two-story boutique in Tehran\u2019s upmarket neighborhood of Zafaraniye.Branded cosmetics, with their accessible price points, are often perceived as gateway products to luxury spending. So news that Sephora, the LVMH-owned cosmetics chain, was widely expected to open seven stores later this year hardly raised eyebrows.Yet expansion into Iran is not without its challenges. For a sector obsessed with controlling brand image, the country\u2019s lack of infrastructure, from trained staff to a shortage of quality real estate, remains the biggest obstacle. Only a handful of premium shopping malls exist, although there are plans to build more in the next two to three years.Tourism also is limited \u2014 vacation spending being a key sales contributor for most brands \u2014 and Iran\u2019s political relationships with the West, while thawing, still remain complex, to say the least. As a result, Claudia D\u2019Arpizio, a senior partner at Bain based in Milan, said the country was more suited to some labels than others.\u201cI think we will see some more mid-sized Italian players go in next, especially men\u2019s wear groups like Zegna or Brioni, as well as watch and jewelry brands, as a taste for the latter tends to develop very rapidly in emerging markets,\u201d she said. Historically, the larger clothing and accessories houses have been cautious about finding the right local distributors and partners, so it is likely they will take longer to establish a presence, she added.Despite the recent flush of enthusiasm, plenty of Western luxury-branded products have been making their way into the country for some time. When the banking sanctions over Iran\u2019s nuclear program were in place, investment coming and going from the country was essentially blocked, making it very difficult for foreign companies to get their profits out. But local third-party businesses always have imported goods into Iran by nonofficial channels, selling them at sky-high markups either in independent boutiques or in private sales behind closed doors.Now, with more Iranians online, learning about Western luxury brands and hungry for reasonably priced goods, entrepreneurs both at home and abroad are racing to fill the vacuum.Milad Monshipour and Hooman Damirchi are two Iranian entrepreneurs who have spent much of their professional lives working overseas before returning home to look at consumer- focused opportunities. Their luxury e-commerce site Madeleine Moda, which they say they hope to be Iran\u2019s version of Net-a-Porter, is expected to begin business soon.\u201cWhen we conducted market research among Iranian luxury goods consumers, we found that over 60 percent of our respondents said accessing the clothing and shoes they wanted continued to be very difficult due to supply limitations,\u201d said Mr. Monshipour, formerly a consultant at the Boston Consulting Group who holds an M.B.A. from HEC Paris. \u201cThey know what they want, they just struggle to get it.\u201cThe tech-savvy consumer here is just as hungry for immediate gratification as their Western counterparts,\u201d he noted.Almost all Iranians have debit cards, and online players like Digikala (an Amazon-style consumer goods website) and e-Sam (an Iranian equivalent of eBay) have made millions of Iranians comfortable with shopping online. So Mr. Damirchi is as bullish as his partner about their short-term, online-focused venture, as well as the longer-term growth potential of large Western brands to establish bricks-and-mortar presences.\u201cThis is a country where for thousands of years a sizable portion of the population has had a culture around and deep appreciation of design, art and fine things,\u201d he said. \u201cThe winners and losers today will be those who define the notion of luxury, and know how to really appeal to the 21st century consumer.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Should Therapists Write About Patients?", "Date": "2016-04-19", "News": "When it came time for the pre-publication legal review for my most recent book, I had an idea of what to expect, or so I thought. The book was highly critical of the American Psychiatric Association, a deep-pocketed, fiercely self-protective organization. I took particular aim at its most lucrative product, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. So I figured the review would rigorously investigate whether my account was fair and accurate enough to withstand any legal challenge.I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d told such stories before. My previous book was full of descriptions of therapeutic encounters, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d taken the industry-standard precautions. For detailed case studies, I obtained written consent. In cases where that was not possible (for instance, if the therapy had taken place long ago and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d lost touch with the patient), I changed all the identifying information; a woman became a man, a doctor became a truck driver and so on. And sometimes I would assemble composite characters, golem-like, out of many people I had seen \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a physical characteristic here, a verbal tic there \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in order to illustrate a clinical point with a brief anecdote.These techniques had easily passed muster with the lawyers for my previous book, so this attorney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s focus on the few, lightly sketched case studies in the new book caught me off guard. It also made me cranky. Who was she to doubt my commitment to protecting people with whom I had such intimate relationships, who had taken me into their confidence, whose foibles and troubles I had learned to accept and even to love? But doubt she did. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis one,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she would say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe strapping beauty with the wild hair \u00e2\u0080\u0094 does she really have broad shoulders and wild hair?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, like I told you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I would reply, \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe is a composite. The person in the book doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exist. But if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re asking me if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve really seen a broad-shouldered woman with wild hair, then I guess the answer is yes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd that one,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she would go on, \u201cthe psychotic woman with the hotel fixation \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is she really a woman, and was her fixation on hotels?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I would say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not Chinese-American and she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not close to 53 years old.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo why does she have to be a woman? Can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you make her a man?\u00e2\u0080\u009dNo reason, I supposed.\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd the other one, the college girl?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she would continue. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDid she really go to an Ivy League school? If so, can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you say she went to a state university?\u00e2\u0080\u009dAnd on and on. In the end, the wild-haired Amazon became a blond waif and the psychotic Asian-American became a man from California, and the college girl (who in real life had already graduated), aged 10 years and became a Chinese-American executive. I married her off to a playboy banker who, until the lawyer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s review, had been a divorced scientist with no connection to the student.I will admit to thinking that some of the adjustments I made were pretty clever, although I was a little troubled by how easy (and even fun) it was to turn the ethical imperative to disguise patients into poetic license. Not to mention how much more smoothly an argument could go if you were free to change the details to suit it.It took a couple rounds of edits before the lawyer was finally satisfied that my subjects were sufficiently disguised. I was in high dudgeon most of that time. If I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d wanted to write a novel, I protested, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have written one. And even when I tried to make up details, how could I escape the fact that most of what I know about people, most of my sense of what constitutes a plausible fiction, comes from my work as a therapist? It seemed as if she was asking for the impossible \u00e2\u0080\u0094 characters and situations plucked out of thin air \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in service of the unnecessary. Hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t I already rendered the patients unrecognizable in my original manuscript? I kept most of this to myself until the last day of the review, when I made an offhand, passive-aggressive comment to the lawyer about how ironic it would be if my new characters were mistaken for real people other than the originals. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou mean by readers?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked.\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWho else?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe question isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t whether someone else will recognize your patients,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s whether or not they would recognize themselves.\u00e2\u0080\u009dI was flabbergasted. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099d apparently been operating in parallel universes, each assuming that we knew and shared the other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goal. I had thought we were trying to protect the patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 privacy; she was worried about their well-being. She may have been doing her job, making sure that no one would sue us, but she was also doing mine, wondering what it would be like to encounter yourself, however deeply disguised, on the page of a book written by someone who has encouraged you to show yourself completely, on the promise of not being judged or exposed, and whom you trusted to keep your intimacies between you.That violation is almost as unfathomable as the fact that I missed it, that it took, of all people, a lawyer to point it out. Nor would it have been any less had I sought and obtained consent. After all, does a patient really have the option of denying a therapist? Can such a request be made without altering the course of therapy, and even perhaps the patient\u2019s life?My moment of self-reproach might have passed. I might have gone on to find some justification for continuing to write about patients. After all, hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the world benefited from the beautifully rendered case studies by such masters of the craft as Sigmund Freud and Irvin Yalom?But then I got busted. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to tell you the details, not the real ones or the fake ones or even the lawyer-approved doubly deceptive ones, except to say that one day, after the book was published, an irate patient came to an appointment with my book in hand, read a page out loud, and said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know this is me. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe you would do this.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Not a single detail in the passage identified this person. Anyone else reading the offending passage would conclude that the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s accusations were paranoid or narcissistic ravings. My lawyer would have been able to persuade any judge or jury of my innocence. I had plausible deniability. But the patient was right. Buried in the page, like a telltale heart, was that person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story. I knew it, the patient knew it, and we both knew in that moment that I had caused a wound beyond healing. I had used the patient for my own purposes. Our relationship was over.In his last novel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Confidence-Man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Herman Meville noted that novelists typically pluck their fictional characters from real life. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEvery great town,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis a kind of man-show, where the novelist goes for his stock as the agriculturist goes to the cattle show for his.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an unflattering comparison, and one that applies equally, if not more so, to therapists who use their patients as characters. At least novelists aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t typically betraying confidences.More From Fixes \u00bbMore From Private Lives \u00bbMore From Couch \u00bbMore From The Stone \u00bbMore From Moviegoers \u00bbMore From The End \u00bbMore From Draft \u00bbMore From Anxiety \u00bbMore From Menagerie \u00bbMore From Disunion \u00bbMore From Bedside \u00bbMore From The Conversation \u00bbMore From The Great Divide \u00bbMore From Errol Morris \u00bbFollowAdvertisement"}

It is a chatbot, a relatively simple piece of software that uses artificial intelligence to carry on a conversation.On Tuesday, Facebook underlined the rise of bots at its annual F8 developer conference in San Francisco. Facebook said it was opening up Messenger, its own messaging app, so that any outside company \u2014 from Applebee\u2019s to Zara \u2014 could create a bot capable of interacting with people through the chat program.With the move, Facebook is aiming to usher in a new era of customer service by bringing together the 900 million regular monthly users of Messenger with the more than 15 million businesses that have an official brand page on Facebook. Facebook is kicking off the project with partners like Spring, 1-800-Flowers, a weather and travel app called Poncho and news partners like CNN. Facebook is also testing advertising on chatbots as a potential source of revenue.\u201cWe\u2019re conversational creatures,\u201d David A.

More than 1.6 billion people are projected to become regular users of mobile messaging apps by the end of this year, equivalent to 22 percent of the global population, according to eMarketer, an industry research firm. That figure is expected to reach two billion people by 2018.The bot revival is also taking place at a time when people are growing tired of individual apps. While big brands have long promoted easier access to shopping and customer service through their own proprietary smartphone apps, some consumers are fatigued by having to download a different app for each company. More than a quarter of the time spent on mobile apps by Americans is now focused on just a handful of social networking and communication apps, according to Forrester, an industry research firm.As a result, brands in search of the best way to talk to consumers are now pairing off with some the world\u2019s dominant messaging platforms \u2014 and their chatbots.\u201cImagine if you had, say, 10 bot interactions a day, and if your entire daily commercial life was powered by a chat platform,\u201d said Ted Livingston, chief executive of Kik. \u201cHow that platform works \u2014 and who controls it \u2014 is going to be very important.\u201d Kik is heavily promoting its \u201cbot store\u201d to lure businesses to its platform.There are no guarantees the bot medium will take off. Facebook, Kik and Microsoft are up against other artificially intelligent assistants like Apple\u2019s Siri and Amazon\u2019s Echo, the hardware devices that are voice-controlled \u2014 no typing required. And making each transaction into a personal conversation may not be what people need when they just want to book a flight or order food.\u201cA lot of apps are already incredibly functional,\u201d said Robin Chan, chief executive of Operator. \u201cTake Uber, for example: You just push a button and it works. You don\u2019t need a drawn-out conversation for every single app.\u201dRegardless, the bot wave is coming, said John Lilly, a venture capitalist at Greylock Partners who has long been interested in bots and artificial intelligence. It may not come right now, with consumers needing to type in \u201ccommand line\u201d-style text to the chatbots, but he said the trend may gather momentum as bots increasingly blend technology and \u201chuman product design,\u201d whatever form that may take.Mr. Tisch of Spring, the mobile shopping start-up that just started offering a bot on Facebook Messenger, said working with the social media company to unveil the chatbot was a no-brainer. Facebook\u2019s huge scale, at more than 1.6 billion global users, makes it a good candidate for kickstarting a new form of commerce online, he said.And chatbots themselves are simply an extension of the kind of personal conversations that are already happening in retail, he said. Many high-end retailers offer personal shopping services, often through text messaging.Conversing with a chatbot to shop feels \u201cmagical,\u201d Mr. Tisch said, though \u201cin reality, much of commerce is happening through the conversations we\u2019re already having all the time.\u201dQuentin Hardy contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Tip.Didn\u2019t ask for that taxi door to be opened? No need.Of course, what to give varies.(And the minimum tip here is much higher than in other cities, Mr. Stallings said.)For dining, he suggests a minimum of 18 percent, but \u201cfor high-end places, it\u2019s 20 percent,\u201d he said.So many other daily exchanges, though, are often head scratchers.Elizabeth Charrow, 34, a barista at Joe Coffee in Greenwich Village, said she appreciates a dollar a drink.\u201cYou give a dollar to a bartender for opening a bottle,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m doing more than opening a beer.\u201dFor Luis Maisonet, 52, a doorman in the West Village, it\u2019s the thought that counts, he said.\u201cSometimes we get cookies, or a nice bottle of wine,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the average is $50 around the holidays. Anything else is gravy.\u201dAntonio Romero, 33, a deliveryman on the Upper West Side, said he was happy with $2 to $3 a trip.Mohammed Uddin, 48, a taxi driver from the Bronx, didn\u2019t say how much he\u2019d like, but he put it this way:Out-of-towners are good for 5 percent to 10 percent, he said.Locals are more generous, leaving around 10 percent to 20 percent.\u201cAnd we\u2019re always happy to pick up New Yorkers,\u201d he said.Here\u2019s what else is happening:Hair forecast: frizz.Here\u2019s to hoping that April showers really do bring May flowers.Times Square can be a jungle sometimes.Now it sounds like it, too.You\u2019re hearing a swamp in the Mamori rain forest at night.Soothing, right?Maybe.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Poet Idolized by a New Generation of Feminists", "Date": "2016-04-15", "News": "Supported byFor decades, it seemed as though Eileen Myles and her unflinching depictions of New York misfits and creatives would forever be relegated to the margins of the American canon. And then last year happened.ON A RECENT SUNDAY afternoon, \u00adEileen Myles came to meet me in the East Village on a white bicycle with brown leather handlebars. We chose as our destination Saint Mark\u2019s Church-in-the-Bowery, a historic portal of downtown Manhattan a few blocks from the rent-stabilized apartment where she has lived for nearly 40 years. Since 1966, the church has housed the Poetry Project, which began as a government-\u00adfunded attempt to address the teenage hippie runaway problem by offering free creative writing workshops, and which Myles discovered when she made her way to New York from Boston in 1974, then in her mid-20s, and not yet out as a lesbian. There, she found the poets drinking and smoking cigarettes around long tables in the church\u2019s back rooms, at seminars run by Alice Notley and Ted Berrigan. Allen Ginsberg came to readings, the group\u2019s leaders were heroes and the East Village felt, to Myles, like the center of anti-institutional American poetry.\u201cThe romance was that you had to be poor, you had to live in this neighborhood, you had to hang out and read all the books that everybody was reading, stay up all night, have an amazing life and write poetry,\u201d said Myles, who had just returned from a visit to her second home in Marfa, Tex., with a tan. Her look is L.L. Bean meets the South Shore, a grandfatherly assortment of cotton button-down shirts, wool sweaters, a canvas coat and transition lenses in blond tortoiseshell frames, complemented by a Massachusetts accent that\u2019s most pronounced when she\u2019s reading poems or cracking wise.For many readers discovering Myles\u2019s work for the first time, the experience was accompanied by a sense of confusion: Why hadn\u2019t we read her sooner? Sitting under the stained-glass window at Saint Mark\u2019s, Myles suggested that perhaps the distance of time has made her writing more palatable to the public. \u201cTo be too queer,\u201d she said, \u201cto be talking too graphically, closer to the present, is more frightening.\u201d7 PhotosIn \u201cChelsea Girls,\u201d Myles describes a world of penny loafers and cut-off jean shorts, the World\u2019s Fair, highway \u201ccomfort stations,\u201d Filene\u2019s Basement, teenagers hanging out in the parking lot of Butterick\u2019s ice cream, \u201cteevee\u201d \u2014 all familiar baby boomer territory, but without nostalgia, and with a frankness about sexuality that opens a direct channel of connection from then to now. The novel also captures what it was like to be Eileen Myles in Manhattan in the \u201970s and \u201980s, when people planned their book parties according to the astrological calendar and went out afterward to a \u201cglitter ball tall hyacinths-in-a-vase Italian Lesbian disco environment.\u201d Her narrator gets her amphetamines from a corrupt diet doctor in Flushing, Queens, and redistributes them at the Strand. She subsists on garlic knots, hot dogs, Campbell\u2019s tomato soup, Budweiser and cigarettes. She has lovers of different temperaments and physical forms. One of them convenes an \u201celite junkie salon.\u201d Another throws herself into the East River. Of a stint working a factory job in Maine: \u201cThe men were all men, and we were all lesbians, and everyone loved to get smashed.\u201dDespite having written the book 20 years ago, Myles\u2019s literary style feels as contemporary as the essayistic autobiographical fiction of Sheila Heti, Ben Lerner and Tao Lin, who might be considered her literary offspring. Her work functions as a bridge between many of the discussions of the present \u2014 about sexual violence, class, \u201chook-up culture\u201d \u2014 and a past from which those narratives were often secret or hidden. And even though her writing is now being transmitted on that most mainstream of venues, the \u201cteevee,\u201d it seems to resist assimilation, in part by maintaining its sense of defiance. \u201cI keep getting called a punk poet in the press, because they can\u2019t say dyke,\u201d she said dryly.Myles has been many things, but punk is not one of them. In her early years in New York she worked as a librarian on Wall Street. She sold subway slugs. She was employed by the Department of Corrections, where she would type up Dodgems, the poetry magazine she was publishing, which, at the time, was as common as starting a band. For half a year she was an assistant to the poet James Schuyler who, said Myles, had \u201ca career as a mental patient,\u201d supported by art-world friends who admired his writing. He lived at the Chelsea Hotel, and every morning Myles would bring him his newspapers and keep him company for the day. Schuyler was one of \u00adMyles\u2019s literary influences, of which there were many: Lucille Clifton, Susie Timmons, John Wieners and, of course, Ginsberg, \u201ca poet who actually got heard.\u201dAfter sitting in Saint Mark\u2019s for a while, we decided to get lunch at the all-night Ukrainian diner Veselka, the site of many late evenings for Myles and her friends. She scanned the room as if to surface the memories. \u201cIn the \u201970s it was cool to be a poet,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the \u201980s it was a joke.\u201d And yet, in 1993, when she finished her novel after working on it for 14 years, it proved as resistant to the market as anything else she\u2019d done. Finally getting it published by Black Sparrow Press \u2014 \u201cthey were indie but they were top of the indie,\u201d she said \u2014 was a breakthrough. The head of the company, John Martin, saw in Myles a kind of female Bukowski, also a house author, although her own idea of \u201cChelsea Girls\u201d was that it would be \u201c\u2009\u2018On the Road\u2019 for girls,\u201d she said. Its release was followed by a series of unlucky coincidences: Bukowski died the same year it came out and the promotional energy turned to his legacy; someone bought the rights to translate the book into French, but the translator died before its completion; and although the movie rights to one of its essays, \u201c1969,\u201d were optioned, the film was never made. But maybe the book\u2019s obscurity wasn\u2019t just bad luck: Maybe the culture just wasn\u2019t ready for it.Myles has a theory about her resurgent popularity \u2014 you might call it the Theory of the Bad Copy, which posits that most people who are breaking with the past do so by presenting initially as bad copies of an accepted person. Which is to say that Myles got published by Black Sparrow as a bad copy of Charles Bukowski. And that Leslie Mackinaw, on \u201cTransparent,\u201d is a bad copy of Myles. And that Hillary Clinton \u2014 who Myles recently endorsed \u2014 is a bad copy of the male presidential figure, but one who Myles insists will be different because of her gender. People get published or elected or onto television shows because they\u2019re bad copies painted in broad strokes \u2014 that\u2019s how difference slips by, and then the bad copies break with the past and make something new. This seems to have been Myles\u2019s plan all along. \u201cIf a fool will persist in their folly, he will be wise, right?\u201d she said, smiling, because she knew she already was.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the East Village apartment where the writer Eileen Myles lives. She lives in a rent-stabilized apartment, not a rent-subsidized apartment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Media Websites Battle Faltering Ad Revenue and Traffic", "Date": "2016-04-17", "News": "Supported byThis month, Mashable, a site that had just raised $15 million, laid off 30 people. Salon, a web publishing pioneer, announced a new round of budget cuts and layoffs. And BuzzFeed, which has been held up as a success story, was forced to bat back questions about its revenue \u2014 but not before founders at other start-up media companies received calls from anxious investors.The trouble, the publishers say, is twofold. The web advertising business, always unpredictable, became more treacherous. And website traffic plateaued at many large sites, in some cases falling \u2014 a new and troubling experience after a decade of exuberant growth.Online publishers have faced numerous financial challenges in recent years, including automated advertising and ad-blocking tools. But now, there is a realization that something more profound has happened: The transition from an Internet of websites to an Internet of mobile apps and social platforms, and Facebook in particular, is no longer coming \u2014 it is here.It is a systemic change that is leaving many publishers unsure of how they will make money.\u201cWith each turn of the screw, people began to realize, viscerally, that this is what it feels like to not be in control of your destiny,\u201d said Scott Rosenberg, a co-founder of Salon who left the company in 2007.Audiences drove the change, preferring to refresh their social feeds and apps instead of visiting website home pages. As social networks grew, visits to websites in some ways became unnecessary detours, leading to the weakened traffic numbers for news sites. Sales staffs at media companies struggled to explain to clients why they should buy ads for a fragmented audience rather than go to robust social networks instead.Advertisers adjusted spending accordingly. In the first quarter of 2016, 85 cents of every new dollar spent in online advertising will go to Google or Facebook, said Brian Nowak, a Morgan Stanley analyst.The power shift was made clear last week as the Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg took the stage for the company\u2019s annual developer conference. He stood in front of a diagram outlining an audacious 10-year expansion plan, which included several features to help keep people inside Facebook\u2019s world instead of following links out.\u201cMessenger is going to be the next big platform for sharing privately, and for helping you connect with services in all kinds of new ways,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said, after demonstrating a CNN chat bot on stage.At the same time, publishers pored over a report from the analytics firm Parse.ly, detailing how important Facebook had become to their business: Among sites tracked by the firm, more than 40 percent of web traffic came from the social network.Facebook\u2019s users seem to be following Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s lead. NewsWhip, which tracks how publishers are performing across major Internet platforms, says the rate at which links to outside websites are shared on Facebook, compared with videos and Instant Articles, has declined.Liam Corcoran, NewsWhip\u2019s communications director, says that in recent months a wide range of publishers have called him to ask whether sudden drops in Facebook reach are widespread, and asking how they might be remedied \u2014 as if they were asking how to cure a disease.\u201cIt\u2019s a doctor\u2019s office,\u201d he said.So far, publishers are responding in a variety of ways. With the help of venture capital funding, companies like BuzzFeed and Vox are investing heavily in video production with a focus on TV and film. Others, like Mashable, are diverting resources to increasing their audience on Facebook, hoping that enough money \u2014 through revenue-sharing arrangements with the company \u2014 will follow.\u201cWe invest in a number of strategies, then figure out which strategies are most effective,\u201d Pete Cashmore, Mashable\u2019s founder, said in an interview.Others are planning to do less with less. \u201cWe talk about our business as though we\u2019re in a shrinking market, and plan accordingly,\u201d said Alex Magnin, chief revenue officer at Thought Catalog, an essay site.Online news sites have watched the rise of social platforms closely. Publishers have started in recent years to obsessively monitor the ways in which their readers arrived at their sites. The sheer speed with which Facebook, Twitter, Google and Snapchat have come to dominate the landscape has taken publishers by surprise.In 2014, Gawker Media\u2019s founder, Nick Denton, wrote a memo to his staff that admonished them for giving in too fully to the influence of platforms, which drove many of his company\u2019s most popular stories. \u201cWe \u2014 the freest journalists on the planet \u2014 were slaves to the Facebook algorithm,\u201d he wrote.Looking back at 2015, however, Mr. Denton, once known for harsh assessments of the media business, struck a conciliatory tone.\u201cThe Instant Articles deal seems great,\u201d he said in an interview last week. \u201cUsers get relevant stories and relevant ads. It\u2019s the realization of that particular Internet dream.\u201dMr. Denton said he was hopeful, like many publishers, that deep \u201cniche\u201d brands have something to offer advertisers. E-commerce partnerships, in which publishers are paid commissions by retailers for products recommended, or mentioned, on their sites, now cover the company\u2019s editorial spending. The arrangement largely sidesteps social networks, but relies on agreements with another huge partner: Amazon.Other companies are looking to focus more on branded content like videos, sponsored stories and full-fledged campaigns. But publishers have quickly learned that those efforts are labor-intensive and put them in direct competition with advertising agencies.Mr. Malik of Gigaom, whose site employed 85 people at its peak, said if he were to start the business today, it would probably be a Facebook page. There is an opportunity, clearly, to reach people there.Money? That\u2019s another matter.\u201cHow do I monetize?\u201d he asked. \u201cStill not clear.\u201dJim Rutenberg contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

For almost two years, European Union citizens have been able to apply to have links to certain web search results taken down. As over 90 percent of Europe\u2019s search market belongs to Google, this is primarily a law about what Google can track and link the public to.So who is deciding the merits of applications to be \u201cforgotten\u201d? More than anyone else, Google. How do they decide whether the application is warranted? Google won\u2019t say.European Union officials appear to think Google is acting fairly, but that doesn\u2019t answer the question of why Google should be policing itself. The answer to that appears to be that no one else has the money and know-how to effectively do the job.As the Internet gets to be a bigger part of everyone\u2019s lives, it may increasingly be that only the biggest Internet companies can do Internet-scale tasks. Google already appears to have the world\u2019s largest commercial network of computers.To some extent, it\u2019s the same for Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook. It would be interesting to see whether Alibaba and Baidu have more computational and data power than the Chinese government.Much the way it curates much of what happens on the Internet, Google has spent years scanning books to create its searchable corpus. For better or worse, few people would want those things destroyed, or made inaccessible.

{"Headline": "With a Stand-Alone App, Starz Looks Beyond the Cable Bundle", "Date": "2016-04-04", "News": "Supported byAnd then there was Starz.The hot and crowded market of subscription streaming services will get yet another entrant on Tuesday when Starz, the premium TV network, plans to introduce a stand-alone app available on Apple and Google devices.Aimed at the 20 million homes that pay for broadband but not the full cable TV bundle, the new service, which costs $9 a month, will offer Starz original series like \u201cOutlander\u201d and \u201cPower,\u201d as well as thousands of TV episodes and movies, including Disney\u2019s blockbuster \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens\u201d later this year.The development puts a renewed spotlight on Starz, which has surpassed its rival Showtime to become the second-largest premium TV network in the country behind HBO. Now it is seeking to expand its footprint even more by making the network available outside the traditional pay TV model, as HBO has with HBO Now, and other media companies have with similar services.At the same time, Starz has been the subject of on-again-off-again merger and acquisition chatter since 2013, when it spun off from the billionaire John C. Malone\u2019s Liberty Media. Mr. Malone, known for his deal making, has spoken publicly about what he sees as the need for consolidation of what he calls \u201cfree radicals\u201d in the media industry.Creating a stand-alone streaming service has been a long time in the making for Chris Albrecht, who took over as chief executive of Starz in January 2010.Previously, Mr. Albrecht was the chief executive of HBO, where he helped assemble a slate of signature series like \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d \u201cThe Wire\u201d and \u201cSex and the City.\u201d During that time, he said, he started exploring the idea of creating a \u201clighter\u201d service that HBO could sell directly to consumers, outside traditional cable or satellite packages.\u201cI like to think it was because I was really smart,\u201d he said, but he instead credited people he hired \u201cwho knew about the space and thought about the way people are going to consume content.\u201dThey said, \u201cThis is something that we should be doing and we should be first,\u201d he recalled.\u201cOther companies that are out there might not now exist if we had done that then,\u201d he added, hinting at the rise of Netflix and of Amazon\u2019s streaming service.Starz had only just started experimenting with original programming, with projects like \u201cParty Down\u201d and \u201cSpartacus.\u201d The flagship network at the time counted about 17 million subscribers and had struck a programming deal with Netflix that Mr. Albrecht described as an \u201calbatross around our neck.\u201d That deal \u201cdid a great job in helping launch Netflix,\u201d he said.The company has changed significantly since then. In 2013, Starz was spun off from Liberty into an independent, publicly traded company. It has also raised its profile with critically acclaimed programs like \u201cOutlander,\u201d based on the best-selling novel about a World War II-era British Army nurse, and \u201cPower,\u201d produced by the rapper Curtis Jackson, better known as 50 Cent, about a New York nightclub owner and drug kingpin.Starz now has about 23.6 million subscribers, according to SNL Kagan, slightly ahead of Showtime\u2019s 23.4 million. HBO, the leading premium channel, has 32.5 million subscribers. Those figures do not include subscribers to their streaming services.Amy Yong, a media analyst with Macquarie, said subscriber numbers were growing for Starz largely because cable and satellite companies get big incentives to sell its subscriptions.Starz is estimated to capture about $4 a subscriber, with the rest of the subscription fee going to cable and satellite companies.\u201cThey are happy to be partners with cable companies,\u201d Ms. Yong said, at a time when many media companies find themselves in heated disputes with cable operators over rights fees.Total revenues for the company increased 2 percent in 2015 to $1.7 billion, with net income down 12 percent to $237 million, primarily because of increased programming and marketing costs. Analysts expect the expiration of a programming deal with Disney to deliver cost savings in the future.Despite the strides Starz has made, it still suffers a perception problem compared with HBO and Showtime, whose shows \u2014 like \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and \u201cHomeland\u201d \u2014 can become part of the cultural conversation. \u201cEveryone knows and recognizes HBO, and consumers can rattle off the last couple of shows on that network,\u201d Ms. Yong said. \u201cStarz still hasn\u2019t found that voice with the consumer. They don\u2019t have any recognizable hits, but they are getting there.\u201d\u201cIt is like they tied one of their legs to ours, tied an anchor around the other leg and threw the anchor off the boat,\u201d Mr. Albrecht said.\u201cIt was certainly distressing to see that and not a lot of fun since then,\u201d he added. \u201cWe can show the ways that we can continue to evolve through the lines of business that we have, as well as creating new ones. We\u2019re going to show a company that is worth investing in.\u201dOne major focus is the new app, which offers downloads of most content and allows four people to stream simultaneously. People who already subscribe to Starz through a traditional pay TV provider also will be able to use the app, which initially will be available on Apple and Google devices, with other future partners expected.In a statement, an Apple spokeswoman said, \u201cAs we\u2019ve said, the future of TV is apps, and STARZ is another incredible example of iOS and Apple TV customers being able to watch the shows they love on their favorite devices.\u201dStarz original series attract viewers who are more racially diverse and have lower average incomes than audiences of other premium TV networks, according to Nielsen data provided by the network. Mr. Albrecht said that the new app was meant for viewers who are likely to be interested in the network\u2019s original programming but are priced out of higher-cost premium TV networks.Typically, cable and satellite providers sell premium networks like HBO, Showtime and Starz on top of subscriptions to standard cable bundles.\u201cThere is an opportunity to differentiate ourselves to a group of consumers that would likely be customers of Starz if they could access it,\u201d Mr. Albrecht said. \u201cPremiums are stuck on top as a cherry last to be added, first to come off.\u201dIndeed, Starz will have much differentiating to do. The debut of the network\u2019s app comes nearly a year after HBO introduced its $15-a-month HBO Now streaming service to much fanfare. Soon after, Showtime unveiled a similar service for $11 a month. All the while, digital competitors like Netflix, Amazon and Hulu have greatly expanded their offerings.Advertisement"}

The 200-bed shelter is taking shape in a former Travelodge that Amazon bought in 2014, a structure that many of the company\u2019s employees walk by every day on their way to or from work. The first handful of families who will sleep there started arriving Monday.The solution is temporary. The building will be demolished next year to make way for several more company office buildings. But advocates for the homeless, and Seattle\u2019s mayor, Ed Murray, said the real significance of the project, which will be managed by Mary\u2019s Place, could not be measured in beds or in the number of months that the shelter will be open.Rather, it is measured in the new relationships that Amazon appears to be forging with the city it calls home.\u201cNew companies struggle to figure out how they can be corporate good neighbors,\u201d Mr. Murray said in an interview. \u201cThe fact that Amazon has chosen to participate in what is, among West Coast cities, the most difficult and the most controversial issue we face, sends to me a positive signal about what kind of corporate neighbor they could grow into.\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s a very interesting place for them to take a risk,\u201d he added.Amazon\u2019s director of global real estate and facilities, John Schoettler, said the path to turning the old hotel into a shelter was \u201crather serendipitous.\u201d The hotel closed years ago, he said, and the building was being used as college dormitory space when Amazon bought it. But when the mayor declared a state of emergency last fall, Mr. Schoettler said, bells went off.\u201cWe were thinking about different things that we could do with it, and we didn\u2019t want it to just sit idle,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we reached out to the mayor\u2019s office.\u201dThe area around the shelter is a building maelstrom, with five major commercial office projects and 10 residential developments with 4,657 housing units in planning or construction within a quarter-mile of the property, according to figures from the city.But low-budget hotels still stake out part of the area, too, as do automotive shops. The Elephant Super Car Wash, with its revolving pink sign dating from an earlier era, is only a few blocks away.Support for Amazon\u2019s new role has been enthusiastic, especially in the realm of homeless advocacy.Mary\u2019s Place will also get $400,000 from the city, from a fund opened up by the mayor\u2019s emergency declaration, to help with operating expenses. Ms. Hartman said the new shelter doubled in one day how many people her group can help.So far, customers have donated items that include 37 room lamps, 49 twin mattresses, 145 boxes of diapers, 26 shower curtains and 1,080 hand and bath towels.Isela Espinoza, 35, a medical assistant and one of the first shelter residents, said the relief it had already begun providing was immediate: She could actually sleep.\u201cI was sleeping in my car before that,\u201d she said. And with her two children there with her, ages 12 and 15, she was ever on alert. \u201cI never felt I could fall asleep because I felt like I needed to protect my children,\u201d she said.\u201cIt changed my way of thinking about the company,\u201d she said about Amazon. \u201cYou hardly hear of big companies, making millions and billions of dollars, looking down to see who needs help.\u201dSome economists and politicians said tech companies hadbeen unfairly blamed for negative social and housing effects on cities. Mr. Murray, for one, said the breakdown of government funding for housing and mental health treatment was driving much of the problem here, as well as in rural and suburban areas.A housing expert at the Urban Land Institute, a research group based in Washington, D.C., said growth is always disruptive, and right now, tech is simply the visible engine of that growth in many places.\u201cWithout question, any American city that has seen recent, significant economic growth is grappling with a housing affordability problem,\u201d said the expert, Stockton Williams, who studies demographics and housing trends for the research group. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a city that is fully meeting the housing needs of all its citizens.\u201dMr. Schoettler said he hoped Amazon\u2019s commitment would extend beyond the one-year life of the shelter. He said that another property nearby could be available next spring, but that it was too soon for promises.\u201cI can see this going on for several years, but again that\u2019s all dependent on our need for space,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon May Violate India\u2019s New Rules on Foreign E-Commerce", "Date": "2016-04-07", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 For Amazon, no country is more important to its global growth ambitions than India, the second-most-populous nation in the world behind China, where online shopping is in its infancy and growing explosively.But Amazon\u2019s India plans just ran into a hitch.Late last month, the Indian government issued additional rules governing foreign ownership of e-commerce companies operating in the country. The government added regulations related to pricing and the sourcing of sales on sites that Amazon and several rivals appear to violate. What is more, the new policy was effective immediately, giving Amazon and others no time to comply.A trade group representing the Internet companies is considering sending a letter asking the Indian government for clarification or to delay enforcement of the rules until September.Analysts and Internet executives in India say they do not expect an immediate government crackdown on Amazon and others, and it is not yet clear what the consequences would be for breaking the new rules.But the regulations were at least helpful to Amazon and its rivals because India finally clarified its murky policies regarding foreign-owned e-commerce companies.Uncertainty is part of the tumult of doing business in India, which has had a flood of foreign investment in its Internet commerce sector and a corresponding wave of opposition from politically powerful domestic retailers. Online spending in India is expected to jump to nearly $75 billion by 2020 from a mere $12.1 billion last year, as more of the country\u2019s 1.25 billion people get on the Internet, according to Forrester.The stunning growth projections have led executives at Amazon, the e-commerce giant, to predict that India could be its second-largest market after the United States within a decade. In 2014, the company\u2019s chief executive, Jeffrey P. Bezos, stood atop a bus in Bangalore wearing a jodhpuri-style Indian coat and holding a giant check for $2 billion, representing the amount Amazon pledged to plow into its business in the country.\u201cWith a growing middle class and propensity to shop online, the revenue potential there is enormous,\u201d said Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Company.As in the United States, in India brick-and-mortar retailers have expressed alarm at the growth of e-commerce, and they have sued the Indian government to compel it to place more restrictions on the industry.For Amazon there is a special urgency to get India right after fumbling attempts to crack the e-commerce business in China, another huge emerging market dominated by domestic players.From the day it started in India in 2013, Amazon had to make big changes to comply with its restrictive rules governing retailing.India essentially bars companies with substantial foreign ownership from operating retail outlets that sell from their own inventories of goods. Although American multinationals like Amazon, Walmart and Apple have sought to overturn or soften those restrictions, the government has made few changes.To work around the restrictions, Amazon and competitors billed themselves as e-commerce marketplaces, eBay-like websites that matched buyers with independent sellers. Amazon owns no inventory of its own in India, though it handles the warehousing and delivery of goods for many of its independent sellers, a model it also employs in the United States.The new regulations appear to make Amazon\u2019s dependence on one large seller on its site, Cloudtail, illegal, according to industry officials and analysts. While Amazon says it has more than 80,000 sellers on its India site, Cloudtail is estimated to account for 40 percent to 50 percent of the site\u2019s sales, according to Mr. Meena of Forrester.The parent company of Cloudtail is a partnership between Catamaran Ventures, the investment firm of the Indian business magnate, N.R. Narayana Murthy, and Amazon, which owns 49 percent. India\u2019s leading e-commerce company, Flipkart, also works closely with an affiliated large seller and faces a similar problem.The agency that issued the new rules, the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion, declined to comment on whether any violations had occurred. Ishtiyaque Ahmed, a director of foreign collaboration at the agency, said he was not familiar with the details of the two companies\u2019 business arrangements \u201cso I cannot discuss a hypothetical situation.\u201dFlipkart declined to comment.One obvious course of action for Amazon is to form more joint ventures with Indian companies to reduce its reliance on any single seller like Cloudtail. Arjun Narayan, managing director of Catamaran Ventures, Amazon\u2019s partner in Cloudtail, said in an email that he did not expect any \u201cabrupt business changes\u201d for Cloudtail.Snapdeal, one of the largest e-commerce companies, which has no large sellers, welcomed the regulations.Nick Wingfield reported from Seattle and Vindu Goel from San Francisco.

She was 35, had been with the company for four years, and was told without explanation by her 28-year-old manager that she had two weeks to get out. On her last day, that manager organized a farewell party for her.It was surreal, and cruel, but everyone at HubSpot acted as if this were perfectly normal. We were told we were \u201crock stars\u201d who were \u201cinspiring people\u201d and \u201cchanging the world,\u201d but in truth we were disposable.Some viewed the statement as a sign that Mr. Bezos at least seems to recognize that it\u2019s not normal for employees to cry at their desks. But it was also a defiant message that he had no intention of letting up.I am old enough to remember the 1980s and early \u201990s, when technology executives were obsessed with retaining talent. \u201cOur most important asset walks out the door every night,\u201d was the clich\u00e9 of the day. No longer.Treating workers as if they are widgets to be used up and discarded is a central part of the revised relationship between employers and employees that techies proclaim is an innovation as important as chips and software. The model originated in Silicon Valley, but it\u2019s spreading. Old-guard companies are hiring \u201cgrowth hackers\u201d and building \u201cincubators,\u201d too. They see Silicon Valley as a model of enlightenment and forward thinking, even though this \u201cnew\u201d way of working is actually the oldest game in the world: the exploitation of labor by capital.HubSpot was founded in 2006 in Cambridge, Mass., and went public in 2014. It\u2019s one of those slick, fast-growing start-ups that are so much in the news these days, with the beanbag chairs and unlimited vacation \u2014 a corporate utopia where there is no need for work-life balance because work is life and life is work. Imagine a frat house mixed with a kindergarten mixed with Scientology, and you have an idea of what it\u2019s like.I joined the company in 2013 after spending 25 years in journalism and getting laid off from a top position at Newsweek. I thought working at a start-up would be great. The perks! The cool offices!It turned out I\u2019d joined a digital sweatshop, where people were packed into huge rooms, side by side, at long tables. Instead of hunching over sewing machines, they stared into laptops or barked into headsets, selling software.Tech workers have no job security. You\u2019re serving a \u201ctour of duty\u201d that might last a year or two, according to the founder of LinkedIn, Reid Hoffman, who is the co-author of a book espousing his ideas, \u201cThe Alliance: Managing Talent in the Networked Age.\u201d Companies burn you out and churn you out when someone better, or cheaper, becomes available. \u201cYour company is not your family,\u201d is another line from Mr. Hoffman\u2019s book.His ideas trace back to a \u201cculture code\u201d that Netflix published in 2009, declaring, \u201cWe\u2019re a team, not a family.\u201d Netflix views itself as a sports team, always looking to have \u201cstars in every position.\u201d In this new model of work, employees are expected to feel complete devotion and loyalty to their companies, even while the boss feels no such obligation in return.UNFORTUNATELY, working at a start-up all too often involves getting bossed around by undertrained (or untrained) managers and fired on a whim. Bias based on age, race and gender is rampant, as is sexual harassment. The free snacks are nice, but you also must tolerate having your head stuffed with silly jargon and ideology about being on a mission to change the world. Companies sell shares to the public while still losing money. Wealth is generated, but most of the loot goes to a handful of people at the top, the founders and venture capital investors.The Netflix code has been emulated by countless other companies, including HubSpot, which employed a metric called VORP, or value over replacement player. This brutal idea comes from the world of baseball, where it is used to set prices on players. At HubSpot we got a VORP score in our annual reviews. It was supposed to feel scientific, part of being a \u201cdata-driven organization,\u201d as management called it.Grinding out phone calls, trying to make a number, hooked to a machine that watches you work \u2014 this is progress? The people who worked in the furniture factory probably didn\u2019t have easy lives, either. They certainly didn\u2019t have a beer garden, as workers at HubSpot do. On the other hand, they didn\u2019t go through weeks of training that felt eerily like a cult indoctrination, being told that they could use their \u201csuperpowers\u201d to \u201cchange people\u2019s lives\u201d by spreading \u201cdelightion\u201d to their customers.Given the choice, I think I\u2019d rather make furniture.An Opinion article last Sunday about working in technology misstated the findings of a 2013 study by Payscale.
