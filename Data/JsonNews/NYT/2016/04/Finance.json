Over the weekend, at a block party in Brooklyn, Mrs. Clinton called out \u201cthe greed and recklessness of Wall Street,\u201d and declared, \u201cI take a back seat to no one in taking them on.\u201d Senator Ted Cruz, the Republican candidate who used a hefty loan from his wife\u2019s former employer, Goldman Sachs, to finance his 2012 Senate race, has labeled the institution a hotbed of \u201ccrony capitalism.\u201d And so on.You would think it would be enough to have them \u2014 whomever this mythic \u201cthem\u201d may be \u2014 don sackcloth and ashes and sneak around in the shadows so no one could identify them by the uniform of their profession. Which, if you accept the premise that we use our wardrobe to signal our allegiance to a group (personal, political or professional), raises the question: What does it mean to look like a banker in the age of Bernie?After all, the last time the financial world was so loudly derided \u2014 during the recession of 2008 and 2009 \u2014 there was a knock-on effect in the men\u2019s wear world, and certain obvious totems of Wall Street style (the broad, structured shoulders; the patterned ties; the Ferragamo shoes) fell out of favor. According to a banker at Goldman Sachs, the idea was to play down any signifiers of employment, lest they invite negative repercussions.This was around the same time the luxury shopping site Net-a-Porter started offering deliveries in brown paper bags so those still able to indulge their consumer urges could not be identified. There was a sense that it was unseemly (and sometimes, in the Occupy Wall Street days, maybe dangerous) to represent the 1 percent.Yet this time around, no such camouflage has seemed necessary.That may be, however, less a gesture of defiance, or the result of the fact that Mr. Sanders and Mr. Cruz had pretty poor primary showings in New York (they are still preaching their bad-banker gospel, after all, and their competitors are being notably circumspect about their ties to the financial sector), than a reflection of a certain reality: The stereotype of the \u201cbanker\u201d that is currently being kicked around no longer exists \u2014 or doesn\u2019t exist in any overarching sense. It may make an easy target, but it\u2019s a straw man.The image was created in 1987 by the perfect storm of Tom Wolfe\u2019s novel \u201cBonfire of the Vanities\u201d and Oliver Stone\u2019s film \u201cWall Street,\u201d and proved astonishingly durable. And though it has been perpetrated to a certain extent in popular culture, it bears less and less resemblance to actual fact.Indeed, in conversations with several financial professionals, the consistent reaction was \u201cno one dresses that way anymore.\u201d Rather, the adjectives most used to describe their clothing were \u201crumpled\u201d and \u201cunderstated.\u201dThe stereotype style has been eroded by the global financial crisis, sure, but also casual Fridays; the rise of the entrepreneurial class, especially in technology; and the growth of a shadow banking sector \u2014 the venture capitalists and hedge funds and private equity firms that have their own, less identifiable uniform, much of which can be characterized by what it is not: the banker clothing of yore.\u201cHe is aggressively not a suit guy,\u201d said Eric Daman, the show\u2019s costume designer, who is now prepping for the second season. The hoodies may be cashmere, the jeans Rag & Bone, the sneakers limited edition, but to the untutored eye, the character may look like nothing so much as a rogue Facebook employee (and he would not look out of place at a Sanders rally).Which is not an accident. As the tech world has risen in the \u201cglobal pecking order,\u201d in the words of John Studzinski, a partner at the asset management firm Blackstone, its determinedly dress-down uniform has infiltrated the world of those who would finance it. The theory being, at least for some, if you can\u2019t beat \u2019em, dress like \u2019em.For others, \u201cit\u2019s less \u2018show me the money\u2019 than subtle,\u201d Mr. Studzinski said. \u201cPeople are going out of their way to be more understated; materialism is less valued than ownership. At a recent Friday lunch, I was looking around and it was all Brunello Cucinelli and Loro Piana. I don\u2019t even know if those brands make suits.\u201d\u201cBut that in-your-face power suit image?\u201d Mr. Studzinski said. \u201cThat image is long gone.\u201d This election year, however, its ghost lingers on.Advertisement"}

It will happen on May 20-22, part of Les Journ\u00e9es Particuli\u00e8res, a three-day event in which the French luxury giant LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton lifts the curtain on some of the studios and workshops of its 70 brands.In 2011 and 2013, more than 100,000 visitors watched shoemakers add the final flourishes to custom Berluti shoes, horologists piece together TAG Heuer watches and petites mains embroider beads onto the bodices of Dior gowns. (The event is held irregularly.)The idea is a play on the Journ\u00e9es du Patrimoine, or Heritage Days, held in France, when official buildings like the Palais de Congr\u00e8s and the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace are opened to the public.Antoine Arnault, chief executive of Berluti, chairman of Loro Piana and the son of the LVMH founder, Bernard Arnault, said he initiated the event to show that LVMH is more than just a stock listing.\u201cThe group is not built by finance,\u201d he said. \u201cThe group is made of tens of thousands of people who are proud of what they do, who love what they do, who work in fantastic conditions.\u201dMr. Arnault said he knows visitors are excited to visit the ateliers, but the event really is for the artisans: \u201cThey\u2019re there all year long making these beautiful products a little bit in the shadows, and you feel their pride.\u201dThis year, 51 locations across Europe are opening, several of them for the first time. In addition to Loro Piana\u2019s mill, they include Fendi\u2019s headquarters and fur workshop at the Palazzo Della Civilt\u00e0 Italiana in Rome, where a visit is as much about the architecture as the artisans. Commissioned by Benito Mussolini in the 1930s, the Square Colosseum, as it is commonly called, is a towering block of travertine marble perforated on all sides by a grid of Roman archways.This year Les Journ\u00e9es Particulaires will put special emphasis on the transmission of savoir-faire, and there will be a variety of master classes, like a barbering workshop with Acqua di Parma, and a session on the art of custom-made dress shirts with the British brand Thomas Pink.In another first, teams from Instagram and Facebook will document this year\u2019s visits in real time to expand the access.Registration begins April 21 on the LVMH website. Potential visitors are being encouraged to create accounts in advance to speed the process once reservations open, because space is limited and tends to fill quickly.As for the event itself, Mr. Arnault has a personal goal: \u201cWe hope to beat the record of Beyonc\u00e9. She sold out her last concert in 3 minutes. We think we can do better.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bernie Sanders Has Trickier, Narrower Road in Democratic Race", "Date": "2016-04-20", "News": "Supported bySenator Bernie Sanders of Vermont grappled with tough and narrowing choices about campaign strategy and fund-raising on Wednesday after his crushing loss in the New York primary and with a series of difficult contests ahead.While Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign carefully avoided any suggestion that he quit the Democratic presidential race, many of her prominent supporters argued that the moment had come for Mr. Sanders to ease off attacks for the good of Democrats in the November election.Mr. Sanders, who took the day off to rest and regroup with his advisers, is under intense pressure to win the Pennsylvania primary on Tuesday or fall even further behind Mrs. Clinton\u2019s sizable lead in pledged delegates needed to capture the nomination. A new Pennsylvania poll put Mr. Sanders 13 percentage points behind Mrs. Clinton, despite heavy spending by the Sanders campaign on television advertisements. Another loss could hamper his formidable fund-raising, which Sanders advisers described as steady but not as strong as it could have been with a New York victory.In addition to Pennsylvania, four other states hold primaries on Tuesday, and Sanders advisers say that all of the contests will be tough for them. While Mr. Sanders has a strong shot at winning the Indiana primary on May 3, given his popularity with white voters and independents there, he has limited opportunities to pick up many more delegates than Mrs. Clinton, according to several Sanders advisers.\u201cIf we get to a position in a week or two where our path to victory with pledged delegates doesn\u2019t look credible, I think we\u2019ll need to stand up and say that in public, and then assess how we can get that lead in delegates,\u201d said Tad Devine, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to speculate about what may happen.\u201dGiven Mrs. Clinton\u2019s lead, several of her allies contended that he should shift his focus from criticizing Mrs. Clinton to championing Democratic policies that might help the party beat Donald J. Trump, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas or another Republican nominee, and also win back control of the House and the Senate.\u201cThere does come a point when Democrats, and those who believe we can\u2019t afford a Trump or Cruz presidency, should recognize that we need to start thinking about what\u2019s best for the presumptive nominee going forward,\u201d said Gov. Jack Markell of Delaware, a Clinton supporter whose state holds its primary on Tuesday. \u201cThe good news is that Bernie Sanders will remain in the Senate, where he can continue to speak out and continue to inspire new people into the process.\u201dGov. Dannel P. Malloy of Connecticut, which also has a primary Tuesday, said he was concerned that the fight between Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton could hurt the party\u2019s congressional candidates and candidates for governor if the Democratic contest comes to be seen as fractious and divided as the Republican presidential race.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.\u201cI think we all need to back up and take a breath, because this shouldn\u2019t be a personal battle that damages the party,\u201d said Mr. Malloy, also a Clinton supporter. Referring to some recent attacks by Mr. Sanders, he said, \u201cYou don\u2019t get votes by saying someone is not qualified to be president.\u201dSanders advisers and supporters reacted to the Clinton pleas with varying degrees of incredulity, noting that Mrs. Clinton and her advisers have been criticizing the senator daily on issues like gun control. The Clinton campaign on Wednesday released a new ad in Connecticut that features the daughter of the principal who died in the Sandy Hook shootings, an indirect attack on Mr. Sanders\u2019s record on guns.Mayor Bao Nguyen of Garden Grove, Calif., a Sanders supporter, said the senator should continue in the race through the delegate-rich California primary in June and further sharpen his focus on policy issues that matter most to Americans.\u201cFighting for the people \u2014 not the millionaire and billionaire class \u2014 is what helped him win eight primaries in a row, defy pundits\u2019 predictions of a Hillary coronation and pull even in national polls,\u201d Mr. Nguyen said.With the Democratic race at a potential crossroads as Mr. Sanders weighs his next steps, Mrs. Clinton and her advisers walked their own careful line on Wednesday. The Clinton camp described her delegate lead as all but insurmountable \u2014 more than twice as large as Barack Obama\u2019s lead over her in 2008 \u2014 but also took pains to avoid appearing overly antagonistic toward Mr. Sanders. Mrs. Clinton has roughly 1,450 pledged delegates and Mr. Sanders has about 1,200; 2,383 are needed to win the nomination.Instead, her allies pleaded with Mr. Sanders to stop doing anything that could be used by Mr. Trump or Mr. Cruz in the fall, and cease running advertisements, like one now in Pennsylvania, that question Mrs. Clinton\u2019s toughness against big banks like Goldman Sachs.\u201cThe Republican will take every one of his most negative statements and use them as ads in the general election,\u201d said Rosalind Wyman, a longtime Democratic National committeewoman from California and a Clinton supporter.Not all major Clinton supporters were pushing Mr. Sanders to shift gears, though. Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, a longtime liberal like Mr. Sanders, said, \u201cIt\u2019s not up to me or anyone else to tell him what to do with his race.\u201dMichael Briggs, a spokesman for Mr. Sanders, said the campaign planned to continue to ask questions about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s ties to Wall Street, her speeches at commercial banks and her changing stances on policy issues. He also shot back sarcastically when asked whether Mr. Sanders might change the tone of the campaign that in recent weeks has become more contentious.See results from your neighborhood.\u201cI\u2019ve seen their, I\u2019m sure, heartfelt concerns about the tone of the campaign,\u201d Mr. Briggs said of the Clinton campaign. \u201cAll I would ask them to do is look in the mirror.\u201dMr. Devine, the senator\u2019s senior adviser, said Mr. Sanders\u2019s focus was likely to be on policy issues crucial to Pennsylvania, Connecticut and other states voting in the coming days.\u201cI have no doubt that judgment issues will come up, but I don\u2019t think it will come up the way it did in New York, which is a fundamentally different media environment than in other states,\u201d Mr. Devine said. He added that there had been no direct conversations between the two campaigns about the future of the race or either candidacy.Jeff Weaver, the Sanders campaign manager, said that the senator would continue to vigorously defend his record and that advisers were confident that he would win the \u201cvast majority\u201d of the states remaining based on the campaign\u2019s internal polling and Mr. Sanders\u2019s past ability to close gaps in places like Michigan and Iowa.The Sanders campaign signaled on Wednesday that it was still fighting hard: Mr. Weaver sent a fund-raising email noting that an unnamed Clinton campaign aide had hurled a swear word at Mr. Sanders in a Politico story. \u201cIt\u2019s outrageous,\u201d Mr. Weaver wrote before asking for donations to \u201csend our own message back to the Clinton campaign in a language they\u2019re certain to understand.\u201dThe Sanders campaign says it raised almost $46 million in March, outpacing the Clinton campaign, which raised $29.3 million. The Sanders campaign reported more than $17 million cash on hand while the Clinton campaign says it began April with about $29 million cash on hand.While supporters of Mr. Sanders have been exceptionally loyal donors, with the campaign breaking online fund-raising records, some Clinton supporters questioned the Sanders solicitations when his ability to overtake Mrs. Clinton in delegates is so slim.\u201cSanders has run a stunningly strong campaign fueled by passionate supporters,\u201d David Plouffe, Mr. Obama\u2019s former campaign manager, wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. \u201cBut raising $$ stating you have path to nomination is fraud.\u201dMr. Devine of the Sanders campaign responded: \u201cFraud is a hard word to put out there. I respect David, but I don\u2019t believe we\u2019re lying or being fraudulent in saying we think we still have a path to the nomination.\u201dAmy Chozick contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Need of More Volunteers, Fire Departments Are Turning to Women", "Date": "2016-04-21", "News": "Supported byHALFMOON, N.Y. \u2014 Maggie Kuebler fought through pain as she wielded heavy power tools to free victims trapped in a mock vehicle accident, one of the many tests she underwent to become a volunteer firefighter.Her 5-foot-7, 150-pound frame shook with exhaustion, but she refused to quit. She knew that some day she could face real life-or-death situations, just as her father, a former Port Authority of New York and New Jersey police officer whose life of service she wanted to emulate, had.Ms. Kuebler, 20, is among a growing number of women climbing tall aerial ladders or rescuing people from smoky rooms as members of New York State\u2019s volunteer fire companies, which serve millions of residents in small towns and suburban communities that cannot afford paid professional departments.\u201cYou just keep telling yourself, \u2018I have to get this person out, I have to get the job done,\u2019 \u201d said Ms. Kuebler, a volunteer with the Walton Fire Department in rural Delaware County.Increasingly, fire officials believe they can.This weekend, about 500 of the state\u2019s 1,583 volunteer fire companies are hosting recruitment open houses. One of the main goals is to attract more women.\u201cI would go without hesitation into a burning building with any one of these women,\u201d said John D\u2019Alessandro, secretary of the Firemen\u2019s Association of the State of New York, a nonprofit group that provides information, education, training and advocacy for the state\u2019s volunteer emergency services. \u201cThe standards, the expectations, are the same for everyone. All I want to know is you\u2019ve got my back and I\u2019ve got your back.\u201dMr. D\u2019Alessandro\u2019s daughter, Caitlin, 21, a college student studying to become a paramedic, has also answered the call. For years, she watched her father and older brother, Evan, both volunteer firefighters, run out the door when alarms sounded. Then she decided, \u201cWhy not me?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly tough job, man or woman,\u201d said Ms. D\u2019Alessandro, a volunteer with the Halfmoon Fire Department in Saratoga County. \u201cBut I love the feeling you get when you help somebody, the relief on their face when they know someone\u2019s there who knows what they\u2019re doing in an emergency.\u201dPeople who call 911 are not concerned about the gender of the person who responds, said Noreen Jenkins, a member of the South Schodack Fire Department in Rensselaer County.\u201cAt the time, they\u2019re thinking that you\u2019re there to help,\u201d she said, \u201cnot whether you\u2019re a man or woman.\u201dWomen still account for less than 5 percent of the 102,000 volunteer firefighters in the state, according to a survey conducted in 2015 by the firemen\u2019s association. But the estimated 5,000 women who are currently volunteers is double the number of a decade ago at a time when departments are having difficultly finding new recruits. The number of volunteers peaked at more than 120,000 in the 1980s.The biggest challenge is time, particularly in areas still struggling to recover from the recession where people have multiple jobs or both spouses work, officials said. Another obstacle is the increased training required to become a firefighter.A federal grant financed a four-year recruiting drive that ended last year and helped attract a larger number of volunteer firefighters. But as the population in many communities rises and the types and complexity of fire calls increases, more volunteers are needed, Mr. D\u2019Alessandro said.Though safer, modern construction techniques and stricter building codes have made building fires less common, firefighters stay busy responding to motor vehicle accidents, calls for medical help, natural disasters and other emergencies, such as pumping out flooded basements. To meet this demand, fire companies would like to exceed the volunteer rates reached in the \u201980s.Carol Trifano, 45, who served in the Navy, said a message posted outside a local firehouse challenged her to join the Clifton Park Fire Department in Saratoga County. The sign said, \u201cIf your neighbor\u2019s house was on fire would you know what to do?\u201dMs. Trifano knew her answer and it kept nagging at her, so she decided to walk into the firehouse and offer to help. \u201cAfter the Navy I missed doing something service-oriented, so it was great to give back to my community,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are responding to people\u2019s most trying times in their entire lives.\u201dMs. Jenkins recalled one emergency when she and her husband, Peter, a fellow volunteer, kept a kitchen fire from consuming an entire house. \u201cWhen we went into that building, it was good to know she was right there behind me,\u201d Mr. Jenkins said. \u201cShe knows how to do everything.\u2019\u2019Despite the serious responsibilities that come with the job, Ms. Jenkins said she had had some lighter encounters. \u201cPeople just don\u2019t know what to call you,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cThey want to say fireman, but they don\u2019t. The funniest I had, onetime, was somebody called me a fire lady. Call me anything you want, just recognize me for what I am.\u201dWhen handling the same difficult and dangerous calls as men, women may sometimes have an advantage, said Chief William Bryans of the West Crescent Fire Department in Saratoga County. \u201cIf there\u2019s an accident involving a female, just that comfort level of having another female there makes the situation a little bit easier,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd most of the women here at this firehouse are moms. So they know how to deal with children. It does help out.\u201d\u201cWomen have to prove themselves at every turn,\u201d said Megan Collins, the organization\u2019s president. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of the older generation that don\u2019t want women in the fire service.\u201dBut such biases are giving way to a growing recognition and appreciation among many fire chiefs who welcome women at a time when their ranks may be thin.Mr. Bryans said he had little patience for those who felt otherwise.\u201cWomen go through the same identical training as a male does,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no difference. They do not get special treatment. I have not detected any discrimination in my department, but I tell you I will not tolerate it. It\u2019s not acceptable, especially in a volunteer service. If people are willing to volunteer their time \u2014 these days it\u2019s so hard because people are so busy \u2014 we owe it to them to give them the respect they deserve.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ex-Goldman Sachs Banker Revamps 401(k) Accounts in New Job", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported byKANSAS CITY \u2014 Greg Smith was making his pitch, just as he did back in the day when he was a striving young sales trader at Goldman Sachs.While Mr. Smith\u2019s earnest, somewhat preachy demeanor has not changed much, what and to whom he sells certainly has. No longer does he travel the world, promoting complex derivative bets to some of the sharpest investors around.Instead, here he was in this city trying to persuade a skeptical audience of middle managers at a credit union to hand over the keys to their 401(k) plans to Blooom, the financial start-up he joined a year ago.Over the span of your working life, you could save more than $100,000 by paying less in fees, Mr. Smith promised, striding back and forth in the sun-filled conference hall at the corporate headquarters of Mazuma Credit Union, which serves five counties in Kansas and Missouri.\u201cIt\u2019s a no brainer,\u201d he said.Mr. Smith is far from the only person from an entrenched Wall Street firm to flee to the Wild West of new financial technology companies.But few have left with as much theatrical flair as Mr. Smith. Having known him before he made his big splash, I was curious about how he was managing his post-Goldman life and went to this city to see for myself.In his spiel to Mazuma, Mr. Smith did not say that mutual fund companies were treating 401(k) savers like muppets, but he might as well have.After all, the essence of Mr. Smith\u2019s original complaint was that Goldman Sachs, in pursuit of quick and easy profits, had come to regard its everyday client as a ready mark. An idiot and fool to be manipulated by someone else, was how Mr. Smith described the sentiment in the book he subsequently wrote, \u201cWhy I Left Goldman Sachs.\u201dOn Goldman\u2019s trading floor in London, where Mr. Smith worked when he resigned in 2012, these unsuspecting clients were frequently referred to as muppets, Mr. Smith claimed.And with that revelation, he turned an obscure bit of trader slang into a global symbol for the many who believed that Goldman was putting the company\u2019s financial interests ahead of its partners in business.Goldman Sachs rejected the notion. But even among the many who believed that the company had become short-term greedy, there were those who viewed Mr. Smith\u2019s critique as bitter and self-serving.Indeed, when the book came out, reviewers sniffed, and sales were mediocre at best.Soon, people had stopped talking about muppets and Greg Smith altogether.For a while, in 2013 and 2014, Mr. Smith was not sure what to do next.\u201cMy parents wanted me to get a job,\u201d Mr. Smith said as he drank a beer at a hotel bar here.He spent some time in Washington, advising the Democratic Senators Carl Levin of Michigan and Jeff Merkley of Oregon on regulatory issues connected to Dodd-Frank legislation.And he hit the paid speech circuit, although it became clear that a career as a public advocate for proper financial and fiduciary practices was not going to happen.Then Mr. Smith came upon the notion of championing the rights of the 90 million Americans who have around $7 trillion saved in 401(k) retirement plans through their companies.The pool of money was huge, but with the average plan size about $91,000, Mr. Smith saw these savers as getting short shrift from the mutual fund giants and the companies that sponsored the plans.That these mostly unsophisticated savers ended up in higher-fee or higher-risk funds without knowing any better galled him, he said.In 2014, he met Chris Costello, a former investment adviser based here who had just co-founded Blooom, a financial technology start-up that uses an algorithm to guide 401(k) savers into the cheapest, most appropriate funds available to them.Mr. Smith was impressed and soon joined as president overseeing marketing and business development. He also came in as an investor, and just a few months ago, he pulled up stakes in New York and moved here.Mr. Smith, 37, grew up in Johannesburg, went to Stanford and spent 12 years working for Goldman in New York and London.But there is something unjaded, if not cornfed, about him that makes him a perfect fit for Kansas.At Blooom\u2019s office on the city\u2019s outskirts, rock tunes fill the air, quants \u2014 the math wizards wearing Royals baseball caps \u2014 pound away at their computer keyboards and a beer tap and Ping-Pong table stand at the ready.Sitting in a conference room, Mr. Smith cites a striking statistic while explaining why he is convinced that Blooom, whose assets have grown to $225 million from $54 million over the last year, can hit it big.Of the 90 million people who have 401(k) plans, more than 83 million will simply guess randomly when it comes to selecting the funds that a Vanguard or a Fidelity offers them, he pointed out.\u201cThe difference between picking a high- or low-fee fund could add two to three years to your retirement,\u201d Mr. Smith said.When I told him that I counted myself in the camp of 401(k) guessers and was curious to see what Blooom could do for my sad little retirement plan, he responded enthusiastically.\u201cGreat idea! Let\u2019s do it, man,\u201d he said.So I did what 2,300 clients have done before me: I handed over the password to my Vanguard retirement account, paid Blooom a Netflix-style fee of $15 a month and got out of the way.Mr. Smith gave me the news with a sympathetic shake of his head: 28 percent of my portfolio was earning next to zero in a pricey bond fund, and I had no international exposure.Moreover, the funds that I blindly selected when I signed up for my plan 15 years ago charged me 0.51 percent in fees.Within minutes, the algorithm had done its work, putting 98 percent of my portfolio into a mix of globally diversified stock funds, with the rest going to bonds.But what really got Mr. Smith going were the savings coming my way.\u201cLook, man,\u201d he said, pointing his finger excitedly at the flower in full bloom on my computer screen. \u201cYour fees are now 0.20 \u2014 that is an annual savings of $775 a year.\u201dIt\u2019s too soon to tell whether these kinds of robo-investing operations will serve investors well over the long term, or whether Blooom will survive in the harshly competitive world of finance.But this much is also true: When I left Blooom that day, no one could say I was a muppet.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Vaccine Scandal Threatens Public Faith in Immunizations", "Date": "2016-04-18", "News": "Supported byHEZE, China \u2014 First the news rippled across China that millions of compromised vaccines had been given to children around the country. Then came grim rumors and angry complaints from parents that the government had kept them in the dark about the risks since last year.Now, the country\u2019s immunization program faces a backlash of public distrust that critics say has been magnified by the government\u2019s ingrained secrecy.Song Zhendong, like many parents here, said he was reluctant to risk further vaccinations for his 10-month-old son.\u201cIf he can avoid them in the future, we will not get them,\u201d said Mr. Song, a businessman. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t we learn about this sooner? If there\u2019s a problem with vaccines for our kids, we should be told as soon as the police knew. Aren\u2019t our children the future of the nation?\u201dThe faulty vaccines have become the latest lightning rod for widespread, often visceral distrust of China\u2019s medical system, and a rebuff to what many Chinese critics see as President Xi Jinping\u2019s bulldozing, top-down rule.The scandal is just the latest crisis to shake public faith in China\u2019s food and medicine supplies, but it is the first big scare under Mr. Xi, who had vowed to be different. He came into office promising to \u201cmake protecting the people\u2019s right to health a priority.\u201dThe anger here in Heze, the city in the eastern province of Shandong where the scandal has its roots, is evident.About two million improperly stored vaccines were sold around the country from an overheated, dilapidated storeroom. The main suspect in the case is a hospital pharmacist from Heze who had been convicted of trading in illegal vaccines in 2009 and was doing it again two years later.Many parents said they were especially alarmed that nearly a year had elapsed from the time the police uncovered the illicit trade and the time the public first learned about it in February.\u201cWithholding information doesn\u2019t maintain public credibility,\u201d said Li Shuqing, a lawyer in Jinan, the capital of Shandong Province, who is one of about 90 attorneys who have volunteered to represent possible victims in the case. \u201cIn the end, it makes people more distrustful.\u201dTo many here, the combination of lax regulation and the secrecy surrounding a potential public health crisis seems like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\u201cThe customers worry about fake milk powder, fake medicine, fake vaccines, fake everything,\u201d said Ma Guohui, the owner of a shop on the rural fringe of Heze that sells baby products. \u201cThis is certainly going to affect people\u2019s thinking. My boy got all his vaccination shots. If he were born now, I\u2019d worry.\u201dDespite such fears, the tainted vaccines are more likely to be ineffective than harmful.The illicit vaccines in the current case were not part of China\u2019s compulsory, state-financed vaccination program, which inoculates children against illnesses such as polio and measles at no charge.The illegal trade dealt in so-called second-tier vaccines \u2014 including those for rabies, influenza and hepatitis B \u2014 which patients pay for from their own pockets.She began the business in 2011, just two years after she had been convicted on charges of illegally trading in vaccines and sentenced to three years in prison, which was reduced to five years\u2019 probation. Officials have not explained how she was able to avoid prison and resume her business.Ms. Pang, in her late 40s, and her daughter, who has been identified only by her surname, Sun, kept the vaccines in a rented storeroom of a disused factory in Jinan. The storeroom lacked refrigeration, which may have damaged the vaccines\u2019 potency. The police have detained them but not announced specific charges, and neither suspect has had a chance to respond publicly to the accusations.It was the government\u2019s intolerance of public criticism, critics said, that kept the scandal under wraps, a delay that now makes it harder to track those who received the suspect injections.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen with these problem vaccines that without the right to know, without press freedom, the public\u2019s right to health can\u2019t be assured,\u201d said Wang Shengsheng, one of the lawyers pressing the government for more answers and redress over the case.In the last few weeks, official reticence has been supplanted by daily announcements of arrests, checks and assurances as the central government has scrambled to dampen public anger and alarm.Last week, the investigators reported that 202 people had been detained over the scandal, and 357 officials dismissed, demoted or otherwise punished. Health and drug officials promised to tighten vaccine purchase rules to stamp out under-the-counter trade.Mr. Xi has so far not publicly commented on the scandal.Dr. Rodewald, the World Health Organization expert, said the proposed changes were promising and would mean clinics would not have to rely on selling patient-paid vaccines for their upkeep.Xu Huijin, a doctor in Heze, said that the concern over the scandal \u2014 and unfounded rumors of deaths \u2014 had depressed the number of parents bringing children to her clinic for inoculations.\u201cThis was badly handled,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was a lack of coordination, not enough information. We should have found out about this long ago. Doctors are taught to tell patients the full facts.\u201dAdam Wu contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "He Catches What Umps Might Miss", "Date": "2016-04-19", "News": "Supported byWeber, 39, stares at two flat-panel screens that carry up to 15 camera angles of the game, keeping an eye out for an umpire\u2019s mistake that might prompt him to pick up the red phone that is a direct line to the Yankees\u2019 dugout.Most fans have never seen Weber, and few realize that in any one game he might exert as much influence on the outcome as a player on the field. As the Yankees\u2019 video replay monitor, it is his job to alert the coaching staff in the dugout if he believes the team should challenge an umpire\u2019s call.Video replay \u2014 which has been expanded this year, its third season in Major League Baseball \u2014 is affecting games like never before, with wins and losses hinging on reviews of everything from potential home runs to foul balls and collisions at home plate. Nobody has been more proficient at using it than Weber.The Yankees have had the highest success rate in baseball since replay was instituted, winning 77.6 percent of their challenges, far above the rate of the Miami Marlins, who are next at 65.5 percent. The rate for the majors is 52.2 percent.\u201cThe whole purpose of replay is just to get it right and make it fair for everybody,\u201d Yankees reliever Andrew Miller said. \u201cBut the reality is, some teams are better than others. I think our guy is better and quicker than the other guys out there, so that\u2019s an advantage for us.\u201dUnlike in the N.F.L., in which all scoring plays and turnovers are automatically reviewed, and the N.B.A., in which reviews are initiated by referees, a vast majority of replay reviews in baseball are initiated by managers. And because managers are allowed one challenge per game \u2014 they maintain the challenge if their appeal is successful \u2014 there can be rewards for diligently using the system.The Yankees have also been judicious. Their 58 challenges since 2014 are tied for the fewest in the majors, and they had not challenged any plays through the first 11 games of this season. The Rays had made the most challenges (109 through Sunday\u2019s games), one more than the Chicago Cubs, who had won the most overturned calls (54).Before the first pitch is thrown Wednesday night at Yankee Stadium, Weber will grab a cup of coffee or tea, walk past a sign that reads, \u201cDo Your Job,\u201d and settle into a swivel chair in front of the two screens. He is not sure how he ended up with this job. It just sort of landed in his lap \u2014 pretty much like all of his other varied duties.Weber\u2019s title, major league coaching assistant, is rather amorphous. \u201cI like it like that,\u201d he said with a smile.He throws batting practice most days, stands in as a first baseman during infield drills, assists with video preparation, charts pitches, helps convey analytical data to players and is available if players want extra work. In the winter, he shifts to the front office, preparing scouting reports in the quantitative analysis department.Such a pliable skill set is what one might expect from somebody who studied finance and psychology while playing baseball at the University of Illinois. A year after he was drafted by the Yankees, he seemed to be developing into a pitching prospect, with an 8-4 record, 23 saves and a 1.97 E.R.A. at Class A Greensboro. But he then had the first of two elbow operations, missed two seasons and was released.He pitched for two years in an independent league, but at the end of 2004, Weber was 28 and was not getting phone calls from any major league organizations.\u201cIt was just time to move on,\u201d said Weber, who landed a job as a stock analyst in Chicago. While he appreciated learning about the corporate environment and passed his exam to become a licensed broker, \u201cthat competitiveness never went away and my passion for baseball never went away,\u201d he said.Five years later, knowing that his background in finance might be seen as an asset in baseball, Weber reached out to Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman. Two weeks before the start of spring training in 2009, Cashman offered him a job.\u201cWhen I was hired initially, I wanted to make sure it would be O.K. if I worked in the off-season,\u201d Weber said. \u201cI\u2019m very interested in understanding the analytics side of baseball \u2014 it certainly piqued my interest in how the game is changing.\u201dWhen Weber was asked to handle replay reviews, he approached it in the same manner he did stock reports or scouting reports: He dived into research. He studied success rates of N.F.L. challenges and spoke with teams at both ends of the spectrum, as well as someone at the N.F.L. offices. In that first season, seemingly everyone in baseball had a different approach. The Oakland A\u2019s used color-coded, numbered cards from 1 to 5 to signal to Manager Bob Melvin whether to appeal: A red 1 meant no appeal, a green 5 meant absolutely, and a yellow 3 was a coin flip.(From the seventh inning on, the umpires can initiate a replay review on their own.)\u201cThere are some philosophies that say challenge everything; if you lose, you lose it,\u201d Weber said. \u201cI go back to, it\u2019s either right or wrong. I think our process works, but we continue to tweak it.\u201dManager Joe Girardi added: \u201cIt\u2019s not like you get as many as you want, so if you call for a replay, you better be right. Webby is usually right on. I don\u2019t even run back and look, and I could run back and look in our clubhouse. I trust him with anything.\u201dThat trust was reinforced last July 3 when Tampa Bay\u2019s Evan Longoria hit a ball into the left-field corner in the 11th inning and slid into second base ahead of the tag by Jose Pirela. Umpire C. B. Bucknor signaled safe.\u201cHe called, and I\u2019m like, \u2018What is he calling for?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Girardi said.Upon review, Longoria was out.It\u2019s hard to know how the game would have otherwise turned out, but the path to victory was easier for the Yankees, who won on Brian McCann\u2019s 12th-inning home run. Consider that in the American League, the Houston Astros edged the Los Angeles Angels for the final playoff spot by one game. And the Yankees were only one game ahead of the Astros.Home teams and visiting teams are supplied the same equipment, a pair of flat-screen computer monitors that are about 2 \u00bd feet wide by 1 \u00bd feet tall. Though the monitors have access to 15 camera angles, they can vary by ballpark and by which TV network is broadcasting the game. Those 15 shots can be configured in numerous positions and sizes on the monitors. Weber communicates with Rob Thomson, the bench coach, on the dedicated phone line that goes directly to the dugout, much like the one from the bullpen.\u201cA couple times I\u2019ve gotten a call telling me to get one of the pitchers up,\u201d said Weber, whose report is relayed by Thomson to Girardi.When the Yankees are on the road, the monitors are set up in different places \u2014 in Toronto, where they played last week, they are in a shack adjacent to the clubhouse. The setup at Yankee Stadium is in the video room, which can be a hive of activity during games. Pitchers, hitters and coaches duck in and out, looking at one of the four TV screens or seven computer monitors to pick up clues from the previous inning that will help them outwit the opponent. The audio feed from a Yankees TV or radio broadcast is piped through four speakers.When a controversial play occurs, there is no shortage of back-seat drivers.\u201cI\u2019ve had quite a few \u2014 I guess I\u2019d call them replay assistants,\u201d Weber said. \u201cHiroki Kuroda, I\u2019d always do the opposite, but he\u2019d always have an opinion. Everybody has opinions.\u201dKuroda, a pitcher, left after 2014, but of the current players, Miller and outfielder Brett Gardner are the voices most frequently in his ear \u2014 often voting with their heart more than their head. Alex Rodriguez is also a regular presence in the room.\u201cIt\u2019s got to be an overwhelming position to be in \u2014 you\u2019re never out there, you\u2019re never seen, but potentially a game could hinge on a decision you make from down in the dungeon,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThere is usually three or four guys looking over his shoulder \u2014 is that ball fair or foul? He handles us being around pretty well.\u201dWeber said his focus, attuned by an ever-present cup of coffee or tea, was on the monitors. He charts pitches \u2014 cataloging location, velocity and pitch type \u2014 and leaves only if he needs to take a bathroom break between innings. If Weber spots a play that might be worth reviewing, he typically has about 10 seconds to look at the replays and make an assessment.\u201cI\u2019m pretty locked in during the game,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of just background noise.\u201dWeber deflects any credit for overturning calls. He says the satisfaction he gets is in helping players. If, for example, the catcher McCann throws out a runner, then he deserves to get credit for it. If Gardner beats a throw to first base, he should be rewarded with a hit.There is, however, one underrated perk of the job.\u201cIt\u2019s the only time that I\u2019m able to tell the manager what to do,\u201d Weber said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ed Snider, Flyers Owner Who Made Philadelphia a Hockey Town, Dies at 83", "Date": "2016-04-11", "News": "Supported byEd Snider, who co-founded the Philadelphia Flyers of the National Hockey League and owned the team for nearly 50 years, and who was chairman of a sports management company that provided services to hundreds of arenas, stadiums and convention centers in North America, died on Monday at his home in Montecito, Calif. He was 83.His family said he had died of cancer.The son of a grocery store owner, Mr. Snider formed the Flyers with several partners as an expansion franchise in 1967 in a city with no hockey tradition, no base of hockey fans and no hockey arena. They built one on Broad Street, called it the Spectrum and installed their team.After a shaky start, the Flyers turned the City of Brotherly Love into a town that loved bare-knuckle fights on the ice. Mr. Snider hired a cadre of roughneck fighters after seeing his team of aging retreads and young castoffs humiliated by brawlers like the St. Louis Blues and the Montreal Canadiens. Blood flowed. Sellout crowds roared. In 1973, The Philadelphia Bulletin dubbed the Flyers the \u201cBroad Street Bullies.\u201dAnd in 1974 and 1975, the Flyers won consecutive Stanley Cup championships. Philadelphia became a hockey town and never looked back.The Flyers were the league\u2019s first expansion team to win hockey\u2019s holy grail, and repeating the feat a year later left fans ecstatic. Bursting with pride, two million people turned out for back-to-back celebratory parades. Mr. Snider\u2019s Flyers won no more Stanley Cups, but the team became one of the best in the N.H.L., making the playoffs 38 times and playing in six more Stanley Cup finals, the last in 2010.\u201cLuukko was talking about his boss, but just about everybody in Philadelphia says the same thing,\u201d Jeff Z. Klein, a Times hockey reporter, wrote. \u201cTantalizing as the prospect may sound to Rangers fans \u2014 and Penguins fans and Devils fans and Islanders fans and on and on \u2014 without Snider there would probably have been no Flyers, no legacy of the Broad Street Bullies, no hockey.\u201dIn 1974, Mr. Snider formed Spectacor as a holding company for the Flyers and the Spectrum, with himself as chairman. The company became landlord to the National Basketball Association\u2019s Philadelphia 76ers, who also played at the Spectrum, and acquired Prism, the first regional sports network on cable television, and WIP-AM, one of the first all-sports radio stations. Mr. Snider also wrote innovative contracts to manage arenas in New York, Massachusetts, Michigan, Virginia and Florida.In the late 1980s, Mr. Snider and Spectacor built an arena in South Philadelphia that became the Wells Fargo Center. In 1996, he sold a majority stake in Spectacor to Comcast but retained a one-third interest and the chairmanship of the merged sports and entertainment behemoth, Comcast Spectacor. The company bought the 76ers and acquired companies that managed and provided food, ticketing and other services for hundreds of arenas, stadiums and convention centers in the United States and Canada. It sold the 76ers in 2011.Mr. Snider attended nearly all the Flyers\u2019 home games and was involved in day-to-day team matters.\u201cThe owner is supposed to be the guy with the money, who sits back in some big office and smokes hand-rolled cigars while he watches the bread roll in,\u201d Maury Z. Levy wrote in Philadelphia magazine in 1971. \u201cHe is not supposed to get his custom-made suits spoiled by the smell of the locker room after a good game. These are the unwritten rules of being an owner, and Ed Snider breaks every one of them.\u201dEdward Malcolm Snider was born in Washington on Jan. 6, 1933, to Sol and Lillian Bonas Snider. His father owned three grocery stores in the nation\u2019s capital. Ed graduated from Calvin Coolidge High School in 1951 and from the University of Maryland in 1955 with an accounting degree.He was named a vice president for business affairs of the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League in 1964, after his sister, Phyllis, married Earl Foreman, a part owner of the team. In 1966, when the N.H.L. disclosed plans to expand its league from six to 12 teams, Mr. Snider and several partners, including Jerry Wolman, a principal owner of the Eagles, applied for a franchise in Philadelphia.The city had little experience with pro hockey. The Arrows of the Canadian-American League, a forebear of the American Hockey League, had played there in 1927-28 and in 1934-35. The Quakers, an N.H.L. franchise, played for a season in 1930-31, but quit after a dreadful campaign. While Hockey News said Philadelphia was \u201cleast likely to succeed,\u201d the N.H.L. awarded the Snider-Wolman group a conditional franchise.In a division agreed upon by the partners, Mr. Wolman largely financed and controlled the Spectrum, which was built in little more than a year, and Mr. Snider assumed control of the Flyers, who began their inaugural season in October 1967. But Mr. Wolman ran into financial problems, the Spectrum fell into bankruptcy, and Mr. Snider, under a court-approved plan, agreed to pay the creditors and assumed control of the Spectrum in 1971.Mr. Snider, who also had a home in Gladwyne, Pa., was the longest-tenured owner in the N.H.L. when he died.He was married four times. With his first wife, the former Myrna Gordon, he had four children, Craig, Jay, Lindy and Tina. They were divorced in 1981. In 1983, he married Martha McGeary. They had two children, Sarena and Samuel, and were divorced in 2001. His 2004 marriage to Christine Decroix ended in divorce in 2012. In 2013, he married Lin Spivak.She survives him, as do his children, 15 grandchildren and a sister, Phyllis Foreman.In 1999, a Philadelphia Daily News poll named Mr. Snider the city\u2019s greatest sports mover and shaker, surpassing the legendary Athletics manager Connie Mack and the basketball broadcaster Sonny Hill. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1988 and the United States Hockey Hall of Fame in 2011.In 2005, he created the Ed Snider Youth Hockey Foundation, which maintains ice rinks and provides equipment, coaching and hockey programs for thousands of children in Philadelphia and Camden, N.J. He also endowed a research center at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.Daniel E. Slotnik contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Making a Soda Tax More Politically Palatable", "Date": "2016-04-03", "News": "Supported byScaling BackMayor Jim Kenney was elected in Philadelphia last year after promising to bring the city universal prekindergarten, but he needed a way to pay for it.Enter the soda tax. As part of his budget, introduced this month, Mr. Kenney has proposed taxing sugar-sweetened beverages at 3 cents an ounce, the highest soda tax proposed anywhere in the country.Mr. Kenney is taking a different political tack. Instead of the usual eat-your-vegetables pitch of public health reformers, he is offering Philadelphians something delicious: a giant pot of money to fund popular city projects. He says his soda tax could raise more than $400 million over five years, enough to fund not just universal preschool, but also renovations to local libraries, parks and recreation centers; \u201ccommunity schools\u201d that wrap social services with education; and cash for the troubled municipal pension program. He is not using the word obesity, or suggesting that people should drink less soda.His tax could raise the price of a 20-ounce bottle of soda by 60 cents, an increase likely to make some shoppers think twice. But when asked about the health benefits of the tax, he says, \u201cThere\u2019s really serious health benefits in pre-K.\u201dIn other words, this soda tax isn\u2019t for the nanny state; it\u2019s for the needy state. Governments are starting to think of soda taxes as the next sin tax \u2014 an untapped source of revenue that could help with other things.\u201cI think Philadelphia may change the whole conversation about soda taxes,\u201d said Larry Tramutola, a political consultant who helped Berkeley pass its soda tax, and who is advising other California communities eyeing similar measures.\u201cThe world economy is squeezing a lot of governments, and they need revenue,\u201d said Barry Popkin, a professor of nutrition at the University of North Carolina, who is deeply involved in studies evaluating the effects of the taxes in Mexico, Chile and Berkeley, and hears from a lot of curious public officials.In this country the pitch has remained mostly about public health. San Francisco, where a measure last year just missed a needed two-thirds supermajority of votes, is trying again to pass a tax on sugary drinks. So are a handful of other communities in California. Berkeley\u2019s government has promised to devote the money to community gardens and other healthy initiatives. San Francisco is expected to do the same.But public health advocates say they are watching the Philadelphia experience closely, and think it could influence other local lawmakers if it succeeds. Five years ago, Mr. Kenney, then a City Council member, opposed a soda tax when his predecessor proposed it to fight childhood obesity. This time, he looked around and decided that such a tax was necessary to pay for his prekindergarten program. \u201cIt turns out in the end to be the only revenue source,\u201d he said.The use of soda tax funds to finance local libraries, parks and recreation centers could be a shrewd political choice in a city where district representatives want to show results in their community. Ten of the 17 City Council members represent districts. \u201cThere\u2019s an innate incentive to get in line,\u201d Mr. Kenney said. The tax will continue to be debated as part of the city budget, which typically comes up for a final vote before the City Council in May.Articles in this series will examine Americans\u2019 changing eating habits.The soda industry, of course, is fighting these efforts aggressively. As it has done in past years, it is responding through lobbying and advertising, and by organizing coalitions of opponents. It argues that soda taxes are condescending and hurt poor shoppers disproportionately.\u201cTime and time again, voters in cities across the country say loud and clear they oppose soda taxes,\u201d said William Dermody, the vice president of policy for the American Beverage Association.In Philadelphia, industry officials are making anti-tax arguments, saying that a tax devised to lower consumption of the good will not be a stable source of revenue for an initiative, like universal prekindergarten, that requires permanent funding.They also argue that the big soda tax, collected on distributors who deliver beverages into the city, may be too easy for individuals and retailers to evade by shopping outside city lines.

He proclaimed it a monument, he said, \u201cto help tell the story of these suffragists.\u201dMr. Obama added, \u201cIn these rooms, they pursued ideals which shouldn\u2019t be relegated to the archives of history, shouldn\u2019t be behind glass cases.\u201d\u201cI want young girls and boys to come here, 10, 20, 100 years from now, to know that women fought for equality, it was not just given to them,\u201d President Obama said, adding that he wanted future generations to be \u201castonished\u201d to learn \u201cthat there was ever a time when a woman had never sat in the Oval Office.\u201dLeft out of the name of the monument was Robert Sewall, who built the house around 1800 and then rebuilt it in 1820, after the British burned it to the ground in 1814 because it housed Americans resisting the invasion of Washington.But the house\u2019s name will remain the same. \u201cIt will always be the Sewall-Belmont House \u2014 that will never go away, and we don\u2019t want to get rid of that history,\u2019\u2019 said L. Page Harrington, the executive director of the Sewall-Belmont House and Museum. \u201cBut if you\u2019re talking about a women\u2019s history monument, you want to pick women to name it for.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m here to say we will close the wage gap,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t believe that we\u2019re going to close our wage gap, you need to come visit this house because this house has a story to tell.\u201dThat story was very nearly lost to history.Ms. Paul moved into the house in 1929, as the party began a push for women\u2019s rights legislation and an equal rights amendment. She lived and worked there until the mid-1970s and hosted a continually rotating cast of women who traveled to Washington to press their cause.\u201cWomen would come here to the headquarters and they would learn how to politically engage, but they needed a safe place to stay and they needed to be able to have chaperones with them,\u201d Ms. Harrington said. \u201cThe women that lived and worked here were extremely dedicated.\u201dMs. Harrington said the house itself had been integral to the push for women\u2019s rights because of its proximity to the Capitol, where Ms. Paul led lobbying efforts on hundreds of pieces of legislation and succeeded in winning passage of as many as 300.Even as she fought for women\u2019s rights, Ms. Paul had to fend off efforts to encroach on her prime real estate. In 1968, a group of congressmen drafted legislation to confiscate the house to make room for a driveway for a new Senate office building. They were unsuccessful. A similar effort surfaced in the 1970s, when Ms. Paul enlisted the help of Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic representative from Colorado, to fight efforts to tear down the house to make way for the Hart Senate Office Building.\u201cThe guys were building the Hart building, and they were going to tear this thing down because it was insignificant and in their way,\u201d Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland and the chamber\u2019s longest-serving woman, said in an interview. \u201cI joined with other women of the House at that time \u2014 15 or 16 \u2014 and said, \u2018We\u2019re not going to tear down women\u2019s history so 50 guys can have offices.\u2019\u201dLast year, Ms. Mikulski drafted legislation to designate the house as a National Park Service site and wrote to Mr. Obama asking that he use his presidential power to proclaim it a monument.\u201cThere are a lot of monuments around here in Washington, and we thought that there ought to be a national monument to women \u2014 to our struggle and our success,\u201d she said.Since the 1990s, as the membership of the National Women\u2019s Party dwindled and other women\u2019s groups attracted more attention and money, the aging house struggled. It survived in part through event rentals, including many wedding receptions, bringing in about $100,000 at its high point in 2007, Ms. Harrington said.But a mold outbreak in the library in 2014 cost $75,000 to fix, forcing her to switch two full-time staff people to a half-time schedule to cover the cost. Heavy snowfalls in January and February ripped off the copper gutters. Repairs ate up Ms. Harrington\u2019s budget for Women\u2019s History Month programs last month.The monument designation means that the National Park Service will now perform such maintenance, and the museum can continue to operate. The weddings, Ms. Harrington said, are a thing of the past.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Europe Says U.S. Regulations Keeping It From Trade With Iran", "Date": "2016-04-21", "News": "Supported byTEHRAN \u2014 With the completion of the nuclear deal with Iran and the opening of its market, European businesses expected a trade bonanza.But three months after the lifting of many sanctions against Iran, there is growing frustration among European politicians, diplomats and businesspeople over the inability to complete dozens of energy, aviation and construction deals with the Iranians.The main obstacle, the Europeans say, is their ally, and the driving force behind the historic nuclear agreement, the United States. Wary of running afoul of new sanctions imposed by Washington over Iran\u2019s missile program and accusations that Iran sponsors terrorism, European banks are refusing to finance any of the deals, effectively perpetuating Iran\u2019s isolation from the global financial system.Europeans also point to new American visa regulations that make it more difficult for them to enter the United States if they have traveled to Iran. Those financial and travel restrictions, they say, make it nearly impossible to reach agreements with their Iranian counterparts.The hurdles set up by the United States, Europeans say, are also infuriating the Iranian leadership and undermining what they understood to be one of the main goals of the nuclear deal, which was to draw Iran out of its international isolation.From the Iranian perspective, the American obstacles are jeopardizing the fulfillment of the nuclear agreement and empowering the country\u2019s hard-liners. \u201cThe question is, now that the nuclear sanctions are lifted, what status quo will emerge when it comes to doing business with Iran?\u201d said Cyrus Razzaghi, the chief executive officer of Ara Enterprise, a Tehran-based consultancy. \u201cNow everything is ambiguous. If the situation doesn\u2019t change for the better \u2014 banking, more deals \u2014 for Iran this will be a growing risk for the deal.\u201dThe financial obstacles are bad news for Iran\u2019s moderate president, Hassan Rouhani, who ran for office on promises of an economic revival fueled by the nuclear deal and the lifting of sanctions. Hard-liners have pointed to the financial complications as evidence that the United States can never be trusted, and that Mr. Rouhani has been deceived into making unreciprocated concessions.Indeed, American officials have discounted talk of an Iranian windfall. On Monday, Secretary of State John Kerry told the Jewish lobbying group J Street in Washington that Iran had so far received only $3 billion after the nuclear deal, far less than what some Republican critics of the deal claimed were $150 billion in frozen assets. \u201cWe thought it would be $55 billion, but guess what,\u201d Mr. Kerry said, holding up three fingers.United States officials say \u2014 and most European experts agree \u2014 that it is not only the sanctions that are blocking Iran\u2019s access to the American financial system but also Iran\u2019s failure during its years of isolation to update laws governing money laundering and prohibitions against the financing of terrorism.European oil companies, whose capital and expertise Iran desperately needs to revitalize its flagging oil industry, are not making any deals until the Treasury provides clarity over the use of dollars for sales of Iranian oil, diplomats and industry insiders say.But European banks will still have to contend with American regulatory requirements. According to a financial disclosure law, all banks worldwide have to disclose whether their customers are American citizens, to prevent tax evasion. If they fail to do so the banks\u2019 assets can be seized.Several million people hold dual Iranian and American citizenship. Because the Iranian government is reluctant to allow information about its citizens to be shared with the United States, experts say, it is unlikely that it will comply with the act \u2014 another complication for European banks.The United States first imposed sanctions against Iran during the 1979 hostage crisis, focusing over the years primarily on disrupting its ability to connect to international financing networks. As a result, no foreign credit or debit cards work in Iran, forcing visitors to carry large amounts of cash. Selected European banks were once allowed by the Treasury to use dollars in their dealings with Iran. That ended with the nuclear sanctions.Europe never imposed any trade restrictions on Iran. Until 2006, Germany was its biggest trading partner, and there were dozens of flights between Europe and Iran. Iranian oil was refined in the Dutch port of Rotterdam. The European oil giants Royal Dutch Shell and Total were engaged in huge oil projects.When the European Union joined the American effort to press Iran to halt its nuclear program, the bloc\u2019s main action was to impose a boycott on Iranian crude. European banks, oil companies and producers subsequently abandoned the country after increasingly tough sanctions imposed by the Obama administration.Despite the obstacles, European officials say they are determined to clear a path for restored commercial relations. \u201cWe used to be Iran\u2019s first partner in the field of economy, trade, investment,\u201d Ms. Mogherini told the Tasnim News Agency on Tuesday. \u201cWe want to return to those days.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Patricio Aylwin, President Who Guided Chile to Democracy, Dies at 97", "Date": "2016-04-19", "News": "Supported byPatricio Aylwin, the former president of Chile whose election in 1989 put an end to the long dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, and who set up a commission that exposed the government\u2019s brutalities, died on Tuesday at his home in Santiago. He was 97.His family confirmed his death.Mr. Aylwin (pronounced ELL-win), the leader of the centrist Christian Democratic Party for more than half a century, was the first elected civilian after General Pinochet\u2019s 17-year rule.A mild-mannered lawyer, he initially seemed no match for the gruff General Pinochet, who remained the army commander in chief. But Mr. Aylwin went on to hold together a coalition of 17 moderate and left-wing parties, maintained the high economic growth rate he had inherited from the Pinochet years, distributed income and social benefits that helped reduce poverty levels and \u2014 perhaps his greatest accomplishment \u2014 established a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to collect testimony on human rights abuses under General Pinochet.The negotiated terms of the transition to civilian rule had placed severe limitations on Mr. Aylwin\u2019s government. They included keeping General Pinochet\u2019s authoritarian 1980 Constitution in place, albeit with revisions, allowing the former dictator to remain head of the army for eight years and later to take a seat in the Senate for life.Mr. Aylwin was under pressure to reverse General Pinochet\u2019s policies and bring those responsible for human rights crimes to justice. But he met resistance from the army, which still exerted influence over the nascent democratic institutions and made constant threats, and from an obstructionist new Congress, which skewed to the right because of an electoral system that favored General Pinochet\u2019s allies.Nevertheless, Mr. Aylwin pushed ahead with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, acting against the advice of some of his ministers, who feared further straining the relationship with the military.Years later, the Aylwin model inspired similar commissions in South Africa and other countries with long legacies of human rights abuses.Patricio Aylwin Az\u00f3car was born on Nov. 26, 1918, in Vi\u00f1a del Mar, a Pacific beach resort west of Santiago, the Chilean capital. Although largely of Spanish Basque heritage, he owed his last name to a Welsh ancestor who immigrated to Chile in the 19th century. His father was a Chilean Supreme Court president.Like his father, Mr. Aylwin became a lawyer, graduating from the University of Chile Law School in 1943. After years of successful practice, he gravitated toward politics and was elected to the Senate in 1965 on the Christian Democratic ticket. He was elected president of the party seven times.In 1970, Chile was plunged into political turmoil with the election of Salvador Allende Gossens, the Socialist head of a Marxist coalition, as president. He received slightly more than a third of the popular vote after the two other major party candidates split the remaining ballots.Under President Allende, hundreds of companies were expropriated, the copper industry was nationalized, and an extensive program of agrarian reforms redistributed lands among the poor. But government overspending on social programs and American-orchestrated economic strangulation led to food scarcity and hyperinflation, leaving Chile bitterly divided between left-wing and right-wing camps. The rightists ultimately asked the armed forces to intervene.On Sept. 11, 1973, General Pinochet and three other military junta members began a bloody coup, with the Air Force bombing the presidential palace. Mr. Allende committed suicide during the assault.Along with most Christian Democrats, Mr. Aylwin publicly endorsed the military regime. But as it became increasingly repressive, and after General Pinochet announced his intention to remain in office indefinitely, Mr. Aylwin, like other centrists, became an opponent. He eventually emerged as a leader of the center-left and moderate opposition, though he had been anathema to many leftists because of his early support for the dictatorship.General Pinochet, confident that his high-growth economic policies had gained him public support, sought to extend his rule by eight years through a plebiscite sanctioned under his Constitution. But the opposition leaders coordinated a campaign that led to a resounding popular rejection of General Pinochet\u2019s proposal and forced him to call democratic elections for president and Congress the next year.On Dec. 14, 1989, Mr. Aylwin, then 71, won the presidency with 55.2 percent of the vote, easily defeating General Pinochet\u2019s handpicked candidate and former finance minister, Hern\u00e1n B\u00fcchi, as well as another right-wing candidate, Francisco Javier Err\u00e1zuriz, a businessman.\u201cChile doesn\u2019t want violence or war; it wants peace,\u201d Mr. Aylwin declared on taking office on March 11, 1990.With the return of civilian government, Chile ended its diplomatic isolation from the rest of the world. Foreign capital poured into the country, especially to exploit its rich copper mines, and domestic investment further expanded an economy that benefited from the balanced budgets, low inflation and strong private-sector bias of the Pinochet era.Still, the general did not hesitate to rattle his saber as army commander when government policy displeased him. The tensest moment was in December 1990, amid calls for his resignation in the wake of a corruption scandal involving his son, also named Augusto Pinochet. As a show of force, General Pinochet ordered troops confined to their barracks. A second attempt to investigate his son\u2019s shady deals provoked another threatening response by the military.Mr. Aylwin struggled to control the armed forces while promising \u201cjustice insofar as it is possible,\u201d a phrase that human rights groups considered to be synonymous with impunity. Although Mr. Aylwin gave the courts information on the human rights abuses laid out by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, years passed before judicial investigations led to any convictions.Mr. Aylwin also pushed the army high command to weed out hundreds of agents of the C.N.I., General Pinochet\u2019s repressive secret intelligence agency, who were still active in the army.Mr. Aylwin, who was limited to one term as president by the Chilean Constitution, left office in 1994. But he remained one of the most admired political figures in Chile, gaining status as the leading elder statesman.He is survived by his wife, Leonor Oyarz\u00fan, whom he married in 1948; two daughters, Isabel and Mariana; three sons, Miguel, Jos\u00e9 Antonio and Juan Francisco; 15 grandchildren; and 11 great-grandchildren.\u201cChile has lost a great democrat,\u201d President Michelle Bachelet said, \u201ca man who always knew how to place the unity of democrats above their differences, which helped him build a democratic country.\u201dShe declared three days of national mourning.Jonathan Kandell reported from New York, and Pascale Bonnefoy from Santiago, Chile.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Victor in Mayoral Primary Is Ready to \u2018Get Baltimore Working\u2019", "Date": "2016-04-27", "News": "Supported byOn Wednesday \u2014 precisely one year after the unrest \u2014 Baltimore woke up to the news that Ms. Pugh was its presumptive next mayor. She won a narrow victory Tuesday night in a crowded field to become the Democratic nominee, which in heavily Democratic Baltimore is tantamount to winning in November.\u201cNobody gave this campaign a chance,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Pugh told a racially mixed crowd of supporters at her victory party Tuesday night, calling the win \u201ca milestone\u201d for herself and for the city.But the challenges she faces, in a majority African-American city torn by the wrenching national debate over race and policing, were immediately clear.In a city where many longed for a fresh face in the mayor\u2019s office, Ms. Pugh, 66, who has been in politics here for nearly two decades, is certainly not that.Arrayed on stage behind her at Tuesday\u2019s victory party were some of the city\u2019s biggest establishment figures, including Representative Elijah E. Cummings, a powerful Democrat, and Billy Murphy, the lawyer for the family of Mr. Gray. Yet Ms. Pugh was also joined by some not-so-establishment figures, among them Kwame Rose, a 21-year-old hip-hop artist, writer and activist who voted for the first time, escorted to the polls by Ms. Pugh, on Tuesday.\u201cI think it\u2019s easier to have the conversations about race and race relations,\u201d Ms. Pugh said in an interview Tuesday, summing up what she views as the changes in the city over the last year. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to have the conversations about being more inclusive. It\u2019s easier to have the conversations about how important it is to lift the least of us while we lift all of us.\u201dNow Ms. Pugh and Baltimore are going to have a different conversation about how to move the city forward after a painful, tumultuous year. Asked her top priority, she had three words: \u201cGet Baltimore working.\u201dIn West Baltimore on Wednesday, demonstrators marked the anniversary of the unrest with speeches and song at an all-day rally in front of the CVS pharmacy that was looted and burned last year. Many were not Pugh backers; their despair was palpable.\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t trust politicians; we vote for politicians promising us stuff and they never keep their word,\u2019\u2019 said Dante Bradley, a 26-year-old chef, cradling his 4-year-old daughter. He has been reading Malcolm X and other black writers. He did not vote on Tuesday, he said, but if he had, he would have cast his ballot for another candidate: City Councilman Carl Stokes.People in Baltimore have no illusions about the hard work ahead. The city has deep systemic problems that fueled last spring\u2019s unrest \u2014 and that predate it by decades. Unemployment, particularly among young black men, is high. Crime has spiraled out of control; last year, Baltimore, with roughly 623,000 people, had about as many murders as New York, with a population of 8.4 million. (There were three murders in Baltimore last weekend alone.) Thousands of abandoned and dilapidated rowhouses line city streets.\u201cTo assume that whomever you elect mayor is going to wave a magic wand and change that dynamic \u2014 that\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d said Courtney Billups, 47, a lawyer who recently moved here from Maryland\u2019s Eastern Shore, where he spent four years in public office as a county commissioner elected as a Democrat.\u201cI know the neighborhoods where unemployment is the highest,\u201d she said. \u201cI understand that we have 77,000 people unemployed in this city.\u201dIf she wins in November as expected, Ms. Pugh will succeed Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, once a rising star among national Democrats who fell out of favor at home after the unrest over the Freddie Gray case. Ms. Pugh, 20 years her senior, lost the Democratic nomination for mayor to Ms. Rawlings-Blake in 2011 (the city then had odd-year elections), coming in second in a five-way race. Ms. Pugh is in her third term in the Maryland Senate, where she is the majority leader.A public relations executive and children\u2019s book author who helped found the Baltimore Marathon and an African-American newspaper, Ms. Pugh, a native of Pennsylvania, has a master\u2019s degree in business administration from Morgan State University here. In Annapolis this year, she won plaudits for leading a push \u2014 with some success \u2014 for broad changes in the way police officers are trained and suspected police misconduct is investigated.Her campaign fliers bore the slogan \u201cHonest, Trustworthy, Unquestioned Integrity.\u2019\u2019 But some of Ms. Pugh\u2019s opponents attacked her for soliciting campaign contributions from lobbyists appearing before her on legislative business; The Baltimore Sun, which endorsed her, editorialized that the move \u2018\u2018may follow the letter of Maryland\u2019s campaign finance law but not its spirit.\u2019\u2019Asked about that, Ms. Pugh grew testy, saying of her rivals: \u201cThey threw dirt because they wanted to win a race.\u2019\u2019She also flashed some sharp elbows. When Jayne Miller, a television reporter with WBAL here, asked Ms. Pugh if there would be room for Ms. Dixon in City Hall, she replied tartly, \u201cNot in my administration,\u201d adding, \u201cI\u2019m going to be looking for the best and the brightest.\u201dBeyond her professional r\u00e9sum\u00e9, and her on-air clash with Mr. Rivera, one thing Ms. Pugh is known for in Baltimore is her impeccable attire.She said her love of fashion came from her mother: \u201cMy mother always used to say to us that we should dress as though we\u2019re in charge.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Revelation on Brussels Attackers Fuels Fears of New Assaults", "Date": "2016-04-10", "News": "Supported byBRUSSELS \u2014 The announcement on Sunday that the plotters of last month\u2019s Brussels terror attacks had originally intended to hit Paris again only heightened the concern among police and intelligence agencies that shadowy Islamic State networks could unleash new attacks at any time, not only in France and Belgium but in other European capitals.As intelligence experts and officials took stock of what they have learned since the Nov. 13 assaults in and around Paris, which killed 130 people, several things have come into focus. The scale of the Islamic State\u2019s operations in Europe are still not known, but they appear to be larger and more layered than investigators at first realized; if the Paris and Brussels attacks are any model, the plotters will rely on local criminal networks in addition to committed extremists.Even as the United States, its allies and Russia have killed leaders of the Islamic State, and have rolled back some of the extremist organization\u2019s gains on the battlefields of Iraq and Syria, the Islamic State appears to be posing a largely hidden and lethal threat across much of Europe.When Belgian prosecutors announced that Mohamed Abrini, one of the men arrested on Friday, had confessed to being the mysterious third man in the Brussels Airport bombing, it seemed to mark a rare victory for Belgian law enforcement, which has struggled to track down extremists. But it also was a reminder of the ease with which the Islamic State\u2019s operatives move across borders and the shifting roles that suspects play: According to prosecutors, Mr. Abrini was a logistician in the Paris attacks but was meant to be a bomber in the Brussels attack \u2014 except that his bomb failed to explode.There are almost certainly similar cells that are active in non-French-speaking countries and that have not yet surfaced. Britain, Germany and Italy are thought to be high on the list of Islamic State targets.It adds up to a long road ahead in Europe for law enforcement and intelligence agencies but also for citizens who are having to learn to adapt to an array of new security precautions and more intrusive surveillance, especially in public places.\u201cWe are not finished yet with the job of finding everyone who is in this big network of Paris and Brussels,\u201d said Jean-Charles Brisard, the head of the French Center for the Analysis of Terrorism in Paris. \u201cEvery time progress is made, we add another few people to the list of people we are looking for.\u201dIt is sobering to look at the number of people believed to have some connection to the Paris and Brussels attacks: 36 are suspected of being active participants to varying degrees in organizing or carrying them out. Of those, 13 are dead, and most of the rest are in custody. A handful have been released but are subject to conditions, like daily check-ins at a police station.At least two of the attackers are believed to have had roles in both plots.Others are probably lying low or on the run. What worries investigators is that many of the participants in the Paris-Brussels network were recruited by a preacher in the Brussels district of Molenbeek, Khalid Zerkani. He was tried twice in Belgium, accused of recruiting more than 50 young men to join the fight in Syria and helping to finance their journey to the Middle East. Many of those recruits were also named in those trials and tried in absentia.\u201cThere are still many people involved who were part of the Zerkani network, who were convicted in absentia \u2014 at least five to 10 \u2014 and we don\u2019t know where they are or what they might do,\u201d Mr. Brisard said.While they could turn out to be minor players, they could also emerge as able organizers of new assaults. Among Mr. Zerkani\u2019s recruits, prosecutors say, were Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the on-the-ground commander of the Paris attacks, and Reda Kriket, who was arrested on March 24 in a suburb of Paris. Mr. Kriket has been accused of being in the final stages of planning an attack in France involving \u201can arsenal of weapons and explosives of an unprecedented size,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Molins, the Paris prosecutor.From the ammunition and material found it appears that a highly lethal attack was averted. Mr. Kriket had Kalashnikov assault rifles, a submachine gun, pistols, ammunition and four boxes containing thousands of small steel balls.Four men in touch with Mr. Kriket, who were arrested in Rotterdam in the Netherlands, had in their possession 45 kilograms of ammunition, according to the Dutch Public Broadcaster, NOS. That is enough ammunition for 2,500 rounds, which is enough to supply as many as a dozen gunmen with multiple magazines.Mr. Kriket\u2019s connection to the Paris and Brussels cells that carried out the attacks in those cities was not clear, and experts have differing views, but it raises the possibility that there are other, similar cells in France and Belgium as well as farther afield.\u201cThe cells are kept quite separate,\u201d said Claude Moniquet, a former French intelligence officer who now works in Belgium.He added that so far investigators had not learned much about Mr. Kriket either from Salah Abdeslam, who prosecutors say was the only one of the 10 men directly involved in the Paris attacks to survive, or from Mr. Abrini, who was arrested on Friday and is accused of being involved in the logistics for the Paris attacks. Prosecutors say Mr. Abrini has also acknowledged accompanying the two suicide bombers at the Brussels airport.Western intelligence and counterterrorism officials say their working assumption is that there are Islamic State networks in two or more European countries in addition to those in France and Belgium.\u201cOther Islamic State cells are highly likely to be in existence across Western Europe, preparing and organizing further operations, and awaiting direction from the group\u2019s central leadership to execute,\u201d said Matthew Henman, the head of IHS Jane\u2019s Terrorism and Insurgency Center in London.\u201cA key area of focus is gaining a better understanding of how these cells are structured and their organizational and operational methods,\u201d he said.Mr. Henman, reflecting the views of half a dozen intelligence, counterterrorism and military officials interviewed in Europe last week, said the authorities\u2019 working assumption of how the Islamic State structures its external operations in Europe might be shifting.Officials believed that the Islamic State had developed an overarching network of facilitators in Europe over the last few years to buy weapons, rent cars and reserve hotel rooms for teams of operatives who had previously traveled to, or were returning from, Iraq or Syria.But after Brussels, Mr. Henman said, the thinking now reflects the belief that the operation may instead be made up of self-contained cells, with individuals who can perform multiple jobs as needed.The British authorities are on alert, and the threat level in Britain remains at \u201csevere,\u201d meaning that an attack is \u201chighly likely.\u201dThe Islamic State\u2019s threats are in some ways easier to fulfill in France and Belgium than elsewhere because of the large number of French-speaking foreign fighters, many of whom are European citizens from those countries.Of the foreign fighters in Syria and Iraq, an estimated 5,000 to 6,000 are from Europe. About 1,800 people have left or tried to leave France to fight in Syria and Iraq, according to recent statements by Bernard Cazeneuve, the French interior minister. An additional 450 have gone to those countries from Belgium, according to estimates by analysts in Europe.The announcement on Sunday that the Islamic State had aimed to strike France again came from the Belgian federal prosecutor\u2019s office. \u201cNumerous elements in the investigation have shown that the terrorist group initially had the intention to strike in France again,\u201d the office said in a statement.\u201cEventually, surprised by the speed of the progress in the ongoing investigation, they urgently took the decision to strike in Brussels,\u201d the statement said.In the attacks in the two capitals, a total of 162 people died and 753 were wounded.Alissa J. Rubin reported from Brussels, and Eric Schmitt from London and Naples, Italy. Aurelien Breeden contributed reporting from Paris, and C.J. Chivers from the United States.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In a Big Hole for a Detroit House, but Happy", "Date": "2016-04-22", "News": "Supported byYour Money7 PhotosDETROIT \u2014 Many residents of high-cost areas entertain the dream, at least occasionally: Give up the rent or mortgage grind, liquidate assets and start over someplace cheaper, perhaps one that could use a few spirited new residents.Amy Haimerl and her husband, Karl Kaebnick, fell hard for Detroit and thought they could make their own dream of financial freedom come true when they moved here in 2013. But this is what happened: They put more than $400,000 (including all of their retirement savings) into a 3,000-square-foot, 102-year-old home in the city\u2019s West Village neighborhood that was most recently appraised at just $300,000.They claim, however, to be 100 percent satisfied and genuinely happy. Which raises a question: Are they insane?So let\u2019s start with those facts. Ms. Haimerl, who is 40, and Mr. Kaebnick, 44, had about $10,000 in liquid assets when they decided to move. They settled on a house on a block where only two homes were boarded up.They bought the smaller one, a wreck with no wires or radiators or doors or pipes, for $35,000, liquidating Ms. Haimerl\u2019s retirement account to close without a mortgage. \u201cThere is essentially nothing left inside the walls,\u201d she writes in her book. \u201cWhat we have is a pile of bricks with character.\u201dFor the renovation, they were counting on the $110,000 that would be left from Mr. Kaebnick\u2019s accounts. The previous owners had figured it would take $150,000 or so to make it habitable. What could go wrong?Well, the couple was missing two crucial bits of knowledge, one about the Detroit market and the other about themselves.First, they realized only after they had bought the house that there were no construction loans available. That was because there wasn\u2019t any evidence that after renovation, homes like theirs would be worth more than what it would cost to fix them. So whatever work the couple wanted to do, they would have to pay for it themselves. Then, they could try to get a mortgage after the work was done and take out cash to repay any other debts they incurred along the way.And it turned out that there were a lot of those debts, in part because the couple misjudged the amount of work they would need and want to do. They started by looking at options for doing just $100,000 of work, but that might have forced them to move in without any water. The only contractor who made them feel comfortable figured it would take $300,000.He went to work, and they ended up spending $400,000 total, not including the purchase price. You\u2019ve heard versions of this story before, but the specifics here involved a balcony from a crumbling church that made incredible wainscoting but begged for matching custom woodwork and installation that eventually cost $65,000.So they borrowed $75,000 from Ms. Haimerl\u2019s father and $40,000 from her grandparents and aunt. Mr. Kaebnick\u2019s family chipped in with kitchen appliances in lieu of a wedding or a gift, and the rest came from a $25,000 Lending Club loan, $50,000 in USAA personal loans and some credit card debt.The result is by no means extravagant, though it is a lot of space for two people with no designs on having children. The interior trim is bare, and the house still needs paint in many rooms. It\u2019s missing a porch, and the garage out back is crumbling.On paper, Ms. Haimerl is about the last person you would expect to go all in like this. She grew up poor and lost a house to a foreclosure in Denver several years ago, when a previous relationship disintegrated. She has even worked as a personal finance editor.The money scold in me believes she should have known better, but she believes she knows plenty. \u201cAs a contractor\u2019s daughter, I grew up with men who want to do it right,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t skimp on work now because you pay for it later.\u201d So they shored up the roof and rebuilt the rear of the structure.Then, there is her take on retirement. Her father had $75,000 to lend to her because he had been forced to liquidate a once-thriving business that he built after the family\u2019s earlier lean years. \u201cI never grew up with any idea that there would be retirement,\u201d she said. \u201cYou were trying not to go to a payday lender. My dad\u2019s retirement was supposed to be the business.\u201dMs. Haimerl is a writer and Mr. Kaebnick is a computer programmer, and perhaps they can work well into their 70s or 80s. In the meantime, their net worth is negative. They did get a mortgage after the work was done, and the appraiser assigned the $300,000 value to their home, a triumph in their neighborhood at the time.\u201cI\u2019m confident other contractors would not have made the same call,\u201d Mr. Garfield said. \u201cBut I do think everyone we have done business with has become a friend, and in that mix of things, this seemed to be the right thing to do.\u201dBut how best to explain away their lack of retirement savings? Plenty of people who sank their life savings into real estate in less desirable parts of Brooklyn or San Francisco a decade or two ago are probably thrilled.So is that how they think about the money they have put into their Detroit dream? That they bet on a city instead of a bunch of stocks? \u201cWe have gotten gun-shy about talking that way,\u201d Ms. Haimerl said. \u201cPeople here say, \u2018How dare you treat our city like an investment.\u2019\u201dMr. Kaebnick said he understood the sentiment. \u201cSo many people who stuck it out here for so long never had anything to show for it,\u201d he said. \u201cTo them, we might come across as privileged newcomers who are going to ride it to the bank.\u201dIn the meantime, Ms. Haimerl and Mr. Kaebnick have not found financial freedom in Detroit, though they insist that they are so much richer for having moved. In a poignant moment early in her book, Ms. Haimerl describes gazing longingly into a window in a newly gentrified Denver neighborhood, before her dream of homeownership there turned into a nightmare. The living room looked like luxury, a place where the residents weren\u2019t constantly hustling to hold things together.Aspiring homeowners in Detroit may well walk down her street someday soon, see her through the window and wonder how she had it so good. Would they be jealous? Should they be?\u201cI thought maybe that once you were inside the window, you didn\u2019t have to hustle,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the truth is, we\u2019re all hustling.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the surname of the contractor hired by Amy Haimerl and Karl Kaebnick for their home in Detroit. It is Calvin Garfield, not Maxwell.Advertisement"}

Asks for Removal of \u2018Too Big to Fail\u2019 Label From GE Capital", "Date": "2016-03-31", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 General Electric has asked regulators to lift the \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d label on GE Capital, saying in a filing on Thursday that its finance arm had shrunk to the point where it no longer met the definition.If successful, GE Capital would be the first financial institution to lose its designation with help from regulators, though the road map for how that process would work is not immediately clear.The Financial Stability Oversight Council, a regulatory body created by the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul and led by the Treasury secretary, is responsible for analyzing and designating companies that could take down the banking system in the event of another crisis.The Treasury Department, which leads the regulatory council, said in a statement that the council \u201cwelcomes the opportunity to evaluate developments at any designated nonbank financial company and their potential effect on financial stability.\u201dIt said the council re-examines each of the designations every year and \u201cevaluates whether any changes at the company, or in its regulation or markets, justify a rescission of the designation.\u201cBefore the financial crisis, some of the largest, riskiest nonbank financial companies were not subject to adequate oversight,\u201d the Treasury noted.General Electric filed a \u201crequest for rescission\u201d on Thursday, which states that GE Capital \u201chas substantially reduced its risk profile and is significantly less interconnected to the financial system, and therefore does not pose any conceivable threat to U.S. financial stability.\u201dGE Capital recently received approval to sell its deposit business in the United States to Goldman Sachs. Total assets have shrunk 52 percent, to $265 billion from $549 billion in 2012.Its consumer finance arm, now called Synchrony Financial, was spun off last year. In addition, GE Capital has restructured as a holding company owned entirely by General Electric, with American and British subsidiaries.The company\u2019s remaining businesses \u201cdo not provide a critical function to the economy that could not easily be supported by other entities,\u201d according to the release.At an investor meeting in December, Jeffrey R. Immelt, the chief executive of General Electric, was asked about the prospects for GE Capital once the systemically important designation was removed.\u201cLet\u2019s go through the de-designation process; let\u2019s see how the world is working as it pertains to financial services and things like that,\u201d Mr. Immelt said, adding that he thought the shift in investors\u2019 minds would be \u201cIs it as really as much today about how we use it to position our industrial growth as it is necessarily freestanding.\u201dShares of General Electric ended nearly flat in trading on Thursday.A day earlier, MetLife, the country\u2019s biggest life insurer, won a major battle in court against the government, overturning its own \u201csystemically important\u201d designation.Judge Rosemary M. Collyer of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia said in her order that she had upheld arguments that regulators failed to adequately assess MetLife\u2019s vulnerability to extreme financial distress and the potential economic impact of the designation.The Treasury Department has said it is disappointed with the decision, but it has not yet said whether it will appeal. The judge\u2019s full opinion is under seal.The American International Group and Prudential Financial are the other two nonbanks that were given the \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d label.Appearing on CNBC on Thursday, Peter Hancock, the chief executive of A.I.G., said his company would watch the progress of the MetLife decision if it is appealed.

She has tracked down his other works from the early 1900s, including roomfuls of furniture carved for American industrialists. He rarely signed his chairs, chests, tables and panels, which he decorated with vines, fruit, medieval knights, Gothic pointed arches, Celtic knots and Norse monsters.Ms. Hogan also uncovered biographical details that von Rydingsvard apparently tried to hide when he was alive. Although his parents technically belonged to the nobility, they inherited no land or fortune. Born in 1863, he grew up in a hamlet on the west coast of Sweden,where his family farmed, tended the grounds of a cemetery and ran a country store. As a teenager, von Rydingsvard (pronounced REE-dings-vehrd) made his way to Stockholm and then New York and Boston, working at furniture factories. By the 1890s he had brought most of his relatives to the United States and married Anna Davis, a linguist and historian from Boston who was a descendant of Magna Carta signers and 17th-century New England settlers.He apparently exaggerated the loftiness of his inherited titles. His wife erroneously called herself Baroness von Rydingsvard. After her mistake was exposed in the press, she sued for divorce, but von Rydingsvard weathered the scandal. \u201cHe must have been incredibly charismatic,\u201d Ms. Hogan said.He set up schools for female carvers in Manhattan and Brunswick, Me., and taught at institutions including Columbia University, the Rhode Island School of Design and the school at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. By the 1930s, he had largely retired to Maine with his second wife, Ida, also a woodcarver.Ms. Hogan said she hoped that more von Rydingsvard artifacts would surface. \u201cWe want to keep this conversation going,\u201d she said.Jay Belloli, the show\u2019s curator and vice president of the Falkenstein Foundation, said that each of the artist\u2019s metal artworks includes hundreds of meticulous welds, although \u201cthey look like they just happened\u201d on the fly.Halley K. Harrisburg, director of the Michael Rosenfeld Gallery, said that treasures in the inventory are still being unearthed, and that research is underway on how Ms. Falkenstein fashioned and displayed her pieces. \u201cNo one iconic image summarizes her work,\u201d Ms. Harrisburg said.In the early 1900s American philanthropists vied for Renaissance tapestries, seeking to add touches of aristocratic taste to new museum galleries. After decades of neglect, such textiles are being retrieved from storage, refurbished and put on display, in some cases alongside texts analyzing the tastes of their past owners.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chicago State, a Lifeline for Poor Blacks, Is Under Threat Itself", "Date": "2016-04-09", "News": "Supported byCHICAGO \u2014 The lack of a state budget in Illinois has been dismissed by many here as politics as usual, another protracted ego contest between the Republican governor and the Democrats who rule the Legislature.It does not feel that way at Chicago State University, a 150-year-old, predominantly African-American school on the city\u2019s far South Side.Since last July, when the fiscal year began, the university has received zero dollars from the state, though it relies on Illinois for 30 percent of its $105 million budget. If no one swoops in with a rescue plan, the school could shut down, stranding students mid-degree, eliminating hundreds of jobs and shuttering a path forward for a poor and underserved community.In February, the school declared a financial emergency. Officials canceled spring break and moved commencement up to April 28, rushing to finish the semester before funding goes dry. Last month, members of the faculty and staff were notified that the school was making contingency plans to collect their keys. Reserve funds to pay employees will run out after April 30.\u201cPeople are losing their minds,\u201d said Barbara Ameyedowo, 28, a math major who is expecting to graduate in December. \u201cStudents are leaving. I\u2019m hopeful that it will be resolved, but I\u2019m so sad. Chicago State is all this part of the South Side has left.\u201d\u2019Governors and legislatures around the country have made deep cuts to state universities in recent years, leaving the smallest and least prestigious schools financially stressed, as tuition is hardly adequate to sustain many institutions. In Illinois, the absence of a budget means there has been no state financing, straining state universities and prompting some to furlough and lay off employees.None, though, are in the dire predicament of Chicago State. Many, including the flagship University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, have healthy endowments or affluent alumni bases to lean on. Like some other predominantly minority institutions, Chicago State has neither.\u201cWe are absolutely in financial disaster,\u201d Thomas J. Calhoun Jr., the university president, said in an interview on Wednesday. \u201cWhat do you do when your state just zips up the pocketbook and doesn\u2019t give you anything?\u201dThe crisis has left many of the 4,500 students at Chicago State, the vast majority of whom are black and from low-income backgrounds, shaken and angry: Why are they, rather than their peers at more elite state universities, at risk of becoming the first major casualties of the budget stalemate?\u201cIt\u2019s aimed at hurting minorities,\u201d Glenn Weston, 23, a junior who is studying accounting, said of the budget conflict. Though Chicago State University is not a member of the historically black colleges and universities system, he said, \u201cChicago State is like the H.B.C.U. of Chicago. Other schools here would never close.\u201dStudents are fearful that the school could shut down, leaving them with unfinished degrees and few options to transfer nearby.For many students, the university is a lifeline. Originally founded as a teachers\u2019 college during boom times in the 1860s, the small, austere campus of concrete plazas and low-slung brick buildings now occupies 160 acres of land deep on the South Side of Chicago. It is bordered by an expressway and a residential neighborhood that was once solidly middle-class but has been upended by poverty, gang violence and declining population. Streetlights are marked with dark green banners, the school color, stamped with the Chicago State logo.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of frustration in the community,\u201d said Phillip Beverly, a political-science professor at Chicago State, who grew up five blocks from the school and whose grandmother and wife are graduates. \u201cYou\u2019re closing off an avenue for people to change their lives.\u201dTuition and fees are low at about $12,000 a year, and close to 85 percent of the students qualify for Pell grants, federal aid for poor students.\u201cThis is one of the least expensive schools,\u201d said Melanie Ellis, the junior class president, 34. \u201cYou can pay $30,000 a year for U.I.C. or $10,000 a year for Chicago State,\u201d she said, referring to University of Illinois at Chicago. \u201cWhat do you choose?\u201dThe university attracts untypical college students. The average age is 31; close to half are mothers (70 percent of the student population are women, and most of them have at least one child); and the average ACT score is 18.6 out of 36, compared with the national average of 21.\u201cWe can\u2019t just go to another school,\u201d said Reiko Williamson, a senior who is studying nursing, as she left a class on a rainy afternoon. \u201cThis is all we have. This is all we can afford.\u201dTo save money, Chicago State, which has about $50 million in deferred maintenance, has cut about 15 percent of its work force in the last year, frozen all travel expenses and renegotiated contracts.But that has not been enough, and administrators say that they are waiting for elected officials in Springfield to pass a budget or approve an emergency infusion of cash \u2014 two reprieves that do not appear imminent.The roots of the crisis lie in a stalemate that began last June, when Mr. Rauner vetoed a budget plan sent to him from the Democratic-controlled Legislature that was out of balance by more than $3 billion. With no overall plan in place, he has addressed problems piecemeal \u2014 signing a bill to fund K-12 education, for instance. But he did not do the same for higher education, and in his budget plan last year, he proposed a 31 percent funding cut for universities and community colleges.Mr. Rauner recently called the potential closing of Chicago State \u201can outrage,\u201d but blamed Democratic lawmakers for the crisis. \u201cI believe that the supermajority in the Legislature is using Chicago State and many other service providers in Illinois as leverage to try to force a massive tax hike,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe that\u2019s what\u2019s going on, and that\u2019s wrong.\u201dOther government programs are also feeling the pressure: Social service agencies are cutting help for the poor and mentally ill, museums are closing and rural hospitals are scaling back services. But for many students, the convenience and accessibility of Chicago State has had a profound impact on their ability to earn a degree \u2014 people like Ms. Ellis, for instance, who said that if the school closes, she could lose all of the credits she has already earned in the nursing program, since she was told that they are not transferable.In the past, Chicago State has been plagued by problems of its own making: In 2011, an audit discovered rampant financial mismanagement, including a failure to bill students for their tuition for an entire semester in 2010. Mr. Calhoun, who took over as president several months ago, said he firmly believes those problems are in the past.State Senator Emil Jones III, a Democrat who attended Chicago State and whose family has raised money for the university in the past, said that he was pushing for a legislative solution.\u201cChicago State has been historically underfunded over the years,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen a crisis comes up and the funding stops, they will be the first to close.\u201dClifton Conrad, a professor of education at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said the situation at Chicago State foreshadows what many small universities could experience in the coming years, as state budgets contract and less money is designated for higher education.\u201cI fear this may have drastic implications,\u201d Professor Conrad said. \u201cYou have an institution, a public institution, that is so dependent on state funding. And now you have an ominous threat where students are now wondering, can they invest long term in this institution?\u201dOther universities in or near Chicago, including Governors State University and the private Roosevelt University, have offered to take in students who may be left stranded. Mr. Calhoun said that he hopes that will not become necessary. But, he said flatly, \u201cany institution, Chicago State included, that has expenses but no revenues, will eventually have to close.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Getting a Student Loan With Collateral From a Future Job", "Date": "2016-04-08", "News": "Supported byAt Purdue University, some undergraduates will have a new option to help finance their degrees: pledging to pay a percentage of their future incomes in return for funds today.Such programs are not loans. Instead, students get funds to cover current education expenses, and, in return, they agree to pay a percentage of their future income over an agreed-upon period of time. When that repayment term ends, so does the student\u2019s obligation, even if their total payments are less than the amount they received.Though an emerging corner of the educational finance industry, such programs help ease the often crushing debt many American college students face after graduation, proponents say. A small number of lenders have tested the model in recent years, but Purdue is the first American university to officially embrace the concept.\u201cIt looked to us like it was interesting enough that somebody ought to try it,\u201d said Mitch Daniels, the university president and a former governor of Indiana. \u201cFor some students, this may be a very preferable option to some of the private loans that are out there.\u201dA senior studying mechanical engineering, one of Purdue\u2019s most popular majors, could get $15,000 in return for a commitment to pay 4.23 percent of his or her income for a bit less than eight years. Purdue estimates that the engineer would have a starting salary of about $56,000, and will be making monthly payments of $200. In that hypothetical situation, the student would eventually repay a total of $20,647.But an English major can anticipate a starting salary of $34,000, by Purdue\u2019s calculation. For that student, the school would offer a different package, which might require a higher percentage of income over a longer period.The Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, the federal overseer that many view as the industry\u2019s likely regulator, said it was keeping an eye on the offerings.\u201cIt is important that consumers know up front the costs and risks of financial products,\u201d said Seth Frotman, the agency\u2019s student loan ombudsman. \u201cThis generally isn\u2019t the case for income-sharing agreements, which can create challenges for borrowers trying to navigate their repayment options.\u201dPaul Gu, one of Upstart\u2019s founders, said the income-sharing deals were \u201ca product that was almost equally unpopular among borrowers and investors.\u201d Lenders were reluctant to put money into contracts with such unpredictable returns, and borrowers struggled to figure out a fair price for their future labors. In the end, most preferred to stick with the borrowing option they better understood: traditional, interest-bearing loans.In the two years it offered income-sharing agreements, Upstart did 141 deals, totaling $2.7 million. Since changing models, it has originated loans of nearly $370 million for 27,000 borrowers.Only a few hundred students in the United States have received money through income-sharing arrangements, and there is no long-term data yet on the results, but some participants say they are happy with how their deal has worked out for them.He now works in Los Angeles on program development for an education nonprofit and pays Lumni $160 a month, about 4.5 percent of his income. His repayment term is 10 years.\u201cTo me, it\u2019s totally worth it, even if I end up paying triple or quadruple what they actually gave me,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have been able to go to Columbia if I didn\u2019t get that source of funding, and that experience was priceless to me.\u201dPurdue is holding information sessions for students this month to explain its Back a Boiler program, which was established by the Purdue Research Foundation. About 200 students have requested information and application forms, which the school will begin accepting in May, Mr. Daniels said.\u201cMaybe Purdue will be the Pied Piper,\u201d said Mr. Whelan of 13th Avenue Funding, who is trying to recruit partners and investors to expand his organization\u2019s financing. Mr. Daniels said he viewed his school\u2019s program as an experiment \u2014 and he\u2019s sanguine about the possibility that it will fail.\u201cIt may prove to be too novel, or other options may emerge that obviate the need, but that\u2019s for the students and their families to decide,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may or may not ever become a real phenomenon, but it certainly catches people\u2019s interest.\u201dMr. Jasiulek said he hoped more students would have the opportunity he did to take advantage of the unusual funding model \u2014 but even more than that, he wishes it were not necessary.\u201cLet\u2019s be real; it\u2019s sad that a thing like this has to exist,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy is school so expensive? I think our whole educational system is broken, and it\u2019s an exploitative situation, however you cut it.\u201dAn article on Saturday about a novel student loan program at Purdue University described the debt level of Purdue graduates incorrectly. The average graduate with debt emerges owing $28,000; that is not the debt level of average graduates over all.Advertisement"}

Their opponents, they say, are too close to the men who brought a new level of shame to Albany and too uncommitted to ethics reform.Mr. Kaminsky \u2014 who is Mel Brooks\u2019s great-nephew \u2014 may be finding that a relentless focus on corruption, despite its consistent ranking in the polls as a top voter concern, can go only so far.The Senate district has slightly more registered Democrats than Republicans, but has been in Republican hands for decades. A Siena College poll, released on Saturday, found that Mr. McGrath had opened up an eight-point lead.Democrats were confident that Mr. Kaminsky\u2019s background as a federal corruption prosecutor \u2014 he brought down another former State Senate majority leader, Pedro Espada Jr. \u2014 would make him \u201cthe right man for this moment,\u201d as Bill Lipton, the executive director of the left-leaning Working Families Party, which has contributed get-out-the-vote efforts to Mr. Kaminsky\u2019s campaign, put it.Mr. McGrath, by contrast, was a political unknown, a partner at the law firm Sullivan Papain Block McGrath & Cannavo who pledged to focus on bread-and-butter issues like education, and warned that with the Senate controlled by Democrats, Long Island would be in danger of losing school financing to New York City.The focus on education has set the stage for a line of attack that the Kaminsky campaign hopes will appeal to members of the hyper-engaged anti-testing parents\u2019 movement, which is deeply suspicious of the education reform movement.It remains to be seen whether Mr. Kaminsky\u2019s assertions of an under-the-table deal would be enough to counter the impact of the advertisements. (Scott Reif, a spokesman for the Senate Republicans, who regularly support charter school groups, denied that any such bargain was made, calling the allegation \u201cslanderous.\u201d)As Mr. Kaminsky has flayed Mr. McGrath for his reticence on ethics issues and his unwillingness to disavow Mr. Skelos, Mr. McGrath\u2019s campaign has gleefully recorded Mr. Kaminsky\u2019s every absence from Assembly sessions (\u201cBreak Out the Missing Milk Carton,\u201d one news release read). Mr. McGrath has said that he supports some ethics reforms, like term limits for legislators and stripping pensions from lawmakers convicted of a felony; Mr. Kaminsky\u2019s spokesman, Evan Thies, defended his attendance record as \u201cexcellent,\u201d noting that he had sponsored 16 bills that eventually passed, a freshman record.\u201cThere\u2019s two schools of thought here,\u201d said Steve Greenberg, a Siena College pollster who oversaw the survey. \u201cOne is, \u2018Oh my God, corruption\u2019s going to resonate here more than anywhere else,\u2019 because they\u2019ve just seen their state senator thrown into jail for corruption. The other school of thought is voters think, \u2018We got rid of the guy, we\u2019re going to have an election for a new person, what is that new person going to do for me?\u2019\u201dBut perhaps more important in a race that will depend heavily on turnout, Mr. McGrath has won the endorsements of many local unions, including some representing law enforcement, civil servants, health care workers and firefighters.In the Lower Manhattan race, Ms. Niou, the chief of staff to Assemblyman Ron Kim of Queens, is counting on the Working Families Party\u2019s support to help her overcome voters\u2019 historical indifference to special elections and the baked-in disadvantage of running as a third-party candidate in a reliably Democratic district.The Republican candidate, Lester Chang, a businessman, has also branded Ms. Cancel as a creature of Mr. Silver\u2019s political organization.Ms. Cancel, who works in the office of the city comptroller, Scott M. Stringer, has picked up endorsements from two local Democratic city councilwomen, Margaret Chin and Rosie Mendez, who have praised her deep roots in the district and her work on tenants\u2019 rights issues in public housing.Ms. Cancel is \u201cthe best one that can represent the district, \u2019cause she knows the district,\u201d Ms. Chin said in an interview.\u201cIf we\u2019re going to clean up Albany, we\u2019re going to have to do it one district at a time,\u201d he said, adding that there was \u201cno comparison\u201d between Ms. Niou and Ms. Cancel as candidates. \u201cThat\u2019s what this election\u2019s about, and it\u2019s appropriate that it starts in this election.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But she is expected to move swiftly to claim an early advantage against the leading Republican candidate, Donald J. Trump. Her advisers and allies say she will spend the coming weeks honing her message for the general election, and stepping up fund-raising that has lagged in the face of Mr. Sanders\u2019s challenge.\u201cWith your help, we\u2019re going to come back to Philadelphia for the Democratic National Convention with the most votes and the most pledged delegates,\u201d Mrs. Clinton told a crowd of 1,300 here after she took the stage to \u201cEye of the Tiger.\u201d \u201cAnd we will unify our party to win this election and build an America where we can all rise together.\u201dAfter a landslide win in New York last week, Mrs. Clinton had already begun to treat Mr. Sanders as a greatly diminished threat, concentrating her fire on Mr. Trump and, to a lesser degree, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. Her victories in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut and Delaware on Tuesday will only accelerate that shift.In recent days, she has sharpened her pitch about the general election\u2019s stakes, heading off Republican attacks on her record as secretary of state under President Obama and delivering a more forceful message about the economy and the need to create jobs and lift wages.\u201cImagine a tomorrow where hard work is honored, families are supported, streets are safe and communities are strong, and where love trumps hate,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said Tuesday night, drawing applause at her play on Mr. Trump\u2019s name.Mrs. Clinton is not expected to publicly pressure Mr. Sanders to quit the race. Clinton advisers say any efforts to muscle him out could backfire, angering his supporters and Mr. Sanders, both of which Mrs. Clinton praised Tuesday night \u201cfor challenging us to get unaccountable money out of our politics.\u201dBut a \u201csuper PAC\u201d supporting Mrs. Clinton\u2019s candidacy, Priorities USA Action, may start running general election ads even before the nominating contest ends.Guy Cecil, the group\u2019s chief strategist, said the group might run ads against Mr. Trump or Mr. Cruz, \u201cdepending on how the Republican primary develops and whether they decide to launch attacks against Hillary.\u201dIn coming weeks, Mrs. Clinton will campaign in states with looming primaries, but she will also recharge and spend time in New York plotting a general-election strategy with advisers.\u201cShe needs to be smart and calculated and prepare herself for a tough general election, and knowing her, she will be,\u201d said Thomas R. Nides, a friend and adviser who worked for Mrs. Clinton at the State Department.After months of focus on the 2,383 delegates needed for the Democratic Party nomination, her campaign has begun to analyze the Electoral College, working out potential races against Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz. And the campaign will begin polling in traditional battleground states like Ohio and Florida.But it will also pore over data in traditionally Republican states like Arizona, North Carolina and Georgia that could be in play, particularly if Mr. Trump is the nominee, and focus on demographics beyond the Democratic primary electorate.\u201cRealistically, the most important part in all of this are white working-class women,\u201d said Geoff Garin, a pollster and strategist on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign who is now advising Priorities, citing Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emphasis on issues like equal pay for women and an increase in the minimum wage.10 PhotosSenator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, who campaigned alongside Mrs. Clinton in his state, said she must focus on how best to connect to a broader electorate that is in what he called a \u201crevolutionary mood,\u201d alluding to how Mr. Sanders has energized supporters. \u201cYou are not going to win this general election by proposing incremental changes,\u201d Mr. Murphy said, adding that he hoped Mrs. Clinton \u201cdoesn\u2019t shy away from proposing some big ideas to try to reorder the country, to the benefit of those that are hurting.\u201dMr. Sanders\u2019s campaign vowed Tuesday to remain in the fight through the California primary on June 7, and perhaps until the party\u2019s convention in July. As word of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s victories rolled in on Tuesday night, he gave a defiant speech in West Virginia, predicting he would win the state when it votes May 10.Mrs. Clinton, who doggedly remained in the 2008 primary contest against Barack Obama until June despite his insurmountable delegate lead and Democratic calls for her to bow out, has said she will not call on Mr. Sanders to withdraw, but she has bristled at the implication that he could overcome her big leads in both pledged delegates and the popular vote.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s aides and allies are pressuring Mr. Sanders to run on issues rather than continuing to attack Mrs. Clinton\u2019s ties to Wall Street or her previous support for global trade deals \u2014 attacks that Republicans are likely to use in the fall.\u201cIf he tones down the rhetoric and continues to fight, he\u2019ll go out on a very high note with a lot of people, including me, thinking he did a great service to American democracy,\u201d said Edward G. Rendell, a former Pennsylvania governor, who supports Mrs. Clinton. \u201cBut if he keeps it up, it could be brutal.\u201dMr. Sanders, whose sole win on Tuesday came in Rhode Island, did not attack Mrs. Clinton directly in his remarks on Tuesday night, but argued insistently that he would be a superior general-election candidate. As voters went to the polls earlier in the day, the Sanders campaign sent out a fund-raising email with an image of Mrs. Clinton and her husband, Bill Clinton, at Mr. Trump\u2019s 2005 wedding, and accused Clinton allies of being \u201ctraitors\u201d in their treatment of Mr. Sanders.\u201cIf we are sitting here and there\u2019s no sort of mathematical way to do it, we will be upfront about that,\u201d he said.Democrats supporting Mrs. Clinton have pointed to Senators Harry Reid of Nevada, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Chuck Schumer of New York as potential peacemakers, should the Sanders campaign keep up its pointed attacks on Mrs. Clinton.\u201cI\u2019m going to be optimistic and say it won\u2019t be necessary, but all of us are friends with Bernie and we\u2019d pick up the phone and talk to him at any time,\u201d said Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri who is supporting Mrs. Clinton.But Mrs. Clinton would do well to begin \u201cbuilding bridges\u201d to Mr. Sanders, said David Axelrod, a former senior strategist for the Obama campaign.\u201cIt seems certain Bernie will run through the last primaries, which is inconvenient and costly,\u201d he said. \u201cStill, when you\u2019re the winner, you can afford to be big and Hillary should.\u201dAmy Chozick reported from Philadelphia, and Alexander Burns from New York.

{"Headline": "Grumbling About Socialism, the Yankees Profit From It", "Date": "2016-04-16", "News": "Supported bySports of The TimesSocialism wafts in the spring wind.That son of Brooklyn, Bernie Sanders, walks the streets of the city denouncing the lords of finance. And in the Bronx, Randy Levine, president of that Goldman Sachs of baseball franchises, the Yankees, holds forth on the unjustness of a more rarefied socialism.Levine says Major League Baseball\u2019s revenue-sharing agreement, which compels wonderfully wealthy franchises to give tens of millions of dollars to somewhat less-wealthy teams, is a too-blunt instrument of redistribution.\u201cWhat is very burdensome to us, and is unfair, is the amount of money we have to pay in revenue sharing compared, for example, to teams in our market that pay 10 times less than us,\u201d Mr. Levine told Ken Rosenthal of Fox Sports.Mr. Levine had in mind the Mets, and I can dig it. Thanks to the depredations of the Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff, the Wilpons once trembled. Baseball extended a secret $25 million loan, a comfort known only to the rich. Fans put up with years of bad and badly funded baseball.In possession now of rosy health and a pennant flag, the Mets contribute modestly to revenue sharing.Then again, the Yankees benefit from a different sort of socialism. Taxpayers spent nearly $1 billion subsidizing the ziggurat known as the new Yankee Stadium. And the Yankees pointedly decline to share their boodle with fans in the form of cheaper tickets.Richard Brodsky, a former member of the New York State Assembly, issued a stinging report several years ago, \u201cThe House That You Built.\u201d It examined the ways, hidden and not, by which the public subsidized the new stadium. (The Mets\u2019 owners, no pikers, received more than $500 million to build Citi Field.)Mr. Brodsky and his staff uncovered political gamesmanship and legerdemain, some of which pushed against the bounds of the legal. I asked him for a tutorial.\u201cRandy Levine was a leading socialist when it came to feeding at the public trough,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is a Bernie Sanders for the extremely rich.\u201dMr. Levine, who received his rhetorical training as deputy mayor for the temple-bursting Rudy Giuliani, did not hesitate to return serve in kind.\u201cRichard Brodsky has never had the slightest idea what the Yankee Stadium deal was about,\u201d he told me. \u201cHe is a blowhard.\u201dSo far, so schoolyard. Let\u2019s pause to examine the details of this stadium deal, in which New York, as in Milwaukee, Cleveland, Minnesota and so on across the United States, came gold-lined with public dollars for the private team owners.Mr. Levine opened our discussion with a big play.\u201cThere are no subsidies,\u201d he said.He folded that hand soon enough. According to the city\u2019s Independent Budget Office, the stadium received about $270 million in federal tax-exempt financing. There was an additional $58 million for the parking garages, which the Yankees don\u2019t own but from which they benefit.\u201cThe bonds don\u2019t cost the city or the state anything,\u201d Mr. Levine said. \u201cIt costs federal taxpayers all over the country.\u201dThat might not comfort a taxpaying plumber in Tulsa.The city and state gave the Yankees a $40 million sales tax exemption on their construction costs. Mr. Levine argues that the stadium now generates sales tax, which is true but is beside the point. Most women and men start businesses without government subsidies and pay sales tax.So we\u2019ll count that as a subsidy.The city allowed the Yankees to build atop a city park. In turn, the city built a handsome new park for the working-class residents near the stadium.Mr. Levine tossed down another that-ain\u2019t-no-subsidy soft-shoe.\u201cThe parks are a home run, a great use of public funds,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Metro-North station, people wanted that forever.\u201dThe Yankees could not simply steal a park \u2014 someone had to pay to replace it. And they wanted that train station. I am grading this test, and like the staff of the Independent Budget Office and Mr. Brodsky, I declare all of this a subsidy, good for about $380 million.Then there is a property-tax exemption and tax-exempt bonds, which saved the Yankees $400 million. Here the story deepens. Let\u2019s dispense with the obvious: This was a subsidy.\u201cThe City has determined to use its property taxes\u201d to \u201cfinance the construction and operation\u201d of the Stadium, the bond counsel for the Yankees wrote to the Internal Revenue Service in 2006.Now let\u2019s turn to Mr. Brodsky and the heart of his objections.The new stadium \u2014 which as of a few years ago produced 15 full-time jobs \u2014 almost certainly was ineligible for a city subsidy. So officials pretended the Yankees were at imminent threat to relocate to the New Jersey Meadowlands, or Newburgh or Troy, N.Y. This allowed the city to offer a retention subsidy. Mr. Brodsky inquired about this at his hearings.Which city official heard the Yankees say they might leave?\u201cI don\u2019t recall,\u201d replied Seth Pinsky, who was charged with overseeing this project.Did they tell anyone in your agency?\u201cThere may have been,\u201d Mr. Pinsky said. \u201cI don\u2019t recall.\u201dThe Yankees wanted to apply their property-tax money to paying off their low-rate, tax-exempt federal bonds, a tactic known as a payment in lieu of taxes. (In layman\u2019s terms, it is like building yourself a new house and persuading the city to let you send property taxes to your bank to pay off your mortgage).The Internal Revenue Service feared that such deals amounted to a legal raid on the federal treasury. So the I.R.S. demanded that officials prove that the bond payments really matched what the team would have paid in property taxes.That was no easy task. Most appraisals in the Bronx ran no higher than $36 a square foot. A nearby shopping mall, home to a Target and a Bed Bath & Beyond, was built on land appraised at $9 a square foot.The city sent its appraiser to Harlem, a hot real estate market. Voil\u00e0! According to Brodsky\u2019s report, the land under Yankee Stadium was valued at $204 million, or $275 a square foot. This fib allowed the Yankees to siphon their money into tax-exempt bonds, at a cost to taxpayers across the nation.The city and Bruce Ratner, a politically wired developer, reprised this shell game for Barclays Center in Brooklyn. Soon after, the I.R.S. ended the practice.All of which gets to what rubs Mr. Brodsky raw: ticket prices. How is it that we drove trucks up to the Stadium and dumped piles of cash and ended up with the second-highest baseball ticket prices in the nation?\u201cGovernment\u2019s client is the public and not the Yankees,\u201d Mr. Brodsky said. \u201cWhen the public subsidizes a stadium, there is a public interest in assuring that people can afford events.\u201dGood luck with that. Saturday\u2019s game against the Mariners and King Felix featured a few tickets in the $21-to-$35 range. Those are closer to heaven than to the field. As we descend, prices move upward, into the $145 range and beyond.Maybe the better bet was to treat this as a business investment. Since the Yankees came into possession of a new stadium, the value of the franchise has nearly doubled, to more than $3 billion. A clever city official might have sought an ownership stake.The public record establishes that the Bloomberg officials sought a luxury box.\u201cIt was,\u201d Mr. Levine said, \u201ca great public-private partnership.\u201dNo doubt.A Sports of The Times column last Sunday about the financing used to build Yankee Stadium misidentified the position in state government once held by Richard Brodsky, who issued a report on the public subsidies for the stadium called \u201cThe House That You Built.\u201d He is a former member of the New York State Assembly, not a former state senator.Email: powellm@nytimes.com Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Afghanistan, John Kerry Seeks End to Bickering of Unity Government", "Date": "2016-04-09", "News": "Supported byKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 Secretary of State John Kerry arrived in Kabul on Saturday with a message of support for Afghanistan\u2019s struggling coalition government, which has been bogged down by infighting as it confronts an emboldened Taliban insurgency.Mr. Kerry, who met with both Mr. Ghani and Mr. Abdullah, also led a meeting of senior officials from both governments to assess the commitments from each side since the signing of a strategic partnership agreement between the United States and Afghanistan.As if to underscore the perils confronting the government and the country, rockets landed near Kabul\u2019s diplomatic district not long after Mr. Kerry\u2019s departure. It was not immediately known if the rocket attack caused injuries or deaths, or significant damage.The United States has about 9,800 troops in Afghanistan, as part of NATO\u2019s reduced mission to train and advise the Afghan forces, but also in a counterterrorism mission aimed at Al Qaeda and, as of January, the Islamic State affiliates that have arisen in parts of the country.While the troop level is expected to be reduced to 5,500 by the end of the year, Mr. Kerry said President Obama\u2019s decision would take into account the views of the new United States and NATO commander in Afghanistan, Gen. John W. Nicholson, who is in the middle of conducting an assessment before he presents his recommendations to the Pentagon.Mr. Kerry\u2019s remarks before his meetings with Mr. Ghani and Mr. Abdullah suggested that the two leaders\u2019 continued bickering remained a concern.\u201cWe need to make certain that the government of national unity is doing everything possible to be unified and to deliver to the people of Afghanistan,\u201d he said.Mr. Ghani, later appearing in a news conference with Mr. Kerry, thanked Mr. Obama for his flexibility on troop levels, and reaffirmed his government\u2019s commitment to making reforms and fighting corruption.Afghanistan must show clear progress in those areas before requesting continued financing and other international commitments at two coming conferences, in Warsaw and Brussels.\u201cThe unity, national empathy, and responsibility of our political class in particular need to be strengthened,\u201d Mr. Ghani said.The Afghan leaders still do not see eye to eye on many basic issues in the political document that was Mr. Kerry\u2019s instrument to bring them together, and their disagreements have slowed the government\u2019s response.Yet at a time of raging violence, which took the lives of nearly 6,000 members of the Afghan security forces last year, the top security ministries have been run by caretakers who do not have parliamentary approval. The minister of defense, for instance, remains as a caretaker even after failing his parliamentary confirmation. The ministers of intelligence and the interior resigned with harsh public words for the government.After months of limbo, a new interior minister was finally approved by Parliament on Saturday, while the two leaders continue to disagree over the choice for a new intelligence chief. On the same day that the interior minister was confirmed, the government also finally got its first attorney general \u2014 after the post had been vacant for a year and half.The Kerry-brokered agreement called for holding within two years parliamentary elections, delayed a year already, and a loya jirga, a grand assembly of elders from across the country, to amend the Constitution and change Mr. Abdullah\u2019s role of chief executive to the position of prime minister.To avoid another electoral mess, the agreement also calls for overhauling the voting process.With the agreement\u2019s deadline a little more than six months away, Mr. Ghani and Mr. Abdullah have sharply disagreed over the mechanics of the overhaul, and they are unlikely to meet the requirements on time.A vocal political opposition, made up mostly of officials from former administrations who have been alienated by the current leaders, has intensified its criticism, with an eye on the deadline. Many have even declared that the government, born out of a political agreement, will lose its legitimacy in October if the two leaders do not fulfill the promises they signed on paper.Yet Mr. Kerry, at the news conference with Mr. Ghani, asserted that the coalition government did not have an expiration date.\u201cLet me make this very, very clear, because I brokered the agreement, President Ghani signed it and Chief Executive Abdullah signed it,\u201d Mr. Kerry said. \u201cThere is no end to this agreement at the end of two years or six months from now. This is an agreement for unity government the duration of which is five years.\u201dWestern and Afghan officials say certain advisers to Mr. Ghani are envisioning a different outcome: using the deadline to force out Mr. Abdullah. They argue that while the position of chief executive expires, the president will still have a mandate, from an election that they say was cleansed by a United Nations audit.But American officials have told Mr. Ghani\u2019s faction that such a path would be unacceptable \u2014 that, essentially,the government is only legitimate as long as both men are in it.Jawad Sukhanyar reported from Kabul, and Mujib Mashal from Mazar-i-Sharif, Afghanistan.Advertisement"}

He nevertheless outperforms peers on both content and readability. There\u2019s an honest assessment on JPMorgan\u2019s sluggish diversity drive and an unexpected nod to the efforts of on-site medical staff members.The dominant theme is defending the scale of an institution with $2.4 trillion of assets. Mr. Dimon is blatant in some areas, as when he notes that JPMorgan holds enough capital to absorb not just the losses the Federal Reserve stress tests ascribed to his bank in last year\u2019s stress test, but the entire $222 billion at the top 31 banks. There\u2019s also a whole section titled \u201cDoes the United States really need big banks?\u201dThe bank chieftain asserts there is now \u201cvirtually no chance of a domino effect\u201d among big banks if one gets into trouble, as they lend very little to one another. While true, it also sounds too much like fighting the last battle. Other risks, including the increasing similarity of assets they hold, go unaddressed.Often, however, the message is more subtle. On burgeoning financial technology, for example, Mr. Dimon says financing for nonbanks will probably dry up in a crisis. In other words, beware the shadow banks that new regulations may have helped create. He also points out how size affords banks like JPMorgan the ability to fight back effectively against would-be disrupters in payments and lending.Mr. Dimon even plays the patriotism card.

{"Headline": "Robert Linton, Steadfast \u201980s Wall Street Banker, Dies at 90", "Date": "2016-04-28", "News": "Supported byRobert E. Linton, a prominent Wall Street executive who led the swashbuckling investment bank Drexel Burnham Lambert in the years before it imploded in scandal but who was largely untainted himself, died on Tuesday in Manhattan. He was 90.The cause was heart failure, his son Jeffrey said.During his tenure atop Drexel in the early 1980s, Mr. Linton oversaw the firm\u2019s rapid expansion into one of the nation\u2019s biggest \u2014 and most profitable \u2014 investment banks. At its height, Drexel pioneered the junk bond industry and came to symbolize the 1980s \u201cgreed is good\u201d mentality on Wall Street, inspiring movies and books that detailed the risk-taking of that era.Eventually, however, the federal authorities suspected that something worse than greed was afoot.In 1989, prosecutors filed six felony counts of mail and securities fraud against the firm, which pleaded guilty and later dissolved. Michael R. Milken, the \u201cJunk Bond King\u201d and a central figure in the case, also admitted to crimes, providing the capstone to what was then the largest criminal prosecution in Wall Street history.Although Mr. Linton was a board member during much of that period, he was no longer C.E.O. And Mr. Linton, who was never accused of wrongdoing in the case, had previously denounced some of Wall Street\u2019s excesses.Robert Edward Linton was born on May 19, 1925, in Manhattan. After graduating from Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire and forgoing college, he enlisted in the Army in 1943 and served in World War II, attaining the rank of second lieutenant in the Army Air Forces.After the war, Mr. Linton returned to New York, raising his family in Rye. At the time of his death, he had homes in Manhattan and Purchase, N.Y.Besides his son Jeffrey, he is survived by his wife of 63 years, the former Margot Tishman; two daughters, Roberta L. Bennett and Elizabeth M. Linton; another son, Thomas; a sister, Marion Benson; and five grandchildren.In 1946, Mr. Linton joined a predecessor to Drexel, then a small brokerage house, as a runner delivering stock certificates around Wall Street. More than three decades later, he was named chairman and chief executive. He was also a director of the New York Stock Exchange and led a Wall Street trade group, known then as the Securities Industry Association.Whether as a shrewd businessman or a prudent steward of the economy \u2014 or both \u2014 Mr. Linton cried foul. Congress repealed Glass\u2013Steagall in 1999, opening the door to the sort of megabanks that ultimately took billions of dollars in bailouts during the 2008 financial crisis, an outcome that arguably vindicated Mr. Linton.At Drexel, it was the junk bond business that drove much of the growth. Drexel designed the instruments to finance companies that were riskier bets. For a time, these bonds outperformed investment-grade securities as they fueled a wave of corporate takeovers.But when one of the firm\u2019s clients, Ivan F. Boesky, was swept into a federal investigation, so was Drexel. Rudolph W. Giuliani, the United States attorney in Manhattan at the time, led a nearly three-year investigation that focused on the firm\u2019s insider trading and stock manipulation. In addition to pleading guilty, Drexel paid the government $650 million in penalties, a record at the time.Mr. Linton, who remained friendly with Mr. Milken over the years, was not charged or accused of wrongdoing, though the New York Stock Exchange barred him from associating with any member firms of the exchange for one year, saying he had inadequately supervised employees.Despite his prominent role on Wall Street, Mr. Linton largely avoided the spotlight.As a rival banker told The Times in 1977, \u201cBob has been married to the same lady for 25 years, has had the same secretary for 22 years since he became an officer of his house, has a 14-year-old dog,\u201d four children and \u201clives quietly in Rye.\u201d In other words, the executive said, he was a \u201csteady sort who gets things done without much fuss.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Wall Street Family\u2019s Charmed Life Is Thrown Into Turmoil", "Date": "2016-04-05", "News": "Supported byAndrew Caspersen violated a circle of trust that included colleagues, a Princeton classmate and even his wealthy family when he raised tens of millions of dollars for what authorities have called a fraudulent investment scheme that has rattled Wall Street.Among the victims to emerge from Mr. Caspersen\u2019s alleged scheme are members of his own family, who invested more than $3 million, according to a person with direct knowledge of the events who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Another was a college classmate, James McIntyre, an executive at the hedge fund Moore Capital, who personally invested $400,000. Mr. McIntyre then recommended that a charitable trust affiliated with Moore Capital put in $25 million of its money.A former Blackstone Group managing director, Mr. Caspersen was well respected on Wall Street. He came from a world of privilege, attending Groton, Princeton and then Harvard Law School \u2014 credentials that allowed him to move easily within the world of high finance.Mr. Caspersen\u2019s charmed life was thrown into turmoil on the afternoon of March 26, when he, his wife, their two young children and his in-laws were returning from a vacation in Florida.Waiting for Mr. Caspersen, 39, at La Guardia Airport were federal agents with an arrest warrant.Federal prosecutors in Manhattan charged him in a criminal complaint with securities and wire fraud in what they called a \u201cbrazen\u201d scheme to defraud investors of up to $95 million.Mr. Caspersen\u2019s circle extended beyond the corridors of Wall Street. Even Kimba M. Wood, the federal judge initially assigned to a related civil fraud lawsuit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission against Mr. Caspersen, has had to recuse herself from the litigation because of unspecified family connections to the former Wall Street executive.Events began to spiral out of control for Mr. Caspersen months before his arrest in a case that has now thrust his family, friends and acquaintances into the spotlight unwittingly.Federal prosecutors contend in a criminal complaint that Mr. Caspersen blew more than half of the $25 million that he took in from the Moore Charitable Foundation \u2014 founded by the billionaire Louis M. Bacon to promote conservation \u2014 on losing options in a personal brokerage account.But the authorities also said that in November, Mr. Caspersen used some of the money to cover his tracks after making separate unauthorized wire transfers of $8.1 million and $770,000.Mr. Caspersen worked as a partner at Park Hill Group, a division of PJT Partners, until he was fired last week. It was there that he was said to be able to exploit a client billing system that allowed him to siphon money into his own personal account.These transfers represent fees paid by two clients of Park Hill that Mr. Caspersen had diverted to a bank account that he controlled instead of having that money sent to Park Hill, said a person with direct knowledge of the situation. The invoices that the clients received had indicated that the money was being directed to what appeared to be a bank account held by Park Hill.Mr. Caspersen, however, had taken advantage of the firm\u2019s payment process that allowed him to personally send out invoices to clients, said the person with direct knowledge of the situation.The Park Hill clients were unaware of what Mr. Caspersen did and his employers learned of the improper wire transfers only about a week before his arrest because they appeared legitimate.No client money went missing and it was not clear what Mr. Caspersen may have done with the money that was misdirected to the bank accounts he controlled.The S.E.C. said that Andrew Caspersen, a partner at Park Hill, solicited $95 million to invest in a shell company.It could not be determined when Mr. Caspersen sent the invoices to his clients.Park Hill is now reviewing its procedures that allow some executives to send invoices directly to clients, said the person with direct knowledge of the situation. The person added that Mr. Caspersen took advantage of the firm\u2019s policies that were intended to foster a close relationship between clients and the executives working on their business matters.Park Hill, which said last week that it was \u201cstunned\u201d to discover the charges, is cooperating with the authorities. The firm held off on terminating Mr. Caspersen until he was arrested, at request of the authorities.Much remains unknown about Mr. Caspersen\u2019s possible motivation and the details of his scheme, which the authorities said began in July, when he incorporated an investment vehicle called Irving Place III SPV L.L.C. in Delaware.The Irving Place investment vehicle had a name similar to a legitimate investment vehicle that Park Hill and Mr. Caspersen had raised several hundreds of millions dollars for last year \u2014 a confusing situation that he exploited when approaching friends and family for money.The unauthorized wire transfers suggest that Mr. Caspersen had incurred money woes, even though his family\u2019s wealth was considerable and both he and his wife had well-paying jobs.Last year, Mr. Caspersen earned a $3.68 million salary from Park Hill. His wife, Christina, also a Princeton graduate, is an investor relations representative for Anheuser-Busch InBev. Earlier this year, she went on an extended leave of absence from the brewing behemoth, before her husband\u2019s arrest.The couple bought a multimillion-dollar home in Bronxville, N.Y., in 2015, not far from his in-laws\u2019 home. They also own a co-op apartment in Manhattan.A review of court documents does not reveal any outstanding judgments or liens against Mr. Caspersen or his known assets.A child of privilege, Mr. Caspersen was a beneficiary of family trusts and businesses that his father, Finn M. W. Caspersen, a noted financier and philanthropist, left behind.The elder Mr. Caspersen was chairman and chief executive of Beneficial Corporation, a consumer finance company, for nearly two decades before selling it for $8.6 billion to Household International.Mr. Caspersen\u2019s father killed himself in 2009 at the age of 67; he was at the time suffering from kidney cancer. A year before his death, he pledged $30 million to Harvard Law School, which later named its student center in the family\u2019s honor. Mr. Caspersen and all four of his sons, including Andrew, also graduated from Harvard Law.Soon after Mr. Caspersen\u2019s death, The New York Times and other news organizations reported that his name had surfaced in connection with a federal investigation into the misuse of offshore bank accounts to avoid taxes. The Internal Revenue Service began an audit of some of offshore accounts tied to his name.But neither Mr. Caspersen nor any of his family members were charged by federal authorities with wrongdoing. Last year, a tax lawyer retained by the Caspersen family conducted a review of the I.R.S. audit and said in a letter, which was reviewed by The Times, that the investigation was completed in 2013 and did not impose any penalties for failing to report holdings in a foreign bank account.A representative for the Caspersen family provided a copy of the letter to dispel any impression that the elder Caspersen had killed himself under a cloud of suspicion.The letter said the I.R.S. reviewed tax filings by Mr. Caspersen and his wife, Barbara, for a five-year period beginning in 2005. The only blemish tax officials found was an underpayment of taxes in 2008 for which the I.R.S. assessed a penalty of nearly $14,000 that was paid by Mr. Caspersen\u2019s estate.Like their father, all of Mr. Caspersen\u2019s sons, including Andrew, the youngest, pursued careers in finance. Finn Jr. is the chief operating officer and general counsel of Peapack-Gladstone Bank in New Jersey and Erik Caspersen is a former executive with Polygon Investment Partners. Sam, a former Sullivan & Cromwell lawyer, is now a managing director of Brock Capital Group, a boutique investment bank.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Duane R. Clarridge, Brash Spy Who Fought Terror Networks, Dies at 83", "Date": "2016-04-10", "News": "Supported byDuane R. Clarridge, a pugnacious American spy who helped found the C.I.A.\u2019s Counterterrorism Center, was indicted and later pardoned for his role in the Iran-contra scandal, and resumed his intelligence career in his late 70s as the head of a private espionage operation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, died on Saturday in Leesburg, Va. He was 83.His lawyer, Raymond Granger, said the cause was complications of laryngeal and esophageal cancer.Mr. Clarridge was an unflinching champion of a brawny American foreign policy and of the particular role played by the C.I.A.\u2019s clandestine service \u2014 a cadre he likened to a secret army that \u201cmarches for the president\u201d and ought to be subjected to as little outside scrutiny as possible.Mr. Clarridge, widely known by his nickname Dewey, delighted in the role of rogue. He often arrived at work in white Italian suits or safari jackets and bragged to other C.I.A. officers about the brilliant ideas he had conceived while drinking the previous night.\u201cIf you have a tough, dangerous job, critical to national security, Dewey\u2019s your man,\u201d Robert M. Gates, the former director of central intelligence and later defense secretary, was quoted as saying in \u201cCasey,\u201d a 1990 biography of William J. Casey, the Central Intelligence Agency\u2019s chief during the Reagan administration, by Joseph E. Persico. \u201cJust make sure you have a good lawyer at his elbow \u2014 Dewey\u2019s not easy to control.\u201dHe spent years overseas as an undercover officer, but perhaps his most consequential effort at the spy agency was the creation of the Counterterrorism Center (then called the Counterterrorist Center) in 1986 after a string of attacks the previous year, including the hijacking of TWA Flight 847 and the massacres at El Al ticket counters in Rome and Vienna carried out by the Abu Nidal Organization.Up to that point, the C.I.A. had devoted little effort to understanding international terrorism, and Mr. Clarridge persuaded Mr. Casey to create the center with an unusual arrangement: having undercover spies and intelligence analysts working together to try to dismantle terrorist networks. Within a year, C.I.A. operations had significantly weakened the Abu Nidal organization.Since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the Counterterrorism Center has grown into a behemoth, the heart of a spy agency transformed by years of terrorist hunting.Mr. Clarridge\u2019s efforts against international terrorism came as he was becoming ensnared by investigations into the Reagan administration\u2019s efforts to use proceeds from secret arms sales to Iran to arm the contras, a Nicaraguan rebel group battling troops of the country\u2019s socialist government, known as the Sandinistas.Mr. Clarridge had been in charge of the C.I.A.\u2019s covert war in Nicaragua in the early 1980s (he told his colleagues that his idea to mine the harbors of Nicaragua in 1983 came while he was drinking gin at home) and had developed a close relationship with Lt. Col. Oliver North, who was running the Iran-contra operation from his perch at the National Security Council.According to the final report by Lawrence E. Walsh, the independent counsel investigating the Iran-contra affair, Mr. Clarridge testified that he had no knowledge that cargo ships sent to Iran to help secure the release of American hostages contained any weapons. He also denied trying to solicit money from foreign countries to circumvent a congressional prohibition against financing the contras.\u201cIn both instances,\u201d the report said, \u201cthere was strong evidence that Clarridge\u2019s testimony was false.\u201dHe was indicted on a charge of perjury in 1991, three years after he had retired from the agency. President George Bush pardoned him on Christmas Eve 1992, along with five other Iran-contra figures. He had the pardon framed, and he eventually hung it in the front hallway of his home near San Diego so it would be the first thing visitors saw on entering his house.But the scandal embittered him, and he used his 1997 memoir, \u201cA Spy for All Seasons,\u201d to settle some old scores. He lamented in the book that the C.I.A. had lost its swagger since the end of the Cold War, becoming a risk-averse organization that was beholden to lawyers and was degenerating \u201cinto something resembling the style, work ethic and morale of the post office.\u201dDuane Ramsdell Clarridge was born in Nashua, N.H., on April 16, 1932. Both of his parents (his father was a dentist and his mother a homemaker) were active in local Republican politics, and the nickname he carried through life had Republican origins. According to his memoir, a neighbor in Nashua began calling him Dewey in 1944 in honor of Thomas E. Dewey, the New York governor who ran for president that year against Franklin D. Roosevelt.He joined the C.I.A. in 1955, after getting degrees from Brown and Columbia, and served undercover in Nepal, India and Italy before being promoted to run the Latin America division in 1981.He is survived by a daughter, Cassandra; two sons, Ian and Tarik; and five grandchildren. His first marriage ended in divorce; his second wife, Helga, died before him.More than two decades after his retirement from the C.I.A., Mr. Clarridge began working as a government contractor when military officials in Kabul hired him and a small team to gather information about militant groups in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Using sources in the region \u2014 he identified them only by cover names, such as Waco and Willi \u2014 he would turn their field dispatches into reports he sent to the military command by encrypted email.Mr. Clarridge worked for a security firm hired by The New York Times in December 2008 to assist in seeking the release of a reporter, David Rohde, who had been kidnapped by the Taliban. Mr. Rohde escaped on his own seven months later, but Mr. Clarridge used his role in the episode to promote his spy network to military officials.The Pentagon canceled the contract in 2010 after the private spying operation was revealed.But two years later, after Mr. Clarridge had moved into a retirement home in Northern Virginia, he told a reporter that he still had his \u201cnetwork\u201d intact for the future.\u201cNobody has been able to sit down with him and have him get one iota of intelligent information about the Middle East,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Demands have picked up for a judicial commission under the country\u2019s chief justice to investigate any potential wrongdoing by the prime minister and his family.Mr. Sharif has rejected any allegations of money laundering, claiming that his children have legitimate business abroad, and he has signaled his willingness to establish an inquiry commission.But as the political turmoil increased, Mr. Sharif flew to London on Wednesday for cardiac medical treatment that he described as a checkup. The timing of the visit immediately prompted rumors that Mr. Sharif might not return to Pakistan until investigations were completed.In his absence, the finance minister, Ishaq Dar, is leading important cabinet meetings this week. However, government officials said that Mr. Sharif will return on Sunday, and will face the crisis.Mr. Sharif, 66, an affluent businessman whose family has made its money through businesses primarily dealing in steel, returned to power in 2013 after his party won a majority in the general elections. He had been prime minister in the 1990s and was ousted in a military coup in 1999.Mr. Sharif has tried to assert civilian control over the government but has run into difficulties with the powerful military, which has again become ascendant in both foreign and domestic affairs in recent months and commands a deep well of public support.On Thursday, Imran Khan, the most trenchant political opponent of Mr. Sharif, also arrived in London. Mr. Khan said he was looking to hire financial investigation agencies that could look into the Sharif family\u2019s dealings. Mr. Khan has threatened to lead street protests if an investigation is not initiated by the government.Some political analysts here say that the major opposition political parties do not want the crisis to reach the point at which the military might step in.\u201cThis is a godsend opportunity for us,\u201d Mr. Khan said last week, urging Pakistanis to rise against Mr. Sharif.Another mainstream political power, the Pakistan Peoples Party, has so far seemed to be weighing its options, and there has been no major joining of forces with Mr. Khan.

That figure is on the low end of the revenue estimate the company shared publicly with investors in February.Even that revenue is coming at a cost, with Yahoo expecting to pay other sites about $1 billion this year for sending traffic to its advertising services.The company\u2019s cash flow is also declining. Yahoo has reaffirmed to bidders its February projection that adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization would be about $750 million this year, down from $952 million in 2015.Perhaps more important to potential bidders is that Yahoo executives, including the chief, Marissa Mayer, are offering little detail about the costs and realistic growth prospects of various parts of its business.Potential bidders wanting to meet with Ms. Mayer or her executives are first directed to listen to a recording from the management team laying out the basics, said one of the people close to the bidding, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality agreements surrounding the process.Bidders who get a meeting with management hear the same upbeat story of growth coming sometime in the future that Ms. Mayer has been repeating to Yahoo\u2019s stockholders. When pressed on the strengths and weaknesses of specific businesses and projects, however, Yahoo executives have been closemouthed.Sarah Meron, a Yahoo spokeswoman, said on Wednesday that the company publicly disclosed many of its projections to investors in February and would provide an update during its first-quarter earnings call, expected this month. She declined to comment on the bidding process.Initial bids are due at the end of next week, but that deadline might be pushed back.For example, Yahoo has told private equity firms and other financial players considering a bid that it considers them to be second-tier bidders, compared with so-called strategic bidders like Verizon and AT&T that would integrate Yahoo into their existing businesses.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "George Weymouth, Conservationist, Horse Enthusiast and Bon Vivant, Dies at 79", "Date": "2016-04-29", "News": "Supported byIn 1967, George Weymouth, a member of the du Pont family and a longtime fixture in fox-hunting, polo, steeplechase and carriage-driving circles, learned that the pristine meadowlands near his home in Chadds Ford, Pa., were going to be developed.\u201cWe heard that Disney was coming to buy the lands, then that a nuclear power plant was under consideration,\u201d Mr. Weymouth, known by the nickname Frolic, told The Hunt magazine in 2011. \u201cThere was also talk about building a new town of 10,000 people, similar to Columbia, Md. The land developers were thinking of damming up the Buck Run and building lakeside lots. It was unbelievable.\u201dWith F.I. du Pont and William Prickett, two friends from the Cheshire Foxhounds, a fox-hunting club in Unionville, Pa., Mr. Weymouth bought two parcels totaling 47 acres and created the Tri-County Conservancy, which became the Brandywine Conservancy. It is now one of the largest land trusts in the United States, overseeing more than 62,000 acres in Chester and Delaware Counties in Pennsylvania and New Castle County in Delaware.Mr. Weymouth died on April 24 at his home in Chadds Ford. He was 79. The cause was complications of congestive heart failure, Andrew Stewart, a spokesman for the conservancy and museum, said.In the early 1980s, Mr. Weymouth worked with the conservancy and a group of local investors to acquire most of the former King Ranch in Chester County, Pa. An outpost of the King Ranch in Texas, it was once known as \u201cthe finest finishing school for cattle in the East.\u201dAfter a long period of tricky negotiations, during which Mr. Weymouth put his home up as collateral, more than 5,000 acres of the ranch were acquired in the form of easements for $11.5 million, with a prime section of about 800 acres, known as the Laurels, going to the conservancy outright.George Alexis Weymouth was born on June 2, 1936, in Wilmington, Del., and grew up in nearby Greenville. His father, George Tyler Weymouth, was an investment banker. His mother was the former Dulcinea Ophelia Payne du Pont, known as Deo. He acquired the nickname Frolic after a family dog that died soon after he was born.He began riding horses as a boy and went on to train and ride show horses, hunters, racers and polo ponies. After graduating from St. Mark\u2019s School in Southborough, Mass., he entered Yale, where he led the polo team to a national championship in 1957.He was not, by his own admission, much of a student. \u201cI couldn\u2019t read and write or spell,\u201d he told The Philadelphia Inquirer in 2007. \u201cI still can\u2019t. I don\u2019t know anything but painting pictures and being on a horse.\u201d Nevertheless, he graduated in 1958 with a degree in American studies.That year he played for an intercollegiate polo team in a series of invitational matches and tournaments in England. A last-second goal led to a heartbreaking defeat against a team sent out by the Maharajah of Cooch Behar, but the Americans rallied to beat Cambridge University and eventually win the Gloucestershire Cup.While playing at Windsor, Mr. Weymouth struck up what became a lifelong friendship with Prince Philip, whose portrait he later painted, and who over the years allowed him and his carriage the free run of the royal park in Windsor.After buying an 18th-century stone farmhouse on 225 acres in Chadds Ford in 1961 and renaming the property Big Bend, Mr. Weymouth began collecting antique carriages, which he drove daily. A back injury made riding impossible \u2014 he walked with the aid of crutches dating from the Civil War \u2014 but he learned to handle four-horse teams expertly.\u201cDriving four horses is not as simple as it looks,\u201d Robert Longstaff, Mr. Weymouth\u2019s longtime coachman, said in an interview on Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s really an art, and he was exceptionally talented at it.\u201dMr. Weymouth was fond of long-distance carriage expeditions, clocking thousands of miles in the United States, England and France. On one occasion, he took a weeklong trip from the Knickerbocker Club in Manhattan to Saratoga Springs, N.Y., startling residents in Harlem as he passed through and stopping for the first evening at the Tarrytown estate of the banker David Rockefeller, one of his closest friends.For nearly 40 years he played host every May to a carriage parade from his house to the annual steeplechase races in Winterthur, the former du Pont estate in Delaware, followed by a celebration and pig roast at Chadds Ford.In his teens he became friends with Andrew Wyeth, later his neighbor in Chadds Ford, who taught him the technique of egg tempera painting. Mr. Weymouth became an accomplished painter of portraits and landscapes, and a co-conspirator when Mr. Wyeth, in 1971, began painting and drawing his neighbor Helga Testorf, often in the nude, a project he kept secret from his wife.Mr. Weymouth stored the 240 works, later known as the Helga pictures, at his house for 15 years. The secret became public when Mr. Wyeth hinted at the existence of the pictures in an interview with Art and Auction in 1985 and sold them to a collector a year later.A bon vivant and a character, Mr. Weymouth was a toff of the old school, with a global network of friends in high places. He rarely turned on a television, in part because he never mastered a remote control, or light switches, for that matter. He preferred candlelight.

Born on March 8, 1924 in Orange, NJ, he was the second son of Armenian immigrants who fled\n                                        Turkey to escape persecution in the early 1900&aposs. After graduating Orange High School in 1942, he served in the U.S. Army in Europe and Japan during WWII. He later attended Seton Hall University, where he majored\n                                        in business and graduated Magna Cum Laude in 1949. In a rich and varied international business career that followed, he pioneered two industries-export finance and export management - and positively influenced the\n                                        lives and careers of many people who worked with him. He worked for the Arabian American Oil Company from 1949-1967, during which time he worked for periods in Lebanon, the Netherlands and Saudi Arabia and earned\n                                        an MBA from NYU.

{"Headline": "Puerto Rico\u2019s Prosperous D.C. Power Couple", "Date": "2016-04-12", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As Puerto Rico has spiraled toward possible bankruptcy, the island\u2019s sole representative in Congress has seen his family wealth swell, thanks in part to Wall Street companies that have sought to capitalize on the island\u2019s financial crisis and have hired his wife to advise them.The dual roles \u2014 those of a lawmaker and a spouse who are both involved in the financial affairs of their community \u2014 are hardly unusual in Washington, a city where power couples are increasingly common and, at times, celebrated.But legislation that Pedro R. Pierluisi, a Democrat and the resident commissioner to Congress from Puerto Rico, has introduced would benefit at least two of the companies that have hired his wife, Mar\u00eda Elena Carri\u00f3n, for financial advice.And as Ms. Carri\u00f3n, 51, has done her work for these firms, Mr. Pierluisi\u2019s office has been lobbied by two of her clients, Fundamental Advisors and Och-Ziff Capital Management, documents provided by the resident commissioner\u2019s office show.No House rules require Mr. Pierluisi to disclose the names of his wife\u2019s clients, and he did not. The names of her Wall Street clients came to light after The New York Times requested them.In separate interviews, both Mr. Pierluisi and Ms. Carri\u00f3n said they kept their professional careers separate, and that nothing that Mr. Pierluisi had done in Congress had in any way been intended to benefit his wife\u2019s start-up company, Multicultural Capital, or his bid for governor.\u201cShe has every right to engage in her profession,\u201d Mr. Pierluisi said during an interview at his Capitol Hill office. \u201cIt has nothing to do with what I am doing in Congress. The only link here is that it happens in Puerto Rico.\u201dMs. Carri\u00f3n \u2014 who earned a master\u2019s degree in business administration from Columbia University and spent more than a decade working for Wall Street investment banks \u2014 called questions about the potential conflict of interest unfounded.Executives at the firms that hired her, including Fundamental Advisors and Och-Ziff, declined to comment on the record.House ethics rules place no limits on the work that a spouse of a lawmaker can do. Two ethics lawyers who examined the matter at the request of The Times said they saw no violation of the rules based on the work that Ms. Carri\u00f3n has done.But Meredith McGehee, policy director at the Campaign Legal Center, a campaign finance watchdog group, said that Mr. Pierluisi should have disclosed the deals in which his wife had been involved.\u201cDemocracy is a confidence game \u2014 people need to have confidence that elected officials did not come into power to enrich themselves,\u201d Ms. McGehee said. \u201cThe reality is what they have done here has created some smoke, the appearance of a conflict, no matter how much the congressman protests that assertion.\u201dWhen she opened the business after her husband\u2019s election, it represented a return to the financial world for Ms. Carri\u00f3n, an expert in emerging markets who had worked for 15 years at Wall Street firms like Prudential Financial and Bankers Trust before taking a break to pursue a doctorate in Puerto Rican history.From her small office in San Juan, Ms. Carri\u00f3n fielded requests from investors looking to buy or sell assets, including hotels and residential buildings.Her work in this area has coincided with a surge in interest in the island by major Wall Street players, like Apollo Global Management and Och-Ziff Capital Management, two New York-based investment funds. They went to Puerto Rico looking for bargains on so-called distressed assets, such as struggling hotels, or to buy some of the island\u2019s public debt, because the government was offering unusually high interest rates to pull in much-needed money.Och-Ziff asked for Ms. Carri\u00f3n\u2019s help in 2012 and 2014 as it looked for investments, eventually purchasing stakes in a hotel and residential complex on the island. Ms. Carri\u00f3n\u2019s firm earned a fee of more than $1 million for helping set up the deal, according to participants in the transaction. She would not say how much her company earned in fees.More recently, Ms. Carri\u00f3n was hired by Fundamental Advisors. Her company was not able to help find a suitable investment, but her fee was in the tens of thousands of dollars before the contract was terminated at the end of last year.In March 2014, Och-Ziff was one of at least a dozen hedge funds that purchased large stakes in $3.5 billion worth of bonds sold by the Puerto Rican government, with the help of Wall Street firms including Morgan Stanley.This bond offering, the largest sale of junk-rated municipal debt in United States history, attracted hedge funds instead of the more traditional municipal bond investors because of the unusually high interest rates that the strapped Puerto Rican government was willing to offer.Within months of the 2014 bond sale, Wall Street executives involved in the transaction turned to Mr. Pierluisi\u2019s office for help. He had introduced legislation first in July 2014 and again in February 2015 that would allow the Puerto Rican government to take advantage of United States bankruptcy provisions available to the 50 states.For companies like Och-Ziff and Fundamental Advisors, that change in the law would protect their investments in Puerto Rico general obligation bonds if the island won bankruptcy protection, while holders of other debts issued by the Puerto Rican government would be paid back less than promised.\u201cThe congressman took this position for one reason and one reason only \u2014 because he believes it is in the best interests of the 3.5 million American citizens that he represents,\u201d a statement from his office said.Mr. Cabral-Corrada, in an interview, declined to discuss the event or those who attended.Campaign finance records \u2014 for Mr. Pierluisi\u2019s House race and his account in Puerto Rico to fund his bid for governor \u2014 show contributions around the time of the event from more than a dozen financial industry figures and lobbyists.Mr. Pierluisi, provided with a copy of the fund-raising invitation, said he had not previously seen it.\u201cThis is unfortunate language,\u201d he said.Congress has not taken any action on legislation intended to help resolve Puerto Rico\u2019s financial crisis. A new proposal emerged late last month that would no longer guarantee that general obligation bondholders were fully protected. In the interview, Mr. Pierluisi offered his tentative support for part of this new House proposal, which would replace his own legislative plan, as further proof that he was not trying to help any of his wife\u2019s former clients.Ms. Carri\u00f3n added that she had never worked for the hedge fund divisions of the firms that invested in bonds, but instead helped their private equity wings, which purchase real estate assets like hotels, and that her contracts with all of her clients included a provision making clear she does not lobby Congress.Some of the firms are so small, though, that executives are involved in running both divisions out of the same offices.In the time since Mr. Pierluisi has been in office, his wife\u2019s firm has grown from having no revenue to being worth more than $1 million, his most recent financial disclosure report, filed in 2015, says.Financial disclosure reports Mr. Pierluisi filed with the House show his family\u2019s average net worth, subtracting debts from assets, surged to $1 million in 2014, the most recent report, from $36,501 in 2008, the year he was elected.Mr. Pierluisi said the change in his family wealth was entirely a result of his wife\u2019s earnings.\u201cWhile everyone else suffers, they are profiting from the crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, it is par for the course when it comes to the political elite in Puerto Rico.\u201dEric Lipton reported from Washington, and Michael Corkery from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Looming Threat of Avian Flu", "Date": "2016-04-13", "News": "FeatureLast year\u2019s outbreak showed just how difficult it is to protect America\u2019s agricultural system from devastating diseases. Next time it could be even worse.Supported byThere were seven other piles like this on the Moline family farm, in northwest Iowa, enough to fill three football fields up to the first row of seats. Bleached pelvic crests and the knobby ends of shins poked up from the humus alongside an unbroken wishbone. They were all that was left of the 56,000 turkeys that Moline and his older brother, Grant, and their father, John, were raising last May, when avian influenza arrived on their farm. When they went to bed one night, their turkeys were healthy; the next morning, almost 100 were dead and hundreds more were gasping for breath. Thousands of birds died in days.\u201cI\u2019d never seen anything like it before,\u201d Moline said when I visited him last October. \u201cMy father, who is 70 years old, he\u2019d never seen anything like it before, and some older relatives that have been around this area for a long time, they\u2019d never seen anything like it. It rolled through the farm like a runaway train.\u201dThe Molines had been dreading the flu for months, watching it advance across the state and hoping their isolated location, outside a small town called Manson, would keep the disease away. Instead, following orders from the United States Department of Agriculture, the family was required to kill all their birds, even those that were not showing symptoms, sacrificing them as a firebreak to keep the disease from spreading. They stacked the thousands of carcasses in 200-foot windrows of wood shavings and straw so the heat of decay would burn the virus away. They turned the piles with tractors, scrubbed and fogged and aired their barns, turned the piles again, swabbed the empty buildings to check for infection and waited out weeks of quarantine to earn an all-clear from the U.S.D.A. and the state\u2019s Agriculture Department.Iowa was the worst-hit state in the outbreak, and the Molines\u2019 farm was the first allowed to restock once it was over. When I visited, there were 28,800 turkeys in four of their barns \u2014 11-week-old birds, reedy and at the midpoint of their lives \u2014 and another 28,000 new arrivals cheeping in the brooder barn, where they spend their first few weeks. It seemed as if the devastating flu had never been there \u2014 except for the extra compost, as much as they would have accumulated in 10 years of normal farming.It has been a year since the bird flu tore through the Midwest: enough time for decimated farms to cash their indemnity checks and begin buying replacement birds; for the wholesale price of eggs, which doubled, to slide back to normal; for national awareness of the outbreak, the worst animal-disease epidemic in United States history, to dissipate. But among the poultry farmers who endured the flu, and others watching elsewhere in the country, there is a pervasive uneasiness, because after a year of scrutiny, federal and academic scientists still cannot say for sure how their properties became infected. Despite their own efforts to harden their defenses, and new federal plans to help them, it is possible that poultry farmers are not equipped for the flu to return among the United States\u2019 billions of chickens; and that ranchers and pork producers might be equally unprepared if an unfamiliar disease detonated among the country\u2019s 92 million beef and dairy cattle or 68 million pigs. Planning for epidemics, animal or human, is to a large extent based on what a disease did the last time. It is much more difficult to predict what a disease will do next.The Department of Homeland Security was set up in 2003, and one of its first responsibilities, set by presidential directive the following January, was to protect \u201cthe agriculture and food system against terrorist attacks, major disasters and other emergencies.\u201d The president asked Congress for billions to finance the new task of defending the country, including more than $1 billion for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, or Aphis, the U.S.D.A. division that tracks diseases. But the funding was used for federal structures that would research and detect agricultural diseases; little reached down the production chain to strengthen what farmers were doing on their own properties. Dr. Carol Cardona, a professor of avian health at the University of Minnesota who studies poultry disease, explains that the thinking was that farms, deep in thinly populated rural areas, would not be a danger to one another: \u201cThe food system responded to 9/11 with changes further up the food chain.\u201dThose structures worked as they were supposed to when the avian flu arrived in December 2014. The virus was detected as it jumped the Canadian border from small farms in British Columbia and landed in wild birds in Washington State before spreading through poultry farms on the West Coast. Avian flu usually comes from wild birds: mostly ducks, geese and shorebirds, which shed the virus in their bodily waste and secretions as they migrate. To watch for its arrival, federal and state agencies collaborate on surveillance systems, taking samples of lakes where birds roost, wild birds when they are banded and wild turkeys and ducks that are shot by hunters. But those systems cannot test every one of the millions of birds that cross the United States every season. The first signal of the flu\u2019s arrival can be when domesticated birds die.And that was what happened next. The flu changed course, zigzagging across the map instead of down: On March 4, 2015, it struck Minnesota, the No. 1 turkey producer in the United States; Missouri was next, on March 9; then Arkansas on March 11, Kansas on March 13, South Dakota on April 1. The pattern did not match wild migration patterns, and scientists watching its spread were baffled as they tried to find the source. On April 2, it struck Minnesota yet again, and within two weeks, the flu hit 23 farms holding 1.5 million turkeys. It descended on Iowa on April 13, invading first a turkey farm and then a giant property holding more than 4.1 million egg-laying hens.The U.S.D.A. had written plans anticipating the arrival of avian flu, but there was no way to test how effective they would be: There had not been a multistate epidemic of highly pathogenic avian influenza \u2014 fast-moving, virulent and very infectious \u2014 in the United States for more than 30 years. The main effort against avian influenza has been geared toward detecting and controlling an epidemic in people. A strain known as H5N1 emerged in Hong Kong in 1997, and since then it has infected 846 people in 16 countries and killed more than half of them \u2014 a small number of victims, but an enormous mortality rate. So far almost all the victims have been farmers or people who live in proximity to chickens, but virologists fear its spreading to the global population. The United States has a Na\u00ad\u00adtional Strategy for Pandemic Influenza, created to counter that threat, that focuses on how the disease would affect humans. Farmers have built their barns and established their routines around the more common diseases of turkeys and chickens \u2014 Marek\u2019s disease, infectious bronchitis, fowl cholera \u2014 which can be prevented with vaccinations and good hygiene. But those protections weren\u2019t adequate against this flu.Turkeys in the United States are raised in solid-walled barns for their first few weeks, and after that in open-sided buildings, hundreds of feet long and faced with a few feet of plywood topped by walls of mesh. Panels that resemble upside-down roller blinds slide up when conditions are cold or blustery and down again when the wind drops or temperatures warm. The design is industry-standard, as were the procedures the Molines followed to protect their birds. They swapped their outdoor boots for indoor ones before they walked into the barns that housed the adult birds. They also dipped their outdoor boots in disinfectant before entering the brooder barn and pulled on coveralls and fresh boots once they were inside. As the flu drew near, they added extra precautions, like extra boot dips and parking cars farther away from the barns.The Molines\u2019 property is small and relatively low-tech, but even huge farms, where advanced biosecurity is routine, had no better luck. Rembrandt Foods, about 100 miles northwest of the Molines, is the third-largest egg producer in the country; before the flu arrived, it owned 15 million hens on its farms. The birds live in sealed solid-walled sheds, hundreds of thousands per building, under computerized lights and climate-controlled ventilation. Workers shower and change into uniforms when they arrive for work, step through disinfectant before they enter a barn and shower and change again on the way out. The parking lots are cement instead of gravel to reduce the omnipresent Iowa dust and any organisms that might hitch a ride on it, and the company commissions outside audits of its biosecurity. It passed one just before the epidemic started. The flu got in anyway. More than eight million birds had to be destroyed.\u201cFifteen years of work,\u201d says Dave Rettig, Rembrandt Foods\u2019 president, who began his career with a farm of just 25,000 birds. \u201cGone in a week.\u201dA study done in July estimated that the flu cost the United States $2.6 billion in lost sales, almost $400 million in forgone taxes and 15,693 jobs. But as devastating as the losses were to Iowa, Minnesota and other states, their 50 million turkeys and hens represented a small portion of the poultry industry. The largest concentrations of chickens in the United States \u2014 Georgia, which raises 1.3 billion broilers a year, and the Delmarva Peninsula, where the broiler business began in the 1920s \u2014 lie under another migration route that ducks take over the Americas. If the flu were to land in those areas and spread the way it did in the Midwest, much of the United States poultry industry would be in jeopardy: almost nine billion birds, 90 billion eggs, more than $40 billion in earnings, 1.3 million jobs.Last year\u2019s flu was not the first livestock outbreak that took the nation by surprise in recent years. In 2002, exotic Newcastle disease spread into commercial poultry in California. It took 11 months, and the slaughter of more than three million birds, to end the outbreak. In 2003, a cow with bovine spongiform encephalopathy, mad cow disease, was found in the western United States. Fears of the brain-destroying human disease that it causes, which killed at least 122 people in Britain between 1995 and 2013 and forced the destruction of 1.3 million cows, cost the United States some $6 billion in forgone export sales. In 2013, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus entered the country \u2014 no one is yet sure how, though the cause may have been contamination of the bags that hold bulk feed \u2014 and killed at least seven million piglets, spiking pork prices by almost 10 percent. The animal disease that planners fear the most is foot-and-mouth disease, which has not been seen in the United States since 1929. It hadn\u2019t been seen in Britain since 1968, but then in 2001, it descended upon the country\u2019s cattle herds, forcing the destruction of more than six million cows, pigs and sheep. That epidemic cost Britain about $11 billion. If the disease returned to the United States, the U.S.D.A. estimates that the price tag could be anywhere between $15 billion and $100 billion.Months after the avian-flu outbreak, virologists at the Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory, a division of the U.S.D.A., examined virus samples from infected farms. When it reproduces, flu makes infinitesimal copying errors, so viruses dropped by different ducks, or the same duck at different times, show tiny variations. The samples recovered from the first farms were different; the ones recovered later were identical or nearly so, which suggested they had to have been transferred mechanically \u2014 on a piece of equipment, or a tire, or a boot. The farms of the Midwest were infecting one another.Federal epidemiologists documented afterward that farms might have caught the flu when a feed truck made deliveries; when equipment technicians visited; when rendering trucks picked up birds that died in the normal course of farm business. No one could say for sure how those visitors acquired the virus. It might have been by driving onto another farm that was not yet quarantined. It could have been contamination by feathers or scraps of barn litter blowing off a disposal truck. In the small towns among northwest Iowa\u2019s large farms, people who work for one farm business are often roommates \u2014 or parents or children or spouses \u2014 of people who work for another. If one resident carried the virus home on his boots, another might take it unknowingly to work the next day. Most farmers still haven\u2019t been able to determine exactly how their properties were infected.The U.S.D.A. and trade associations have since commissioned much more detailed plans that, if carried out, could better protect farms from the flu and from one another, drawing quarantine zones among properties and prescribing what farmers should do inside their own fences. The agency also ramped up federal procedures to detect the virus earlier and cull chickens faster. In January, farmers got a preview of how that would work: A turkey farm in Indiana fell to a different flu variant.Within a few days, a much shorter response than last year\u2019s, all the commercial and backyard flocks within 12 miles were tested, and all the birds on 10 farms were killed. The new plans worked, but the episode confirmed poultry producers\u2019 fears that the flu would come back. \u201cAll the industry in all the states, and I have talked to a lot of them,\u201d says Dr. T.J. Myers, who oversees the Aphis unit that led the response to the Midwestern outbreak, \u201care scared to death.\u201d The obvious protection, an influenza vaccine, cannot be used until after flu arrives, partly because it masks birds\u2019 symptoms. Last fall the U.S.D.A. approved a vaccine for the new strain, but it is keeping it held on the shelf. If it is given in advance, other countries could buy poultry with live infections, and human health experts fear it could conceal a pandemic\u2019s start.Avian flu surprised everyone last year, and the farmers who lived through it wonder whether they will be surprised again. At Rembrandt, Rettig has reassigned employees to make sure that those sharing a household work at the same site, and he bought the company more of its own delivery equipment. The Molines, smaller and less capitalized, are not sure what else they can do. \u201cThe most frustrating part\u201d of the outbreak \u201cis there\u2019s nothing that says, This is how we got it; this is how we can stop it,\u201d Brad Moline told me.He was walking me to a barn where he had rigged a new invention he was proud of. Turkey houses have vents along the roof ridge that open and close when the panels move. Investigators had warned the brothers that sparrows and barn swallows might transmit the virus. Moline had seen the birds fly in through the vents, and so he designed a chicken-wire tunnel that ran all along the roof ridge.\u201cWe think that might keep them out,\u201d he said. We looked up at the new tunnel. A sparrow had already found its way inside. It flew along the roof line, looking for a way to escape: back and forth, back and forth, trapped.Maryn McKenna is the author of \u201cSuperbug\u201d and \u201cBeating Back the Devil.\u201d She is a senior fellow at the Schuster Institute for Investigative Journalism at Brandeis University.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Chocolat,\u2019 a Biopic in France, Stirs a Discussion About Race", "Date": "2016-04-17", "News": "Supported byA new French film has helped restore his legacy. Called \u201cChocolat,\u201d it stars Omar Sy, the most prominent black actor in France, as the title character, who was named Rafael Padilla after his death but whose birth name is unknown. The film co-stars the experimental circus artist James Thierr\u00e9e, a grandson of Charlie Chaplin, as George Foottit, an English clown and the other half of a duo that made both famous.A box office success, the film operates on many levels: as a family-friendly conversation-starter about racism in France, as an exploration of the history of taste and cultural appropriation, as a vehicle for Mr. Sy to flex his comic muscles and as a story about the hazards of success. Padilla escaped slavery in Cuba, came to Europe and found fame making white people laugh, only to lose his fortune to drink and gambling.The film has put a rare focus on French people of African origin in a country where minority actors rarely headline films, and where most debates about identity center on Muslims from North Africa. But \u201cChocolat\u201d also has a strong story line.Padilla, who escaped slavery in Cuba, came to France via Spain. In the film, he and Foottit meet at a dingy circus in the French provinces, where his act was to play a cannibal, wearing a loincloth and baring his teeth while the audience gasps. The act evolves, but a central idea, white fear of black people, remains.A few years later on a fancy Paris stage, Chocolat circles Foottit, who pretends to be terrified. The elegant audience is convulsed with laughter. But are they laughing with, or at, the black clown? Those are the ambiguities at play in the film. Eventually, Chocolat grows frustrated with his act and with earning less than his white co-star. He changes tack and performs \u201cOthello.\u201d Tastes change. Josephine Baker and other African-American dance acts come to France, and the clown act becomes outdated.\u201cWe talk about the past, which is real and of course there are echoes with the present,\u201d said Mr. Sy, speaking by telephone from Los Angeles, where he moved in 2013 to pursue an acting career in Hollywood. \u201cI hope people who see it will be aware of this history and ask themselves the question, How we can improve things today?\u201dMr. Sy said he tries to transcend debates about race. \u201cIn the U.S. or France, I always worked as an actor, not a black actor,\u201d he said. In the throes of the #OscarsSoWhite controversy, Mr. Sy appeared on the cover of T\u00e9l\u00e9rama, an influential French weekly, beneath the headline \u201cIn Hollywood, they see me as French, not black.\u201d\u201cChocolat\u201d may face some of the same challenges. To audiences in the United States, the film\u2019s title \u2014 and the poster of a grinning Mr. Sy dressed nattily as Chocolat the clown \u2014 might seem tone deaf.But G\u00e9rard Noiriel, a French historian who was a writer on the film and is the author of the book \u201cChocolat: The Real History of a Nameless Man,\u201d said the movie\u2019s title was self-aware. \u201cPeople should understand that it\u2019s the nickname given him by the French and that reveals the prejudices of the era,\u201d Mr. Noiriel said.After the clown\u2019s death, Foottit\u2019s son named him Rafael Padilla, the surname of the wife of the Spanish master who had bought him in Cuba.\u201cChocolat\u201d was the idea of the French film producer Nicolas Altmayer, who read a newspaper report on a traveling theater performance about Chocolat that Mr. Noiriel had organized. It took years to put together the financing. And he needed Mr. Sy to headline. In France, \u201cthere are few black actors and no bankable actors,\u201d Mr. Altmayer said. \u201cThis is a 19-million-euro film. There\u2019s no choice. If Omar had said no, I would have stopped the project.\u201dMr. Thierr\u00e9e spent an intense month with Mr. Sy developing their clown act. While Padilla was short and energetic, Mr. Sy is tall, with a loping gait. They inverted the dynamic, with Foottit becoming the more energetic. \u201cWe tried to have this kind of tightrope act between historical faithfulness and trying to do something original,\u201d Mr. Thierr\u00e9e said. French critics have raved about his performance, and noted the strong family resemblance to his grandfather.With comic touches, the film comes at a serious time. \u201cToday, with the political climate in France and the rise of the far right, we have a responsibility to reach different publics,\u201d Mr. Noiriel said. \u201cWe live in a France that is a diverse and multicultural society, but collective memory is still too Franco-centric.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Automakers Revisit Tactics That Hurt Them Before Recession", "Date": "2016-04-14", "News": "Supported byWheelsWhen the car industry collapsed in the recession, automakers pulled back sharply on aggressive leasing deals and other financial incentives that had artificially increased their sales for years.But now, with carmakers under pressure to maintain last year\u2019s record numbers, they are once again turning to the same tactics that got them into trouble a decade ago.Automakers are offering increasing discounts on economy cars and luxury models alike, relying more on sales to fleets like rental-car companies and bloating dealers\u2019 inventories. More and more auto loans are being stretched out over longer periods of time.But there could be a harsh payback in the future. Automakers that rely heavily on leases end up taking the vehicles back in three or four years and selling them as used \u2014 often at big discounts.\u201cManufacturer incentives are at a dangerous level,\u201d Mr. Jackson said. Pumping up sales through profit-eating incentives and high fleet sales, he added, \u201cis nitroglycerin.\u201dAt the top of Mr. Jackson\u2019s concerns is leasing, which is a way of renting a new car for a specified period of time, like 24 or 36 months. Customers like leases because they typically make lower monthly payments than if they bought cars with loans. Automakers and dealers like leases because they get more flexibility to structure deals that enable customers to get pricier cars with affordable payments.Consider the lease secured by Allen Lin, a teacher from Altadena, Calif.A few weeks ago, he walked into a Lexus dealership and drove out about two hours later with a 2016 RX 350, leased for three years at $408 a month. The small sport utility vehicle \u2014 one of the most popular on the market \u2014 had recently been fully overhauled, and redesigned car models typically sell with little or no discounts. But Mr. Lin paid no money up front, did not trade in his old car and got $5,000 knocked off the car\u2019s list price of $43,779.\u201cIf you can get a deal like this, it\u2019s pretty sweet,\u201d said Mr. Lin, 35.Brian Smith, vice president for marketing at Lexus, said that leasing helped keep customers from straying to other brands but that Lexus did not use it to drive sales volume.Luxury makers tend to lean on leasing more heavily than more middle-of-the-market brands. For example, more than half of all Lexus, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Audi and Acura cars are leased. Still, all automakers use leasing to some extent, and all shapes and sizes can be leased.The three most-leased vehicles are the Honda Civic, the Honda Accord and the Toyota Camry, according to Experian Automotive.A Honda spokesman said the Japanese automaker took a measured approach to leasing to maintain used-car values. Toyota said it also managed leasing with a focus on residual value.In the past few years, some brands have significantly increased leasing. Five years ago, leases made up less than 20 percent of sales for Chevrolet, Hyundai and Mazda. Now it accounts for more than 30 percent of their sales.A spokesman for General Motors said leasing helped Chevrolet increase sales and retain customers. Hyundai\u2019s leasing levels are in line with industry practices, a spokesman said. Mazda limits lease discounting to maximize the value of used cars for customers, a company spokesman said.But while leases can lift sales, they also pose risks for car companies and their finance arms. They have to borrow billions of dollars to finance leases, and then, after leases expire, they take the cars back and sell them through dealerships or at used-car auctions. Selling gently used cars can be a good business for dealers and can help automakers attract new customers.But if they lease too many vehicles, or economic conditions sour, the value of used cars can fall and leave car companies with big losses.That\u2019s exactly what happened in 2008, when the market suddenly crashed and automakers and dealers were left a glut of cars coming off lease.Some analysts worry that the industry could be heading for that kind of situation.This is happening at a time when consumer purchases of new cars are slowing.In the first quarter of the year, sales to individual consumers rose less than 1 percent, compared with the same period a year ago, according to data from J.D. Power and Associates. In March, consumer new-car purchases, known as retail sales, fell 1 percent. But total sales are higher because of a big jump in sales to fleets, such as rental companies.Car companies are also offering auto loans over longer periods of time. Edmunds.com found that more than 27 percent of all new cars sold in the first quarter went to customers who took out loans lasting 73 to 84 months, up from 23.4 percent in the same period a year ago.\u201cIt feels like a tougher market now,\u201d said Mark Wakefield, a managing partner at AlixPartners, a consulting firm with a large automotive practice. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to see where the growth is going to come from.\u201dAlix is predicting leaner times ahead. It sees vehicle sales rising about 2 percent this year to 17.8 million cars and light trucks, and then declining, slipping steadily to 16.2 million vehicles in 2019.That leaves many automakers pushing lease deals to drive sales. This month, for example, BMW is offering a deal on its i3 electric car. It is available in many parts of the country for just $163 a month for 24 months, with no down payment. The deal is based on a price of $31,999 \u2014 a 32 percent discount from the car\u2019s list price.BMW\u2019s leasing business ensures dealers have a steady stream of well-maintained, used models to offer value-minded customers, a company spokesman said. Such \u201ccertified pre-owned\u201d cars also keep used BMW prices firm, he said.Derrick Oxender, a commercial property owner in Ann Arbor, Mich., still had a few months to go on the three-year lease for his 2013 Ford F-350 diesel truck. He was paying $825 a month based on its list price of about $58,000.But a salesman from his Ford dealer called and said he could turn in his 2013 truck and lease a 2016 model, loaded with extras like heated rear seats. Although his new F-350 is priced at $71,000, he got a new lease with a monthly payment of just $695.\u201cYou have to be stupid not to do it,\u201d Mr. Oxender said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Connecticut Chooses to Cut Jobs Over Increased Taxes in Budget Crisis", "Date": "2016-04-17", "News": "Supported byForced to rely heavily on its highest earners to fill the state\u2019s coffers, and fearful of alienating more of the highest-earning residents after a tax increase last year, legislators are not entertaining additional taxes on the rich.\u201cWe\u2019d price ourselves out of the market,\u201d said Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, a Democrat, if the state tried to make up for its $922 million shortfall with a \u201cmillionaire\u2019s tax.\u201d The revised budget Mr. Malloy proposed on Tuesday covers the shortfall, incorporating cuts to expenses and jobs \u2014 as many as 2,500 state positions could be eliminated \u2014 but no tax increases.Connecticut faces a new economic reality, Mr. Malloy said in an interview on Saturday. High-paying finance jobs, which helped the state\u2019s budget, are not expected to return to pre-recession levels.One of those laid off was Gail DeMarco of East Lyme, a supervising psychologist who has a college student and a high school freshman.Ms. DeMarco said she was aware of the state\u2019s fiscal crisis, but because Mr. Malloy had emphasized the importance of mental health services, she did not expect layoffs to include jobs like hers \u2014 therapists working with traumatized children and at-risk teens.But last Monday, after arriving for work at the Connecticut Juvenile Training School, Ms. DeMarco, a union member, was let go from her $91,600-a-year job.She said she worries \u201cabout the kids who have already had significant trauma in their lives, and they are then re-traumatized by this sudden loss of people they have relationships with, who are advocating for them.\u201dMr. Malloy said during a budget address in February that Connecticut needed to \u201calign state employee benefits with our present economic reality.\u201d His current budget proposal asks nonunion employees to pay a greater share of their health care costs.A union representing health care workers launched a television advertising campaign in early February called \u201cOne Connecticut.\u201d\u201cThere are other ways to close these deficit holes instead of coming back to middle-class workers,\u201d Ms. Schneider said. \u201cIf we lose 2,500 jobs in the state, that\u2019s only going to harm our economy more.\u201dWith deficits also expected in the coming years, Mr. Malloy and members of the state\u2019s General Assembly increasingly find themselves on a tightrope.States typically generate just over one-third of their revenues from personal income taxes, and another third from sales taxes, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Connecticut, by comparison, relies on personal income taxes for more than half of its revenue.While the number of jobs in Connecticut has returned to pre-recession levels, lower-wage positions in finance have taken the place of high-paying jobs, according to a report by the Standard & Poor\u2019s credit ratings agency. That shift translates to lower personal income tax revenues, in a state that relies so heavily on income taxes. \u201cThat makes or breaks Connecticut,\u201d said Arturo Perez, a fiscal research analyst at the National Conference of State Legislatures.In the long term, Connecticut faces a grim balance sheet. For decades, the state did not fully finance its pension plans, and Connecticut now carries more than $26 billion in unfunded pension liabilities.The lawmaker, L. Scott Frantz, a state senator from Greenwich, said, \u201cThe legislature can\u2019t balance a budget to save its life, and with other shortfalls going forward it does not look pretty for the state of Connecticut unless we as a General Assembly get our act together.\u201dMr. Frantz said he thinks Mr. Malloy has a deeper understanding of the state\u2019s tax base today than when he entered the governor\u2019s office in 2011.\u201cHe knows that he can\u2019t afford to lose one more taxpayer,\u201d Mr. Frantz said. \u201cIf he wants a halfway decent legacy, he\u2019s going to have to make sure this fiscal house is dramatically improved.\u201dAn article in some editions on Monday about a budget crisis in Connecticut that has included layoffs of state employees misidentified the group that started the \u201cOne Connecticut\u201d television campaign, which was meant to put a face on state workers. It was a union representing health care workers, not a consortium of 16 unions. The article also referred incorrectly to the people featured in one of the campaign\u2019s commercials. Only one of the people featured was a client of a social services agency, not all three.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Federal Housing Officials Warn Against Blanket Bans of Ex-Offenders", "Date": "2016-04-04", "News": "Supported byPrivate landlords who have blanket bans on renting to people with criminal records are in violation of the Fair Housing Act and can be sued and face penalties for discrimination, the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development said.Mr. Castro said housing bans against former offenders were common.\u201cRight now, many housing providers use the fact of a conviction, any conviction, regardless of what it was for or how long ago it happened, to indefinitely bar folks from housing opportunities,\u201d Mr. Castro said in a statement. \u201cMany people who are coming back to neighborhoods are only looking for a fair chance to be productive members, but blanket policies like this unfairly deny them that chance.\u201dFederal housing officials said the guidance was meant to emphasize to landlords that blanket bans are illegal, as well as to inform housing applicants of their rights. Housing officials said they can investigate violations and bring discrimination charges against landlords that could result in civil penalties for them, and damages for a person denied housing.Lawyers who represent former prisoners said they expected HUD\u2019s stance to lead landlords to revise their screening policies to avoid litigation. The guidance, which is similar to an instruction federal officials already have for public and subsidized housing, could also lead to more and stronger lawsuits against those who continue to deny housing based on criminal history.Concern over restrictions that hinder former prisoners\u2019 efforts to find jobs and homes has taken on urgency in recent years, as pressure has built to ease the high rates of incarceration that followed decades of tough sentencing for drug offenses, which took a harsh toll on minority communities.Research shows that obtaining housing reduces recidivism. But groups like Fortune Society said they have encountered landlords who ban tenants with criminal histories without individual reviews or any regard to evidence of rehabilitation or whether the person poses a threat to safety.Some landlord groups said owners had the right to exercise their own judgment given the liability they face from other tenants if the person commits another crime. Some have partial bans and screen only for certain crimes, such as sex offenses or arson, or allow those who were convicted of misdemeanors but not felonies.(Landlords can continue to exclude those convicted of manufacturing or distributing drugs, the only crimes that are exempted under the Fair Housing Act.)In their response to the Fortune Society lawsuit, Sandcastle Towers Housing Development Fund, the owner of a rental complex in Far Rockaway, Queens, with more than 900 units, and other co-defendants argued that the use of criminal records \u201cserves valid business and security functions of protecting tenants and the property from former convicted criminals.\u201d (The lawsuit, filed in 2014, is pending in United States District Court for the Eastern District in Brooklyn.)\u201cA person who has already demonstrated a disregard for the law, upon penalty of imprisonment, is at greater risk for repeating that conduct, is a greater security risk and is a greater risk of defaulting in making rental payments or in complying with leases,\u201d the defendants said, adding that \u201cconvicted criminals lose some of their rights and privileges as a result of their convictions.\u201dBut federal housing officials said that landlords would have to take a more individualized approach to avoid violating the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits discrimination in the sale, rental or financing of housing based on race, national origin and other protected characteristics. Even those with a partial ban must prove that their policy does not discriminate, by showing that it \u201caccurately distinguishes\u201d between criminal conduct that poses a risk to safety and conduct that does not.\u201cPolicies that exclude persons based on criminal history must be tailored to serve the housing provider\u2019s substantial, legitimate, nondiscriminatory interest and take into consideration such factors as the type of the crime and the length of the time since conviction,\u201d the guidance reads.Some landlord groups said they already advised case-by-case reviews of potential renters.\u201cIt would require everyone to revise whatever policies they have,\u201d said Neil Garfinkel, a lawyer who advises brokers for the trade association. \u201cI always advise a holistic approach and to look at the applicant as a whole.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Financial Tech Debaters Should Look at Rapid Money Movement", "Date": "2016-04-19", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsTalking shops should do more than simply gloomily prognosticate or ardently cheer, even for financial technology. The Bank of England\u2019s Andy Haldane and Deutsche Bank\u2019s boss, John Cryan, are among 53 luminaries backing a new forum to debate financial technology.Data abuse is a concern, as they note in a paper published by the World Economic Forum. They also want new standards to stay ahead of the game. But the biggest risk is how fast and obscurely money can move. Monitoring that should be the new forum\u2019s main task.Technological advances since 2008 rebut a comment made by Paul Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman, that the only successful financial innovation is the A.T.M. Recent inventions offer greater financial inclusion and a potential check on inequality. Mobile phone credits now give remote rural households access to virtual bank accounts. Online automation has brought down the cost of wealth management services that only the rich could afford.Small and medium-size businesses in Spain can now get access to financing in as little as 10 minutes from the peer-to-peer lender Kabbage, says Ralph Hamers, the boss of its partner in the country, the Dutch bank ING.But while fintech promises much, it also poses systemic risks. Regardless of the innovative technology behind it, lending is always likely to carry the danger that borrowers won\u2019t be able to pay. Even if many peer-to-peer lenders now have banklike capital requirements, insufficient regulatory oversight could allow mountains of bad debts to pile up. The risk could be compounded given that the vast majority of these start-ups began during a period of historically low default rates.The threat posed by payment operators is of a different hue. Take the Chinese mobile payments firm Alipay, which now provides almost half a billion users with access to 50,000 stores in Asia. The failure of a firm with that scope potentially could cripple trade and commerce.This new fintech initiative has some of the world\u2019s best financial minds behind it. Yet so does the Bank for International Settlements, which warned of the impending financial crisis at the start of the last decade to no avail. The challenge for fintech\u2019s talking shop will be to translate similar insights into careful scrutiny and action.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Long Primary Carries Costs for Hillary Clinton: Money and Time", "Date": "2016-04-21", "News": "Supported byHillary Clinton has burned through tens of millions of dollars to counter Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in states that are unlikely to be general election battlegrounds, delaying any pivot to the general election and shrinking her potential financial advantage over the eventual Republican nominee.While Mrs. Clinton has built a significant advantage in pledged delegates over Mr. Sanders in the Democratic nominating contest, her lead has come at a significant cost. She spent more than she raised in each of the first three months of the year, according to Federal Election Commission data, including more than $12 million on ads in March alone.According to the Campaign Media Analysis Group, Mrs. Clinton has spent at least $20 million on advertising in states like New York, Illinois and Massachusetts, money that could otherwise have been saved for the general election.See how the latest fund-raising numbers from the campaigns and outside groups stack up.\u201cHe is making Hillary Clinton spend money that should be spent defeating the Republicans,\u201d said John Morgan, a Florida trial lawyer who will host a Clinton fund-raiser at his Lake Mary home next week. \u201cBernie Sanders has the real possibility of being the modern-day Ralph Nader. All he\u2019s doing now is hurting Hillary.\u201dThe lengthening primary poses potential problems not just on the spending side of the ledger, but also has delayed a shift to raising money for the general election, where Mrs. Clinton lags well behind the pace set by President Obama during his 2012 campaign, according to data from the commission.An interactive delegate calculator that lets you simulate how the 2016 Republican nomination process could unfold.\u201cWe head into the homestretch of the primary in strong financial shape with the resources we need to continue to run a competitive race through the end of the primary and the road ahead,\u201d said Robby Mook, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign manager.But as the Clinton campaign and its allies see the challenge from Mr. Sanders fading and have grown more comfortable with their delegate lead, they are shifting some of their attention away from the primary and looking toward the general election, mapping out fund-raising plans and sharpening their message.The campaign has begun discussions with senior \u201cbundlers\u201d \u2014 donors who volunteer to collect checks from dozens of other donors \u2014 to step up contributions to the Hillary Victory Committee, a joint fund-raising effort with the Democratic National Committee and many state Democratic organizations.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.By directing her largest donors to give more to party organizations, Mrs. Clinton can sock away tens of millions of dollars that would benefit her campaign during a general election effort while avoiding the appearance of presumption that might come with raising general election money while Mr. Sanders remains in the race.The victory committee had raised $61 million through the end of March, according to commission filings, with most of the money ending up back in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign or at the Democratic National Committee. Much as Mr. Obama did in 2012, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s team has used party contributions to the joint committee to subsidize some costs of her presidential campaign, including prospecting for small donors. Mr. Sanders attacked the arrangement this week as unethical, though campaign lawyers said it was legal.On Wednesday, fresh off a victory in the New York primary, the campaign hosted hundreds of bundlers for a conference at a Sheraton hotel in Manhattan, where some of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s top advisers urged donors to focus on bolstering her fund-raising for the contest against Mr. Sanders. Advisers to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign said it was remaining focused on primary dollars in part because that money \u2014 up to $2,700 from each supporter \u2014 could be used during the general election, too, while general election contributions could not be spent until after the party\u2019s convention in July.A \u201csuper PAC\u201d backing Mrs. Clinton is preparing for the worst. Priorities USA Action raised $11.8 million dollars in March and had $44.7 million in cash on hand at the start of April, far ahead of the group\u2019s pace during Mr. Obama\u2019s re-election campaign.Banking on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s increasingly likely victory in the Democratic primary contest, and those pledges, the group has begun reserving $125 million in television and digital advertising for the general election campaign \u2014 a significant sum this early in the race.\u201cPriorities will be ready to fight back against the billion-dollar onslaught Republicans are readying against Hillary Clinton,\u201d said Justin Barasky, a spokesman for Priorities USA.Rachel Shorey, Chase Davis and Nick Corasaniti contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Investing With a Conscience, but Done by a Robot", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported byCracker Barrel Old Country Store, the company behind a chain of down-home restaurants, might not seem an obvious model for advanced financial technology. Its specialty is vintage: vintage food, and in its gift shops, vintage toys and vintage music in the form of hymnal CDs.Yet an upstart fund manager called Arabesque Partners has determined that Cracker Barrel is among the most attractive investments out there in a special category that takes into account environmental, social and governance factors \u2014 known in the industry as ESG.And even more intriguing: The calculation was not made by a human analyst, but by a robotic one.In the most recent full quarter for which data was available, Cracker Barrel represented 1.31 percent of the Arabesque Prime fund, which factors in a company\u2019s sustainability and corporate responsibility track record before investing. That was more than any other stock, including more obvious suspects like Unilever, the consumer goods giant that is obsessed with sustainability, and Xinyi Solar Holdings, a big maker of solar panel components.Arabesque is one of a growing number of investors that are leaning on mountains of new data about companies\u2019 environmental, social and governance performances in hopes of making more profitable trades.New firms like Arabesque are making ESG data a core part of their strategy. Goldman Sachs has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to start an ESG-focused exchange-traded fund. And the biggest money managers in the world, including BlackRock, now regularly incorporate ESG analysis as they compose their portfolios.The motivation is not entirely about ethics. Underpinning the strategy is a belief that companies that take better care of the environment and their communities will perform better in the long run.\u201cNo one wants to be patronized with a moral argument,\u201d said Andreas Feiner, head of ESG research at Arabesque. \u201cYou tell investors that these companies are going to perform better.\u201dAnd yet even among the most strident capitalists, there is a growing sense that doing well by doing good is in vogue.\u201cWe have the opportunity to marry making money with a purpose,\u201d Mr. Feiner said. \u201cThat is a very rare thing in finance.\u201dWhat makes the Arabesque position in Cracker Barrel all the more surprising is that it wasn\u2019t a fund manager who made the decision to invest. It was an algorithm.Arabesque bills itself as the first firm exclusively focused on ESG investing through quantitative analysis \u2014 that is, with algorithms, rather than humans, picking the stocks. It has two funds, with about $50 million under management. Its Prime fund is fully invested in equities and rebalanced quarterly, while its Systematic fund moves money to cash holdings during periods of market volatility and is rebalanced daily.To make these decisions, Arabesque\u2019s technology relies on an expanding universe of data concerning the ESG performance of thousands of companies. Among the biggest suppliers of such information are Bloomberg, Sustainalytics and MSCI. Bloomberg said that about 15,000 of its customers regularly accessed the ESG data it provided through its terminals.To compile the data, firms like Bloomberg mine regulatory filings, company sustainability reports and websites to find seemingly obscure information, such as how much nitrous oxide a manufacturer emits each year, how many employees died on the job, and how many women are in management positions.Once firms like Arabesque get their hands on the data, they add it to their algorithms and place their faith \u2014 and funds \u2014 in the wisdom of the machine.Arabesque has gone further than most, turning over the entire composition of its funds to algorithms rather than to humans. But many traditional institutional investors are moving in similar directions. At Newton, part of BNY Mellon, ESG considerations are part of the everyday investment decisions.\u201cTo make the best risk-adjusted return decision, what I am doing is thinking more broadly and more holistically about things that a lot of investors don\u2019t traditionally think about,\u201d said Sandra Carlisle, head of responsible investment at Newton. \u201cTake climate change. It\u2019s very clear that that manifests itself in physical risk, in all sorts of things. That was not something that we were thinking about in the 20th century.\u201dBNY Mellon scoops up data from Bloomberg and Sustainalytics, as well as RepRisk, which does broad ESG analysis; CDP, which focuses on carbon emissions; and Institutional Shareholder Services, a corporate governance specialist.About 15 years ago, the accounting scandals at Enron and WorldCom began to focus investors\u2019 attention on the importance of corporate governance. After that, investors began to wonder if environmental and social factors should be on their radar, too.\u201cThe door opened a crack so you could have a conversation about the possibility of these things,\u201d said Michael Jantzi, chief executive of Sustainalytics, one of the main providers of ESG data.\u201cMore and more people are realizing that this is a smart thing to do when you\u2019re making investments,\u201d Ms. Carlisle said. \u201cBetter to know than not to know.\u201dAdvertisement"}

For years, making sure that amount was on hand had been a perfunctory, check-the-box assignment.That all changed in the summer of 2007, when two Bear Stearns-related hedge funds collapsed and Bear liquidated them. Short-term lenders began to question the judgment of Bear\u2019s management, and Mr. Friedman was on the front lines of gauging how the market viewed the firm as a credit risk. He quickly discovered, much to his dismay, that Bear had become a pariah.After the final Bear Stearns shareholder meeting, on May 29, 2008, Mr. Friedman told me, in no uncertain terms, that he believed the firm got what was coming to it. \u201cWe\u2019re the bad guys,\u201d he said. \u201cWe did this to ourselves. We put ourselves in a position where this could happen. It is our fault for allowing it to get this far, and for not taking any steps to do anything about it. It\u2019s a classic case of mismanagement at the top. There\u2019s just no question about it.\u201dBut times and perspectives change. When Mr. Friedman appeared before the government\u2019s Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission two years later, Phil Angelides, the commission\u2019s chairman, asked about his comments to me that Bear had been responsible for its own downfall. Much to my surprise, under oath and on national television, Mr. Friedman walked back the statement. After explaining to Mr. Angelides how shocking it was to watch the firm he had worked at for 27 years suddenly implode, he said, \u201cI was angry. I was interviewed over a period when I was looking to find someone to blame. I lashed out.\u201d He apologized and said he had been regretting what he told me two years earlier.The emails show Mr. Friedman\u2019s concern about the firm\u2019s liquidity began in earnest in June 2007, just as the two hedge funds were being shuttered and as the firm was getting ready to announce its second-quarter earnings. They also show how sensitive Bear executives were to outside perceptions of the firm.On June 25, Timothy Greene, the co-head of fixed income at Bear, emailed Mr. Friedman about the dangers of traders using Bear\u2019s balance sheet to trade for customers. \u201cWe are being very careful not to signal any hint of liquidity distress,\u201d he wrote. Mr. Friedman wrote in reply, \u201cWe\u2019re going to think how to craft the message in terms of getting rid of aged positions, paring down risk, etc., so as not to spook anyone.\u201dWhen Standard & Poor\u2019s, the rating agency, revised its outlook for Bear to negative, from stable, on Aug. 3, 2007, top Bear executives scrambled to put a good spin that, too. \u201cWe need to create more liquidity ASAP,\u201d said Sam Molinaro, Bear\u2019s chief financial officer, in an email to Michael Minikes, another senior Bear executive, that day.But liquidity remained a major problem. Banks were ending their \u201cevergreen\u201d financing arrangements with Bear, and Mr. Friedman doubted they would be available to the firm again unless they \u201chave amnesia,\u201d he wrote. On Aug. 20, Mr. Friedman wrote that since the S.&P. report, Bear had lost $14.5 billion in existing funding and had received only $2.7 billion from new sources. He noted that another $3.1 billion n funding was \u201calready scheduled to be pulled\u201d or was \u201cat risk of leaving.\u201d He expected another $1.9 billion in borrowings to be lost in the next week or two. There was also a \u201csignificant dispute\u201d with State Street Bank over the valuation of the collateral backing its $1 billion loan to Bear, \u201cand it\u2019s clear that what they\u2019d most like is to simply pull it.\u201dOn Dec. 3, 2007, Mr. Friedman noted in an email to executives in the fixed-income division that the firm was \u201cstarting to see some significant pullback in funding\u201d and lost \u201cclose to $2 billion in cash\u201d in one day. \u201cIt\u2019s getting ugly out there,\u201d he wrote.In a Dec. 15 memo to Thomas Marano, the other co-head of fixed income, Mr. Friedman said he worried that another $10 billion to $30 billion of short-term funding would be pulled if and when Moody\u2019s Investors Service downgraded the firm as he expected it would (and which it did five days later). \u201cWe will also effectively be out of the derivatives business \u2013 equities, rates and credit \u2013 since we already have firms refusing our name and many more will refuse us then,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEither way, we\u2019re dead, whether from lack of cash or lack of customers.\u201dIn the same email, Mr. Friedmann worried that Bear employees would soon recognize the reality that Bear might well be out of business. Faced with a lean year for compensation \u201cand the prospect of effectively winding down the firm over the next quarter, how do they respond?\u201d he asked, rhetorically. \u201cI think we all know: Any that can find another place to work will do so. So we\u2019ll be alive in the way that a patient on life support is alive, hoping for a miracle.\u201dHe then asked Mr. Marano why Bear\u2019s executive committee had failed to understand the seriousness of the firm\u2019s predicament. \u201cBeats the hell out of me,\u201d Mr. Friedman wrote. He added that Robert Upton, the treasurer, had spoken to Mr. Molinaro, the chief financial officer, a dozen times but had \u201cbeen rebuffed.\u201d Mr. Friedman wrote that he had spoken \u201cover and over\u201d with Steven Begleiter, the head of corporate strategy, \u201cand been told that no one believes things are that urgent.\u201d Mr. Friedman wondered if the executive committee was \u201cconfusing\u201d raising new equity with having sufficient funding to run the business. \u201cRaising new capital won\u2019t fix the world around us,\u201d he concluded in the email, just three months before the firm\u2019s demise. \u201cBut the point that gets lost is that if we don\u2019t do it we won\u2019t be here when the world gets back to normal.\u201dIn the end, Bear\u2019s top executives opted not to raise new equity. And the firm was no longer around when the world got back to normal.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Colorado Weighs Replacing Obama\u2019s Health Policy With Universal Coverage", "Date": "2016-04-28", "News": "Supported byDENVER \u2014 For years, voters in this swing state have rejected tax increases and efforts to expand government. But now they are flirting with a radical transformation: whether to abandon President Obama\u2019s health care policy and instead create a new, taxpayer-financed public health system that guarantees coverage for everyone.The estimated $38-billion-a-year proposal, which will go before Colorado voters in November, will test whether people have an appetite for a new system that goes further than the Affordable Care Act. That question is also in play in the Democratic presidential primaries.The state-level effort, which supporters here call the ColoradoCare plan, would do away with deductibles. It would allow patients to choose doctors and specialists without distinguishing between those \u201cin network\u201d and those \u201cout of network.\u201d It would largely be paid for with a tax increase on workers and businesses, and cover everyone in the state. Supporters say most people would end up saving money.Insurance groups, chambers of commerce and conservatives have already lined up in opposition. They say the plan\u2019s details are vague, its size and cost galling. The proposed health system would have a budget bigger than that of Colorado\u2019s entire state government. A new 10 percent tax on payroll and incomes to pay for the system would push Colorado\u2019s tax rates to some of the highest in the nation.The proposal\u2019s chance of success is dubious. Colorado has a mixed record when it comes to ballot measures, though it has passed some notable ones over the years, including marijuana legalization and the Taxpayer Bill of Rights, an anti-tax, anti-spending constitutional amendment.But the proposal had enough support to garner 100,000 signatures, which put it on the ballot. It has also worried insurers, and some in the medical community and the business community, enough for them to organize in opposition, even enlisting a Democratic former governor to help in their campaign.In this season of political discontent, the notion of dismantling the health insurance system has tapped an aquifer of frustration from voters. People say that even after the Affordable Care Act, they still pay too much in premiums, plus thousands in deductibles, and still have to worry about being bankrupted by a disabling car crash or an extended hospital stay.\u201cI think insurance is one of the biggest jokes and crooks,\u201d said Brandon Barta, 38, of Denver. He said his father, Dixon, who worked at a gas station, never received aggressive enough treatment for his prostate cancer. He died last May at the age of 64.\u201cHe was overlooked,\u201d Mr. Barta said.Mr. Barta said he was intrigued by the idea of a universal health plan that covered maternity care, checkups, emergency room visits and hospital stays, all the way through end-of-life care. Like millions of Americans, he has health insurance tied to his work. His coverage lapsed recently when he switched jobs to start working for a golf entertainment complex, and he is still waiting for his new plan to kick in.Still, he has questions about how universal coverage would work and how much it would cost taxpayers like him.The answers: If a majority of voters say yes, the system would start running in 2019, and essentially be a start-up health cooperative bigger than companies like Nike and American Express, according to the Colorado Health Institute, an independent policy group. A 21-person elected board would set the benefits and budgets. The system would be financed by payroll taxes of 3.3 percent for workers and 6.7 percent for employers. It would impose a 10 percent tax on investment income, people who are self-employed and some small-business income.In the contest for the Democratic presidential nomination, Hillary Clinton, echoing many moderate Democratic leaders here, has said that she wants to keep and improve the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Obama\u2019s signature legislative legacy. But her opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders, who won Colorado\u2019s Democratic caucuses last month by nearly 20 points, has advocated abandoning the health law for a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d approach. His proposal is similar to the ColoradoCare plan.The campaign over the Colorado initiative has had the unusual effect of putting conservative critics in the position of defending Mr. Obama\u2019s health plan against an assault from the left. At the same time, it is energizing progressives, who say the Affordable Care Act was a giveaway to the insurance industry that, even with an estimated 20 million people newly insured, has left too many others without coverage.\u201cNo matter how long we hang in there with the Affordable Care Act, we will never cover everybody,\u201d said Jeanne Nicholson, a former Democratic state senator and nurse who is a leading supporter of universal care here. \u201cWe don\u2019t understand why we should compromise and say some people can have bronze coverage, some can have silver and some can have gold. Why can\u2019t we all have platinum plus?\u201dNathan Wilkes, 42, who lives in the Denver suburbs, said that years of trying to get care for his son, who has hemophilia, had worn his family thin and made him an advocate for universal coverage. He said the family had spent thousands of dollars and destroyed its credit because of insufficient coverage. The Affordable Care Act offered some benefits, he said, but its gaps were still too big and \u201cnot sustainable.\u201dUnlike its conservative neighbors, Colorado jumped to get on board with the Affordable Care Act. It set up its own insurance marketplace and expanded Medicaid coverage for poorer residents. But there have been stumbles. People in mountain towns with few providers faced eye-popping premiums for coverage. Colorado\u2019s biggest health cooperative, Colorado HealthOP, shut down in October, forcing more than 80,000 people to find new plans.Colorado\u2019s plan would replace many private workplace plans, but it would sit alongside Medicare and federal health coverage for veterans, and private insurers could still sell coverage to people who wanted more.The Colorado Health Institute, an independent policy group, said the plan\u2019s passage would be \u201cthe most far-reaching health care reform in any state\u201d since the Affordable Care Act.\u201cIt\u2019s replacing a system that I think has become really dysfunctional,\u201d said Irene Aguilar, a Democratic state senator and physician who is leading the effort. \u201cThe game has been rigged by the for-profit corporations to ensure they win.\u201dOpponents say that it could wreck the state\u2019s humming economy and drive away doctors and businesses, and that its costs could spiral out of control.If it passes, ColoradoCare would become part of the state Constitution, and become virtually impossible to significantly alter without a statewide vote. It would also fall outside the reach of the Taxpayer Bill of Rights, a 1992 amendment to the Colorado Constitution that put strict limits on spending and new taxes.\u201cIt would be a disastrous economic impact on the state,\u201d said Walker Stapleton, Colorado\u2019s treasurer and a co-chairman of the opposition campaign. \u201cIf you think legalized pot brought a lot of people to Colorado, you should try free health care.\u201dLike many other Republicans here, Mr. Stapleton opposed the Affordable Care Act and continues to criticize how it has been put in place. But to defeat the new initiative, he now finds himself defending the federal health law.Sean Duffy, a Republican and a spokesman for the opposition campaign, said many of his neighbors in the conservative Denver suburb of Highlands Ranch had eagerly signed the petition to put the question on the November ballot because they saw it as a way to get rid of Obamacare.Some Democratic officials also oppose the state\u2019s universal care effort. They include Gov. John Hickenlooper, who said during his 2014 re-election fight that he was \u201cno big fan of the Affordable Care Act.\u201dColorado\u2019s previous Democratic governor, Bill Ritter, also opposes it.Michelle Lucero, general counsel at Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado, is among the health care officials lining up against the measure. (The hospital itself also opposes it.) She worries that it could threaten research dollars or drive away doctors.\u201cThey\u2019re going to choose to go to a state that\u2019s not hamstrung by this,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Discord Grows Among the Parties Over Greek Debt Talks", "Date": "2016-04-17", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Executives of the International Monetary Fund mutter darkly about Greeks tapping their phones in Athens. Greek government officials accuse the fund of torpedoing their economy via tough austerity measures.And both the Greeks and the fund moan about the refusal of Germany to consider any form of debt relief for Greece.Signs of the growing tensions over Greece and its debt were evident at meetings of the I.M.F. in Washington last week. But nothing exemplifies the growing discord more than a simple chart on a draft memorandum drawn up by the fund that has been making the rounds at meetings here.The chart depicts just how wide the gap is between Europe and the I.M.F. in terms of assessing Greece\u2019s ability to pay down its growing debt burden \u2014 currently close to 180 percent of its gross domestic product \u2014 in the coming decades.And it highlights the danger that, just as it was last summer, Greece may be pushed to the edge of bankruptcy as a result of an inability, if not an unwillingness, of the fund, Europe and Greece to reach a compromise.Ever skeptical of Greece\u2019s capacity to keep a lid on spending and to increase taxes over the years, the fund\u2019s economists project that the debt will approach 300 percent of G.D.P. by 2060 \u2014 an outcome depicted vividly on the chart as a line sloping sharply upward.The stance of Europe, which is on the hook for a much larger chunk of the debt than the I.M.F., is represented by a line trending defiantly downward.In the view of finance ministers in the euro area, Greece will meet the demands of the toughest austerity program ever imposed upon a nation and will generate enough cash to bring the debt below 100 percent of G.D.P.The implication of the chart and the accompanying memorandum \u2014 neither of which has been made public \u2014 is that the I.M.F., as things stand, will not be able to support the next bailout agreement that Greece and Europe reach.Late last week, the managing director of the I.M.F., Christine Lagarde, said publicly what many senior fund officials have said quietly for months: Europe\u2019s assumption that Greece, in the decades ahead, can annually achieve a budget surplus (minus interest payments) of 3.5 percent of G.D.P. and pay down its debt is \u201chighly unrealistic\u201d and would require a \u201cheroic\u201d sacrifice from an austerity-battered populace.That assessment is hardly a surprise. Since the spring of 2010, the time of the first Greek bailout, I.M.F. economists have been saying that Greece would never be able to pay back such a tremendous amount of debt.They contend that in terms of money borrowed and economic output lost, the Greek crisis has far exceeded even the classic emerging market busts in Latin America and Asia \u2014 many of which were resolved via various forms of debt restructuring.As a result, they conclude, the very thought that Greece can pay its way out of this mess without having its debt reduced in some way is fantasy.\u201cThere is no exit for Greece without debt relief,\u201d Mr. Gourinchas said.Part of the problem is that the fund\u2019s role now is highly unorthodox. While the fund is owed $12 billion, it is not promising to lend any new money this year, which, at least in the view of the Greeks, reduces its credibility. Isn\u2019t it hypocritical of the fund, some Greek officials say in private, to push us so hard when it is not willing to lend new money? At least the Europeans are promising to put more money on the table, they point out.Fund officials have responded: How can we be your enemy if we are the ones pressuring Europe to give you a break on your debt?In the phone transcript, published by WikiLeaks, it was suggested that the only way to get an agreement would be to push Greece once again to the precipice of default.\u201cI brought this up with my Greek colleagues,\u201d said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the finance minister from the Netherlands, who is leading Europe in the talks with Greece. \u201cIt\u2019s an issue of trust \u2014 how can the I.M.F. do its work if they have to worry all the time about having their phones tapped?\u201dAs to the matter of Greece\u2019s debt, Mr. Dijsselbloem remained adamant: It is not being discussed.While it remains most unlikely that the I.M.F. would walk away from the talks, that such a step is even being suggested underscores how uncertain the negotiations have become.That is because Germany has frequently said that it requires the I.M.F. to be an active participant in the process. So if the fund does not bless an agreement, Germany will be very unlikely to embrace it.Despite all the tensions, negotiations are continuing. Greece, unlike in past years, sent its full team of negotiators to Washington last Thursday to resume talks that had been temporarily suspended.They include the finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos; the debt expert Stelios Papadopoulos; the economy minister, Giorgos Stathakis; and the Greek government\u2019s longstanding financial adviser, Glenn Kim, an independent investment banker who previously worked for Moelis and Lehman Brothers.The crux of the talks has long been Greece\u2019s bloated pension program, which still pays out about 10 percent of G.D.P. annually. Fund officials have always said that without significant pension cuts, they could not approve any new deal.Greece has argued that, in depression-like economic conditions, Greeks cannot afford pension cuts, especially when pensioners are now the only breadwinners in many families.Under the labor minister, Georgios Katrougalos, the Greek government is now pushing a plan that would freeze current payouts and cut future ones and that would increase contributions from employers.Whether that will be enough to win over the I.M.F. and, ultimately, Europe regarding the debt question remains to be seen.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Afghan Women, Eager to Play, Are Relegated to the Sidelines", "Date": "2016-04-26", "News": "Supported bySome consist of little more than a young woman with a business card and a desk, as one insider described the women\u2019s version of cricket, Afghanistan\u2019s most popular game. Others, like women\u2019s soccer, have managed to field a few teams for practices and training sessions but have not played an international match in years.Even the relatively few encouraging stories, like women\u2019s taekwondo, one of the sports that may see an Afghan woman sent to the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, are at best qualified successes. Afghanistan\u2019s strongest hope for a female taekwondo medalist, Somaya Ghulami, 23, actually lives in Iran and commutes to practice sessions here. She said she would never be able to compete if she had to live in her own country.It is a conspicuous failure for Western efforts to improve the lives of Afghan women. With few exceptions, the sports programs have become riddled with corruption and been undermined by conservative Afghans who have never liked the idea of young women on sports fields.One of the main supporters of women\u2019s sports in Afghanistan is the American government, which spends $1.5 million a year on coeducational sports programs \u2014 not counting a $450,000 cricket grant that officials took back when they realized no women\u2019s cricket was being played. American officials, however, declined to discuss women\u2019s sports on the record.Ms. Galpin was upset that sponsors\u2019 gifts, including more than 40 bicycles and other racing gear, valued at more than $100,000, were stolen after being handed over by her organization to the team and Mr. Seddiqi.Mr. Seddiqi was recently dismissed from his post as both coach and head of the federation by the president of the Afghanistan National Olympic Committee, Mohammad Zaher Aghbar, who cited something besides corruption. He claimed that Mr. Seddiqi had successively married and divorced three of the young women on his team. \u201cHe has married three of them \u2014 three times \u2014 and the girls were all complaining about him,\u201d Mr. Aghbar said.In an interview, Mr. Seddiqi denied the corruption charges, claimed Ms. Galpin\u2019s organization was still financing the cycling federation and called the accusations against him \u201ca lot of made-up crap.\u201d Mr. Seddiqi, 62, acknowledged that he had three prior divorces and was now married to a 25-year-old woman, but denied that his current or past wives were ever team members.One national cycling champion (Mr. Seddiqi also controlled the men\u2019s team), Hashmat Barakzai, who recently fled to Germany to claim asylum, said that \u201cSeddiqi used the women\u2019s team as his personal piggy bank and love playground.\u201dMr. Seddiqi\u2019s critics said training was almost nonexistent. \u201cHe would take them out to a roundabout on the highway and ride around in circles,\u201d Ms. Galpin said.\u201cUnder coach,\u201d Ms. Galpin said, referring to Mr. Seddiqi, \u201cit\u2019s zero female empowerment.\u201dCorruption in other women\u2019s sports might not be quite as brazen, but it remains a huge problem. Diana Barakzai, who played for Afghanistan\u2019s women\u2019s cricket team when it was actually functioning, in 2009, said she was approached recently by the Afghanistan Cricket Board about heading up a women\u2019s team.\u201cThey told me they already made a deal with someone to pay them $180,000 for the job, but if you\u2019re willing to pay $200,000 you can have it,\u201d she said, adding that she turned the offer down.Ms. Barakzai, who is not related to Mr. Barakzai, said she was surprised by the demand, since she assumed there was no money to be made in women\u2019s cricket. Besides, the national team had not competed \u2014 or even practiced \u2014 in at least three years.But it turned out that the United States Embassy had awarded a grant of $450,000 last summer to promote women\u2019s cricket and had sent it to Lapis Communications, a private organization, to administer. Those funds have now been returned to the American Embassy, said a Lapis official, Sarah-Jean Cunningham. \u201cThis program did not get the traction it needed to justify pushing forward,\u201d she said.Shafiq Stanikzai, the chief executive officer of the Afghanistan Cricket Board, denied Ms. Barakzai\u2019s accusations. \u201cThat\u2019s totally a false claim that she made and a very stupid one,\u201d he said.Mr. Stanikzai said that there was a national women\u2019s cricket program but that it was operating in secret. \u201cWe are not publicizing that due to certain limitations,\u201d he said. \u201cThe national team is functioning but at a very basic level, as they are not good enough to compete at an international level.\u201dBut Peter Anderson, an Australian cricket coach who was brought to Afghanistan several years ago to train its women\u2019s cricket team, said the cricket board was so against women participating that it had dismantled what women\u2019s team there was. He said he quit after being shunted to coaching the disabled team.Tuba Sangar is the current head of women\u2019s cricket \u2014 the person Mr. Anderson described as \u201ca girl in an office with a business card.\u201d When contacted, she said she was not allowed to comment.Robina Jalali was on the first women\u2019s team to compete in 2004 in the Olympics for Afghanistan after the Taliban were toppled.

Now the head of women\u2019s sports at the National Olympic Committee, she says that even the foreign embassies are no longer paying much attention.\u201cThe main problem is the growing insecurity we have; secondly, violence against women, which is growing.

She said security concerns, family pressure and public harassment were not the only difficulties the soccer players faced. The national team has lost more members to marriage than anything else, she said, because Afghan women are considered too old to wed after their early 20s, and their husbands typically refuse to allow them to play.Taekwondo has been similarly hurt, Ms. Ghulami said during a recent training session here, adding, \u201cFortunately, I have a liberal family that does support me \u2014 and we live in Iran.\u201dAhmad Shakib and Jawad Sukhanyar contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Milan the Real Capital of Italy?", "Date": "2016-04-26", "News": "Supported byMILAN \u2014 IF you walk around Rome, and you survive the speeding mo-peds and the taxi drivers fuming at the tourists wandering across the road, you soon understand why locals claim to live in the most beautiful place in the world. The city is a breathtaking concentration of history, art and charm \u2014 every corner could fill your eyes, your camera and your typical American romantic comedy.But Rome, despite all of this, is a gloomy place these days. The economy is stagnant, corruption is rife and no one seems to know or even care how to get things moving again.In contrast, if you walk around Milan, and you survive the bus drivers swearing at pedestrians who cross against the lights, hunched over their phones, you soon understand why the Milanese think their city is Italy\u2019s actual guiding light. It has become, in the last few years, an irresistible magnet for young people from all over the country, who flock here to work in design, media, fashion and food.You can hear regional accents from every corner of the country and see all kinds of faces, from wiry, dark-haired Sardinian girls to tall, blond boys from Alto Adige. That\u2019s why Milan, today, is happy.Rival cities are commonplace: New York and Los Angeles, Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo, Beijing and Shanghai, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, Madrid and Barcelona. In Italy, it\u2019s Rome and Milan. But the match has never been more uneven.Rome is in a foul mood. It\u2019s gone from scandal to scandal, some of them truly embarrassing. Last year a major investigation known as Mafia Capitale revealed the cozy relationship between organized crime and Italian politicians. As a result, Rome\u2019s mayor, Ignazio Marino \u2014 not an accomplice, more of a hapless bystander \u2014 resigned in October.Then it got worse. The city is plagued not only by widespread corruption but also by everyday inefficiency and insiderism. Francesco Paolo Tronca, who replaced Mr. Marino, found out that the municipality owns more than 28,000 real estate units, on which the unpaid rents amount to $400 million. Apparently, 85 percent of the tenants don\u2019t care to cough up, or don\u2019t have to. Or they pay $36 a month for a villa with a view over the Colosseum \u2014 or $5.50 for a place on the Campo de\u2019 Fiori. Yes, really.Milan, on the other hand, is in an ebullient mood. Last year\u2019s expo, with 21 million visitors, seven million of them from abroad, was an unexpected success. The city\u2019s annual Salone del Mobile, the annual furniture fair, is now the benchmark for the furnishing and design industries, the largest of its kind in the world. This month it attracted 400,000 visitors \u2014 70 percent of them foreigners \u2014 and transformed the city in another weeklong movable feast.High-rise towers are going up across the city, transforming the skyline. Fashion, design, art, advertising, publishing \u2014 Milan is the go-to city for all these sectors, as well as, increasingly, manufacturing and finance. Rome stays afloat with politics, public television and cinema.The comparison is even harsher when it comes to the public sector: hospitals, garbage disposal, transportation and infrastructure. Around 40 percent of Rome\u2019s streets have major cracks and potholes; there are several blogs and Facebook pages devoted to the \u201cbuche di Roma\u201d (\u201choles of Rome\u201d). Milan, in contrast, does all these things right.Exacerbating the difference is Rome\u2019s indifference. A columnist wrote last week in Corriere della Sera: \u201cRomans believe they know everything. They look down cynically at the world from what they call the Eternal City.\u201d Maybe it\u2019s a little harsh, but there\u2019s some truth in it. The place is so beautiful that its residents think beauty alone is enough. When they realize that modern urban life needs more than that \u2014 efficient public transport and honest managers, for instance \u2014 they say they want to change things. But change is painful. And beautiful, seductive Rome is there to whisper: \u201cWhy bother? Don\u2019t!\u201dIn June, both cities will choose new mayors. In Milan the picture is clear. Two previous city managers, Beppe Sala and Stefano Parisi, represent left and right. Both are considered competent (Mr. Sala was the boss of the Expo). Either way, Milan will be fine.One thing is true of both cities: Whoever wins will have his or her work cut out. Rome must learn to combine its spectacular heritage with higher standards in daily life. La dolce vita must meet la vita pratica halfway. You don\u2019t enjoy the Colosseum if you waste an hour waiting for a bus that never arrives.Over the past hundred years, many of Italy\u2019s pivotal changes \u2014 good and bad \u2014 began in Milan: socialism, Great War fever, Fascism, the resistance to Fascism, the economic boom of the \u201960s, the political turmoil of the \u201970s, the Clean Hands anti-corruption campaign, the populist Northern League. And now, this young, lively and colorful renaissance.Milan\u2019s challenge is to spread its current success to the rest of the country. Show that there\u2019s an entrepreneurial spirit across Italy, and that the young people who flock to Milan to find it might be persuaded to stay at home, if they could find the same opportunities. Give a chance to the smart new Italians that fill the piazzas on these spring nights. They\u2019ll take care of it.Beppe Severgnini is a columnist at Corriere della Sera and the author of \u201cMamma Mia!: Berlusconi Explained for Posterity and Friends Abroad.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Panel Would Make Insurers Help Contain Rising Drug Costs", "Date": "2016-04-18", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 An influential federal advisory panel is calling for Congress to force private insurers to rein in rapid increases in prescription drug costs \u2014 by cutting some Medicare payments to insurance companies while shielding older Americans from higher out-of-pocket expenses.But with drug prices increasing, Medicare beneficiaries now find that they may have thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket costs, even with prescription coverage, and the government is subsidizing more of the benefit than originally intended.Federal spending on prescription drugs under Part D rose 16.6 percent last year, to $75 billion, in part because of new drugs to treat hepatitis C. The Congressional Budget Office expects similar growth this year.Beneficiaries are feeling the pinch. Barbara N. DalPonte, 67, who lives in a suburb of Salem, Ore., takes six drugs, including one for chronic lung problems and another, Nexium, for excess stomach acid. She was in a Humana plan last year, but when she learned that the costs to her would total $7,400 this year, she switched to one offered by another company \u2014 EnvisionRx, a unit of Rite Aid \u2014 with out-of-pocket costs of $3,400.\u201cThe costs are distressing,\u201d she said, \u201cbut the drugs are effective, they work for me, and I don\u2019t know what I would do if I did not have coverage for them.\u201dAt the same time, the panel said, Congress should eliminate Medicare beneficiaries\u2019 5 percent share of drug costs above the threshold.John F. Hoadley, a research professor at Georgetown University and a commission member, said this change would be \u201ca huge benefit\u201d for people with very high drug costs.The recommendations will be included in a June report to Congress, which often heeds the panel\u2019s advice.\u201cOut-of-pocket costs can exceed thousands of dollars for beneficiaries who take just one specialty drug or a large number of less costly brands and generics,\u201d the Kaiser Family Foundation, which tracks the health insurance market, said in a recent report.Dr. Rita F. Redberg, a commission member and cardiologist at the University of California, San Francisco, noted that many of the medicines approved recently by the Food and Drug Administration were costly specialty drugs.Pharmaceutical companies and advocates for beneficiaries said some of the panel\u2019s recommendations could harm patients\u2019 access to certain medicines and raise costs for some low-income people.Opinion polls show that a majority of Americans of both political parties support government action to keep down drug costs. Those costs have become an issue in the presidential campaign, with Donald J. Trump, Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders all saying Medicare should directly negotiate prices with drug manufacturers, a practice now forbidden in Part D.Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee, said he was drafting legislation to cap certain drug costs in Part D. Most types of health insurance, other than the traditional fee-for-service Medicare program, have limits on out-of-pocket costs, he noted.\u201cIt defies common sense that a similar protection has not been put in place for seniors, especially with the rise of high-cost prescription drugs,\u201d he said.The commission would give insurers new tools to manage Medicare drug benefits. It would, for example, grant insurers more discretion in covering antidepressants and immunosuppressants, used in transplants. Medicare now requires insurers to cover \u201call or substantially all\u201d drugs in those \u201cprotected\u201d classes.It would also require some beneficiaries to pay more for brand-name drugs before qualifying for so-called catastrophic coverage. And it would create financial incentives for greater use of generics by low-income people, who, the commission says, account for about 70 percent of Part D spending.\u201cThese recommendations will significantly harm beneficiaries by eroding coverage and protections for some of the most vulnerable enrollees,\u201d said Allyson Funk, a spokeswoman for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a trade group.Andrew Sperling, a lobbyist at the National Alliance on Mental Illness, said the proposals \u201ccould adversely affect people with serious mental illness who are below the poverty level.\u201dClare Krusing, a spokeswoman for America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, a trade group, criticized the proposed cut in Medicare payments, saying this change could lead to higher premiums for beneficiaries.Medicare beneficiaries with incomes less than 150 percent of the poverty level \u2014 under $17,820 a year for an individual \u2014 can often obtain extra help with drug costs through Medicare Part D. But Jocelyne Watrous, who works with clients at the nonprofit Center for Medicare Advocacy in Willimantic, Conn., said that for people with somewhat higher incomes, the out-of-pocket costs could be unmanageable.\u201cAs a result,\u201d she said, \u201cpeople are still skipping doses, cutting pills in two or taking them every other day just to get by.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yahoo Agrees to Give 4 Board Seats to Starboard Value", "Date": "2016-04-27", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For over a year and a half, Yahoo has been tormented by a prominent activist investor who has criticized virtually everything about the company, from its business strategy to its efforts to sell major assets.Now that hedge fund, Starboard Value, is finally getting a seat at the embattled Internet company\u2019s table, heading off a potentially distracting fight and perhaps easing the way for a potential sale of its core business.\u201cWe look forward to getting started right away and working closely with management and our fellow board members with the common goal of maximizing value for all shareholders,\u201d Mr. Smith said in a statement.The move may let Yahoo focus more on its sales efforts while also quieting one of the company\u2019s biggest and most persistent gadflies, since Starboard must now refrain from public criticism. The company had engaged two sets of bankers over the last several months: some to run defense against Starboard, others to supervise the auction.Giving those seats to Starboard may also remove some additional doubts about the seriousness of Yahoo\u2019s intent in exploring a sale, a process that several people involved have described as messy and confusing. The hedge fund had latched on to those concerns as part of its activism campaign.As part of the settlement, two existing directors will step down, leaving the board at 11 members. Coupled with the two new directors appointed by Yahoo last month, more than half of the company\u2019s board will be new this year.The other new additions to the board are Tor R. Braham, a former technology investment banker at Deutsche Bank; Eddy W. Hartenstein, a director of Tribune Publishing and former chief executive of The Los Angeles Times; and Richard S. Hill, chairman of Tessera Technologies.At the same time that a settlement has been reached, Yahoo and its board are still combing through the preliminary bids received last week. Among them were proposals from Verizon Communications, seen as the early leader in the sales process, and from investment firms like TPG Capital, Silver Lake and a consortium led by Bain Capital and Vista Equity Partners.Removing Starboard\u2019s threat of a board fight might mean that Yahoo no longer feels compelled to complete its sales process before its next annual shareholder meeting. The agreement with Starboard says Yahoo must hold its meeting by June 30. Still, company executives have expressed confidence in the speed of the process, and Mr. Smith is likely to keep pressing for a timely conclusion.Hopes for a deal have helped lift Yahoo\u2019s stock price more than 11 percent so far this year. But investors largely shrugged off the agreement on Wednesday, and shares closed down 0.43 percent.For investors, little matters more now than whether Yahoo can find a buyer for its core Internet business, including its huge sports, finance and mail arms. A weak quarterly earnings report last week, in which sales fell 11 percent, underscored the continuing troubles that have plagued the company.Despite its huge presence in the early days of the web, Yahoo has steadily lost ground to newer competitors like Google and Facebook, leaving it to grasp for solutions to turn around its business. A succession of chief executives, the latest being the Google veteran Marissa Mayer, have failed to find an effective answer.That has drawn a number of activist investors over the years that have sought to shake up the company. Before Starboard it was Third Point, the firm run by the billionaire Daniel S. Loeb, who successfully ousted Ms. Mayer\u2019s predecessor and called for the hiring of the Google engineer.But Ms. Mayer\u2019s various initiatives have not panned out. In September 2014, Starboard \u2014 a roughly five-year-old firm with a growing reputation as a successful activist investor \u2014 emerged, leading with criticism of the company\u2019s strategy.Starboard and Mr. Smith later added criticism of how Yahoo planned to sell its remaining stake in the Alibaba Group of China and, eventually, Ms. Mayer\u2019s overall performance, to their complaints.Little love has been lost between the two sides in the last year and a half, with Ms. Mayer believing Starboard to be a nuisance and disrespectful and Mr. Smith publicly calling for the ouster of Yahoo\u2019s board. The relationship took a further hit last month when Yahoo filled two board seats hours before the company was set to sit down with Starboard.But both sides continued to work on reaching a settlement, which has become more and more common in corporate America as companies and activists alike seek to avoid the expense and uncertainty of running a full-blown proxy fight.While corporate boards initially viewed such rabble-rousers as threats to be fought, they have increasingly opened up and offered director seats to end hostilities.Starboard won seats on Wednesday not only at Yahoo but also at Marvell Technologies, a chip maker that the hedge fund had fought against for only a few months. At Marvell, the activist investor won four board seats and will have a say in the selection of the company\u2019s next chief executive.Some on the receiving end of Starboard\u2019s campaigns have eventually formed cordial relationships with the hedge fund. One of the new Yahoo directors who had been proposed by Starboard, Mr. Hill, was on Tessera\u2019s board when that company battled against the activist investor three years ago.The alternative could be far worse. Starboard, for instance, ousted the entire board of Darden Restaurants, the parent of the Olive Garden chain, after rallying fellow investors unhappy with the company\u2019s financial performance.\u201cThis constructive resolution will allow management and the board to keep our focus on our extremely important objectives,\u201d Ms. Mayer said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cManagement is looking forward to working with the entire board, including the new directors, to maximize shareholder value.\u201dGiving activist investors a role in the boardroom also helps to silence them, since such settlements \u2014 like the one at Yahoo \u2014 include nondisparagement clauses that prohibit these firms from publicly criticizing their companies.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Spending Bill Falters in Clash Over Amendment Tied to Iran Nuclear Pact", "Date": "2016-04-27", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The first appropriations bill taken up this year by the Senate \u2014 in what was supposed to a be a new spirit of bipartisan cooperation on financing the government \u2014 crashed and burned on Wednesday because of a dispute over an amendment that Democrats and White House officials said would undermine President Obama\u2019s nuclear accord with Iran.The amendment, offered by Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, would bar the United States from purchasing heavy water \u2014 which is used in producing nuclear energy and nuclear weapons \u2014 from Iran. Under Mr. Obama\u2019s nuclear accord, Iran must reduce its supplies of heavy water.The United States and Russia are the world\u2019s largest purchasers.Mr. Cotton, in a floor speech on Wednesday, said the United States should not be subsidizing the Iranian government\u2019s nuclear program and noted that nothing in the agreement requires the United States to buy heavy water from Iran.Mr. Cotton said that he had such great confidence in the merits of his amendment that he had encouraged Democrats to subject it to a 60-vote threshold for approval, even though it could have passed with a simple majority vote.\u201cI have offered to put it at a 60-vote threshold because there are 60 senators who do not believe that the United States should be subsidizing Iran\u2019s heavy water industry,\u201d Mr. Cotton said on the floor.He added, \u201cI want to pass this bill. I want to move on to the next appropriations bill.\u201dSenator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, accused Republicans of sabotaging the energy and water appropriations bill by unveiling Mr. Cotton\u2019s amendment at the last minute.The energy and water appropriations measure, which also covers many national-security related programs, including the nation\u2019s nuclear arsenal, was brought to the floor first this year in part because it was expected to win passage with little rancor.As a result of the Democrats\u2019 opposition, a procedural vote needed to move the bill toward final passage failed on Wednesday morning. The vote was 50 to 46, with 60 votes needed under Senate rules for the bill to move forward.Senate Republican leaders said Mr. Cotton\u2019s amendment was never pending for consideration and accused Democrats of creating a pretense for scuttling the bill.Democrats said Mr. Cotton\u2019s amendment could have been called up for a vote after the procedural step, at a point when Democrats would have been unable to stop the overall bill.They also noted the White House had warned that Mr. Obama would veto the bill if Mr. Cotton\u2019s amendment was attached to it.Appearing uncharacteristically livid, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, took to the floor to assail Democrats.\u201cI think we have come up with yet another definition of obstruction today,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. He accused Democrats of finding \u201ca new way to blow up the appropriations process,\u201d and added, \u201cOur Democratic colleagues were great at dysfunction when they were in the majority and they are pretty good at it in the minority.\u201d\u201cThis is a ridiculous place for the Senate to be,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cRidiculous.\u201dDemocrats, also irritated, said it was Mr. McConnell\u2019s responsibility to prevent members of his Republican conference from introducing amendments that would sabotage legislation that otherwise enjoyed bipartisan support.\u201cThey have an onus to fix it,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York.Democrats insisted that Mr. Cotton was trying to undermine the nuclear accord, and his efforts set off a war of words with the White House.Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, accused Mr. Cotton of putting forward an \u201cideologically motivated policy rider.\u201d\u201cSenator Cotton is certainly no expert when it comes to heavy water,\u201d Mr. Earnest added. \u201cI\u2019m confident that he couldn\u2019t differentiate heavy water from sparkling water. His focus is on undermining the effective implementation of this agreement that prevents Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\u201dMr. Cotton, a graduate of Harvard University and Harvard Law School who joined the Army after the Sept. 11 terror attacks and did combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, took to Twitter in his own defense.\u201cAs for you @PressSec,\u201d he wrote, addressing Mr. Earnest, \u201cYou\u2019re right. I don\u2019t know much about sparkling water. It isn\u2019t served in Army, unlike in your ritzy West Wing.\u201dCongressional Republicans have been under pressure on fiscal matters because of their inability to pass a budget resolution in the House, where hard-line conservatives oppose a bipartisan agreement reached last fall on modest increases in federal spending.Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, who made his name as his party\u2019s most prominent budget architect, has insisted that despite the failure to draft a budget, Republicans would work to adopt annual appropriations bills. In the Senate, Mr. McConnell has similarly set a goal of passing all of the regular appropriations bills and Mr. Reid had previously pledged cooperation.Mr. McConnell\u2019s aides accused Mr. Reid of breaking that pledge by leading Democrats in blocking the energy and water measure.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Fintech Start-Ups, Efforts to Rethink Rules That Cramp Innovation", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Getting a financial start-up off the ground is tough enough.The likelihood of incurring huge legal fees to secure money transmission licenses in all 50 states makes it that much harder. Yet that is what some digital currency start-ups face as a result of a bewildering hodgepodge of regulations across state and national lines that can make it difficult even to know which rules apply.Hoping to remove at least some of the burden, government agencies in the United States and elsewhere have been increasing their efforts to update the regulations.Many of the existing laws apply to older forms of finance like Western Union, the money-transfer company founded 165 years ago to capitalize on telegraph technology. The lack of fresh rules today means that modern fintech start-ups must also adapt to 19th-century regulations.And states have their own rules. In Wyoming, for instance, digital currency start-ups must maintain enormous amounts of capital reserves to operate there.The white paper follows some previous efforts by regulators to revise the rules. Last year, the Treasury Department sought information about marketplace lending, which matches borrowers and lenders over the Internet using algorithms.This year, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau outlined a new policy meant to give start-ups more confidence in introducing financial products without fear of a regulatory rebuke, at least initially.Existing rules make it difficult to guess which regulations apply to which firms. Take multisignature technology, in which wallets holding digital currencies like Bitcoin have authorization \u201ckeys\u201d held by different parties. No transaction involving that money can take place without the consent of at least two of the key holders.Whether digital wallet companies can do anything with those deposits in the meantime, as insurance companies do when they invest their unpaid premiums, remains an open question.Some big banks, while arguing that they are embracing financial tech, want regulations for the new companies that are equal to what the banks face. Bank of America\u2019s chief executive, Brian Moynihan, said at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland this year that disruptions to the payments system would be costly and that regulators must work to ensure that the industry can run smoothly.As William Winters, the chief of Standard Chartered Bank, put it during that panel, \u201cAs long as it\u2019s a level playing field, it\u2019s O.K.\u201dFor some companies in the fintech business, that is not a problem. Take Prosper, an early entrant in the marketplace-lending industry.The company has worked to comply with regulations on both sides of its business, its executives said. Investors in the loans it assembles are protected by the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as regulators in 31 states.Borrowers on Prosper\u2019s platform are covered by traditional banking rules, since Prosper technically teams with WebBank of Utah to disburse its loans.\u201cIt\u2019s the same framework that applies to any bank lending program,\u201d Sachin Adarkar, Prosper\u2019s general counsel, said in an interview.The European Union allows companies that hold a license in one country to \u201cpassport\u201d it to other members of the bloc.\u201cIt would be politically difficult,\u201d Mr. Brito said. \u201cWhat you would be doing is challenging or removing authority of many different state regulators.\u201dThat makes it unlikely that the bramble of regulations will go away soon.Advertisement"}

(Phasing out the famous lardo led to some institutional hand-wringing. \u201cThere was real concern that our regulars would be kind of upset about it,\u201d Mr. Katz said.)The course has been refined down to a single baguette whose tips taper off into the crunchiness of grissini. The bread is accompanied by a ball of spreadable whiteness: Inspired by an aerated mozzarella that Mr. Ladner once swooned over at a restaurant in Sicily, it incorporates cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and cultured Battenkill Valley cream that are whipped almost to the brink of becoming butter and then transformed (using techniques popularized by molecular gastronomy) into tender, gleaming globes.For special occasions, the new pastry chef, Justine MacNeil, and her crew have created a different kind of sphere, fashioned out of chocolate and about the size of a bocce ball. When customers crack it open at the table, hidden sweets fall out. Even the candy wrappers are custom-made. \u201cThey\u2019re talking about hand-stamping each one, and I\u2019m like, \u2018Please don\u2019t make me do that,\u2019\u201d Ms. MacNeil said.The result at Del Posto is so self-consciously lavish that it may seem a throwback \u2014 on purpose. \u201cIt\u2019s what my, and I\u2019ll bet your, dad imagines when he hears the term \u2018fine dining,\u2019\u201d Mr. Batali said.That luxury is largely subsidized by a steady private dining business downstairs. \u201cIt keeps the lights on,\u201d Mr. Katz said. Mr. Batali said the restaurant had invested about $1 million in the upgrades.Yet unlike tasting-menu restaurants like Blanca and Atera, which cater to a relatively rarefied clientele of food obsessives, Del Posto is engineered for a more all-encompassing embrace. At any given moment, you\u2019re apt to spy tourists, locals, high-finance types toasting big deals and families celebrating birthdays. \u201cWe spend a lot of energy trying to appeal to as broad a demographic as possible,\u201d Mr. Ladner said.The service is meant to be both warmly conversational and classically buttoned-up. \u201cLike a big hug from Grandma,\u201d said Matt Abdoo, the chef de cuisine. \u201cIf Grandma happened to be Italian royalty.\u201dOn a recent afternoon, about an hour before the dinner crowd began to trickle in, Mr. Katz presided over a meeting with servers and suggested that they needed to apply more focus to the task of pulling out chairs for diners who were leaving or returning to their tables.\u201cWe need to just work on it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very rare to find a restaurant where they pull the chairs out for you.\u201dAn observation arose: Sometimes a guest is just too fast.\u201cYou can\u2019t chase the guests,\u201d Mr. Katz conceded. \u201cA better solution is to get ahead of the guest.

Such committees can receive larger donations \u2014 up to $102,300 \u2014 than individual candidates, who are limited to $11,000 per donor during a general election for the State Senate.The report was reviewed by the board\u2019s four commissioners and forwarded to Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, prompting a criminal investigation that is being conducted with agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who have been accompanying Mr. Vance\u2019s investigators as they serve subpoenas and conduct interviews.But in a seven-page letter obtained by The New York Times, Mr. Laufer said the activities described by Ms. Sugarman in her report were \u201cunquestionably authorized by the existing law.\u201d\u201cI am at a loss to understand any proper purpose that could have been served by a criminal referral,\u201d Mr. Laufer wrote.Mr. Laufer also denounced the unauthorized release of Ms. Sugarman\u2019s report to the press on Friday, saying the board\u2019s inability to maintain confidentiality was \u201ca complete dereliction of duty.\u201d If the leak came from the board, he said, it amounted to \u201ca highly prejudicial and perhaps politically motivated act.\u201dBut on Friday, Ms. Sugarman defended her work \u2014 \u201cMy career was based on conducting investigations fairly and independently,\u201d she said in an interview \u2014 but declined to discuss any aspect of the de Blasio fund-raising inquiry, including the release of the report to the press, because of the confidential nature of her office\u2019s investigations.Likewise, Douglas Kellner, one of the board\u2019s four commissioners, said on Sunday that he could not comment on or acknowledge investigations or criminal referrals. But he agreed with some of Mr. Laufer\u2019s concerns about the impact of the leak and about \u201chow prejudicial the public comments have been\u201d in its wake.Mr. Kellner, a Democrat, added that he and other commissioners had consistently criticized Ms. Sugarman for \u201cwhat appears to be arbitrary selection of those who she determines to investigate.\u201d\u201cWe have repeatedly expressed concerns that the independent enforcement counsel has not explained how she chooses which investigations to pursue,\u201d he said.\u201cThe work that I do here has nothing to do with where I came from,\u201d she said on Friday, adding, \u201cIt just makes me chuckle when people say those kinds of things.\u201dFor Mr. Cuomo\u2019s part, Dani Lever, a spokeswoman for the governor, said on Sunday that \u201cthe only things we know about the reported investigations by the U.S. attorney, district attorney and Board of Elections are what have been reported in the press.\u201dThe two men and the police officials have not been charged with a crime, and Mr. de Blasio has said his administration will fully cooperate with investigators.In the case of the 2014 campaign, Mr. Laufer condemned Ms. Sugarman\u2019s \u201cnovel, esoteric and chilling interpretation\u201d of the actions of Team de Blasio, which included Emma Wolfe, a senior aide to the mayor, and Ross Offinger, the treasurer for the Campaign for One New York, a nonprofit created by Mr. de Blasio to support his agenda.According to Ms. Sugarman\u2019s report, during the late days of the 2014 campaign, Team de Blasio arranged for large donations to be made \u2014 through Putnam and Ulster Counties\u2019 Democratic committees and a state committee \u2014 for the sake of two incumbents locked in tight races: Cecilia F. Tkaczyk, who was running in a district that included part of Ulster, and Terry W. Gipson, whose district included part of Putnam. The group also arranged for more than $300,000 to be sent through the Putnam committee, which forwarded it to the campaign of Justin Wagner, who was seeking a Senate seat in the Hudson Valley. All three Democrats lost.Investigators said similar patterns existed with candidates running in Monroe and Erie Counties.Mr. Kellner said the key to determining if a crime occurred was whether the act of transferring the money to the campaign committees of individual candidates was separate from the act of transferring the money to the individual candidates. Doing both transactions as part of a single transaction, Mr. Kellner said, would be a violation of state election law and a felony if it was done \u201cknowingly and willfully,\u201d arguing that Mr. Laufer did not delve into that topic.\u201cIt would have been perfectly legal to make the contribution to the party committee and for the party committee to spend the money in support of the candidate,\u201d he said, \u201cand it would have been perfectly legal for the party committee to transfer funds to the candidates campaign committee. But if it was a single transaction, then that\u2019s a violation.\u201dJ. David Goodman and William K. Rashbaum contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

It was not well-received.In a break with the position it has held for the last two years, the administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio said it would give the developer a 99-year lease to the Kingsbridge Armory and allow it to occupy the cavernous property, provided the group agreed to vacate the property if it fails to obtain loans by Dec. 30 for the $158 million first phase of the project.In a letter proposing the compromise, Deputy Mayor Alicia Glen said the developer\u2019s lawsuit, filed in State Supreme Court in the Bronx, \u201cis totally unfounded and an unproductive step.\u201dYet, she added, \u201cwe nonetheless wish to accommodate KNIC.\u201dThe de Blasio administration began briefing Bronx officials last week on the proposed compromise, according to Wiley Norvell, a spokesman for the mayor. State Senator Gustavo Rivera, a Democrat whose home overlooks the armory, said that he supported the city\u2019s new offer.William Brewer, a lawyer for the developer, rejected the city\u2019s offer. He said it was \u201cdisappointing\u201d that the city had not resumed communication until the lawsuit was filed.The development group \u201cwants the lease that was previously agreed upon by both parties,\u201d Mr. Brewer said in a statement. \u201cWe reject any offer that limits our ability to begin construction or restricts the ability to record a mortgage against the lease.\u201dAlicia Glen, a deputy mayor, said in a letter that a failed project would be a \u201cmajor blow\u201d to the Bronx neighborhood.Until now, the city has held the lease to the armory in escrow, and said it would not turn it over until the developer demonstrated firm financing commitments for the first phase. The city, which set an April 25 deadline for the commitments, has been negotiating with the developer in recent weeks.Mr. Parker\u2019s group and its lawyers have argued that by keeping the lease in escrow, the city has unfairly hobbled the developer\u2019s ability to raise money. Even so, the developer said it had complied with the city\u2019s requirement by raising $20 million and securing a nonbinding pledge from the state to provide a two-year, $138 million construction loan.In December, the state\u2019s economic development agency authorized the first part of that loan, worth $30 million. But the Public Authorities Control Board cut the loan to $15 million.In late 2013, Mr. Parker\u2019s plan, then estimated to cost $275 million, won widespread support in the Bronx and approval from Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.The developer originally sought to open by 2017, the 100th anniversary of both the Kingsbridge Armory and the National Hockey League.As a result of the infighting, the city agreed to sign the armory lease, but insisted that it be placed in escrow until Mr. Parker could line up the money for the first phase. The city has indicated it does not want to have to go to court to evict the developer if the project cannot be financed, nor does it want construction work to render the building unusable for any other purpose than ice rinks.In the lawsuit field on Tuesday, Mr. Parker\u2019s lawyers said city officials had \u201cdeliberately delayed\u201d progress on KNIC, causing the developer and the local community \u201chundreds of millions of dollars in damages.\u201dWhile publicly pretending to cooperate with KNIC, the lawsuit said, the city\u2019s Economic Development Corporation \u201cwas secretly working to advance the private interests\u201d of Mr. Parker\u2019s ousted partners.The city, however, emphatically denied the allegations.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Just Beaujolais and Chenin Blanc (and That Could Be Enough)", "Date": "2016-04-28", "News": "Supported byThe PourIt\u2019s the rare wine list that can be all things to all people. Only the most well-financed restaurants have the resources to range freely the world over and present the best of the best. Instead, most wine-conscious restaurants narrow their visions and choose a style or region in which to concentrate.The selection must complement the cooking. And, ideally, it must convey something significant about the restaurant\u2019s identity and aspirations.Freek\u2019s Mill\u2019s list was constructed by Alex Alan, the sommelier and a partner in the restaurant, which opened in early April. In putting it together, he lands Freek\u2019s Mill squarely in the middle of an age-old debate: Is a restaurant obliged to give customers what they want by offering something for everybody? Or can it stay true to a vision, no matter how narrow, uncompromising or esoteric?Mr. Alan said his choices were not originally philosophical, but instead grew out of a draft of the restaurant\u2019s opening menu, which emphasized seasonal vegetables, small plates and a wood-burning oven.\u201cI put it all together in my head based on the flavors and how they worked,\u201d he said. \u201cAs it turned out, I have a lot of Beaujolais and chenin blanc in my house. It\u2019s what I like to drink.\u201dKnowing that Freek\u2019s Mill was on a quiet block of Gowanus, where the prominent local landmarks include a coffin wholesaler and a shuffleboard theme bar, Mr. Alan pondered whether obsession might have its advantages.\u201cI started thinking that no one was going to come out to Gowanus unless I go all the way down the rabbit hole with these two regions,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d provide something else if people aren\u2019t interested, but that\u2019s just a pressure-release valve.\u201dEven with such a concentration in two regions, Mr. Alan insists that customers have plenty of variety from which to choose. From the Loire, chenin blancs come from Vouvray and Savenni\u00e8res, Montlouis and Jasni\u00e8res, Anjou, Touraine and Saumur. The various appellations offer a multitude of terroirs, and it\u2019s a fascinating opportunity to compare different expressions of the same grape.\u201cI think chenin plays in an amazing variety of sites, from light, lean Montlouis to rich Savenni\u00e8res,\u201d Mr. Alan said. \u201cEven if the flavor profile has something in common, I would say you have more variety between Montlouis and Savenni\u00e8res than anywhere in the world.\u201dIn Beaujolais, too, Mr. Alan sees a wide spectrum of expressions between, say, the light fruitiness of Brouilly and the denser, more textured wines in Morgon.\u201cIn a perfect world, I want to give customers what they want,\u201d Mr. Alan said. \u201cBut I also want to teach them something without it feeling like I\u2019m teaching them something.\u201dNobody has complained yet about the narrowness of the list, he said. But if people do, Mr. Alan\u2019s safety-valve selections may not offer a comfortable landing. Among the 13 whites labeled \u201cNot Chenin Blanc,\u201d he offers a 2014 Pazo de Se\u00f1orans Albari\u00f1o for $50 and a 2014 Pattes Loup Chablis for $75, but also a Hungarian juhfark for $55 and four vintages of a blend of obaideh and merwah from the legendary Lebanese producer Chateau Musar. These wonderful age-worthy wines will set you back $115 to $350 a bottle, depending on how old a bottle you select.\u201cHopefully, there\u2019s enough there,\u201d Mr. Alan said. \u201cIf you want to stick to your guns, I\u2019m going to offer it to you. But it\u2019s top tier.\u201dPrices for Beaujolais run for $40 for a 2015 Jean Foillard Beaujolais Nouveau, one of four non-cru selections, up to $100 for a 2014 Lapalu Brouilly Cuv\u00e9e des Fous, a rare bottling made from vines over 100 years old that is gorgeously vivid. Freek\u2019s, by the way, is a nontipping restaurant, so list prices have an extra percentage figured in.I applaud Mr. Alan for going all in on his list. For the most part, he has chosen wonderful wines that will reward consumers who put themselves in his hands. And, honestly, Beaujolais and Loire chenin blancs are distinctive and delicious but well within any notion of what constitutes the mainstream.For truly adventurous palates, I highly recommend exploring the selection of Georgian wines. They are unusual, particularly the \u201camber\u201d wines, whites that are made like reds. Instead of removing the pigment-bearing skins from the grape juice, as is the case with conventional white wines, the skins are left to macerate with the juices, giving the wines an amber cast and a tannic rasp that is rare in a white. They feel great in the mouth, and the tannins give the wine an extra bit of heft. As a group, these are honest, authentic, delicious expressions made by small farmers.Though the list\u2019s bandwidth may seem narrow, the opportunity for pleasure is great. If you just can\u2019t live without Bordeaux or pinot grigio, however, a few thousand other restaurants in New York will have what you want.Email: asimov@nytimes.com.

{"Headline": "\u2018American Amnesia,\u2019 by Jacob S. Hacker and Paul Pierson", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported byIf Bernie Sanders were a book by two leading politics professors, it would be \u201cAmerican Amnesia.\u201d This is the story of how government helped make America great, how the enthusiasm for bashing government is behind its current malaise and how a return to effective government is the answer the nation is looking for.How America came to forget about the merits of good government, and the price now being paid, is the meat of \u201cAmerican Amnesia,\u201d the third book by Jacob S. Hacker (Yale) and Paul Pierson (Berkeley), whom Bill Moyers calls the \u201cSherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson of political science.\u201d According to these academic detectives, America\u2019s amnesia is no accident. The country has been brainwashed by a powerful alliance of forces hostile to government: big business, especially Wall Street, spending unparalleled lobbying dollars to advance its narrow self-\u00adinterest; a new wealthy elite propagating wrongheaded Ayn Randian notions that free markets are always good and government always bad; and a Republican Party using a strategy of attacking and weakening government as a way to win more power for itself.You don\u2019t need to Feel the Bern to take this book seriously. The unexpected popularity of both the senator from Vermont and Donald Trump in this year\u2019s primaries arguably reflects their tapping into widespread anger toward the American establishment. \u201cAmerican Amnesia\u201d provides chapter and verse on why the public has good reason to be angry.For the country\u2019s first 200 years, Americans combined healthy skepticism about government with an acceptance of its necessity. Today conservatives, in particular, have \u201cforgotten\u201d that balanced view. Woodrow Wilson, No.\u202f1 on Glenn Beck\u2019s list of \u201cTop 10 Bastards of All Time\u201d (above Hitler, Pontius Pilate, Pol Pot), actually ushered in valuable improvements in government. His innovations \u2014 the Federal Reserve and income tax, trustbusting the robber barons \u2014 paid off handsomely. By the 1950s, America was leading the world across a \u201cGreat Divide\u201d separating centuries of \u201cslow growth, poor health and anemic technological progress\u201d from \u201chitherto undreamed-of material comfort and seemingly limitless economic potential.\u201dAmerica has always had freewheeling entrepreneurial capitalists. Hacker and Pierson argue persuasively that the 20th-century change that enabled them to create extraordinary wealth for all was \u201ceffective governance\u201d \u2014 reflected in such crucial foundations of a \u201cmixed economy\u201d as better physical infrastructure, health care and education for the \u00admasses, and generous funding for \u201cblue skies research\u201d that made possible everything from antibiotics to the Internet.As recently as the 1950s, government was broadly appreciated by Americans. In his first State of the Union address, the Republican president Dwight Eisenhower mentioned \u201cgovernment\u201d nearly 40 times, almost always positively. Such sentiments were even shared by business. The \u00adbosses of great companies, like Kodak and General Motors, worked closely with government through the Committee for Economic Development to solve the country\u2019s most pressing problems. Yet by the 1980s, Ronald Reagan was memorably saying the \u201cmost terrifying words\u201d in the English language were \u201cI\u2019m from the government, and I\u2019m here to help.\u201d As the public mood changed, the Democrats soon joined in, though without wholly embracing the Republican philosophy. In his first State of the Union, Bill Clinton mentioned government only around half as often as Eisenhower, mostly negatively.Clinton felt he had to declare that \u201cthe era of big government is over\u201d \u2014 even though it had already shrunk considerably: By 1989 there was only one federal government worker for every 110 Americans, compared with one for 78 in Eisenhower\u2019s day (and around one for 150 today). Now America is paying the price for beating up its government, Hacker and Pierson argue. It is sliding down international rankings of social progress that it used to top, in areas like public health and education. America ranks only 25th in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development for the share of 3-year-olds in early childhood education, for example.Hacker and Pierson highlight three main prongs of the Republican attack: \u201cDenounce crony capitalism\u201d while catering to narrow business interests; \u201cFeed political dysfunction and win by railing against it\u201d; and \u201cUndermine the capacity of government to perform its vital functions\u201d and at the same time \u201cdecry a bungling and corrupt public sector.\u201dStill, the authors are suffering their own amnesia about the troubled state of the economy and American business during the 1970s, which is when the public fell out of love with government. This gets only a few pages, with observations like \u201cthe decade was not the economic wasteland it is often remembered as today.\u201d Yet experiencing stagflation and other economic troubles for the first time in the era of mass prosperity provided ample reason for Americans to question the prevailing mixed-economy orthodoxy and ask whether government was overreaching.What\u2019s more, for all that bashing, government has become the dominant American political narrative, and for all the Randian resources deployed by the Koch brothers and others, antigovernment \u00adforces have been unable to stop the current Democratic president from introducing a huge expansion of government in health care, and then getting re-elected. The authors also bury near the end their surprising belief that despite everything, as a society, \u201cwe really have never had it so good.\u201dThen there is the excessive nostalgia for the heyday of trade unionism. While Hacker and Pierson acknowledge the negative role played by teachers unions in blocking education reforms that might have kept America higher in those international performance rankings, that fact gets barely one sentence. And as for Wall Street, they are too one-sided the other way. Though Wall Street deserves much blame for the crash of 2008 and the subsequent Great Recession, the financial sector is not all a giant rip-off. Many of its innovations over the past 50 years have been adopted around the world because they can yield significant economic benefits.As for solutions, Hacker and Pierson say \u201cthere is no magic bullet.\u201d They offer several sensible suggestions \u2014 further limit the use of filibusters in the Senate; institute campaign finance reform; make it easier for people to vote; introduce regulatory reform to tackle today\u2019s robber barons in finance, energy and health care. Yet their big call is for a new, broad-based movement to restore America\u2019s love for effective government \u2014 the modern successor to the Progressives of a century ago.Is this realistic? There are a few hopeful straws in the wind. The popularity of Bernie Sanders with younger voters hints at a generational change in attitudes. Some enlightened business leaders \u2014 Bill Gates, Howard Schultz, Marc Benioff \u2014 are emerging as a different sort of role models, on issues like inequality, the treatment of veterans and gay rights. Perhaps the unexpected strength of Donald Trump will provide a wake-up call \u2014 if it isn\u2019t already too late \u2014 to the Republican establishment, reminding it that if all you ever do is bash government, you risk creating a vacuum that may be filled by something you will really want to forget.Matthew Bishop is a senior editor at the Economist Group and the author of several books on economics.Advertisement"}

California, said they would appeal to the state Supreme Court.\u201cThe Court of Appeal\u2019s decision mistakenly blames local school districts for the egregious constitutional violations students are suffering each and every day,\u201d Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., the lead counsel for the plaintiffs, said in a statement. \u201cBut the mountain of evidence we put on at trial proved \u2014 beyond any reasonable dispute \u2014 that the irrational, arbitrary and abominable laws at issue in this case shackle school districts and impose severe and irreparable harm on students.\u201dThe plaintiffs in Minnesota and New York vowed to press on, with backing from the Partnership for Educational Justice, a New York-based group that receives financing from the foundations of Eli Broad, a Los Angeles billionaire, and the Walton family, founders of Walmart.Katharine Strunk, an associate professor of education at the University of Southern California, said that while the ruling may be considered a victory for teachers\u2019 unions, the case had sparked a national conversation over teacher hiring and firing.\u201cThe judges are saying things are not right in California, that there are drawbacks to the current system, but this is not something for the courts to decide,\u201d Ms. Strunk said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone believes that these laws are the best we can do.\u201dThe plaintiffs argued that because the state allows districts to grant tenure after just two years, and because districts often spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to remove teachers they consider low-performing, tenure rules can lock in ineffective educators for life.All too often, the plaintiffs argued, the worst teachers are placed in schools with high concentrations of low-income and minority students.In its ruling, the appeals court said that \u201cthe challenged statutes do not in any way instruct administrators regarding which teachers to assign to which schools.\u201dThe judges acknowledged that principals got rid of \u201chighly ineffective teachers\u201d by transferring them to other schools, including schools with many poor students.\u201cThis phenomenon is extremely troubling and should not be allowed to occur,\u201d they wrote, \u201cbut it does not inevitably flow from the challenged statutes.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Advocates contend that artists are just using different media to express the same ideas as they always have and that, as prices for \u201cUntitled (L.A.)\u201d and other examples show, fringe art is moving into the mainstream while collectors are more than meeting it halfway.\u201cI don\u2019t like the word \u2018fringe,\u2019 \u201d said Sara Friedlander, head of postwar and contemporary evening sales for Christie\u2019s. \u201cPainting and sculpture make up a small part of the output for artists. Some of the most interesting artists, in the market and culturally, look outside those traditional boundaries. It\u2019s a very important part of the conversation when we talk about artists making art today.\u201dBuying works in unusual media \u201cis no different from collecting other kinds of art,\u201d said Nicole Kluk, a senior consultant at Quintessentially Art, a London advisory service. \u201cLike any artwork, you have to make a connection with it in one way or another \u2014 financial, emotional.\u201dNot many collectors have made a connection with fringe art. A 2014 survey of international collectors by Axa Art found that 89 percent owned paintings, and 60 percent or more collected drawings and sculptures. Slightly fewer than half kept photographs in their collections, and 14 percent had \u201cinstallation and video art.\u201dOwners of exotic fare tend to start out with traditional works and expand their horizons.\u201cCollectors start with a print, then they buy a painting, then once they become more educated, they\u2019re more interested in buying different types of art,\u201d Ms. Kluk said. \u201cPhotography is now considered art, not a lesser medium. It\u2019s coming to the point where digital art is going to be at that same level.\u201dWhile many of the materials that artists work in today are new, the search for new media in its modern form goes back to Marcel Duchamp and the Dada notion that \u201canything can be art,\u201d said Steven Henry, director of the Paula Cooper Gallery in New York.\u201cWe\u2019re talking about ideas that have been explored for more than 100 years,\u201d said Mr. Henry, whose facility showcases artists renowned for novel approaches in their work, such as Carl Andre, Robert Grosvenor, Mark di Suvero and Christian Marclay.Even as unconventional forms of art enter the mainstream, there can be quirks to owning, displaying and experiencing them that keep them distinct from traditional works and present challenges for collectors.A sculpture with multiple parts in various media may come with instructions for the dimensions of the space in which it\u2019s kept, as well as the lighting and temperature. In the case of a digital work, there may be a risk that programs used to create it will be incompatible with devices on which it\u2019s played, now or in the future.An authenticated video or photographic recounting of a specific staging of a piece of performance art may come with detailed instructions from the artist on how to arrange the components or re-create the performance. Tinkering with it may violate terms of the copyright that the buyer acquires as part of the transaction.Such precision, verging into fussiness, illustrates another aspect of fringe art that sets it apart: that passively viewing it, the way you would a painting on a wall, isn\u2019t enough. There needs to be active interaction with a work. As Ms. Kluk put it, \u201cyou\u2019re buying a concept,\u201d not a static object.An irony of fringe art is that its idiosyncrasies and high maintenance raise its popular profile. Ms. Friedlander noted that more unusual niches infiltrate the culture via public, professional displays before making their way into private homes, not the other way around.\u201cA lot of this work is very participatory, so it starts with galleries and museums, then the collector base develops and it trickles down to the secondary market,\u201d she said.Christie\u2019s includes fringe works in its postwar and contemporary sales, along with more conventional painting and sculpture. Sotheby\u2019s includes unconventional works in its contemporary sales, too, but a spokesman, Dan Abernethy, said the firm deals infrequently in genres such as video, digital and performance art.Owning fringe artworks may be a big production, but it\u2019s one that Mr. Henry says more collectors are prepared to undertake.\u201cWhat may be different now is the willingness and capacity of collectors to acquire, display and steward ambitious works that are nontraditional in execution,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a commitment, in terms of space and resources, to maintain and present a work properly.\u201dThe guiding principle among the Dadaists and their descendants may be that anything can be art, but Mr. Henry pointed out that not everything is art, even in exotic niches.\u201cYou have to have certain fundamentals,\u201d he said. \u201cThere has to be a solid idea behind an artwork. More important is an aesthetic component. You can have a great idea, but if it\u2019s not manifest compellingly in an aesthetic way, it\u2019s only going to go so far. We respond to a certain refinement and nuance, a certain quality of execution.\u201dThere was a sufficient response to \u201cUntitled (L.A.)\u201d and to other acknowledged masterpieces of fringe art, such as Tracey Emin\u2019s unmade bed and Urs Fischer\u2019s wax-and-metal sculpture of a man sitting in a chair, that each sold for millions of dollars. But there are plenty of unconventional pieces available at conventional prices, certainly compared with what some traditional works have fetched lately. That can make fringe art a suitable purchase for a neophyte collector.\u201cYou can buy an important piece by an important artist at a fraction of the cost of a contemporary painting,\u201d Ms. Kluk said. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to buy a sure-thing investment at a more accessible price point.\u201dArthur Korteweg, an assistant professor of finance and business economics at the University of Southern California, says he\u2019s not sure that is a sure thing.\u201cThis is probably not a great area for investment for similar reasons that the more established art market is not,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are unique pieces whose fundamental value is hard to figure out. At least for mainstream art there\u2019s more data to look at.\u201dBut \u201cpeople buy art for many reasons, not just as an investment,\u201d Mr. Korteweg added. \u201cThey get enjoyment from looking at it and are willing to take a lower rate of return financially. If you treat it purely as an investment, you don\u2019t get that dividend.\u201dMr. Henry agreed that collecting the dividend is essential, especially because the cost of an unconventional artwork is not just financial, either.\u201cThere\u2019s a commitment to owning something that\u2019s not just going to hang on a wall,\u201d he said. \u201cThe primary motivation has to be having a relationship to the work. You have to be truly vested, not just financially but emotionally.\u201dAn earlier version misstated the title of an artwork by Felix Gonzales-Torres. It is \u201cUntitled (L.A.),\u201d not \u201cUntitled.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But in the worst-hit countries \u2014 Cyprus, Greece, Ireland and Italy \u2014 ordinary people continue to grapple with the consequences of deep job losses and wage cuts, which have slashed incomes.In Italy, disposable income for the average household \u2014 essentially, take-home pay \u2014 shrank 4 percent from 2008 to 2014, according to European Union data. Over those years, Greek households lost 24 percent of their disposable income, and Cyprus suffered declines of 22 percent. At the same time, German households gained more than 15 percent.So much time has passed with overall European fortunes frozen or even sliding backward that doubts pervade about the ability of the Continent to ever again achieve sustained robust growth. In a place that is home to some of the world\u2019s wealthiest countries \u2014 founts of precise German engineering, Italian luxury goods and French gastronomical excess \u2014 children have been born and raised to primary school age while commercial life around them has achieved practically no gains.And there are few signs that things will improve soon. Major banks across the Continent remain reluctant to lend, starving even healthy businesses of capital needed to expand and hire. Concerns about the global economy \u2014 especially the slowdown in China \u2014 threaten to crimp Europe\u2019s export growth, which has been at the center of the recovery.To be sure, Friday\u2019s preliminary data \u2014 a new early-stage snapshot of growth released by the European Union \u2014 showed the eurozone advancing during the first quarter at a stronger pace than the United States economy, which managed only a 0.5 percent annualized rate in the same period.Many economists now discuss Europe\u2019s prospects with the grim vernacular long used to describe Japan. There, a real estate bubble in the 1980s gave way to a calamitous bust that left banks reeling. Decades of half-measures aimed at finessing the economy to better days kept the ship of state afloat but left it in the doldrums.\u201cEurope is just sort of hanging on,\u201d said Kenneth Rogoff, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund who is a professor at Harvard. \u201cIt\u2019s very much like Japan, where Japan chose not to grab the bulls by the horns. It\u2019s still a very rich country. It\u2019s stable, but it\u2019s in decline.\u201dEven \u201changing on\u201d may amount to an aspiration. The terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels have left Europe on knife\u2019s edge, with policy makers and investors cognizant that people with lethal intentions are no doubt plotting more. Refugees and migrants continue to stream toward the Continent, propelled by terrible conflicts in Libya, Syria and elsewhere. This has thrown another fraught and complex problem at European governments that have shown little mastery of coordinated action.The United States engineered a faster and more vigorous recovery from the Great Recession via a burst of government spending and tax cuts, combined with aggressive central bank action. By late 2011, less than four years after the downturn began, G.D.P. was back to its precrisis level, reaching $15 trillion.The eurozone, which generated \u20ac2.48 trillion in economic activity during the first quarter, is only now on track to surpass its 2008 full-year gross domestic product. of just below \u20ac10 trillion, or about $11.3 trillion.Unlike the United States, which surpassed its pre-bubble peak in 2011, the eurozone as a whole has stumbled along. Here are some of the bloc\u2019s notable leaders and laggards.It has been hobbled by the basic afflictions of its peculiar setup: The euro currency is a shared enterprise, yet the 19 national governments that now use it operate their own budgets, while having to abide by limits on borrowing.In other countries, economic weakness generally pushes down the value of the currency, making goods cheaper on world markets relative to competitors\u2019 and lifting exports. But in the eurozone, all the countries are stuck with the same value for their currency, regardless of their individual troubles.\u201cThe crisis began in the United States, yet the rigidities associated with the euro meant that it was the eurozone that wound up the big loser,\u201d Mr. Stiglitz said. \u201cIt\u2019s worth noting that, over that period, Japan, the rest of Europe and the United States all performed better. This is a euro disease.\u201dGermany, which plays the dominant role in setting eurozone economic policy, has been unwilling to allow national governments to run larger deficits to stimulate their economies, while demanding that they enact policies that make it easier for employers to hire and fire. The result has been Continentwide austerity marinated in acrimony.\u201cThe French and Italians have been shouting at the Germans, \u2018You should expand and then we\u2019ll all be better off,\u2019\u201d Mr. Begg said. \u201cThe Germans have been shouting back, \u2018No, you should sort out your mess and then we\u2019ll all grow together.\u2019\u201dThe eurozone economy has made progress since the crisis hit, even if its size is roughly the same. Eight years ago, finance and construction made up a greater share of the economy than today, a reminder of the overbuilding that left banks tallying disastrous lending losses. Now, exports are more pronounced, a trend enhanced by the decline of the euro, which has surrendered 28 percent of its value against the dollar since the summer of 2008. This has made European goods cheaper on world markets.But the ability of European businesses to continue to rack up export growth faces challenges. China, the European Union\u2019s second-largest trading partner behind the United States, absorbed roughly 10 percent of Europe\u2019s exported wares last year, according to the bloc\u2019s data. As China slows, that will most likely diminish its appetite for Europe\u2019s products.\u201cThere isn\u2019t much help for the eurozone in the broader global economy,\u201d said Jacob Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.Beyond the worries of the moment, a rapidly aging population appears very likely to constrain Europe\u2019s fortunes. While Europe\u2019s high levels of productivity should continue to support a comfortable standard of living and a strong social safety net for much of its population, fewer people working means fewer goods being produced and services rendered.\u201cThe potential growth rate in Europe is probably 1 percent,\u201d Mr. Kirkegaard added. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t therefore expect growth to be much greater than it is today. This is, quite frankly, as good as it gets.\u201dDavid Jolly contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Quiet War on Corporate Accountability", "Date": "2016-04-26", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsLet\u2019s back up. Current accounting standards require corporations to make financial disclosures of information that \u201ccould\u201d influence investors. If this sounds wishy-washy, it is. The accounting board\u2019s proposal would rewrite this already subjective standard to require corporate disclosure only when there is a \u201csubstantial likelihood\u201d that information \u201cwould\u201d significantly alter investor decisions.The language change is troublesome because it lowers the bar for excluding important or \u201cmaterial\u201d information. Even just changing \u201ccould\u201d to \u201cwould\u201d is a big deal. \u201cCould\u201d connotes possibility and invites broader disclosure; \u201cwould\u201d connotes more certainty and can be used by firms to exclude disclosure.Imagine a pharmaceutical company that discovers that a promising new drug in the pipeline is performing poorly in patient trials. Such information \u201ccould\u201d sway investing decisions, and, under current rules, there\u2019s a strong case for disclosure. But it\u2019s much harder to establish that there is \u201csubstantial likelihood\u201d that disclosing this information \u201cwould\u201d significantly alter investor choices. If the new proposal is enacted, the drug company gets a free pass to avoid disclosure.Given the technological advances, we support re-examining the current rules that govern \u201cmaterial\u201d corporate disclosure. After all, these rules haven\u2019t exactly served investors well. Consider the examples of Enron and Lehman Brothers.Disclosure is the cornerstone of fair and efficient markets. Investors can make educated decisions only if they have access to relevant information about public companies. Weakening disclosure standards imperils the integrity of markets.In principle, the S.E.C. has final authority to set disclosure rules for public companies. But the S.E.C. decades ago turned over much of this work to the private-sector accounting standards board. This body draws its members largely from the accounting and finance professions, citing the need for expertise from industry. It\u2019s this state of affairs that has partly gotten us to where we are today.The board\u2019s changes contradict the S.E.C.\u2019s own strategic plan, which notes that \u201can educated and informed investor ultimately provides the best defense against fraud and costly mistakes.\u201d The accounting board should abandon its efforts to undermine disclosure rules. Even better, the S.E.C. should use this opportunity to step in and strengthen them.Karthik Ramanna is an associate professor of business administration at Harvard and the author of \u201cPolitical Standards: Corporate Interest, Ideology, and Leadership in the Shaping of Accounting Rules for the Market Economy.\u201d Allen Dreschel is a lawyer at Better Markets, a nonprofit organization that promotes the public interest in the financial markets.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fintech Firms Are Taking On the Big Banks, but Can They Win?", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported byDealBookBanking has long been viewed as one of the last traditional, old-school, stuck-in-the-past industries. When you think of banking, you might still think of wood-paneled walls and pinstripe suits.That impression may increasingly be misguided.If you spend more than 15 minutes with any senior executive of a large bank these days, it is almost impossible not to hear the phrase \u201cfintech\u201d uttered. It is usually spoken with a sense of optimism, but sometimes with a sense of dread.\u201cFintech,\u201d of course, is short for financial technology, a catchall for a near-revolution of new technologies aimed at upending parts of the financial world, including payments, wealth management, lending, insurance and currency.The fintech phrase itself is actually not new \u2014 it dates to the late 1980s and early 1990s \u2014 though it has taken on a heightened sense of importance and urgency now that it has been embraced by Silicon Valley as the new new thing. An estimated $19 billion of investment poured into the fintech bucket last year, according to Citigroup, up from just $1.8 billion five years earlier.\u201cThe real threat to banks is not from Washington or Brussels but from start-ups all over the country creating interesting fintech start-ups that are chipping away at key parts of their franchise,\u201d said Steve Case, a founder of AOL and an entrepreneur with investments in several fintech businesses, who just wrote a book about the future, \u201cThe Third Wave.\u201dThe promise of all these new technologies is to fundamentally disrupt the biggest players in finance. Companies like Stripe, a payments company, hope to become replacements for PayPal and others. Lending Club wants to make getting a loan cheaper and easier. Wealthfront wants to advise you and manage your money from your phone. And, of course, Bitcoin and its many derivatives wants to be the new gold, or better yet, digital cash.If they succeed, Wall Street as we know it may become an outpost of Palo Alto. According to a Citigroup report last week, fintech may be on the cusp of an \u201cUber moment,\u201d as Antony Jenkins, the former chief executive of Barclays, predicted last year. Some 800,000 people will have lost their jobs at financial services companies to some of the newly dreamed up software in a decade, the report said. \u201cRoughly 60 to 70 percent of retail banking employees are doing manual-processing-driven jobs,\u201d the report explained. \u201cIf all the current manual processing can be replaced by automation, these jobs can disappear or evolve.\u201dThe ripple effects are enormous: Consider not just the employees but the impact on commercial real estate, for example, if banks shut their coveted branches on the corners in major cities.Others are less convinced. Wall Street denizens like the banking investor J. Christopher Flowers have declared that the fintech frenzy is simply that: hype that defies common sense and will leave a trail of failed companies in its wake.A third view may have the highest likelihood of coming true: The big banks, so powerful and yet so anxious about the possibility of being disrupted by the upstarts, will gobble them all up in a spate of mergers and acquisitions that puts the disrupters squarely inside the institutions they were supposed to overtake.Witness JPMorgan Chase\u2019s recent alliance with OnDeck, an online lending platform for small businesses. Rather than build the technology to squash OnDeck or, worse, let OnDeck\u2019s runaway growth continue unchecked, JPMorgan became OnDeck\u2019s \u201cpartner.\u201d It has been couched as an early joint venture. But inside JPMorgan, it\u2019s considered an experiment, a way to gather information and get educated about the nascent fintech lending space, and yes \u2014 assuming all goes well \u2014 possibly to acquire the company or one of its rivals.That\u2019s not to say OnDeck will be a willing seller, but given the money sloshing around in the financial services industry, it\u2019s hard to believe that banks won\u2019t be willing to pay big premiums. After all, even the most successful fintech companies are still tiny. OnDeck is worth about $500 million; JPMorgan\u2019s market value is $214 billion.Indeed, the valuations of fintech companies have recently fallen like those of other private Silicon Valley companies. That has led to speculation about a new round of investment and deal making.\u201cI\u2019m starting to look at opportunities outside,\u201d Patrick Gauthier, vice president of Amazon Payments, said to CNBC this week at a conference in Europe about the prospect of making acquisitions. \u201cAfter a number of years where fintech has been a little bit ahead of itself in terms of valuations, things have come back to earth.\u201dThe crucial question for the fintech industry is whether these businesses can grow fast enough while maintaining a disciplined approach and navigating the thicket of regulatory hurdles that very likely will stand in the way. Silicon Valley has long shunned regulated industries, but having conquered so much of the landscape in other industries, it is now turning to finance.The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency recently said it thought a new regulatory framework needed to be created to help foster innovation among fintech companies while ensuring compliance.Given that the 2008 financial crisis is still so fresh, it is hard to see the rules loosening too much.Which perhaps may be the most compelling reason for why there is probably going to be a wave of deals among these companies soon. With the cost of compliance so high and many large institutions already having built an enormous compliance infrastructure \u2014 the big banks now employ thousands of lawyers \u2014 it will only make sense for smaller upstarts to end up as part of a bigger company.\u201cSome banks will be smart and figure out how to partner with some of these entrepreneurs or acquire some of these companies or do joint ventures, but if they just think it\u2019s going to stay the way it is, they will be surprised,\u201d Mr. Case added.Advertisement"}

Politically oriented groups claiming dubious exemptions as \u201csocial welfare\u201d nonprofits have proliferated in recent elections, allowing donors \u2014 including publicity-shy campaign backers \u2014 to work from the shadows.Representative Peter Roskam, the bill\u2019s sponsor, dismissed the reform groups\u2019 warning, saying the I.R.S. \u201chas a miserable track record when it comes to safeguarding sensitive data\u201d and a history of targeting conservative nonprofits that are critical of administration policies.

Twenty-eight pages are still being withheld amid suspicions that what they contain could implicate the Saudi government and Saudi citizens in the terrorist strike.The Saudi government has long denied any involvement and that view was largely supported by the 9/11 Commission, an independent bipartisan panel that conducted a separate inquiry in 2004 and found \u201cno evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi officials\u201d funded Al Qaeda. Still, questions remain about the work of a number of Saudi-sponsored charities with financial links to Al Qaeda.Because those connections remain unexplained, it\u2019s important that the full congressional inquiry report be released. The push for the 28 pages is part of a larger effort by some 9/11 families to sue members of the Saudi royal family, banks and charities and hold them responsible for any role, including terrorism financing, they may have had in the attacks. So far, such legal challenges have been thwarted because, critics say, federal courts since 2005 have misread congressional intent on the issue of immunity for foreign nations from private lawsuits. They say there was never any intent to provide a legal shield for foreign nations against liability for acts of terrorism committed in the United States.The controversy comes at a time when Saudi-American relations have been badly shaken by disputes over Iran, Syria and other issues, as well as by American frustration with the Saudis\u2019 longstanding embrace of Wahhabism, an extremist form of Islam that inspires Al Qaeda and the Islamic State.Repairing troubled ties with Saudi Arabia, which cooperates closely with America on counterterrorism and security matters, requires that all the facts be known.

The announcement sets up what would be one of the largest strikes in recent years.\u201cOur committee worked very hard to address all of the concerns they raised about limiting health care costs for the company, and we\u2019ve been clear about our willingness to do so,\u201d said Bob Master, assistant to the vice president of District 1 at the Communications Workers of America, one of the unions in the contract talks. \u201cThe reason we\u2019re going on strike is that they failed to reciprocate on the issues that matter to us.\u201dVerizon says that as more and more Americans give up landlines, it is only natural that phone service providers like Verizon will require fewer workers to operate and maintain them.In a release, Verizon said that its wireline business \u2014 its traditional landline phone service, as well as video and Internet offerings to homes and businesses, but not its wireless operation \u2014 generated about 29 percent of its revenue in 2015 but less than 7 percent of its operating income, suggesting that this business was not especially profitable. The company also said that the employees covered by the contracts currently being negotiated \u2014 over 99 percent of them in the wireline business \u2014 receive an average of $130,000 a year in wages and benefits.Mr. Reed and another Verizon official, Robert Mudge, the president of Verizon\u2019s wireline network operations, expressed confidence that customers would experience no service disruption in the event of a strike. They said the company had begun training other personnel from among its total work force of more than 175,000 to perform the duties of the unionized workers.Most often, the duties will be performed by employees in the management ranks who supervise the workers going on strike. Mr. Mudge said the replacement workers would also include some information technology professionals, finance personnel and engineers. If the strike lasts beyond a few days or weeks, he said, it might be necessary to explore outside contracting arrangements.A strike in 2011 lasted two weeks before the two sides agreed to a new contract.The fate of Verizon\u2019s call centers highlights some of the crucial divides between management and the unions. Verizon says that some of its call centers house only a handful of employees, and that it wants to be able to move the workers to other sites in the same broad geographic area. But the current contract prevents relocation exceeding 35 miles.\u201cThose rules may have made sense 40 years ago,\u201d Mr. Reed said. \u201cNow they don\u2019t.\u201dThe unions say that this ignores the underlying issue: One reason the volume of employees at certain call centers has fallen, Mr. Master said, is that the company outsources some of this work to contract workers in other countries like the Philippines and Mexico and to other parts of the United States. Verizon wants to increase the percentage of customer-service calls that can be routed to workers outside the region where the calls originate.One possible way for the company to expand its pool of well-paid jobs at a time when its traditional copper-line business is only marginally profitable and shrinking would be to expand its fiber-optic network, known as Fios, which can package together television, Internet and telephone service. But Verizon appears to have soured on a large-scale expansion of its Fios network.\u201cWe represent the people who install Fios, it\u2019s the future of the business\u201d said Mr. Master. \u201cBut they won\u2019t build Fios in Buffalo, in Syracuse, in Albany.\u201dIan Olgeirson, an industry analyst with SNL Kagan, said Verizon had fulfilled is initial plan of laying fiber that could serve as many as 18 million homes, but hadn\u2019t progressed much beyond that plan.\u201cI think there was always an assumption they would go one step further and address more copper-based households that were not in that initial plan, and it doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s much appetite for that,\u201d said Mr. Olgeirson. He cited as one cause the competition from streaming video online rather than paying for a bundled package that includes television.For his part, Mr. Mudge said: \u201cWe continue to invest in Fios. We\u2019re putting as much investment in Fios today as we did in the previous five years.\u201dOther issues at stake include how long a worker can be asked to temporarily work outside of his or her normal area \u2014 the company proposed up to two months, which the unions say is too long \u2014 and what the unions say are Verizon\u2019s refusal to negotiate better wages or benefits for about 100 Verizon Wireless retail workers, who unionized in 2014Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bernie Sanders\u2019s Legacy", "Date": "2016-04-27", "News": "Supported byAt this point, Bernie Sanders is the figurehead of a living idea and a zombie campaign.The issues his campaign has raised are likely to resonate with the progressive left for decades, if not forever, but his path to becoming the Democratic nominee is now narrower than a cat\u2019s hair.He has gone from leading a revolution to leading a wake.I think people have mischaracterized the choice being made between Sanders and Clinton. It is not necessarily a clean choice between idealism and pragmatism, between principle and politics, between dynamism and incrementalism \u2014 though all those things are at play to some degree.But to me, it is more about where we peg the horizon and how we get from here to there. The ideals are not in dispute. What\u2019s in dispute is whether our ideals can be reasonably accomplished by a single administration or a generation.Sometimes you have to cut deals to reach ideals. That\u2019s politics.Now, you could argue that our politics are broken, as Sanders has, and you would be right. Moneyed interests \u2014 that of industries and individuals \u2014 have far too much influence. Our two-party system is heavily skewed to favor establishment candidates, although Sanders\u2019s success and Donald Trump\u2019s offer strong evidence that the party apparatuses are not inviolable.What requires less debate is the often-repeated refrain that Sanders\u2019s supporters are the future of the Democratic Party. In state after state, often whether he won it or not, he carried youth vote by wide margins.Enten explained:And while current polling favors Clinton, history does not. The last time a Democratic president succeeded a multiterm Democratic president was when Harry Truman succeeded Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1945.However the election breaks in November, the Sanders coalition \u2014 largely young, liberal and white \u2014 will not likely be satisfied. Either Clinton will win, and it will simply feel like a lesser of two evils, a subsuming of a righteous cause into a waffling contrivance; or Clinton will lose, and the Sanders coalition will feel vindicated that the wrong Democratic candidate won the nomination.Either way, the cause lives.Universal health care becomes no less attractive. Neither does free public college, or campaign finance reform, or a more pacifist foreign policy.The Democratic Party, for better or worse, is likely to move further toward progressive purity in Sanders\u2019s wake. This may backfire, and encourage a nominating process that pushes otherwise moderate and widely attractive candidates to adopt increasingly extreme policies that make them nearly unelectable, as has happened with the Republican Party.That, to me, seems to be at least part of the Democratic Party\u2019s future. Whether that is a utopian or dystopian future, only time will tell, but the reckoning is coming. This, I believe, will be a fixture of the Sanders legacy: Drag a center-left party further left \u2014 whether one calls that True Left or Extreme Left.Advertisement"}

About $2.5 billion would be devoted to the East Side Access project, which would connect the Long Island Rail Road to Grand Central Terminal.Thomas F.

The rest is expected to be paid for by the federal government and other sources.State and city officials have not specified where most of their funding will come from. Transit advocates have repeatedly criticized Mr. Cuomo, arguing that his commitment amounted to an I.O.U. for the state-run agency.On Wednesday, Lawrence S. Schwartz, a board member and a former top aide to the governor, urged the board not to question Mr. Cuomo\u2019s promise.\u201cThe money will be there,\u201d Mr. Schwartz said.The plan had been delayed in recent months by budget negotiations in Albany, with Republicans in the State Senate pushing for extra money for roads and bridges and other legislators opposing cuts for the Second Avenue subway.The first phase of the Second Avenue project, which will extend the Q line to 96th Street, is scheduled to begin service at the end of the year. The second phase will expand the line to 125th Street.\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten to a place where we\u2019re happy that we\u2019ll be able to substantially begin the work on Phase 2,\u201d Mr. Rodriguez, a Democrat, said.The authority said it would apply for a federal grant program, New Starts, to pay for the additional $500 million for the project.As part of the budget agreement, the authority\u2019s debt limit was raised to $55 billion from $41 billion, spurring concerns that the agency would take on debt to pay the state\u2019s funding share. Robert E. Foran, the authority\u2019s chief financial officer, told board members on Wednesday that if the agency financed debt on the state\u2019s behalf, the state would pay for the debt service. The move would not prompt a fare increase, he said.Gene Russianoff, the longtime leader of the Straphangers Campaign, a rider advocacy group, complained that the process took too long and that the governor\u2019s funding plan was not concrete enough.\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing for the riding public that it\u2019s moving ahead,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they didn\u2019t set any indoor speed records.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "E.C.B. Rules Out Free Money as Antidote to Falling Prices", "Date": "2016-04-07", "News": "Supported byFRANKFURT \u2014 With the eurozone economy still listless, despite the aggressive stimulus measures being taken by the European Central Bank, economists at a conference here on Thursday were full of advice on aggressive next steps.But top officials of the central bank pushed back against one of the most radical proposals: to print money and hand it out to citizens in an approach known as \u201chelicopter money.\u201dStill, the central bank acknowledged its deep concern about the risk that the eurozone\u2019s economic doldrums, characterized by a worrisomely low rate of inflation, could devolve into outright deflation, a vicious circle of falling prices and demand that can undercut corporate profits and cause unemployment to soar.A growing number of economists argue that central banks must use radical measures \u2014 even helicopter money, largely a textbook notion \u2014 to prevent deflation from becoming entrenched in Europe.\u201cThe decline recorded in February was a new element,\u201d the summary said. Members of the council agreed that \u201ceuro area growth momentum would be slower and inflation lower for longer than previously anticipated.\u201d\u201cWe have a deflation risk,\u201d Ignazio Visco, a council member and the governor of Italy\u2019s central bank, said at the Frankfurt conference on Thursday.The event was a gathering of economists and other analysts who follow central banking, some of whom expressed doubts that the E.C.B.\u2019s actions so far would be powerful enough to counteract the effects on the eurozone economy of a slowdown in global trade.The term helicopter money was coined in 1969 by the economist and Nobel laureate Milton Friedman, more as a thought experiment than as a serious policy proposal. The idea was that when conventional policy tools no longer worked, central banks could print bills and toss them from helicopters to eager citizens who would spend the money and stimulate the economy.Deflation sets in when falling prices prompt people to delay purchases because they expect prices to fall even further. Consumer spending and investment collapse, companies dismiss workers, and spending falls even further as people lose their jobs and incomes. Central bankers fear deflation because once it sets in, it is notoriously difficult to reverse.Helicopter money has long been seen as a hypothetical last resort. But the idea has been taken more seriously as inflation in the eurozone has remained stubbornly near zero. Inflation has been below 0.5 percent since July 2014 and was at negative levels in both February and March.The E.C.B. does not expect inflation to reach the bank\u2019s official target of close to, but below, 2 percent until after 2018.\u201cWe face continued disinflationary forces,\u201d Mario Draghi, the president of the E.C.B., said in the bank\u2019s annual report, published on Thursday.But handing out free money would not be easy. The E.C.B. has no procedure for distributing cash fairly to the roughly 335 million people in the eurozone. One mechanism might be to give everyone a tax cut. But that is probably illegal under eurozone rules, which bar the bank from getting involved in member governments\u2019 financing.Charles Bean, a professor at the London School of Economics, said at the Frankfurt conference that Britain, arguably, had already distributed helicopter money. The Bank of England has printed money to purchase government bonds, and the government in turn has made tax cuts.\u201cPeople mistakenly think this is some magical policy that has not yet been tried,\u201d Mr. Bean said. \u201cIn reality, it\u2019s a mix\u201d of policies.Some economists say that the E.C.B. has already introduced a form of helicopter money by deciding last month to offer interest-free funds to banks, on the condition that they lend the money to businesses and consumers. If banks meet certain lending benchmarks, they will get a bonus from the E.C.B. in addition to the interest-free funds. In effect, the commercial banks will be paid by the central bank to lend money.But central bank officials clearly do not want to raise expectations that they are about to start carpet-bombing the eurozone with freshly minted bills.V\u00edtor Const\u00e2ncio, the vice president of the central bank, also ruled out helicopter money during an appearance at the European Parliament on Thursday. He argued that actions already taken by the E.C.B., which include penalizing banks for hoarding cash, have been working.\u201cWithout these measures,\u201d Mr. Const\u00e2ncio said, \u201cthe euro area would have been in outright deflation last year.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York Budget Deal With Higher Minimum Wage Is Reached", "Date": "2016-03-31", "News": "Supported byALBANY \u2014 Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and state legislative leaders announced on Thursday that they had reached a budget agreement that would raise the minimum wage in New York City to $15 by the end of 2018, but initiate slower increases elsewhere, even in the city\u2019s wealthy suburbs.For Mr. Cuomo, the wage agreement came with clear concessions, as some lawmakers outside the city won a softer phase-in period. Long Island and Westchester County will not reach a $15 wage for nearly six years; areas north of Westchester are assured only of reaching $12.50 by 2021.The wage issue was one of the final obstacles to reaching a timely accord on the next state budget, estimated to be more than $150 billion, which mixes high-profile policy measures with nuts-and-bolts infrastructure spending and aid to schools.With the minimum wage deal and another hard-fought measure \u2014 one that would eventually provide employees across the state 12 weeks of paid time off to care for newborns or sick relatives and for families dealing with military deployments \u2014 the governor was able to claim victory on two signature issues.Still, Mr. Cuomo, who had fought hard for the higher wage, cast the increase as a major accomplishment on Thursday, both for working people and for his own political brand.\u201cWe\u2019re leaders,\u201d he said, \u201cin economic justice.\u201dThe governor, a Democrat, also announced a plan for billions in income tax cuts beginning in 2018 \u2014 affecting families earning less than $300,000 \u2014 and to end the Gap Elimination Adjustment, which had drained money from local school districts for state uses.Mr. Cuomo also backed off two plans adamantly opposed by fellow Democrats in the State Assembly: one asking New York City to shoulder $485 million in funding for the City University of New York, and another seeking hundreds of millions of dollars more in Medicaid savings, largely drawn from the city.The budget was still being debated and voted on by legislators even as Thursday\u2019s midnight deadline passed, officially making for a late budget. But work was expected to be completed Friday \u2014 the first day of the fiscal year \u2014 close enough to the fiscal target protect Mr. Cuomo\u2019s reputation for efficient governing. (He has passed five previous budgets more or less on time.)On-time budgets have become such a point of pride for the governor that lawmakers could not resist needling him once midnight came and went. \u201cJust so you know,\u201d State Senator Rub\u00e9n D\u00edaz rose on the Senate floor to say at 12:12 a.m., \u201cthe budget is late.\u201dThe 11th-hour nature of the announcement prompted some concerns from lawmakers who were expected to review and vote on the bills with little time to read them. \u201cDespite a lot of a good content in the budget, the process at arriving at the conclusion left a lot to be desired,\u201d said State Senator Michael Gianaris, a Queens Democrat.And if the budget accomplished two cherished liberal goals \u2014 higher wages and paid leave \u2014 it was still notable for what it left out. Mere months after the former legislative leaders of both the Assembly and Senate were convicted on corruption charges in what government watchdogs have taken to calling a \u201cWatergate moment\u201d for New York, there was no hint of ethics reform in the deal on Thursday.On the wage issue, in areas north of Westchester, the minimum wage \u2014 now $9 \u2014 will rise by 70 cents a year over the next five years, eventually hitting $12.50 by the end of 2020, though the governor said it would continue to rise toward $15, depending on its economic impact. Indeed, in announcing the wage increase and brokering a deal with Senate Republicans, Mr. Cuomo seemed to be treading a fine line between confidence that $15 would eventually be reached statewide and cautioning that the wage could be suspended if it was determined to be hurting the economy.The plan also included other caveats: Businesses with 10 or fewer employees will have nearly four years to institute the wage increase in New York City.In describing a so-called safety valve, the governor explained how the wage\u2019s move toward the $15 benchmark upstate would be determined by state labor and budget analysts \u2014 both parts of the executive branch \u2014 who would review the wage\u2019s economic impact using studies conducted beginning in 2019. The state would then use that information to plan increases in the upstate wage \u2014 or to suspend the increase temporarily, statewide, depending on economic data.\u201cThis is the smartest, safest way to go about it, in my opinion,\u201d he said.Senator Catharine Young, a Republican and chairwoman of the Finance Committee, described the idea of different rates for different regions as \u201cvery helpful,\u201d adding that initially limiting the rate to $12.50 upstate would allow \u201ca pause, for study,\u201d after five years.Public-school spending accounted for nearly $25 billion of the budget agreement, which, after several failed attempts in past years, eliminates the deeply unpopular Gap Elimination Adjustment that the state first used in 2010 to cover a huge budget deficit at public schools\u2019 expense. Both Republicans and Democrats supported restoring the funding. The budget also boosted funding for charter schools across the state by roughly $430 per student.But CUNY and its statewide counterpart, the State University of New York, were unable to persuade lawmakers to allow them to raise tuition over the next few years.As city leaders have grappled with a homelessness and affordable housing crisis, the governor has repeatedly promised bold interventions from the state. He delivered $20 billion toward that effort in the budget, though details of the plan remain scarce three months after he first announced it.Both upstate and downstate areas received roughly $27 billion in transportation investments, restoring about $500 million for the second phase of the Second Avenue subway in the Metropolitan Transportation Authority\u2019s 2015-19 capital plan.Under the family leave plan, agreed to by Senator John J. Flanagan, the Long Island Republican who serves as the majority leader, and Carl E. Heastie, the speaker of the Democrat-dominated Assembly, state residents will be eligible for such leave starting in 2018 after working for six months at a job. The leave would eventually be extended to 12 weeks, and would be funded by deductions from employees\u2019 pay.Republicans like Ms. Young were excited about Mr. Cuomo\u2019s tax cut, which will reduce state revenue by more than $4 billion annually by 2025. But Mr. Cuomo presented relief as long overdue for taxpayers in New York.\u201cEconomically, I believe, it will be a net plus,\u201d he said.Mr. Cuomo said he felt no competitiveness with California, where legislators approved the wage increase on Thursday, sending it to Gov. Jerry Brown. New York\u2019s governor was magnanimous, saying working people \u201cneed a raise\u201d everywhere. But he did note that New York City residents would see that raise quicker than those in Los Angeles, where the wage will rise by 2022.Asked whether he worried whether future governors might undo his wage proposal \u2014 Mr. Cuomo is up for re-election in 2018 \u2014 the governor smiled.\u201cI plan to be governor,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Corporate funds make up 12.9 percent share of the total, the highest since 2000.As a sign of how start-up valuations have waxed and waned, the size of the median late-stage fund-raising roughly tripled from 2012 to 2015, but it has fallen by 23 percent so far this year, according to Global Corporate Venturing.For many company funds, financial gain is less important than finding the next big idea.Arvind Sodhani, who led Intel\u2019s venture unit for 10 years, until mid-2015, said corporate venture investing has grown partly because of interest by chief executives. \u201cC.E.O.s who are worried they\u2019re going to get disrupted want to have an outpost in Silicon Valley to discern where the disruption is coming from,\u201d he said.Such corporate funds have \u201cclearly been driving up valuations,\u201d he added.For General Mills, which has also invested in the plant-based food maker Beyond Meat and two other start-ups, the venture capital fund is a way to keep pace with the growing number of small food brands that have found consumer success, especially online.\u201cThe traditional consumer packaged goods model of big advertising budgets, trade leverage and scale \u2014 a lot of those factors have been neutralized by these small brands,\u201d said John Haugen, who heads the General Mills venture fund after managing brands such as Nature Valley, Yoplait and Hamburger Helper. Emerging brands, he added, \u201chave alternative pathways to market online.\u201dTechnology companies pioneered corporate venture funds 30 years ago, followed by media, finance and health care companies. The two giants of the field are Intel, with stakes estimated by outsiders of more than $5 billion in more than 400 companies, and Google, now Alphabet, which has a $2.4 billion venture fund called GV with more than 300 investments.Comcast Ventures invests in companies it can later introduce to its cable and broadcast television customers. In 2009 and 2011, it took stakes in iControl Networks, a broadband home security and energy management service, and it later offered it to its customers through Xfinity Home.Comcast\u2019s portfolio also includes stakes in DocuSign, Birchbox and TiVo, as well as FanDuel, the fantasy sports betting site. Comcast introduced FanDuel to its NBC broadcast TV unit and its large customer base of sports fans.Other corporate venture funds acknowledge that their growing ranks have pushed up private company valuations. \u201cIn the last few years, there has been more and more corporate V.C. money coming in, and I do think that\u2019s had an impact on valuations,\u201d said Rob Salvagno, head of corporate development at Cisco Investments, which has $2 billion of stakes in 100 companies and 40 venture funds.Some funds have had bubble-style returns \u2014 as well as bubble-style losses. Qualcomm, a maker of chips for mobile phones, participated in a $25 million early-stage funding round for Waze, a crowd-sourced traffic application, in 2010. When Waze was acquired by Google for about $1 billion in 2013, Qualcomm\u2019s return was 10 times its investment.But some of Qualcomm\u2019s investments have struggled, too. It invested $5 million in the fitness device maker Fitbit in 2013 and had a paper profit of about 20 times its cost after Fitbit\u2019s initial public offering in mid-2015. However, Fitbit shares have since come back to earth, falling 67 percent from their post-I.P.O. peak in August.Qualcomm is prepared to invest through downturns because such stakes offer a ringside seat for \u201cthe next generation of disruptive innovation around our mobile core,\u201d said Brian Modoff, who oversees strategy, mergers and acquisitions and ventures for the company.Microsoft is renewing a venture investing push, hiring Nagraj Kashyap, the former head of Qualcomm Ventures, in January. The software giant was a big investor in tech and telecommunications companies in 1999 and 2000, but after losing about $5 billion from such investments in the three years that ended in mid-2003, it curtailed the effort in favor of more acquisitions.Venture investments have mushroomed recently at Salesforce, a maker of customer relations software, which began investing in 2009. Since 2011, Salesforce has increased its investments to $505 million, from $27 million. Five of its 150 companies have had I.P.O.s, and another seven or eight are waiting in the wings.Salesforce was one of five named participants in a $350 million investment in the cloud-storage start-up Dropbox in January 2014 that valued the company at $10 billion. Recently, however, one mutual fund investor that was part of the same investor group cut its valuation of Dropbox to less than $5 billion.John Somorjai, executive vice president of corporate development and Salesforce Ventures at Salesforce, said that he did not agree that corporate venture funds have helped inflate valuations. Prices for most investments are set by the traditional venture capital firms that lead the deals, not by the corporate participants, he said.As for Dropbox, Mr. Somorjai called it \u201ca very small investment.\u201d Salesforce does try to reflect such fluctuations in valuing its holdings, but \u201cno single investment is going to move the needle,\u201d he added.Sue Siegel, the chief executive General Electric\u2019s GE Ventures, said the company got into venture investing in 2013 to identify up-and-coming entrepreneurs in the health care and energy industries. She added that G.E. planned to stick with venture investing in the current valuation downturn. \u201cWhen you have these down cycles, it\u2019s a wonderful time for us to look.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "De Blasio Postpones Work on Crucial Water Tunnel", "Date": "2016-04-05", "News": "Supported byMayor Bill de Blasio has postponed work to finish New York\u2019s third water tunnel, a project that for more than half a century has been regarded as essential to the survival of the city if either of the two existing, and now aged, tunnels should fail.If calamity or age forced the shutdown of City Water Tunnel No. 2, which is 80 years old, the primary water supply to much of Brooklyn and Queens would be lost for at least three months, city engineers said, the time it would take for an emergency activation of the sections of Tunnel No. 3 in Brooklyn and Queens that have already been finished.The entire Brooklyn-Queens leg of the new tunnel was scheduled to be finished by 2021, with $336 million included in the capital budget in 2013 by Mr. de Blasio\u2019s predecessor, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, for whom completion of the third tunnel was the most urgent and expensive undertaking of his tenure.The city intends to finish the remaining portions of the tunnel sometime in the 2020s, but it has not set a date for completion nor allocated money in the budget to carry out the work. For the foreseeable future, the $6 billion tunnel will remain dry in the two largest boroughs, where well over half the city\u2019s population lives.\u201cYou look back over the last 50 years, whenever there were fiscal pressures, the unseen world of the municipal water system is where weak city leaders turned to cut spending,\u201d said Kevin Bone, a professor of architecture at Cooper Union and an editor of \u201cWater-Works: The Architecture and Engineering of the New York City Water Supply.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m disappointed to hear that they\u2019ve deferred it. It is symptomatic about planning for the future in America.\u201dCompletion of the third tunnel rose to the top of Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s to-do list, his aides said, after a frightening meeting in 2002, during his first weeks as mayor. Officials from dozens of agencies had gathered to talk about preparedness for events like terrorist attacks and natural disasters.\u201cAs ugly and disastrous as those scenarios were, none of them came close to the possible collapse of one of the two water tunnels that would make half the businesses and residences inside the city of New York uninhabitable,\u201d recalled Kevin Sheekey, a former deputy mayor, who was at the session.Actual digging did not begin until 1970.In the decades that followed, lawsuits, financial crises and other priorities sometimes brought the tunnel construction to a halt \u2014 \u201cThe $1 Billion Tunnel to Nowhere\u201d was the title of a New York magazine article published in 1979 \u2014 or to move along so slowly that completion remained beyond the sights of most people alive in 2002.That left the city vulnerable to the potential collapse of old tunnels hundreds of feet below ground, or, perhaps more likely, the breakdown of equipment which could not be repaired.Nine and a half million people consume what has been called the champagne of drinking water. We took a look at its journey from source to tap.Mr. de Blasio, who was a city councilman and later the public advocate during the Bloomberg years, criticized the mayor for the rate increases and suggested that they were actually being used as a backdoor tax to build up revenue for nonwater projects.Near the end of Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s final term in office, the portion of Tunnel No. 3 serving the Bronx and Manhattan was completed, allowing the city to take 10 shafts serving Tunnel No. 1 out of service, said James J. Roberts, an engineer who is the deputy commissioner for water and sewer operations at the Department of Environmental Protection. Those shafts hold the operating equipment that had shown the most wear and tear, he said, but are still being maintained and could be used in an emergency.\u201cCity Tunnel No. 3 Brooklyn/Queens activation has been deferred,\u201d William Pfrang, a consulting engineer with the city\u2019s water finance authority, wrote in a 2015 report. Asked at a City Council hearing last month when the tunnel would be working, Emily Lloyd, the commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection, said, \u201cMy guess is that we\u2019re talking the mid-\u201920s.\u201dThis year, in a departure from typical city practices, the administration allocated $52 million to design and acquire property for two Tunnel No. 3 shafts in the Maspeth section of Queens, though no money has yet been committed to build them.\u201cThat gives us the ability to move forward should funding be available at some future year, for actually doing construction,\u201d said Vincent Sapienza, the deputy environmental commissioner for engineering, design and construction.Asked why construction of Tunnel No. 3 had been deferred, the de Blasio administration at first said it had been a decision of Mayor Bloomberg\u2019s, but later said it had been a matter of setting its own new priorities and addressing the cost of state and federal mandates.Mr. Roberts, the deputy commissioner, said Tunnel No. 2 was in better shape than Tunnel No. 1, reducing the urgency to complete No. 3 for Brooklyn and Queens.\u201cYou have to make judgments about priorities, and you can\u2019t lose sight of the fact that you need to keep water rates affordable,\u201d said Mr. Roberts, who has spent three decades at the agency. \u201cYou\u2019ve got real people who need to pay real bills, and we try to be very conscious of that. Certainly, the mayor\u2019s office has been very conscious of that. It\u2019s an important factor.\u201dEmily S. Rueb contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Better the Saudis We Know", "Date": "2016-04-22", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsSAUDI ARABIA is dismayed by President Obama\u2019s Middle East policy. Its leaders feel that he does not play by the rules that have governed the Saudi-American alliance for decades: The United States provides security guarantees in return for the Persian Gulf states\u2019 reliable stewardship of their oil reserves and support for American regional dominance.In the Saudis\u2019 view, Mr. Obama has betrayed their interests, often in favor of their enemy, Iran. Having concluded that the United States is no longer a reliable ally, they've decided they must go it alone as a regional power, while also strengthening the country\u2019s domestic economy. In both instances, though, the kingdom is overplaying its hand. The Saudis can\u2019t, in reality, stand up to Iran, nor can their domestic reform agenda deliver, especially if the country remains embroiled in regional conflicts. Failure on both fronts could drag the United States back into the region militarily.The relationship has been rocky since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, when it became clear that 15 of the plane hijackers were Saudi citizens. Mr. Obama\u2019s visit coincided with controversy over a bill before Congress that would enable victims of the attacks to sue the Saudi government \u2014 a vivid reminder of the long-running tensions. (The Saudis have threatened economic reprisals if the bill passes, even though the White House has said the president would veto it.)Yet there is truth to the Saudis\u2019 sense that the Obama administration has attenuated the alliance. The Saudis were shocked when America withdrew its forces from Iraq in 2010 and left Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, a pro-Iranian Shiite, in charge as prime minister. This abandoned Iraq\u2019s Sunnis to the sectarian Mr. Maliki\u2019s mercy, which indirectly abetted the rise of the Islamic State in Iraq.The final straw came with the American-led nuclear deal with Iran in 2015. While this froze Iran\u2019s nuclear program in return for lifting economic sanctions, it placed no constraints on Iran\u2019s ability to project power, either directly or through proxies, across the region, from Lebanon and Syria to Iraq and Yemen.Saudis and non-Saudis alike used to complain about the paralysis of Saudi policy making. Not any more. Now the complaints are of sudden, erratic shifts. The result has been more instability in an already turbulent region. Saudi Arabia will not be able to militarily dominate Iran: It has neither the manpower and the expertise nor the broad network of proxy forces that the Iranians have.The kingdom has also thrown caution to the wind in the domestic arena. The House of Saud knows it must diversify its economy, moving away from oil and providing new sources of employment for its young population. The plan to sell off a share of the highly prized national asset, the state-owned oil and gas company Saudi Aramco, as well as privatizing parts of the health and education sectors, shows how far Riyadh is prepared to go.Yet the Saudi economy \u2014 still deeply dependent on state spending \u2014 is unlikely to generate the $100 billion of annual non-oil government revenue envisaged for 2020. Outside the oil sector, its technocratic resources are limited and its capacity for private enterprise is stunted. Many seasoned technocrats believe that playing with the governance of Saudi Aramco, by far the kingdom\u2019s best-functioning institution, is risky.The kingdom\u2019s understandable desire to increase its geopolitical standing and economic autonomy risks overreaching. America can help mitigate this situation. Saudi Arabia needs the American alliance for economic as well as security reasons. It needs to increase foreign investment to finance both the reform program and its ballooning deficit. A clear signal that the United States, the Saudis\u2019 biggest investor, will continue security cooperation would ease foreign investors\u2019 jitters, as well as calm the Saudi leadership.Despite the surface tensions, King Salman and Prince Mohammed are by temperament and conviction deeply pro-American. It would be a desperately wasted opportunity for Washington not to take advantage of this.As unpalatable as cooperation with the kingdom might be for some, cutting it adrift is worse. Whatever the resentments, neither side has a realistic alternative to the other \u2014 something President Obama has clearly had difficulty reconciling himself to.Bernard Haykel is professor of Near Eastern studies at Princeton.

{"Headline": "A Cashless Society? Not Before Tubman\u2019s $20 Arrives", "Date": "2016-04-22", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 After more than a century-long wait, women and African-Americans are finally going to be represented on the country\u2019s paper currency. But with the new bills years away, how many people will even be carrying cash by the time they go into circulation?Although the long-discussed cashless society is unlikely to have arrived by then, the trend is clear: Americans are relying less on paper money and more on plastic for all manner of transactions.Among them is Matt Bretzius, 31, the president of FischTank Marketing and P.R. in New York. Using cards, he said, makes it easier to manage his spending and record-keeping, and his employees, most in their 20s, use digital payment services like Venmo or PayPal even to reimburse each other for a coffee.\u201cI very rarely see cash exchanged,\u201d he said, \u201ceven for just three bucks.\u201d When he was forced this month to use cash for several days after his credit card number was stolen, it \u201cwas sort of a weird, dirty feeling,\u201d he said.Mr. Bretzius acknowledged that \u201cthe historical significance of putting Harriet Tubman on the bill obviously is fantastic.\u201d But he continued: \u201cIn 20 or 30 years when the bills are circulating, are we going to see a lot of people that have a bunch of $20 bills in their pockets or purses? I don\u2019t think so, personally. I think we\u2019re going to keep trending toward this digital way of spending, especially as the older generations still carrying cash are dying out.\u201dTo argue that there will still be a receptive public for the new notes, Treasury officials on Friday pointed to Federal Reserve data that show a steady increase in the amount of currency in circulation. The $20 bills will feature Tubman, the former slave, abolitionist and suffragist, instead of the slave-owning President Andrew Jackson; $10 bills will feature five suffragists on the back; and $5 bills will honor on the back Eleanor Roosevelt, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the African-American classical singer Marian Anderson.From 1995 to 2015, the number of paper notes in circulation more than doubled, to more than 38 billion from just over 17 billion. Much of that is used in transactions outside this country, since the dollar is the international exchange currency.\u201cWe may be a cashless society one day, but not as soon as some imagine,\u201d Mark Patterson, a former Treasury chief of staff, wrote in an email.He added: \u201cA lot of people dislike paying with a device, even if it\u2019s more convenient. (See the lines at non-EZPass toll lanes.) Many Americans remain unbanked, making electronic payments impossible. And as long as there are babysitters, bellhops, doormen, street vendors and Christmas stockings, there will be cash.\u201d\u201cBut what do I know?\u201d added Mr. Patterson, 54. \u201cI still use cash at Starbucks.\u201dGreg McBride, the chief financial analyst at Bankrate, echoed that skepticism about the speed of a transition to a cashless economy.\u201cGreenbacks aren\u2019t going to disappear, simply because there are a lot of places on this planet that from the moment you step outside the airport, people love U.S. dollars,\u201d Mr. McBride said.He offered other reasons for the staying power of American cash. The biggest: \u201cThe underground economy still runs on cash,\u201d for legal and illegal purposes.Also, as the government continues to cut back on the number of larger bills, smaller bills like the $20 note will increase. Cash will remain in demand for tips. And should interest rates ever be negative, as they have been in Europe and Japan, more people would stash cash in safe deposit boxes.\u201cNever say never,\u201d Mr. McBride said about a cashless future, \u201cbut in the next five, 10 years? Nah, I don\u2019t think so.\u201dStill, he added, \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to migrate that way.\u201d And, he said, by 2030 \u2014 when the Mr. Lew hopes that all of the new bills will have gotten into Americans\u2019 wallets \u2014 a cashless society will be \u201ccertainly getting closer.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Inquiries Cloud de Blasio\u2019s Bid to Come Off as Strong Manager Before \u201917 Race", "Date": "2016-04-15", "News": "Supported byIn the past two weeks, though, the mayor\u2019s fortunes have swung wildly in the opposite direction. His ability and style as a manager have come under excruciating scrutiny, as four separate investigative agencies pursue inquiries into possible wrongdoing on the part of his administration.Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, has been peppered with uncomfortable questions at news conferences and on national television, at a time when he hoped to be acting as a liberal standard-bearer for Hillary Clinton ahead of New York\u2019s presidential primary on Tuesday.Instead, the mayor has repeatedly pleaded ignorance about the questionable actions of city agencies, all but undoing recent attempts by close aides to portray him as an adroit manager of a sprawling city bureaucracy that critics initially said he was too inexperienced or too ideological to handle effectively.In March, the city comptroller\u2019s office opened an inquiry into a city-approved change to a deed that allowed a nursing home on the Lower East Side of Manhattan to be converted to the type of luxury apartments the mayor has said he wants to limit. Mr. de Blasio said he first learned of the matter from news reports.In addition to the federal inquiry and the one by the comptroller, investigations are underway into the nursing home deal by the state attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, and the city\u2019s Investigation Department.Mr. de Blasio, who spent much of his first year as mayor focused on providing universal prekindergarten and much of the second year on his affordable housing initiative, said in an interview last month that he was intent on pressing ahead with an aggressive policy agenda.\u201cWe are going up the ambition scale here,\u201d he said of his next goals: reducing homelessness, improving mental health services and addressing the dirt and disorder that tarnish the quality of New Yorkers\u2019 lives.That image, which Mr. de Blasio has worked hard to shed, lent credibility to the notion that he could be vulnerable in the 2017 election, with potential challenges from both the right and left. But before the investigations came to light, Mr. de Blasio enjoyed rising popularity in polls, with no prominent Democrat emerging as a serious rival.\u201cHe appears to be the type of political leader that those type of allegations accrue to,\u201d said Don Levy, director of the Siena Research Institute, which conducts political polls. \u201cA few years into his administration, his armor has taken a few hits and his accomplishments at this point just don\u2019t seem to have turned the tide on a growing narrative of his not being effective.\u201dTwo former city officials familiar with City Hall\u2019s working said the mayor\u2019s desire to closely manage decisions \u2014 and his displeasure when subordinates failed to answer his detailed questions \u2014 could backfire at times, making agency officials wary of bringing potentially troublesome issues to him in their early stages.One former official said that on several occasions, Mr. de Blasio said he had not been informed about an issue, when there was evidence that he had been, either by email or in person. The mayor would say he had not read the emails, the official said. Both officials, who still work in New York City, requested anonymity to speak about the administration\u2019s internal operations.\u201cThe mayor is driven and passionate and holds his people accountable,\u201d said Phil Walzak, a chief adviser to Mr. de Blasio. \u201cPeople want to take information to the mayor when there\u2019s a problem identified and some recommendations that can be made. I don\u2019t know that people are reluctant to talk to him. I wouldn\u2019t agree with that assessment.\u201dMr. Walzak said the investigations had not dampened progress on the mayor\u2019s agenda. \u201cThe mission of the administration is going to continue forward,\u201d he said.In recent months, Mr. de Blasio has also moved beyond criticizing the previous administration\u2019s failures and has begun celebrating the city and a trajectory that he can claim as his own.How far Mr. de Blasio\u2019s new approach will carry him, as attention remains focused on the investigations, is an open question.In the interview last month, Mr. de Blasio said that he would be personally involved in the planning and execution of what he called \u201cnew, prominent efforts,\u201d attending meetings and making sure that subordinates retained a sense of urgency.\u201cIn any one of these efforts I set the strategic template,\u201d he said, \u201cand that can mean agreeing to a vision, to a set of strategies and tactics that my team develops.\u201dBut on Monday, as Mr. de Blasio announced changes to how his administration handled homeless people, he faced repeated questions about the investigations and his fund-raising practices. \u201cI\u2019m happy to take questions today, but I\u2019m not going to be speaking about this after today,\u201d he said.But two days later, he was answering more questions about the investigations \u2014 and about his skit with Mrs. Clinton \u2014 after an event held by the Rev. Al Sharpton, where she also spoke. \u201cGlad we focused on the important issues of the day,\u201d he said sarcastically to reporters before walking off.Advertisement"}

In a second stage, 20 percent of voters would have to agree to the recall for it to be held. Mr. Maduro\u2019s opponents would then have to win the recall with more votes than he received in his initial election, just under 51 percent.Were Mr. Maduro to be removed this year, elections for a new president would be called.That the commission gave the opposition access to the paperwork at all came as a surprise to many in Venezuela. Opposition leaders said that on previous attempts they had been ignored by the commission. One encounter turned violent.Luis Pedro Espa\u00f1a, a sociologist and political scientist in Venezuela, said the government would probably try to delay the process until next year. If it can, Mr. Maduro could still be recalled, but his vice president would serve the remainder of the term.\u201cThe government has no chance of winning an election and it knows it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see it in the polls, in the results of the Dec. 6 election and the crisis conditions that the country is facing.\u201dOil prices, which had financed Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019 ambitious socialist agenda, have collapsed and the International Monetary Fund is predicting triple-digit inflation. The country has ordered rolling blackouts as electricity runs low, and the shortages have meant that people must stand in line for hours to buy basic items like eggs and milk.On Tuesday, the government declared Wednesday and Thursday holidays for government workers to save electricity, adding them to Friday, which had already been declared a no-work day. The government also said children would not attend school on Friday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After WikiLeaks Revelation, Greece Asks I.M.F. to Clarify Bailout Plan", "Date": "2016-04-02", "News": "Supported byGreece called on the International Monetary Fund on Saturday to explain whether it was seeking to usher Athens toward bankruptcy ahead of a pivotal referendum in June on Britain\u2019s membership in Europe. Greece\u2019s comments came after I.M.F. officials raised questions in a private discussion published by WikiLeaks about what it would take to get Greece\u2019s creditors to agree to debt relief.The I.M.F. declined to comment on the WikiLeaks transcript, but said in a statement that Greece needed to be put \u201con a path of sustainable growth\u201d supported by reforms and further debt relief. The document touched off a fresh political frenzy inside Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019s government, which accused the I.M.F. of trying to \u201cpolitically destabilize Europe.\u201dPrivately, however, the fund has discussed pulling out of the bailout deal unless European creditors agree to reduce Greece\u2019s mountain of debt, without which Greece could be dealt a new economic blow. An I.M.F. exit would put the bailout in jeopardy and raise the risk of a Greek default in July, when Athens must repay a large loan. But the European creditors, especially Germany, have resisted, and are pushing the fund instead to soften the austerity terms it is trying to wrench from Greece.In the transcript, Mr. Thomsen suggests that only a precipitous event might push the Europeans to give in on debt relief and keep the I.M.F. from leaving the bailout.\u201cWhat is going to bring it all to a decision point?\u201d Mr. Thomsen asks, according to the WikiLeaks document. \u201cIn the past, there has been only one time when the decision has been made and then that was when they were about to run out of money seriously and to default. And possibly this is what is going to happen again,\u201d he said.European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.Mr. Thomsen added that the June timing of the British referendum on whether to exit the European Union was crucial, because European leaders would be preoccupied with it for at least a month before then and would not want to return to discussions about the Greek bailout until after the vote. That could pose problems for whether Greece receives financial aid from the bailout in time to meet its July debt repayments.Mr. Tsipras\u2019s government met in an emergency session on Saturday to discuss the implications. \u201cThe Greek government asks the I.M.F. for explanations whether pursuing the creation of bankruptcy conditions in Greece, just before the British referendum, is the fund\u2019s official position,\u201d Olga Gerovasili, a Greek government spokeswoman, said in a statement.As a condition for it to stick with the bailout, the I.M.F. has pressed Germany hard to agree to Greek debt relief. The I.M.F. has leverage because the German Parliament might not agree to release funds to Greece unless the I.M.F. participates in the program. But Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, Germany\u2019s finance minister, has said he sees \u201cno argument\u201d for acceding to the I.M.F.\u2019s demands.The I.M.F. has countered that debt relief is needed not only to help the economy, but also because the Greek government is politically constrained in carrying out all the austerity needed to begin improving its tattered finances. Those frustrations boiled over in the private discussions published by WikiLeaks.\u201cThese guys agree on something and then they give it up the next day,\u201d Delia Velculescu, the I.M.F.\u2019s mission chief for Greece, is reported to tell Mr. Thomsen in the transcript. \u201cWe have said this time and again, we know that they don\u2019t do what we say,\u201d she added. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t function. For them, everything is subject to change \u2014 if the authorities want it.\u201d\u201cI am surprised that it has not happened, is that, because of the refugee situation, they take a decision, that they want to come to a conclusion,\u201d Mr. Thomsen said of the creditors, according to the transcript.If a conclusion does not come rapidly, he added, the I.M.F. would use the threat of quitting against the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who cannot afford for Greece to spiral downward at a time when it is keeping the bulk of new refugees from reaching her country.\u201cYou face a question,\u201d Mr. Thomsen suggests the fund could tell Ms. Merkel. \u201cYou have to think about what is more costly: to go ahead without the I.M.F.,\u201d he said, \u201cor to pick the debt relief that we think that Greece needs in order to keep us on board.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Paris, a Protest Movement Awakens", "Date": "2016-04-14", "News": "Supported byEditorial ObserverPARIS \u2014 A revolt over proposed labor-law reforms in France has set off an uprising among French youth, fed up, they say, over their government\u2019s failure to tackle a host of problems and thus robbing them of their future. Calling itself Nuit Debout \u2014 roughly translatable as \u201cStanding Up at Night\u201d \u2014 the movement recalls Spain\u2019s 2011 anti-austerity Indignados movement and the Occupy movement in the United States. But there are also echoes of France\u2019s own history of popular revolt, including the student-led protests of May 1968.But the attempt to weaken worker protections \u2014 whatever its intended benefits \u2014 is, in the eyes of many on the French left, a betrayal by a Socialist government they did not elect to enact business-friendly policies long advocated by the right. This move has crystallized more general frustration with the Hollande government. On March 30, Mr. Hollande was forced to abandon a constitutional amendment that would have allowed citizens found guilty of terrorism charges to be stripped of their citizenship, a proposal that provoked mutiny in the ranks of the Socialist party. On Monday, Prime Minister Manuel Valls announced measures aimed at mollifying the students, including a government subsidy for graduates seeking work. Student leaders vowed to continue their protests.After the March 31 demonstration in Paris, a handful of protesters decided not to go home and headed for the Place de la R\u00e9publique, where they spent the night. Every night since then, between several hundred and several thousand people have gathered there to call for nothing less than the invention of an entirely new political and economic order.Last Friday, the atmosphere at the Place de la R\u00e9publique seemed more Woodstock than man-the-barricades revolution. Some in the young, white crowd were dancing to techno music. A large group sat on the ground attentively listening to someone speaking with a microphone.There was also an inflatable bubble labeled \u201cEphemeral Agora.\u201d Inside, a young man was speaking to a small crowd. I asked a group of women, all in their late 20s, why they were there.They said they had come as much to find out about the movement as to support it. Perrine Gueguen, a high school teacher, said: \u201cWe\u2019re under a state of emergency in France, and there is a lot of frustration. During the COP-21 climate meeting in December, we were not allowed to demonstrate on environmental issues.\u201d Her friend Ga\u00eblle Marchand added: \u201cNeo-liberal economics are hurting everyone. Now we have the Panama Papers. We\u2019re headed for a wall.\u201dOutside the bubble, there was an information table where people could sign up to volunteer. I asked the young woman behind the table, who would identify herself only as Rosalie, what the movement was about. \u201cOur grandparents failed to bring about systemic change in 1968,\u201d she said. \u201cOur parents failed in 1995,\u201d when there were massive protests against pension-plan reforms. \u201cNow our generation has a chance to do something.\u201d She added, \u201cWe\u2019re really worried about the National Front, about the environment, about a lot of things, and we have a lot of ideas.\u201dIt is too early to tell whether the Nuit Debout movement, which rejects any formal structure, will evolve into a viable left-wing political party along the lines of Spain\u2019s Podemos or Greece\u2019s Syriza parties. On Monday morning, all temporary structures were cleared from the Place de la R\u00e9publique, but the protesters were allowed to continue gathering at night, provided they stayed peaceful and vacated the public space in the morning.Advertisement"}

Indeed, many Democrats revere Mr. Clinton as the leader who brought the party back from the political wilderness by eschewing ideological purity in favor of a more incremental, politically centrist philosophy.It\u2019s puzzling that Mrs. Clinton hasn\u2019t addressed in detail the trade-offs and the consequences, good and bad, of that legislation. That\u2019s a problem, because even though Bernie Sanders voted for the crime bill (it contained certain provisions he supported), some of his supporters view the bill as the type of compromise that they reject.Mr. Sanders\u2019s durability in this race is due in part to young, idealistic Democrats who weren\u2019t born before or don\u2019t remember the partisan battles of the 1990s. Indeed, 2016\u2019s newest voters only know the Obama-era Congress, and its near-constant state of confrontation. On the crime bill, as on the Iraq war, trade deals and gay marriage, some young critics view Mrs. Clinton\u2019s changes in position as politically convenient or unprincipled. The way to reach those voters is to acknowledge their objections and better explain what it takes to move an agenda through a hostile Congress.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s record as a senator is one of pragmatism, reflecting temperamental and philosophical differences with Mr. Sanders, whose reluctance to compromise contributes to his limited legislative record. She should take this opportunity to spell out what she would do with Congress to address mass incarceration as president.Young skeptics may not agree with her approach, but at least they would better understand why the Democratic Party acted as it did, and how its leaders aim to respond to their concerns. That\u2019s as important for uniting Democrats now as it was in the 1990s.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Panama Papers Leak Casts Light on a Law Firm Founded on Secrecy", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported byIn January, a prosecutor investigating the sweeping corruption in Brazil publicly called their law firm \u201ca huge money launderer.\u201dThe partners had become very wealthy, and Mr. Fonseca leveraged the firm\u2019s success to gain an influential role in the upper ranks of politics. He told associates that he wanted to clean up the government, serving as a special adviser to President Juan Carlos Varela until the corruption scandal in Brazil forced Mr. Fonseca to resign this year.In an interview, he said that entering politics was, in part, a way of giving back. \u201cI believe in sharing the pizza,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAt least to give others one slice.\u201dPanama\u2019s president has vowed to cooperate with any judicial investigations stemming from the leaked information, which could put him in the awkward position of allowing an inquiry into his former adviser.Mossack Fonseca has denied that it committed any wrongdoing, and Mr. Fonseca proclaimed his firm\u2019s innocence.\u201cAt the end of this storm the sky will be blue again and people will find that the only crime is the hacking\u201d of the firm\u2019s documents, he said in an hourlong interview conducted over the messaging platform WhatsApp.But some in Panama who know Mr. Fonseca say the leak\u2019s contents are at odds with how he has tried to portray himself and his role in the country.Carlos Guevara Mann, a fellow party member and former government official, said he had once asked Mr. Fonseca, already a successful novelist, why he would bother with politics. The lawyer, he recalled, told him that he wanted to set straight the nation\u2019s human rights record.\u201cWhen you match that conversation with the fact that the firm was providing services to all of those notorious human rights violators \u2014 Qaddafi, Mugabe, Assad and Putin \u2014 it really is repugnant,\u201d Mr. Mann said.\u201cThis is dangerous!\u201d Mr. Mossack wrote in an email to Mr. Fonseca and others at the firm. \u201cA red flag should have been raised immediately.\u201dMr. Mossack placed blame for the oversight on employees in the law firm\u2019s London office who were \u201cnot doing their due diligence thoroughly, (or maybe none at all).\u201dThe leaks have roiled Panama\u2019s legal and banking sectors, bedrocks of the country\u2019s economy, and chilled Panama\u2019s business class. The country\u2019s bar association has come to the firm\u2019s defense, saying the leak amounted to an attack on the country\u2019s reputation.\u201cTerrible damage is being done to them, to all lawyers and their country at large,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Alberto Alvarez, the association\u2019s president, said in a news conference on Monday.There is a lot at stake for Panama, a country whose economy heavily relies on the legal and financial services industries.The rise of Mossack Fonseca coincided with the emergence of Panama as a capital of the worldwide offshore banking industry. The increasing flow of global capital across borders during the 1970s and 1980s fueled a market for lawyers and accountants capable of sheltering the money, and Panama was primed to take advantage of the boom.Beginning in the early 1900s, its station as a trade and shipping center \u2014 at the intersection of two continents and at the convergence of the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea \u2014 made it an obvious candidate for offshore accounting. International ships flew the Panamanian flag to take advantage of its advantageous corporate tax structure, which some experts say was copied almost directly from the state of Delaware.\u201cBecause it has always been at the center of international trade, it was a natural fit for things like offshore finance and international offshore tax planning,\u201d said Victor Fleischer, a professor at the University of San Diego School of Law. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it is justified or not, but people have always thought of Panama as a little bit shady.\u201dThe firm was aggressive and nimble, capable of responding to an evolving regulatory landscape. Its reputation flourished.But other Panamanian law firms joined the fray, too, including larger and more prominent practices than Mossack Fonseca.\u201cAll the important Panamanian law firms have a division like this,\u201d said Roberto Eisenmann, the founder of the newspaper La Prensa in Panama.In fact, Mossack Fonseca is just one of countless firms around the globe dedicated to a worldwide industry that harbors trillions of dollars and may deprive nations of as much as $200 billion in tax revenues each year, tax and legal experts say.Mossack Fonseca\u2019s founding partners bought large homes in exclusive neighborhoods in Panama City as well as luxurious weekend retreats. Growing up, their children borrowed the company plane and took friends on trips.But despite their parallel ascents in business and society, Mr. Mossack and Mr. Fonseca apparently kept their social lives separate. Friends and associates describe their personalities as completely distinct.Mr. Mossack has maintained a low profile, eschewing the party scene of Panama\u2019s high society while adopting a disciplined approach to his work. Though he is more focused on the day-to-day operations, he has so far declined to comment publicly about the document leak.Mr. Fonseca, by contrast, has for years been something of a man about town. Born in Panama in 1952, he studied at the London School of Economics and later worked for several years at the United Nations in Geneva \u2014 \u201ctrying to save the world,\u201d as he described it in the interview.It was then, he said, that he first began to ponder writing a novel. Decades later, in the 1990s, he became famous as a novelist, twice winning Panama\u2019s highest literary prize.But he had even greater ambitions: politics. One day, when complaining to his father about the shabby state of Panamanian politics, the elder man snapped at him. \u201cMy father told me: It\u2019s not fair to criticize the bullfighter from your seat,\u201d he wrote in the interview. \u201cEnter the ring!\u201dBy the 2000s, he was well ensconced with the Paname\u00f1ista party and became a close adviser to Mr. Varela. After Mr. Varela became president in 2014, Mr. Fonseca joined his cabinet as an adviser.Within Mossack Fonseca, both founding partners had swagger. Former employees said the firm had a staff of aides, whose job it was to arrange hotel, car service and entertainment for wealthy clients when they came to town \u2014 like tours of the old city or the Panama Canal.\u201cThere were no kings or princes that I remember,\u201d said Tarina Rodr\u00edguez, adding that she worked at the firm for three years and served as the \u201chead of hospitality.\u201d The visitors, she said, \u201cwere very low-key businessmen, who wanted to keep a low profile.\u201dSeveral former employees described a disciplined culture, arguing that the partners appeared to run an ethical business. Mr. Mossack and Mr. Fonseca, they said, were sticklers for compliance, insisting on detailed procedures concerning most business matters at the firm.\u201cThere were so many processes you had to follow,\u201d said Mileidy Castillo, who said she worked at the firm from 2011 to 2013.Experts say, however, that checking boxes is not the full measure of compliance. Rather, it comes with a law firm\u2019s willingness to push its clients to reveal the true identity of those involved in offshore transactions, and the source of their money.\u201cToo often, these offshore firms are willing to take on just about any customer and follow their instructions,\u201d said Jack Blum, a former Senate investigator who now specializes in examining money laundering and tax evasion.As offshore accounts have multiplied during the past several decades, they have increasingly been used to launder money, evade taxes or finance terrorism. Those seeking to break the law have often enjoyed the same secrecy as accounts used for legitimate purposes.An international transparency movement developed over the past decade, spearheaded by major international agencies. But Panama, long accustomed to following its own path, was far behind in compliance.\u201cIn the last 25 years or so, there has probably been 15 years of almost no regulation,\u201d Mr. Eisenmann said of Panama.In 2014, the Financial Action Task Force put Panama on its list of countries where transparency and accountability systems were woefully lacking, a major blow to the nation. Mr. Varela quickly pushed through legislation to address the issue, leading to Panama\u2019s removal from the list in February.But Panama has been more reluctant to follow a transparency initiative started in 2009 by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. While most other international financial centers, like the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands and Singapore, quickly agreed to the initiative, Panama held back.\u201cPanama is the last major holdout that continues to allow funds to be hidden offshore from tax and law enforcement authorities,\u201d the group\u2019s secretary general, \u00c1ngel Gurr\u00eda, said in a statement on Monday.But several tax experts pointed out that Panama, in its refusal to comply with international transparency standards, is in esteemed company: the United States.Foreign nations have had trouble getting information about accounts their citizens hold in America as well.\u201cPanama isn\u2019t the real story,\u201d said Matt Gardner, the executive director of the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a research group based in Washington. \u201cThis leak is giving a window into a much broader world, but it should be understood as giving a window into how things work in the U.S. as well.\u201dSince the data leak last weekend, both the firm and Mr. Fonseca have said that they are not responsible for the actions of the shell companies they create.In the interview on Wednesday, Mr. Fonseca said that the company was careful to vet clients, and that it would drop any it discovered with a \u201cbad reputation.\u201d But he was insistent that his clients were lawyers, accountants and intermediaries \u2014 not dictators, for instance.\u201cWe are like a car factory who sells its car to a dealer (a lawyer for example), and he sells it to a lady that hits someone,\u201d he wrote in a message. \u201cThe factory is not responsible for what is done with the car.\u201dMr. Fonseca said his firm tried to determine \u201cto the best of our knowledge\u201d the actual owner of a shell corporation.\u201cThe industry is becoming more regulated and serious about being used by the bad guys and we welcome this,\u201d he wrote, adding, \u201cBut pls remember that 15 years ago the term due diligence was unknown.\u201dOver the years, courts and government investigators have occasionally managed to puncture Mossack Fonseca\u2019s shield of secrecy.In Brazil, Mossack Fonseca was linked to a corruption investigation into bribes paid to politicians by companies doing business with the state-run oil company. Investigators began focusing on the firm after finding an array of apartments in the names of relatives of an imprisoned politician.Recent litigation in the United States uncovered a connection between a shell company set up in Nevada and Mossack Fonseca\u2019s headquarters in Panama. The breakthrough came after almost three years of legal wrangling by the plaintiff, one of the world\u2019s best-financed hedge funds, run by the billionaire Paul Singer.The hedge fund was trying to track down money that had been siphoned from public coffers in Argentina into illegal shell companies. The hedge fund owned $1.7 billion of Argentine debt dating to the nation\u2019s financial crisis in the early 2000s, and the country was refusing to pay it.But the hedge fund\u2019s task was not so simple. A shell company known as MF Nevada was claiming that it had no relationship with Mossack Fonseca.Even the judge found this hard to believe, at one point asking the company\u2019s lawyer what the \u201cMF\u201d in MF Nevada stood for, according to a court transcript.\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d the lawyer responded, eliciting laughter in the courtroom.During questioning, the person listed on the incorporation documents acknowledged that she took her directions from individuals at Mossack Fonseca. The federal judge in Nevada found that the shell company was essentially an alter ego of Mossack Fonseca, in effect granting the hedge fund access to information ordinarily held behind the law firm\u2019s impenetrable facade in Panama.\u201cAs attorneys we have the duty to provide privacy,\u201d Mr. Fonseca said in the interview.He feels his firm, in particular, has been robbed of it.Mr. Fonseca said he was currently working on a novel about an investigative journalist who is \u201chonest and looking for the truth without agendas.\u201d And he has already begun outlining another book.The working title: \u201cIs privacy a lost human right?\u201dAn article on April 7 about Mossack Fonseca, the Panamanian law firm that became a powerhouse of secretive offshore banking for the world\u2019s elite, misstated the surname of the secretary general of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, who said Panama has been reluctant to follow an international banking transparency initiative started by the organization in 2009. He is \u00c1ngel Gurr\u00eda, not Gerri.Kirk Semple and Azam Ahmed reported from Mexico City, and Eric Lipton from Washington.

When Nicolas Berggruen spoke, no one interrupted. Only he occasionally checked his phone. And at dinner, the guests received fruit tarts for dessert \u2014 except for Mr. Berggruen, who was served chocolate mousse.\u201cThere is a generation of new donors who have huge assets, and their own ideas, and think traditional think tanks are old-fashioned,\u201d said James G.

He has established councils to study European integration and China.The Berggruen Institute will award an annual $1 million prize in philosophy beginning this year. It is presently funding six Berggruen academic fellowships to China and other places, and it has selected 16 others for the 2016-17 academic year.Mr. Berggruen says he bought more than 400 acres in Brentwood, Calif., and has commissioned the renowned Swiss architecture firm Herzog & de Meuron to design his institute\u2019s headquarters. Craig Calhoun, who is leaving the directorship of the London School of Economics this summer, was appointed president. Mr. Calhoun said his mandate was to \u201cdeepen the conversation.\u201dMr. Berggruen has a gift for networking. \u201cHe knows everyone,\u201d said his friend Stefan Simchowitz, an art dealer. At the philosophy conference in Stanford, he hosted a conversation about artificial intelligence with Antonio Damasio, a neuroscientist who heads the Brain and Creativity Institute at the University of Southern California, and Reid Hoffman, a co-founder of LinkedIn.Mr. Hoffman met Mr. Berggruen through a mutual friend who mentioned Mr. Berggruen\u2019s interests in California governance and Chinese philosophy. \u201cI said, \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s interesting. Let me meet him,\u2019\u201d Mr. Hoffman recalled.The luminaries listed on the institute\u2019s advisory boards are the kind who pop up at White House state dinners or on Barry Diller\u2019s yacht: Arianna Huffington, co-founder of The Huffington Post; the SpaceX founder Elon Musk; Tony Blair, the former British prime minister; Francis Fukuyama, the Stanford professor; and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.\u201cI\u2019m not really involved anymore, but I like Nicolas,\u201d Ms. Rice said in a phone interview. She served on the Think Long Committee for California, a brain trust Mr. Berggruen assembled in 2010 to address the state\u2019s budget crisis.Mr. Berggruen makes it easy for even very busy people to lend their prestige. He foots the bills, booking guests in luxury hotels and sometimes ferrying them on his private jet. In workshops, he asks the kind of big-picture questions that politicians, intellectuals and billionaires like to answer.Orville Schell, a China scholar at the Asia Society in New York and an adviser to the Berggruen Institute, said that Mr. Berggruen gained access to Chinese leaders because he focused on philosophy and culture, not politics and human rights, and noted that his approach was \u201castute.\u201dIt also helped that Mr. Berggruen did not appear to have a business agenda. \u201cIn some ways he is a thinking man\u2019s Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Schell said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want anything from anybody, except to be of consequence.\u201dWhile Mr. Berggruen has arrived, even in his early days he wasn\u2019t exactly an arriviste. His father, Heinz Berggruen, was an art dealer who fled the Nazis in 1936, romanced Frida Kahlo in New York and befriended Picasso in Paris.The younger Mr. Berggruen attended Le Rosey, an exclusive Swiss boarding school, and studied finance at New York University, but he says he began investing as a teenager, borrowing a few thousand pounds from a friend to buy stocks. Forbes estimates his fortune to be about $1.5 billion. Last year, Town & Country magazine named him one of the world\u2019s 50 most eligible bachelors.And last month, he became a bachelor father. Or, as he put it when asked who the mother is: \u201cMe. I am the mother and the father.\u201d Mr. Berggruen has two newborns, a boy and a girl, born three weeks apart to different surrogates and conceived using eggs from two donors.Single fatherhood has now tethered him to Los Angeles, he said, but not too tightly: He bought the apartment one floor down for the children and their nannies.Since 2015, his institute has been funded by his Bermuda-registered charitable trust. He says it has a $1 billion endowment. Foreign status means that Mr. Berggruen forfeits United States tax breaks but can give away money as he chooses. Bermuda has almost none of the restrictions or disclosure rules that bind American nonprofits.In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, Mr. Berggruen said, he began to question his life\u2019s purpose. That led him, in 2010, to hire professors from the University of California, Los Angeles, to tutor him in philosophy.Brian Walker, a political science professor and expert in Chinese philosophy, was one of those. Professor Walker would discuss Plato and Confucius with Mr. Berggruen over lunch in his suite at the Peninsula Hotel. \u201cIt was sort of a surreal setting, but he always did the reading and asked good questions,\u201d Mr. Walker said. \u201cI found him a little mysterious. He didn\u2019t invite personal confidences.\u201dMr. Berggruen is courteous and even courtly: In restaurants, he stands when his date leaves the table. But he isn\u2019t a schmoozer. His Stanford conference ran from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. with little time for small talk.At the philosophy dinner, he asked that his guests discuss harmony and freedom in the East and West. He was playful, but only on topic. \u201cI am going to say something that will make all of you want to kill me,\u201d he said, bringing conversation and forks to a halt. \u201cThe West is absolutist, India is pluralist, and China is \u2014 and I don\u2019t mean this in a negative way \u2014 conformist.\u201dMr. Berggruen spoke proudly of the work his Think Long Committee did to address California\u2019s deficit, including supporting Proposition 31, which among other things would have barred lawmakers from creating expenditures over $25 million without finding the money for them. Mr. Berggruen spent more than $1 million to get the proposition on the ballot. The initiative was voted down in 2012.In 2010, Mr. Berggruen took the Giving Pledge \u2014 which has become a kind of social register for big-time philanthropists \u2014 joining billionaires who have promised to give away more than half of their fortunes. But he is not a spendthrift. He is a trustee of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and tax records show that in 2014 he gave the museum $100,000, the minimum annual gift required; many give double that amount, or more, according to two trustees. That year, Mr. Berggruen gave U.C.L.A. $4,750.Mr. Berggruen says he wants to nurture innovative thinking, not just donate to causes. His institute, he said, is \u201cnot just a money-giving operation; it\u2019s an ideas and energy-producing operation.\u201dSeveral scholars say that Mr. Berggruen\u2019s interdisciplinary approach to philosophy is refreshing in an academic world that can be siloed. Kwame Anthony Appiah, a philosopher at New York University, said he attended a Berggruen event because it gave him a chance to talk to experts about Confucianism, which is not his primary field of study.\u201cI can\u2019t say whether it\u2019s the best use of his money,\u201d Professor Appiah said. \u201cI can only consider whether he is making the world better or worse, and in this case I would have to say, better.\u201dAn article last Sunday about the Berggruen Institute, the think tank operated by the billionaire investor Nicolas Berggruen, misstated, using information from the institute, the number of scholars it is currently funding. There are six scholars, not five.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Getting the Art Out on the Streets", "Date": "2016-04-15", "News": "Supported byPublic art, whether the public knows it or not, is becoming more of a private enterprise.\u201cNow, just at the point that public sector funding for the arts is drying up, the market is beginning to see the value of culture,\u201c Mr. Davy said.Six galleries are collaborating with Futurecity on the project, called the \u201cCulture Line.\u201d Pace, for example, will be represented by digital evocations of migration by Michal Rovner at the Canary Wharf stop. The artwork, costing about 1 million pounds, or $1.4 million, is partly financed by the Canary Wharf Group.Gagosian will show Douglas Gordon and Richard Wright at Tottenham Court Road, while Spencer Finch from Lisson Gallery will edify travelers at Paddington with prints of clouds on the glass roof of the ticket hall that will seem to change with the weather.The other three galleries, Victoria Miro, Sadie Coles HQ and White Cube, have yet to announce their participating artists. The 70-mile Crossrail, which will link Reading in the west to Shenfield in the east, is due to open in 2018.\u201cCities want to be put on the map as a cultural destination,\u201d said Marc Spiegler, the global director of Art Basel. \u201cThe creative class is significant in attracting talent from other sectors such as finance and software development.\u201dMr. Spiegler said Art Basel\u2019s involvement might include developing a gallery district, open-air art displays or digital platforms, with governmental economic development grants being the most likely source of financing.\u201cWe feel we can help cities develop a robust cultural scene,\u201d he said.The loosening of the institutional hold over public art can be seen in the Westminster borough of London, where \u201dVroom Vroom,\u201d a sculpture by Lorenzo Quinn of a vintage Fiat 500 automobile being grabbed like a toy by a giant hand, has been installed in the median of Park Lane.Donated by the private Halcyon Gallery, it is one of more than 100 works in the borough\u2019s \u201cCity of Sculpture\u201d initiative, to which 15 commercial and two public galleries have contributed.Robert Davis, the deputy leader of the Westminster City Council, said that despite the constraints placed on public finances in Britain, his council was committed to \u201cproviding our residents and visitors with the opportunity to access inspiring public art in the streets and spaces around them.\u201dMr. Davis said the borough negotiated contributions of public art with developers applying for planning permits.The proliferation of public art in central London comes at a time when the city has attracted a concentration of international wealth, bloating property prices and making it the undisputed capital of Europe\u2019s art market, if not creativity.\u201cThere\u2019s a danger of London losing the richness that makes creative things happen,\u201d said the architecture critic Rowan Moore, the author of the 2016 book, \u201cSlow Burn City: London in the 21st Century.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s always had a huge density of diverse architecture and people in close proximity,\u201d Mr. Moore said, \u201cbut central London is now becoming a gigantic housing estate for high- and ultrahigh net worth individuals.\u201dOne of the sleekest additions is Embassy Gardens, a complex of almost 2,000 loft-style apartments adjacent to the new American Embassy at Nine Elms on the south bank of the Thames, being built by the Irish developers Ballymore. Two-bedroom apartments start at \u00a31.1 million.Nearby, in a new public park, Ballymore has unveiled sculptures by Sarah Lucas, Simon Fujiwara and Mohammed Ashfaq, curated by Norman Rosenthal and the developer\u2019s chairman and chief executive, Sean Mulryan.The local Wandsworth and Lambeth councils required the developers of a project named Nine Elms to formulate a \u201ccultural strategy showing a contribution to public art,\u201d said Mr. Davy of Futurecity, which was involved in the initial planning.\u201cCentral to our vision for Embassy Gardens is creating a sense of place, and these sculptures will add to the rich cultural diversity of Nine Elms,\u201d Mr. Mulryan said by email. \u201cThe new linear park will draw on the heritage of London\u2019s great parks and will bring public vibrancy to the area \u2014 creating a space for community, culture and connections.\u201dBut London is continuing to polarize into a city of the rich and everyone else. In March 2015, the charity Trust for London published research by Oxford University showing that from 1980 to 2010 the number of poor and rich households in London each increased by 80 percent, while middle income households, traditionally people who appreciate art, declined by 43 percent.As such, London is becoming a place to visit, what Mr. Davy of Futurecity calls an \u201curban play area,\u201d rather than a place in which to live. And its public art reflects this.Ballymore\u2019s park sculptures, the installations of the \u201cCulture Line,\u201d Futurecity\u2019s 90-yard-long \u201cSlipstream\u201d sculpture by Richard Wilson at Heathrow Airport\u2019s Terminal 5 and Mr. Quinn\u2019s \u201cVroom Vroom\u201d are being viewed by people whose minds and bodies are on the move.Public art is changing fast. The challenge for today\u2019s private patrons is to finance works that make people feel they are walking around a world-class museum, rather than an enormous commercial art fair.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Miles Ahead\u2019 and \u2018Nina\u2019 Try to Hit the Beat on the Offbeat", "Date": "2016-04-22", "News": "Supported byMidway through \u201cMiles Ahead,\u201d Miles Davis, anticipating a journalist\u2019s question, asks, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you play like you used to?\u201d He answers himself: \u201cYou have to play a long time to be able to play like yourself.\u201dComebacks, however, are not simply what haunt Davis (played here magnificently by Don Cheadle) in his non-recording years in the late 1970s, when the movie is set. Chasing the ghost of one\u2019s first love, whether it be the muse for the music or simply the music itself, coincidentally is the main conceit for two other new jazz movies, the Chet Baker-inspired \u201cBorn to Be Blue\u201d and \u201cNina,\u201d based on Nina Simone.As much as these movies resemble each other \u2014 with flashbacks and films-within-a-film, as well as plots driven by how effectively their aging characters master personal demons and professional demands \u2014 they are not so much about the life of jazz luminaries in an era past their prime. Instead, these are films about our own genre expectations and the fate of a Hollywood standard: the jazz biopic itself.Since 1927, when Al Jolson donned blackface in \u201cThe Jazz Singer,\u201d jazz movies, perhaps more than any other genre, have reflected and reproduced our nation\u2019s deepest anxieties about race, gender and musical genius.After 1960, the few jazz biopics that came to screen largely featured the stories of African-American artists: \u201cLady Sings the Blues\u201d (1972), about Billie Holiday, and Clint Eastwood\u2019s \u201cBird\u201d (1988), about Charlie Parker.Reflecting the politics of a post-civil-rights-era America, the recognition that African-Americans played a foundational role in creating and innovating in jazz was a sign of progress after their often marginal to nonexistent presence in the white jazz biopics. But while \u201cLady Sings the Blues\u201d and \u201cBird\u201d were lauded for the performances by Diana Ross and Forest Whitaker, the films were criticized for focusing more on their subjects\u2019 tragic heroin addiction than their musical contributions. For African-American musicians in such movies, Mr. Gabbard wrote, \u201cthe only success is the kind that leads to self-annihilation.\u201d He concluded, \u201cFor white artists the conditions of success are much less dire.\u201dBut as the threat of self-annihilation hovers over \u201cMiles Ahead,\u201d Mr. Cheadle (who also directed, and wrote the film with Steven Baigelman) actively pushes back against such a stereotype. There are several Davises here: lover, jazz experimenter, wife abuser, addict, philanderer and racial provocateur.And oddly feminist. One trait that jazz biopics, white or black, have shared historically is the marginalization of black women as wives, lovers and actual artists. Davis\u2019s first wife, the dancer Frances Taylor (played by Emayatzy Corinealdi), is cast not simply as the muse of Davis\u2019s best albums, including \u201cKind of Blue,\u201d but also as the figure he uses to fill up his silence.Even though it is Simone\u2019s nurse, Clifton Henderson (David Oyelowo), rather than her lover, who saves her, both films resort to the even more familiar device that female genius must be nurtured by, rediscovered by and even dependent on men to be taken seriously. The audience learns of Simone\u2019s singular contributions to American music through Henderson\u2019s eyes, as he discovers old interviews and recordings, but we are simultaneously limited by his viewpoint. As Simone\u2019s muse and our guide, Henderson simply updates the male gaze of Mr. Williams\u2019s McKay.But \u2014 like the criticism that Ms. Ross faced because she didn\u2019t resemble Holiday physically or vocally (as Farah Jasmine Griffin explored in her book \u201cIf You Can\u2019t Be Free, Be a Mystery) \u2014 \u201cNina\u201d has been plagued by criticism. Most notably there was the decision to cast the light-skinned Dominican-American Ms. Saldana and, dare I say it, the offensive darkening of her face and eyes in the movie to approximate Simone\u2019s dark brown complexion. To be fair, by inhabiting Simone\u2019s most mercurial moments and performing Simone\u2019s music herself, Ms. Saldana does give her best performance to date.But it is the presentation of Simone \u2014 the bad makeup, unpicked Afro wigs and the casting of Ms. Saldana in the first place \u2014 that underscores Hollywood\u2019s persistent resistance to showcasing the range of black women\u2019s beauty. Equally troubling is the fact that in the film, Simone\u2019s best music is behind her and Henderson must convince her to play again, making her comeback more tragic and her genius less illuminated than that of her male biopic counterparts.Clearly we are in a new phase of the jazz biopic. One that self-consciously tries to both glorify and demystify the golden age of jazz, the 1950s and 1960s, in order to explain its rarefied status in American culture and the price that artists paid for their cultural transgressions. \u201cMiles Ahead\u201d and \u201cBorn to Be Blue\u201d self-consciously play with genre by transforming Davis\u2019s impressionistic style and Baker\u2019s tender pathos from the stage to narrative structures. But perhaps for Simone, whose genre-breaking music never quite fit in the confines of jazz, a new genre of the biopic needs to be invented altogether.Advertisement"}

BTG Pactual said that it was maintaining its current management and shareholder structures. Marcelo Kalim and Roberto Sallouti will continue to serve as co-chief executives, and P\u00e9rsio Arida will remain chairman of the board.The group of seven partners who swapped shares with Mr. Esteves in December to take control of the bank in an effort to save it will remain its controlling shareholders.The return of Mr. Esteves became possible only after a ruling on Monday by Justice Teori Zavascki, justice on Brazil\u2019s high court. Justice Zavascki lifted orders that had placed Mr. Esteves under house arrest and barred him from work, his lawyer, Ant\u00f4nio Carlos de Almeida Castro, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday.The financier was accused of obstructing justice in a broad corruption investigation surrounding Petrobras, the state-owned oil giant. The investigation has been examining allegations that members of the leftist Workers Party of Brazil\u2019s president, Dilma Rousseff, conspired with top Petrobras executives and outside contractors in an elaborate money laundering and bribery ring.Mr. Esteves, a billionaire who turned BTG Pactual into a banking powerhouse, is under suspicion of conspiring with a leader of the Senate, Delc\u00eddio do Amaral, to interfere with testimony regarding the kickbacks at Petrobras. He was accused of financing the silence of a major witness and former Petrobras executive.Brazil\u2019s highest court ordered in December that Mr. Esteves be released from jail but placed under house arrest. At that time, he was barred from taking any management roles.Justice Zavascki\u2019s ruling on Monday lifted multiple injunctions restricting Mr. Esteves\u2019s movement and activity. It is not final but it allowed him to return to work immediately, his lawyer said.The broader investigation brought on by Brazil\u2019s attorney general that accuses Mr. Esteves of obstruction of justice is still underway and the full high court has yet to rule on whether to accept charges against Mr. Esteves.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Puerto Rico\u2019s Senate Declares Debt Moratorium", "Date": "2016-04-05", "News": "Supported byPuerto Rico took steps on Tuesday toward a unilateral moratorium on all government debt payments, rejecting efforts in Washington to allow it to restructure only under close federal supervision.The Puerto Rican Senate authorized a declaration of emergency and a debt moratorium at around 3 a.m., after hours of debate. The island\u2019s House of Representatives was debating such a measure late Tuesday but had not yet voted. Any bill would need to be signed by the governor, Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla.The sudden moves seemed likely to complicate efforts in Washington to enact a rescue package for Puerto Rico. The House Natural Resources Committee, which has been drafting the rescue in consultation with Democrats in Congress and the Treasury Department, said it still planned to issue an updated version on Wednesday, despite Puerto Rico\u2019s action.The rescue involves sensitive constitutional issues, and the drafters have been trying to strike a balance between Democratic and Republican Party priorities. So far, the lawmakers in Congress have called for sending a federal oversight board to Puerto Rico, auditing all major branches of government there, promoting fiscal reforms and eventually providing certain restructuring tools that are normally available only in bankruptcy.On Tuesday, Daniel Watson, a Treasury Department spokesman, said the agency continued to closely monitor the situation in Puerto Rico and was in contact with the government there. \u201cThe steps Puerto Rico is considering serve as yet another reminder that the commonwealth is in crisis and urgently needs the ability to comprehensively restructure its financial liabilities, along with independent oversight that respects the commonwealth\u2019s self-governance,\u201d the representative said.But the oversight board, which may have seemed a reasonable requirement in Washington, has been seen on the island as an intolerable vestige of colonial rule. Puerto Rican legislative aides also said Congress was moving too slowly, forcing them to enact their own rescue before their economy deteriorated even further.In addition to halting debt payments, Puerto Rico\u2019s lawmakers are acting to limit activities by the island\u2019s Government Development Bank, a crucial part of the local financial system and a participant in virtually all government debt deals. They want to preserve the bank\u2019s cash to finance essential public services.The Senate bill sets a \u201cmoratorium period\u201d that would run until at least Jan. 31, 2017. It also creates a receivership for the Government Development Bank and carves off a \u201cbridge bank\u201d that would continue to honor certain claims during the moratorium.Bank creditors whose claims are not assumed by the bridge bank would be entitled only to the amounts they would receive if the Government Development Bank were liquidated, the Senate bill says.Groups representing some of Puerto Rico\u2019s many bondholders expressed surprise at the call for a moratorium. Hector Negroni, a major bondholder at the investment fund Fundamental Credit Opportunities, said he had just landed on the island for scheduled debt negotiations when he heard.\u201cI came down here to advance a dialogue for a consensual deal on the general obligation bonds,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know about this. I got here and it happened.\u201dPuerto Rico\u2019s general obligation bonds are explicitly guaranteed by the island\u2019s Constitution, and investors holding that type of debt say it would be unconstitutional for Puerto Rico to do anything but pay in full.Andrew Rosenberg, a lawyer representing holders of general obligation bonds, said he thought the moratorium had been deliberately timed to throw cold water on the bondholders\u2019 negotiations. Even as lawmakers declared Tuesday afternoon that \u201cPuerto Rico is not for sale\u201d on the floor of the island\u2019s House, Mr. Rosenberg was distributing the terms of his group\u2019s proposal, which included halting principal repayments on $2 billion of bonds for five years.\u201cWhile we would like to negotiate with the Puerto Rican government in private and in good faith,\u201d he said, the debt moratorium had prompted him to reveal, in his view, what a good deal Puerto Rico was walking away from.The president of the Government Development Bank, Melba Acosta Febo, issued a statement rejecting the proposal Tuesday evening. She called it \u201cexactly the type of \u2018Wall Street\u2019 solution that led us to the precipice we are now looking over,\u201d because she said it would add debt and raise costs over the long term.Others with financial dealings in Puerto Rico said they were caught off guard and did not know how to respond. Some said they thought the legislation was intended not so much to trip up creditors or elicit offers as to pressure Washington to speed up its work on the federal rescue package.Some said they continued to hope on Tuesday that Puerto Rico\u2019s House might enact a narrower moratorium than its Senate had, perhaps excluding certain types of debt or agreeing to pay interest but not principal. But as the hours passed, their hopes were waning.For months Puerto Rico and its Government Development Bank have been meeting with the holders of the island\u2019s $72 billion in debt, trying to interest some of them in a consensual debt restructuring. Parties to some of these discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks are private, said they became aware late last week that the development bank\u2019s assets were being hastily transferred to other financial institutions, for reasons that were not explained.Rumors then began to fly on the island that the bank was about to be shut or privatized.A confidential regulatory review of the development bank last November found that it was insolvent and would have a $1.3 billion deficit by the end of June, which raised the prospect of dedicated funds being diverted to other purposes.The turmoil at the bank threatened to spread quickly to other parts of Puerto Rico\u2019s economy, which is already deeply distressed. Much larger debt payments, totaling about $2 billion, are due from other branches of the government on July 1.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Brussels Mentor Who Taught \u2018Gangster Islam\u2019 to the Young and Angry", "Date": "2016-04-11", "News": "Supported byWhen the Belgian police seized the computer of the man, Khalid Zerkani, in 2014, they found a trove of extremist literature, including tracts titled \u201cThirty-Eight Ways to Participate in Jihad\u201d and \u201cSixteen Indispensable Objects to Own Before Going to Syria.\u201d In July, Belgian judges sentenced him to 12 years in prison for participating in the activities of a terrorist organization, and declared him the \u201carchetype of a seditious mentor\u201d who spread \u201cextremist ideas among na\u00efve, fragile and agitated youth.\u201d\u201cMr. Zerkani has perverted an entire generation of youngsters, particularly in the Molenbeek neighborhood,\u201d the Belgian federal prosecutor, Bernard Michel, said in February.During his trial, Mr. Zerkani, 42, denied any involvement in terrorism. His Brussels lawyer, Steve Lambert, declined to comment for this article.But court documents and interviews with Molenbeek residents and activists, as well as with Belgian security officials, suggest that he had direct or indirect connections with several crucial figures who are now dead or under arrest in connection with the November massacre in Paris that killed 130 people and the bombings last month in Brussels that killed 32.His younger brother, Souleymane, traveled to Syria with help from Mr. Zerkani, according to security officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to do otherwise. The brother reportedly died there in 2014 while fighting with the Islamic State. Reda Kriket, another veteran of the conflict in Syria who was arrested in France last month in connection with the thwarted attack, stayed in Mr. Zerkani\u2019s apartment for a time and lent him his French-registered Mercedes, prosecutors said.Hawa Keita, an immigrant to Brussels from Mali, said her son, Yoni Mayne, had become radicalized in a matter of months under Mr. Zerkani\u2019s influence. (She believes her son died in battle in Syria in 2014.)\u201cHe is a sorcerer,\u201d she said of the now-imprisoned Mr. Zerkani in an interview at her apartment in a Brussels high-rise. \u201cHe is Satan.\u201dThe role in Molenbeek of Mr. Zerkani, a surly man more versed in the ways of the street than in those of the mosque, helps explain why a small and not particularly destitute district of the Belgian capital keeps cropping up in relation to terrorist investigations. It also highlights a pronounced shift over the past decade from the often arcane theological debates of an earlier generation of jihadists linked to Al Qaeda to what Hind Fraihi, who wrote a book about Molenbeek, called \u201cgangster Islam.\u201dMs. Fraihi, a Belgian of Moroccan descent, said that when she first started researching in Molenbeek more than a decade ago, the radical scene was dominated by extremist clerics well versed in religious texts. This has mutated under the influence of Islamic State propaganda, she said, into a criminal enterprise driven by \u201cthe synergy between banditism and Islam.\u201dThe Islamic State recruits among \u201cbandits and gangsters because it needs them for their knowledge of guns, safe houses and the underground scene,\u201d Ms. Fraihi said. \u201cMix this with a little Islam, and this is what you get in Molenbeek.\u201dSome trace the roots of radicalism in Molenbeek to the 1990s, when Bassam Ayachi, a Franco-Syrian former restaurant owner, set up the Belgian Islamic Center, a makeshift mosque that promoted the dogmatic Salafi strand of the religion. Residents and some municipal officials repeatedly warned the authorities that it was sheltering extremists.Philippe Moureaux, Molenbeek\u2019s mayor from 1993 until 2012, said that on meeting Mr. Ayachi, \u201cit was clear he was an extremist,\u201d but that he considered this the responsibility of the Belgian federal security service, not of municipal officials like himself.Mr. Leman, who was serving on the government\u2019s anti-discrimination commission, filed a lawsuit accusing the Islamic Center of promoting anti-Semitic and anti-American views. The court ruled in 2006 that the center had indulged in hate speech, he said. Around the same time, the Belgian police raided Mr. Ayachi\u2019s apartment, carting away computers and documents.Mr. Ayachi subsequently moved to Syria with his son, who later died in battle against government forces. Mr. Ayachi did not reply to a request for comment.Mr. Zerkani, a Moroccan who became a Belgian resident in 2002, moved on the fringes of Mr. Ayachi\u2019s milieu but did not attract close attention, people in his neighborhood said. While the Islamic Center had championed an ascetic and rigid form of Islam that had only modest appeal to young people who liked to drink alcohol and carouse at night, Mr. Zerkani, Belgian investigators said, was able to bridge the divide by channeling the criminal energies of young delinquents.Mr. Zerkani was born in Zenata, an area of northern Morocco inhabited by the country\u2019s often rebellious Berber-speaking minority, and spent time in Spain and the Netherlands before moving to Belgium when he was 28. In Brussels, his associates included supporters of the Shabab, a militant group in Somalia affiliated with Al Qaeda. Belgian investigators say he shoplifted and committed other petty crimes before becoming a prolific recruiter for the Islamic State.A senior Belgian terrorism investigator, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to do otherwise, said that it was not clear how Mr. Zerkani had become a trusted operator for the Islamic State and its predecessors, and that the extent of his involvement with people connected to plots was only now coming into focus.One theory is that Mr. Zerkani was recommended to the militant group\u2019s leadership in Syria by Fatima Aberkan, a friend of the wife of the Qaeda militant who killed Mr. Massoud, the Afghan warlord. In the 2015 trial that featured Mr. Zerkani, a Belgian court sentenced Ms. Aberkan to five years in prison for participation in a terrorist organization; she and five of her children, three sons and two daughters, have spent time in Syria with the Islamic State, prosecutors said.There is no record of Mr. Zerkani traveling to Syria. But prosecutors said that at least 18 people he was in regular contact with went there to fight between mid-2012 and 2014.At least two of the attackers are believed to have had roles in both plots.Belgian security officials and people who know Mr. Zerkani said he had assured Molenbeek\u2019s wayward youth that past criminal convictions were not an obstacle to the Islamic cause, but a vital foundation. At his trial, according to the judges\u2019 summary of the verdict, witnesses testified that he had preached that \u201cto steal from the infidels is permitted by Allah,\u201d and necessary to finance travel to \u201czones of jihad.\u201dHe had been arrested carrying 4,397 euros (about $5,000) and $1,235, as well as currency from Singapore, Morocco and six other countries. The police also seized stolen passports and found multiple cellphones, computers and a device to foil shoplifting alarms.And he had rung up large phone bills, making 47 calls to Islamic State contacts in Syria and 89 to others in Turkey in just 10 days in December 2013, according to court documents.Investigators struggled to balance these findings with the fact that Mr. Zerkani had no known job since 2008, yet for years had doled out money to volunteer fighters. Mr. Zerkani told the authorities that he had worked \u201cau noir\u201d \u2014 in the shadow economy \u2014 trading \u201cvarious objects.\u201d But surveillance teams reported that they never saw him sell anything.Belgian prosecutors said in a report that Mr. Zerkani had secured the obedience of disaffected young men \u201cby progressively cutting them off from their previous bearings and from their family, school and social ties in Belgium.\u201d Most were 15 to 20 years his junior and shared his Moroccan origins.\u201cThey\u2019ll catch a North African because they know the inside of his head,\u201d said Bachir M\u2019Rabet, a youth counselor in Molenbeek. Recruiters like Mr. Zerkani, he added, \u201cwon\u2019t go to a Turk or an Albanian because they\u2019re not culturally close.\u201dMohamed Karim Haddad, the brother of an acolyte who left for Syria, described Mr. Zerkani \u201cas a charlatan who, for a bad cause, misled youths or men who are socially unstable.\u201dMs. Keita\u2019s son, who would have been 25 now, was convicted of drug charges in Brussels in 2013. But his mother said it was not until he started hanging out in Molenbeek that he showed any interest in Syria, and criticized her for being insufficiently devout.Mr. Zerkani did not lecture these recruits on arcane theological justifications for violence, like Mr. Ayachi of the Islamic Center, but instead used a few crude religious ideas to give legitimacy to the criminal path they had already chosen.Long before jihad became fashionable on the fringes, crime was endemic in parts of Molenbeek, a breakdown for which many blame Mr. Moureaux, the former mayor who won election after election.He set off an uproar in 2010 when he joined the mayor of the Brussels region in dismissing a gun attack on police officers by a Belgian-Moroccan armed with a Kalashnikov rifle as a \u201cfait divers,\u201d or a titillating news item of no consequence.The gunman, who was sentenced to 10 years in prison but released after four, was Ibrahim Bakraoui, one of the two brothers who the authorities say staged suicide attacks in Brussels on March 22.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Obama Tax Return Hints at His Post-Presidency Plans", "Date": "2016-04-15", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Even presidents dip into their savings when they are getting ready to switch jobs.Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, cashed out nearly $1 million in investments last year, according to their 2015 tax return, which the White House released on Friday.The figure suggests that they were preparing to finance large expenses like a home purchase. Mr. Obama said last month that the family would remain in the Washington area after he left the White House in January 2017, while his younger daughter, Sasha, finishes high school.The tax return, released before the filing deadline on Monday, shows that the Obamas earned $436,065 last year and paid $81,472 in total tax \u2014 an effective rate of about 18.7 percent. They are getting a refund of $22,859.The White House on Friday released the 2015 joint tax return for the president and Michelle Obama. The document suggests some planning for a future beyond Mr. Obama's White House tenure.The Obamas sold Treasury notes amounting to $994,941, according to the return. The White House declined to give an explanation for the sales.But it is clear that the Obamas will face an array of new costs over the next year, including a likely home purchase and the first year of college for Malia, their older daughter. She is said to be considering Stanford and Harvard, where tuition and other costs exceed $66,000 for the coming academic year.

{"Headline": "MetLife and the Threat to Dodd-Frank", "Date": "2016-04-04", "News": "Supported byEditorialThe decision is a blow to the Financial Stability Oversight Council, established by the Dodd-Frank regulatory reform law. The council\u2019s job is to identify and defuse systemic risks to the economy from nonbank financial firms, including insurance companies and finance companies. The absence of such oversight let Lehman Brothers, American International Group and GE Capital run amok before the financial crisis of 2008, among other disastrous and interlocking developments.Congress put senior officials on the council and gave them a powerful weapon. Its 10 voting members include the secretary of the Treasury, the head of the Federal Reserve and top financial regulators. The weapon is their authority to designate big and complex financial firms as \u201csystemically important\u201d \u2014 in other words, too big to fail. The label subjects a firm to heightened regulatory standards and higher capital requirements.MetLife argued in court that the council used flawed and inadequate analyses in 2014 when it deemed the insurer to be systemically important. The court agreed with MetLife and removed the label. The judge\u2019s full opinion is under seal and is likely to be released only in redacted form, a move intended, in part, to protect MetLife\u2019s privacy. That is unacceptable. Why would MetLife\u2019s privacy concerns outweigh the public\u2019s right to know?One baffling aspect of the ruling is that other nonbanks labeled systemically important by the council \u2014 A.I.G., GE Capital and Prudential Financial \u2014 did not challenge their designations. A.I.G. and GE Capital have undertaken reforms to shrink themselves to less threatening proportions.MetLife is also moving ahead with similar reforms, despite having fought to shed the too-big-to-fail label. This suggests that the lawsuit was intended not to avoid downsizing but to weaken the council.As has happened at the Securities and Exchange Commission and other agencies that have lost court battles over their regulatory authority, the case could have a chilling effect on the council\u2019s exercise of its power and consume valuable time and resources if it decides to appeal. All of which could undermine the panel\u2019s ability to spot and tame systemic risks before they explode.The Dodd-Frank reforms need defending and strengthening, not weakening. The law is the main bulwark against renewed recklessness in the financial system. It is working, if slowly, to reduce risks of another crisis, and it is under attack. It needs champions in high places.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Activism-Shy BlackRock Throws a Surprise Punch", "Date": "2016-04-05", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorBlackRock, the enormous American asset manager with over $4.6 trillion of assets under management, has waged its first significant activist campaign around the G-Resources Group, a Hong Kong company that owned a gold mine. It may be Hong Kong, and it may be only one campaign, but companies should be fearful.So the battle over G-Resources is significant because it may be a sign of things to come.G-Resources is a company listed in Hong Kong but organized under the laws of Bermuda. It was formed to develop the Martabe gold mine in Indonesia. The road has been bumpy for the company as the price of gold has fluctuated. But there was never any doubt that gold was its main business with perhaps a sideline in silver. Only two years ago, G-Resources raised $156 million to bolster its working capital and focus on developing the mine.It was not a gangbuster price, but money was actually not the source of this dispute, nor was Mr. Hegarty\u2019s involvement.BlackRock\u2019s activism arose out of G-Resource\u2019s pledge to live beyond the sale of its main asset. Instead of distributing the proceeds of the sale to G-Resources shareholders, the company announced that it would use the money to enter into the \u201cprincipal investment\u201d and \u201cfinancial services\u201d business. The members of the management team, hired to run a gold mine, would continue in office, now ready to be financial company executives.One might expect this maneuver to raise shareholder eyebrows. Why would a gold management team be qualified to build a finance company from scratch? Even if this were a wonderfully qualified management team for this task, G-Resources shareholders presumably invested in a gold mining company to gain exposure to the asset.It\u2019s here where BlackRock stepped in. According to Standard & Poor\u2019s CapitalIQ, BlackRock collectively owns 9.2 percent of G-Resources.Because this was a sale of almost all of G-Resources\u2019 assets, the company needed shareholder approval to sell the mine.BlackRock fought a typical activist campaign, lobbying shareholders. The two largest proxy advisory services, Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis, recommended against the same transaction. Although, because the proxy advisory services tend to work with their clients \u2013 the institutional shareholders \u2013 and BlackRock is the biggest, the recommendation was not a surprise.BlackRock most likely got all of the outside institutional shareholders on its side, but still it lost. This is the peril of stock ownership outside the United States. Many companies have a shareholder base that is less activist focused.Still, management appeared chastened. In comments made at the meeting, the executive director, Hui Richard Rui stated that the company would consider paying out part of the sale proceeds as a dividend, a direct appeal to BlackRock.BlackRock has run its first significant activist campaign, and that means something. Activists, however short- or long-termist, have beaten an extremely well-worn path for how to influence companies.That BlackRock is using that path shows how worn it is; BlackRock is now willing to challenge management openly when the line is crossed.BlackRock\u2019s move also means something for shareholder activism itself. In the 1980s, private equity arose from nowhere to become one of the most treasured asset classes.But is shareholder activism an asset class or just a way of life? With low barriers to entry, almost anyone can do it. That this activism took place in Hong Kong shows that activism through institutional shareholders is likely to have a greater global effect than hedge fund activism, which needs more liquid markets to function and is often looking for a quick hit.But the real key is whether institutional investors simply decide to cut out the middleman and start doing their own activism. For now, G-Resources is an outlier with a clear case. But the likely future is for institutional investors to become the activists themselves throughout the world.And so, this seems like only a single case, but BlackRock is bound to do more. Companies beware.An article on the DealBook page on April 6 about an activist campaign by the American asset manager BlackRock against the G-Resources Group, a Hong Kong company, misstated the timing of a recommendation by the proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis against a proposal by G-Resources to sell a gold mine. Glass Lewis issued its recommendation before \u2014 not after \u2014 BlackRock campaigned against the deal.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rejected by Colleges, SAT and ACT Gain High School Acceptance", "Date": "2016-04-05", "News": "Supported byThe SAT and the ACT, bugaboos of generations of college applicants, were supposed to shrink in significance as more colleges and universities moved away from requiring standardized test scores for admission.Instead, the companies behind them have pushed into the nearly $700-million-a-year market for federally required tests in public schools, offering the SAT and the ACT even to students who do not plan to go to college. Prompted by a recent change in federal education law, they are competing \u2014 and increasingly winning \u2014 against exams funded by the Obama administration to become mandatory high school tests, used for ranking school performance.\u201cThe testing companies are making a land grab,\u201d said Scott Marion, the executive director of the Center for Assessment, a nonprofit that helps states design and evaluate tests.Long fierce rivals, the testing companies are seizing an opportunity created by political fights over the Common Core, and the exams based on it. But their moves are raising questions about how well the ACT and the SAT measure what students are supposed to be learning in high school, and about equity and fairness.At least seven other states, including Connecticut and Michigan, have said they will use the SAT or the ACT to meet the federal requirement to test high school students. Legislators in Illinois, Tennessee, Florida and West Virginia have proposed requiring or allowing high school seniors to take the college admissions tests instead of ones tied to common standards.\u201cIt\u2019s a little like the Gold Rush,\u201d Mr. Marion said, adding: \u201cFor the SAT and ACT, the way they can really compete is getting a whole state to buy in. Berkeley can do what it wants, but if the SAT is in 50 states, guess what, kids are going to take it.\u201dIt is hard to calculate the size of the market the testing companies are fighting over. Matthew Chingos, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, added up what states spent to satisfy federal testing requirements in 2012 and came up with a total of $669 million. Adding how much they spent on additional tests, he estimated overall spending at $1.7 billion.Some researchers argue that states would have saved money by sticking with the national tests, which the Obama administration paid about $350 million to develop \u2014 making them free to states in the early years.But Delaware, for instance, was already paying to provide the SAT to high school students, so it says it will save $100,000 by dropping Smarter Balanced.In a few states like Delaware that were already giving the SAT or ACT to all high school juniors, getting rid of the Common Core test is, in part, an attempt to address complaints about too much testing. In most states, though, it amounts to replacing one test with another. But those states are betting that high school students will see the SAT or ACT as more relevant to their lives than the Common Core tests \u2014 that they are more interested in looking ahead to college than back on whether they have mastered what they were supposed to learn in elementary and secondary school. For state politicians, the SAT and ACT are also much less politically fraught.The Common Core has come up against parents who complain of overtesting, students opting out of the tests last spring and conservatives objecting to the standards as a federal intrusion into what they said should be a local issue. Those battles have left only about half the states using one of the national tests.The reauthorization of the federal law regulating public schools, which President Obama signed in December, still requires states to test students annually in Grades 3 through 8, and once in high school, and to test at least 95 percent of all students. But it allowed them to use what the law termed \u201cnationally recognized\u201d assessments, \u201csuch as ACT or SAT exams,\u201d for the high school tests.Most of the students opting not to take Common Core tests are in high school, and many high school students were already taking the SAT or the ACT. So states are betting that by switching to those tests, they can have higher participation rates \u2014 and stem complaints about onerous testing.\u201cIn another time, no one would have raised an eyebrow if kids took both the SAT and the state test in one year,\u201d said Michael Cohen, the president of Achieve, which helped develop the Common Core. \u201cIn this political environment, that\u2019s much more complicated. People are running from federally funded tests, and the SAT and ACT look like convenient places to run to.\u201dEven before states fled the national tests, the SAT and the ACT were aggressively moving to gain state contracts. The states paid to offer one of the tests free to all high school juniors, which helped increase the number of students taking them, even as colleges move away from requiring their scores.\u201cThey\u2019re selling wholesale instead of retail,\u201d said Bob Schaeffer, the public education director for FairTest, which favors reducing the number of tests in schools. \u201cInstead of dealing with hundreds of thousands of parents or kids one on one with credit cards, you go to Albany or Hartford or Trenton, you deal with a couple of bureaucrats and suddenly you\u2019ve got 100,000 kids or more.\u201dIn Florida, the legislator behind the bill that would allow students to take the SAT or the ACT instead of the existing state test said the testing companies had helped write the proposed legislation. Edward Colby, a spokesman for the ACT, said it had \u201coffered support for flexibility\u201d in the new federal law, but did not \u201cactively lobby\u201d for the change.Some states using the ACT or the SAT in high school will continue to use the federally funded Common Core tests for students in Grades 3 through 8. But the push by the college testing companies has undermined the national exams. In February, Parcc, left with only a handful of states using its test, announced that it would reconsider its mission, trying to diversify to attract more states.The move toward the college tests has revived longstanding complaints that they favor white students from more affluent families. Also, Mr. Cohen, at Achieve, said it was unclear how well the SAT and the ACT measured the new standards.The ACT says it remains focused on the original purpose of the college tests, which is to predict how well students will do as freshmen; the College Board says the new SAT is more aligned with state standards.The secretary of education for Delaware cited the SAT\u2019s move away from \u201cobscure vocabulary words\u201d in explaining the decision to use it.\u201cOur community was clear that this was in the best interest of our high school juniors,\u201d said the secretary, Steven Godowsky. \u201cAnd the sooner we could make the switch, the better.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the amount that Delaware expects to save by dropping the Smarter Balanced test. It is $100,000, not $100 million. A picture caption with an earlier version of this article misspelled the name of the company running a test-preparation class in Westport, Conn. It is Carnegie Pollak, not Carnegie Pollack.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Cheating Politicians of Iceland", "Date": "2016-04-08", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorFor days now, thousands of protesters have filled the square outside the Parliament, calling for resignations and elections, hurling eggs at the building and, for a bit of Icelandic flair, the occasional salmon fillet.There\u2019s no evidence that the prime minister\u2019s family\u2019s offshore investment (like those held by our finance minister, internal affairs minister and others) included stolen funds, or anything illegal like that. That\u2019s not why people are angry. They\u2019re angry because we thought we had put news like this behind us. It has been only eight years since the economy collapsed and the country was nearly bankrupted. We were then forced to face uncomfortable truths about officials\u2019 involvement in the failed banking sector, as well as about inattentive government watchdogs. Iceland may have been considered a nanny state, but the nanny was dipping into the sherry bottle hidden in the pantry.Trust in government has been rebuilt, slowly and painstakingly, in the years since. And now we find out that our new leaders have been sneakily shipping their money from our small island to another small island, halfway around the world, most likely to save a little on their taxes. For an ordinary citizen that might look like bad form; for a politician it looks like corruption. It ridicules the fundamental Icelandic expectation that all people are equal.It is usually easier to solve problems in small nations like ours than in large and complex societies. That is not the case, however, when facing the corruption of an entitled elite. In the United States, you talk about six degrees of separation between people. Here in Iceland, with our minuscule population, it\u2019s more like one degree. Within a few minutes of meeting someone you will find a common relative, friend, colleague, enemy or former flame. That makes it hard to escape nepotism and crony capitalism.This is one of the reasons the financial crisis got so bad: Many executives of financial institutions had political, social or family ties to government officials and others who were responsible for keeping them in check. To make matters worse, some of those people monitoring the banks had been hired based on connections instead of competence. Many politicians had accepted huge campaign contributions from the banks. And so on. Of course, the main blame lies with the bank managers, but an investigation into the collapse showed an inclination in all levels of government to overlook the negligence or deceptive accounting that was rampant.We thought we were done with this, rid of the old politics. But the same old networks are still in place. The same old people are sharing the same shady tax lawyers and investing advice. Those who set the rules still aren\u2019t able to follow them.Icelanders yearn for the change we were promised. We want to move on. References to the 2008 crash are no longer heard daily, only weekly. People have stopped discussing the fallen banks and have begun to share again their opinions on the European Union. (Which, incidentally, we applied to join soon after the crash, then changed our mind and sent a letter saying we no longer wanted in, to which the union replied that it did not care, it intended to continue the negotiations, with or without us. We have not heard how that is working out.)At present we have an interim prime minister, who appeared a bit lost and underdressed for the occasion when he was introduced to the public on Wednesday. He does not seem to own a tie. But neither does he hold an offshore account. Nor an Ashley Madison account. That\u2019s something, I guess.Yrsa Sigurdardottir is the author of the Thora Gudmundsdottir crime series and the novel \u201cI Remember You.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Gay, Latino Partner Tests Goldman\u2019s Button-Down Culture", "Date": "2016-04-01", "News": "Supported byR. Martin Chavez possesses the light-filled office of a Goldman Sachs partner, with a sweeping view of the Statue of Liberty. But what sets his office apart is the gallery of objects and books arrayed behind the desk.There is the rose-petal birthday present from his husband \u2014 a framed card that says \u201cI love you\u201d in Braille. Below that stands a picture of a wiry terrier named Galahad, acquired as a \u201csobriety dog\u201d when Mr. Chavez stopped drinking in the 1990s. A few feet down, a basketball perches on a shelf.\u201cBasketball is so not me that I decided to put it up there so people could say, \u2018What is Marty doing with a basketball in his office?\u2019\u201d he said, bursting into a peal of laughter.Mr. Chavez, who is 52 and has a thick beard, represents a departure from the button-down partners of Goldman lore \u2014 plutocrats who wore their power on their sleeves and turned the bank into the most vaunted, feared and secretive company on Wall Street.Today Goldman is trying to change not only that public image, but also some of the central tenets of its culture, like the secrecy and reliance on back-room dealings. The company\u2019s chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, has said he wants Goldman to be thought of as a tech company \u2014 putting it in direct competition for talent with the Googles and Facebooks of the world. No one is more central to these efforts than Mr. Chavez.Mr. Chavez, who was promoted just over two years ago to oversee the company\u2019s 9,000 or so computer engineers \u2014 nearly a third of the staff \u2014 is pushing the 147-year-old company to, among other things, share more of its data and software with clients. His centerpiece project, Marquee, gives clients access to sophisticated trading data previously available only by phoning a Goldman employee.Marquee is so closely associated with Mr. Chavez, in fact, that it was initially called \u201cMartee,\u201d a play on his first name. But it has faced internal resistance. Some colleagues complain that the company is handing out valuable information while paving the way for job cuts.Mr. Chavez has responded forcefully, according to people who witnessed some of these conversations. \u201cHe basically said something to the effect of: \u2018If your job is a purely manual job and you are just clicking buttons, you should look to upgrade your skills set now,\u2019\u201d said Adam Korn, a trading executive. \u201cHe was pretty direct.\u201dSome of Mr. Chavez\u2019s ideas about openness date to his early years in Silicon Valley, where sharing is a religion. They haven\u2019t always worked out: At one start-up, he proposed publicly posting everyone\u2019s salaries, an unpopular idea.For Mr. Chavez, transparency is a kind of personal credo. He displays his gay and Latino identities proudly, as well as the Japanese tattoos on his arms. Conversations with him routinely turn to the intricacies of marrying his husband, a Briton, and raising their baby son, who was born to a surrogate in California. He urges his colleagues to open up more as well, arguing that it can serve as an antidote to the negative public image of Goldman.Mr. Chavez represents broad pressures across the financial industry. The 2008 economic crisis and the regulations that followed it are forcing banks to become less opaque and more technologically savvy and efficient. This has shifted the center of power in the business away from the trading desks, where it was before the crisis, and toward the programmers and engineers \u2014 until recently dismissed as the geeks in the back office.Particularly at a place like Goldman, the changes can be an uncomfortable fit with business practices and a culture that have been built up over decades. Charles M. Elson, an expert on corporate governance at the University of Delaware, said that Goldman, born as an adviser to corporations, is not used to operating out in the open.\u201cFundamentally, it\u2019s trying to refit an old car,\u201d said Mr. Elson, who is the director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance, named for the man who ran Goldman in the 1980s. \u201cIt\u2019s not buffing that\u2019s going to do it,\u201d Mr. Elson said. \u201cIn this new environment you have to rethink the whole chassis.\u201dMr. Elson said that Goldman went through a similar change when it converted from a partnership to a publicly traded company. That led to mass departures and internal battles, though Goldman emerged more profitable. It\u2019s not clear that the current slimming-down and opening-up will lead to the same results.Mr. Chavez says that if efforts like his are successful, clients will see \u201ca very different configuration of the financial services industry than the one we have now.\u201d Goldman will still have the chief product of a bank \u2014 money to lend and invest \u2014 but he thinks that the ways in which customers get access to that money will rely more on software and less on the bankers who traditionally delivered Goldman\u2019s services.Mr. Chavez grew up in Albuquerque with two parents who had not graduated from college and four siblings. All five of the children went to Harvard. His mother, a court stenographer whose parents had come from Mexico and Spain to the United States as immigrants, told Mr. Chavez that, because he was Hispanic, \u201cTo get half as far, you have to work twice as hard.\u201dHe was the statistician for the basketball team and read the Encyclopaedia Britannica front to back. \u201cI have no idea how he did it,\u201d his mother, Rose Chavez, said recently. He earned the nickname \u201cmotormouth\u201d from an uncle.There was, though, at least one thing he didn\u2019t talk about: his sexuality. He only came out the day after he defended his doctoral dissertation, in medical information sciences, at Stanford.The difficulty of being in the closet is part of what convinced Mr. Chavez of the importance of transparency. \u201cIt can be hard to be out \u2014 or one can imagine that it might be hard, which is more often the case,\u201d he wrote in a memo to colleagues in 2011. \u201cBut if that imagination leads to holding back, manufacturing alternative stories of how you spent your weekend or where you spent your time off, that not only impacts your peace of mind, it also has negative consequences for your career.\u201dWhen a recruiter from Goldman contacted him in the early 1990s, he worried that Wall Street wouldn\u2019t take to his sexuality as kindly as Silicon Valley had. At the time he worked for a software start-up and had little notion of what Goldman even did.\u201cI didn\u2019t think much about Wall Street,\u201d he said recently. \u201cI thought I was being clever in getting a free trip to New York City.\u201dDuring interviews at the bank, he said, he was impressed by his interviewers\u2019 quick wits. And his future boss took it in stride when Mr. Chavez said he was gay.Soon Mr. Chavez was plunged into Goldman\u2019s early efforts to automate its trading business with a computer system, SecDB, which is still the spine of its operations. Within the elite trading division where Mr. Chavez was placed, the J. Aron & Company operation \u2014 a shop that groomed many of the company\u2019s leaders \u2014 he worked with Mr. Blankfein, now the chief executive, and Gary D. Cohn, now Goldman\u2019s president.Mr. Chavez struggled, though, with drinking, a vice he attributes to an overindulgence in New York\u2019s gay night life. While going through Alcoholics Anonymous in 1997, Mr. Chavez got Galahad, the dog, to try to help him stay sober.He also decided he wanted a change of scene \u2014 pulling a \u201cgeographic\u201d in the parlance of A.A. Over the protests of Mr. Cohn, he briefly took a job at another Wall Street company, Credit Suisse, then jumped back into the start-up world, building a company, Kiodex, that wrote software to evaluate energy-trading risks.Kiodex had a rough ride. First, the tech bubble burst. Then, Mr. Chavez decided to collaborate with Enron right before the energy company went bust.Sean Patrick Maloney, one of Mr. Chavez\u2019s deputies at Kiodex, said Mr. Chavez\u2019s outsider status gave him an unusual problem-solving creativity. \u201cWhen you cross lines of difference in life \u2014 and you embrace things that to others seem taboo \u2014 it absolutely changes the way your brain works,\u201d said Mr. Maloney, who is now a Democratic congressman from upstate New York. \u201cHe sees things that others miss.\u201dStill, his approach would occasionally go astray. It was at Kiodex where Mr. Chavez proposed making everyone\u2019s salary public. Tom Farley, then Kiodex\u2019s chief financial officer, says he talked Mr. Chavez out of that. \u201cThe type of transparency that Marty espouses isn\u2019t for everyone,\u201d said Mr. Farley, who is now in charge of the New York Stock Exchange.Mr. Chavez, for his part, says the episode helped teach him not to prize \u201cradical transparency for its own sake.\u201dKiodex eventually recovered. Mr. Chavez sold it and retired to his house on Fire Island. He was 40 years old.Mr. Chavez was back at Goldman when the financial crisis hit \u2014 at the center of the bank\u2019s efforts to calculate and track its health during those stressful times. Goldman made it through with better results than most rivals. But that success itself caused problems when government investigations uncovered instances in which Goldman profited from the country\u2019s economic pain.Mr. Chavez recalls friends and family asking: How can you work there? It was a message echoing across the world, with Wall Street under fire for driving the nation to the brink of disaster. Goldman began a charm offensive.The company hired a new public relations chief, Jake Siewert, who previously worked as a chief White House spokesman under Bill Clinton. Goldman also began advertising campaigns stressing its philanthropic work and the financing it provides for projects like a new basketball arena in Kentucky.The crisis gave Mr. Chavez an opening to adopt a more aggressive strategy in his day-to-day work. With Wall Street facing the prospect of declining revenue and rising costs, the company was receptive to his proposals to standardize and automate more of its trading operations. Part of the savings to Goldman came from job cuts, though the bank does not provide detailed numbers.He also pitched automation as a way to help Goldman comply with the Dodd-Frank financial reform, which aimed, in part, to make trading more transparent and easier for regulators to track.In the past, the elite trading-desk programmers \u2014 strategists, or \u201cstrats\u201d in Goldman lingo \u2014 had been in a different division from the traditional I.T. department. Mr. Chavez gained control of both units and unified them, causing some consternation on both sides. The strats worried about being dumbed down, employees say, while the I.T. engineers worried about being marginalized.Symphony is representative of Mr. Chavez\u2019s larger strategy. He gave up the opportunity to develop the software internally and turn it into a source of revenue in order to create something that everyone in the industry might use, and that might allow Goldman to communicate with all of its clients better, even if it is not making money off Symphony itself.But the software, like other programs Mr. Chavez is pushing, faces major hurdles to its success. It still needs to win over investment firms \u2014 the biggest clients of the banks \u2014 and many of them are hesitant to use software that, they worry, might give the banks a way to snoop on their communications.Mr. Chavez\u2019s efforts have also faced skepticism in the technology community, in no small part because of a prominent case in which the company accused a former employee and programmer, Sergey Aleynikov, of stealing Goldman\u2019s software upon leaving the company.Mr. Chavez was not involved in Mr. Aleynikov\u2019s case. And he has been trying to confront Wall Street\u2019s mixed reputation among programmers. He has gone to lead recruiting events at elite institutions like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where the number of students applying to Wall Street has fallen sharply, in part because of the perception of the industry as stuffy and slow-moving.Mr. Chavez has not been shy about pushing the company to embrace social issues as a selling point. He urged its human resources department to expand benefits to gay partners before the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage. He then encouraged Mr. Blankfein to speak out in support of gay marriage.Still, he acknowledges, there is much to do. At the Recode event last fall, he joked about Goldman\u2019s lack of diversity.He was in an office, he said, with a fellow Hispanic executive, when another executive stopped by. \u201cHe opens the door, he sticks his head in, and he says, \u201850 percent of the Hispanic partners of Goldman Sachs, right here, right now.\u2019\u201d The task now, he said, was to take Goldman \u201cto a different place.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Vancouver Prescriptions for Addicts Gain Attention as Heroin and Opioid Use Rises", "Date": "2016-04-21", "News": "Supported byVANCOUVER, British Columbia \u2014 Dave Napio started doing heroin over four decades ago, at 11 years old. Like many addicts these days, he heads to Vancouver\u2019s gritty Downtown Eastside neighborhood when he needs a fix.But instead of seeking out a dealer in a dark alley, Mr. Napio, 55, gets his three daily doses from a nurse at the Crosstown Clinic, the only medical facility in North America permitted to prescribe the narcotic at the center of an epidemic raging across the continent.And instead of robbing banks and jewelry stores to support his habit, Mr. Napio is spending time making gold and silver jewelry, hoping to soon turn his hobby into a profession.\u201cMy whole life is straightening out,\u201d Mr. Napio, who spent 22 of his 55 years in prison, said during a recent interview in the clinic\u2019s mirror-lined injection room. \u201cI\u2019m becoming the guy next door.\u201dMr. Napio is one of 110 chronic addicts with prescriptions for diacetylmorphine hydrochloride, the active ingredient in heroin, which he injects three times a day at Crosstown as part of a treatment known as heroin maintenance. The program has been so successful at keeping addicts out of jail and away from emergency rooms that its supporters are seeking to expand it across Canada. But they have been hindered by a tangle of red tape and a yearslong court battle reflecting a conflict between medicine and politics on how to address drug addiction.The clinic\u2019s prescription program began as a clinical trial more than a decade ago. But it has garnered more interest recently as a plague of illicit heroin use and fatal overdoses of legal painkillers has swept across the United States, fueling frustration over ideological and legal obstacles to forms of treatment that studies show halt the spread of disease through needles and prevent deaths.Canada and some European countries have long permitted needle exchanges and monitored injection sites. Prescription programs like Crosstown\u2019s, for addicts whom replacement drugs like methadone do not seem to help, have been available for years in Britain, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland. All these countries have reported significant decreases in drug abuse, crime and disease.The authorities in Vancouver, a bustling metropolis on the coast of British Columbia, say they turned to such programs after more traditional criminal justice approaches failed to stop rampant illegal drug use and sales on the Downtown Eastside, a poor neighborhood notorious for addiction and crime. \u201cWe tried to arrest our way out of it and that didn\u2019t work,\u201d Sgt. Randy Fincham of the Vancouver Police Department said. \u201cClogging up our courts and jails was not the solution.\u201dMore broadly, a study by the British Columbia Center for Excellence in HIV/AIDS found that people who use safe injection sites are 30 percent more likely to enter detox programs and 70 percent less likely to share needles.Participants in the Crosstown prescription program do not have to worry about the purity of their drugs.To get a diacetylmorphine prescription from the clinic, patients must have participated in two earlier clinical trials on heroin maintenance, whose eligibility requirements included more than five years of injecting opioids and at least two failed attempts at replacement therapy, one of which with a treatment such as methadone.But advocates say that some addicts cannot tolerate the side effects of hydromorphone, and worry that anything but heroin itself would send them back to the streets.Patients can visit the clinic up to three times a day, from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. They enter through a security door and fill a white-walled waiting area before taking seats in the injection room, where nurses give them a needle and an average dose of 200 milligrams of diacetylmorphine. The process takes a few minutes, but the effect is profound.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen people make dramatic changes in their lives,\u201d said Dr. Scott MacDonald, the clinic\u2019s lead physician. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to hustle or do sex work anymore, and some are now able to go to school or work. It\u2019s very rewarding.\u201dLarry Love, 65, a gray-haired, jovial former oil rig worker, said he started using heroin at 13. Decades of addiction destroyed his marriage and relationships with his children. A $350,000 inheritance he received in the 1990s vanished in less than four years.Diacetylmorphine, he said, has opened up a path back to normalcy. He compared it to the insulin injected daily by diabetics: just a drug he needs to stay alive.\u201cIt\u2019s 100 percent about stability,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I have money in my savings account and can get a haircut whenever I want. I\u2019ve even started investing.\u201dAdvocates have long wanted to extend heroin maintenance beyond the small group of patients at Crosstown, but they face formidable bureaucratic hurdles and a continuing court fight.In 2013, Canada\u2019s health minister, a member of the Conservative Party, sought to put in place regulations that would ban the prescription of heroin and other illegal drugs outside of a clinical trial, reflecting the party\u2019s broad opposition to harm-reduction policies.Five Crosstown patients and the Providence Health Care Society, which runs the clinic, filed a case with the Supreme Court of British Columbia to block the move, arguing that the federal regulations violated a constitutional right to lifesaving treatment. A Supreme Court justice granted an injunction in 2014 that allowed current patients to continue receiving prescription heroin until the constitutional challenge could be heard. A court date is set for October.At Crosstown, patients continue to try to repair their fractured lives.Liane Gladue, 48, was a seventh-grade teacher and a married mother before she started shooting heroin two decades ago. She said she could not quit, and spent her waking hours shoplifting and committing other crimes. But since joining the clinical trials and Crosstown\u2019s program, she said, she has reconnected with her grown children.\u201cWhen I wake up and think about what I\u2019d have to do for heroin, I feel so lucky to be in this program,\u201d she said. \u201cNow I can do some healing.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on April 23 about a heroin prescription program in Vancouver, British Columbia, that has been successful in keeping addicts out of jail and away from emergency rooms incorrectly rendered the name of a Canadian medical journal that published a study in 2012 estimating that an untreated, severe opioid user costs taxpayers at least $35,000 a year in medical care, jail and other expenses. It is the Canadian Medical Association Journal, not the Journal of the Canadian Medical Association. The error was corrected online after the article was published, but editors failed to follow through with this print correction.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Antismoking Coalition Gives Big Tobacco a Fight in Indonesia", "Date": "2016-04-30", "News": "Supported byJAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 The densely packed houses along Yogyakarta\u2019s Kali Code River went from drab to a riot of reds, blues, yellows and whites.It turns out the village\u2019s benefactor was Philip Morris International and its \u201cShow Your Colors\u201d advertising campaign. On the side of the Gondolayu bridge that overlooks the settlements sits a giant picture frame, with tag lines hung above it reading, \u201cCreate your own story\u201d and \u201cGo ahead.\u201dThe village had been transformed into a giant advertisement for a brand owned by the tobacco company.Yet that push has been met by an increasingly potent coalition of mayors, health officials and antismoking groups that has scored some important victories.The Bloomberg Initiative has designated Indonesia one of its five priority countries, and has donated more than $10 million since 2007. The initiative is largely focused on establishing local and regional tobacco control laws in a nation with a highly decentralized government structure.\u201cIt\u2019s a battle \u2014 like a war,\u201d Yayi Prabandari, a professor of public health at Gadjah Mada University in Yogyakarta, said of the clash between tobacco companies and tobacco control organizations.The Bloomberg Initiative has also created a backlash from smokers\u2019 rights groups, who portray Mr. Bloomberg as a foreign oligarch determined to stamp out Indonesia\u2019s proud tobacco tradition.\u201cPeople who smoke today are stigmatized \u2014 we\u2019re discriminated against,\u201d said Alfa Gumilang, the chain-smoking secretary general of Komunitas Kretek, a smokers\u2019 rights group that accepts funds from the tobacco industry.The Indonesian government relies on the tobacco industry for around 10 percent of state tax revenue. Although tobacco is not nationalized, the government issues growth targets; in 2015, the Industry Ministry released a \u201croad map\u201d for the industry calling for expanded cigarette production.Philip Morris\u2019s success \u2014 it controls 35 percent of Indonesia\u2019s tobacco market through its local subsidiary, Sampoerna \u2014 ushered in a new age of foreign expansion. In 2009, British American Tobacco purchased Bentoel, a local tobacco company that is now Indonesia\u2019s fourth largest, with around 7.5 percent market share.According to Health Ministry officials, Indonesia\u2019s fragmented government ministries often work at cross purposes when tackling the issue.Because of the difficulty of making sweeping changes to tobacco control laws nationally, Indonesia tobacco control advocates are increasingly pushing for changes at the local and regional levels, where money from the Bloomberg Initiative comes in handy.Dr. Theresia Sandra, a specialist in chronic lung disease at the Health Ministry, credits the Bloomberg Initiative with helping local governments counter the influence of big tobacco. The group \u201cbuilds organizations to balance against the strength of industry and opens local governments to the necessity of protecting their communities,\u201d Dr. Sandra said.In one national success, the Indonesian government, with help from the Bloomberg Initiative, passed a law in 2014 requiring manufacturers to put warning labels on cigarette packaging.The tobacco fight in Indonesia, the world\u2019s most populous Muslim nation, even extends to the country\u2019s most powerful Muslim organizations, and shows just how central the issue is for society and the economy.Muhammadiyah, Indonesia\u2019s second-largest Muslim organization, became the first major Muslim group in the country to issue an edict declaring that smoking is forbidden in all circumstances, citing smoking\u2019s devastating consequences to public health.The 2010 decision was significant: Muhammadiyah operates thousands of schools, universities and hospitals around the country. Almost overnight, those places became smoke-free zones.But the Indonesian media quickly pounced on a funding detail. Posted on the Bloomberg Initiative\u2019s website was a $393,000 grant to Muhammadiyah in 2009. According to Bloomberg\u2019s website at the time, the grant sought \u201cthe issuance and dissemination of religious advice on the dangers of tobacco use among Muhammadiyah/Islamic institutions.\u201dCritics accused Muhammadiyah of seeking to unite Muslim opinion against tobacco in return for the grant money.Dr. Sudibyo Markus, who led Muhammadiyah\u2019s health department at the time, said there had never been any quid pro quo.Meanwhile, religious leaders affiliated with Nahdlatul Ulama, Muhammadiyah\u2019s main rival, criticized Muhammadiyah for supposedly bowing to Bloomberg\u2019s money. But Nahdlatul Ulama, which does not view smoking as forbidden in most circumstances, receives funding from the foundation wing of Djarum, Indonesia\u2019s third-largest tobacco company.The group\u2019s vice chairman, Maksum Mahfudh, said there was \u201cno relationship whatsoever\u201d between the funding and its decision that it would not forbid smoking. He added that moving \u201cdrastically\u201d against tobacco would impoverish the farmers and sellers who are \u201cgrass-roots people of N.U.\u201dFor now, the two sides appear to have fought to a draw. After steadily rising for a decade, the smoking rate has plateaued, according to the Indonesian Family Life Survey, funded by the United States National Institutes of Health, that was released in April.\u201cWe remain optimistic about the profit growth opportunities in this key market thanks to its growing adult population and rising income levels,\u201d he told them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Panama Papers\u2019 Sprawling Web of Corruption", "Date": "2016-04-05", "News": "Supported byEditorialThen comes the disgust. With more than 14,000 clients around the world and more than 214,000 offshore entities involved, Mossack Fonseca, the Panama-based law firm whose internal documents were exposed, piously insists it violated no laws or ethics. But the questions remain: How did all these politicians, dictators, criminals, billionaires and celebrities amass vast wealth and then benefit from elaborate webs of shell companies to disguise their identities and their assets? Would there have been no reckoning had the leak not occurred?And then the core question: After these revelations, will anything change? Many formal denials and pledges of official investigations have been made. But to what degree do the law and public shaming still have dominion over this global elite? A public scarred by repeated revelations of corruption in government, sports and finance will demand to know.Offshore banking is not in itself illegal, and not all those named should be presumed to have done wrong. But it is clear that the secrecy of the sort Swiss banks formerly provided and now lawyers in Panama offer is a magnet for ill-gotten fortunes and tax evaders.The papers chronicle a global industry developed to enable an international elite enriched by corrupt or illegal means to conceal its wealth and dealings from taxation, prosecution and public wrath. They expose the questionable riches that public officials have concealed, whether in Iceland, Russia, China, Saudi Arabia or Malaysia. President Xi Jinping of China and President Vladimir Putin of Russia have already clamped down on the media for shining an unwelcome light on the shady financial dealings of their cronies and family members.Above all, the Panama Papers reveal an industry that flourishes in the gaps and holes of international finance. They make clear that policing offshore banking and tax havens and the rogues who use them cannot be done by any one country alone.Lost tax revenue is one consequence of this hidden system; even more dangerous is its deep damage to democratic rule and regional stability when corrupt politicians have a place to stash stolen national assets out of public view.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "There\u2019s No Such Thing as a Free Rolex", "Date": "2016-04-29", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorJustice Stephen G. Breyer dismissed the idea that, in the absence of a strong limiting principle, federal law could criminalize a governor who accepted a private constituent\u2019s payment in exchange for intervening with a constituent problem. Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. expressed disbelief that an official requesting agency action on behalf of a big donor would be a problem. A majority seemed ready to defend pay-to-play as a fundamental feature of our constitutional system of government.In September 2014, after a six-week trial, a federal jury convicted Mr. McDonnell and his wife, Maureen, on multiple counts of extortion under the Hobbs Act, a key statute against political corruption, and honest-services fraud. It was not a complicated case. Jonnie R. Williams Sr., the chief executive of a dietary supplement manufacturer, Star Scientific, had showered the governor and first lady with gifts in return for favors.And the justices seem poised to agree. Their main worry appeared to be that Mr. McDonnell\u2019s prosecution had criminalized what they perceived as normal, day-to-day political behavior \u2014 seemingly more concerned for the chilling effect of federal bribery law on an elected official who accepts a Rolex than for the citizens who are hurt by such self-serving behavior.To overturn the McDonnells\u2019 convictions, however, would also overturn more than 700 years of history, make bad law and leave citizens facing a crisis of political corruption with even fewer tools to fight it.The legal principles involved date from England\u2019s Statute of Westminster of 1275, which said that no officer of the king should take any payment for his public duties except what was owed by the monarch. In 1914, the United States Supreme Court held that official acts included situations \u201cin which the advice or recommendation of a Government employee would be influential,\u201d even if the official did not \u201cmake a binding decision.\u201d In other words, an official may still be guilty of accepting a bribe even if he is not the final decider.Otherwise, only the most unsophisticated criminal would ever get caught. A clumsy influence seeker might write an email offering \u201cfive diamonds for five votes in Congress,\u201d but the powerful corrupting forces in our society would avoid explicit deals and give lavish gifts tied to meetings and speeches, winking and nodding all the while.In its Citizens United ruling, the court gutted campaign finance laws. It acknowledged that American politics faced the threat of gift-givers and donors trying to corrupt the system, but it held that campaign finance laws were the wrong way to deal with that problem; bribery laws were the better path. Now, though, the court seems ready to gut bribery laws, saying that campaign finance laws provide a better approach. But if both campaign finance laws and bribery laws are now regarded as problematic, what\u2019s left?With the Supreme Court apparently imagining that there is some other, simple-to-enforce bribery law, we citizens are left empty-handed. This is the first case since Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s passing to directly address what corruption is; the issue is a critical test of the court.At the Constitutional Convention in 1787, the framers devoted themselves to building a system that would be safe from moneyed influence. \u201cIf we do not provide against corruption,\u201d argued the Virginia delegate George Mason, \u201cour government will soon be at an end.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s \u2018Self-Funding\u2019 Stalls G.O.P. in Donor-Data Collection", "Date": "2016-04-22", "News": "Supported byHe often brags that he is paying for his campaign, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t need anybody\u2019s money.\u201dBut Donald J. Trump\u2019s disregard for fund-raising by email, building lists of small-dollar donors and assembling a modern campaign digital operation could hamstring him as a general-election candidate and do lasting damage to the Republican Party, strategists say.In 2013 and 2014, one of the most valuable assets for Republican candidates at every level was Mitt Romney\u2019s email list, containing the names and contact information for his donors, volunteers and supporters \u2014 a trove that had been amassed, culled and refined over 18 months of the 2012 campaign.That required painstaking work, including frequent communications with supporters in hopes of conditioning them to donate repeatedly. And it paved the way for candidates to send emails to a vast, inherited universe of potential contributors who could easily make gifts with one click.Mr. Trump, however, has emailed no mass requests for contributions or for petition-style statements of support on various issues, as many candidates do to collect names and email addresses, aides confirmed. Rather, he has passively harvested the contact information of people who choose to visit his website and donate or buy campaign-themed merchandise.Many of his supporters, moreover, are first-time or infrequent voters or political independents who may not already show up in the email lists that Mr. Romney and other Republican list-builders have previously gathered.To specialists in political data operations, an enormous potential reservoir of money and information is being squandered.An interactive delegate calculator that lets you simulate how the 2016 Republican nomination process could unfold.Each day that goes by, Republican strategists say, is a lost chance.Mr. Georgia said the Romney list was vital to the Republican congressional committee\u2019s small-dollar donation program. \u201cThere are obviously other sources that you can prospect through and grow your list from,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the size of that list and the quality of those donors can only happen from a presidential election, and we don\u2019t have that this time around.\u201d\u201cWhat happens traditionally in a campaign is they will go out to their list once or twice a week to raise money from their fund-raisers, but when a candidate gets to a general election, you get some donor fatigue because they\u2019ve already maxed out their campaign to give,\u201d said Corey Lewandowski, the Trump campaign manager. \u201cOur list is exactly the opposite.\u201dMr. Lewandowski added that Mr. Trump\u2019s social media following reduced the need for a cultivated email list, and that his supporters were so motivated, they would not need much coaxing if he did decide to ask them for money.Mr. Trump has not completely ignored fund-raising: His website has two \u201cdonate\u201d buttons, and he has reaped $9.2 million in small-dollar donations. (By comparison, he has lent his campaign a total of $36 million, his latest campaign finance reports show.)But the credit-card numbers used to make those gifts could be of enormous potential value to Republicans if he worked at expanding the number of supporters who donate.Zac Moffat, a co-founder of Targeted Victory and former digital director for Mr. Romney, said he believed that the Trump campaign had intentionally bypassed a full-blown effort to raise money online \u2014 despite the fact that hundreds of millions of dollars would need to be spent on the general election.\u201cEasily he\u2019s left tens of millions of dollars of fund-raising potential on the table,\u201d Mr. Moffat said. \u201cBut that wasn\u2019t the campaign they wanted to execute. These are strategic decisions. It\u2019s not like this is a surprise to them.\u201dMr. Moffat also said there was still time for Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign to start a robust email program: \u201cSixty to 70 percent of the growth is going to come in the last five months,\u201d he said.De-emphasizing digital campaign work up till now has put Mr. Trump out of step with key efforts of the three biggest Republican umbrella organizations \u2014 the party\u2019s national committee, and Senate and House campaign arms \u2014 each of which made investing in digital and data operations central to its strategy after Mr. Romney\u2019s loss to President Obama in the 2012 election.The national committee\u2019s email team alone is four times the size of the whole 2012 digital team and has been steadily adding to its email list and data to prepare for the 2016 general election, a list it will have ready to turn over to the eventual nominee, which could end up helping to jump-start efforts in the future by Mr. Trump should he choose to use it.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Q. and A.: Ning Zhu on the \u2018Guaranteed Bubble\u2019 in China\u2019s Economy", "Date": "2016-04-19", "News": "Supported bySinosphereSecond, without meaningful structural reform in the Chinese economy and financial sector, what\u2019s been going on in the past few years will eventually lead to a bubble. A bubble and subsequent bust are not a matter of whether, but when. Overspeculation leads to poor investments, and the debt overhang becomes so big that it eventually causes the bubble to burst. I hope this book will serve as a wake-up call, because the window for defusing this time bomb is closing, given how fast debt has increased in the past few years.Interestingly, some readers in China complained about the title. Some thought I meant that the bubble is guaranteed by the government and therefore will never burst. There are a lot of people scared of the bubble bursting, but just as many who believe we\u2019re already in a bubble and are waiting for the bubble to burst to snap up assets.So no, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s inevitable, as long as China engages in active reform. However, time is running out. With ballooning debt and slowing growth, the Chinese government will have fewer deployable resources going forward. Given the already high valuations in the stock market and housing market, it\u2019s not clear how far one can push the bubble without it bursting and having a catastrophic impact on China and the global economy. Now that China shoulders a large portion of global economic growth, whatever happens in China will have far-reaching implications for the rest of the world.To diffuse the risks, the government has to phase out its guarantees. It should stop providing guarantees for economic growth and investment performance and let the market play a maximum role in allocating resources.I\u2019d like to add that this challenge is not unique to China. In the February G-20 central banker and finance minister summit meeting, leaders from major economies agreed to use more active fiscal policies to boost global economic growth. We may have reached a point, at least in some major economies, where leaders are setting unrealistic objectives for economic growth. I think global leaders need to realize that high economic growth is very difficult to achieve after a certain threshold, and can in fact cause much unwarranted risk for future generations.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hedge Funds Are the New Venture Firms", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported byIn Silicon Valley, hedge funds with billion-dollar reserves are becoming the new venture capitalists.Tiger Global, a $20 billion investment firm started by Chase Coleman as a hedge fund, is one of three investors that has helped Nubank, a digital finance company in Brazil, raise tens of millions of dollars.Lee Ainslie\u2019s $10.5 billion hedge fund, Maverick Capital, is likewise dabbling in private start-up funding, as one of three investors in Vserv, a digital platform for mobile marketing and commerce in India and Southeast Asia that has raised more than $10 million.Lending Club, an online marketplace that matches people who want to borrow money with people willing to lend it to them, counted Coatue Management, a hedge fund and private equity fund, as one of its investors before its initial public offering in late 2014.All three hedge funds have something else in common: They are part of a successful network of so-called Tiger cubs, managers that got their start from the billionaire trader Julian Robertson, who made his mark picking stocks. His Tiger cubs have also struck gold. Many of them have ventured away from betting on publicly listed companies to taking stakes in private start-ups.Other investment firms, too, are pouring tens of millions of dollars into Silicon Valley. Much of that money is going to companies that focus on financial technology \u2014 called fintech \u2014 which includes new ways to replace traditional banking using the Internet and automation. Last year, funding for fintech start-ups more than doubled, reaching $12.2 billion, compared with $5.6 billion in 2014, according to a report from PricewaterhouseCoopers.\u201cThere was a huge wave in 2013\u201d of hedge funds and other alternative investment firms shifting into the fintech space, said Fiona Grandi, a financial services fintech leader at KPMG. After the 2008 financial crisis, banks around the world reduced lending and other services. The Internet and smartphones have allowed new players to step in and provide those services directly to consumers without using traditional banking platforms.Investor enthusiasm for the fintech sector has helped push valuations higher, with several start-ups reaching the milestone \u201cunicorn\u201d status, referring to valuations of $1 billion or more.\u201cIf you were to step back and just look at what has happened in terms of banking \u2014 with the unbundling of the banks, we\u2019ve watched venture capitalists pour in money and we\u2019re seeing the number of \u2018unicorns\u2019 marching towards going public increase,\u201d Ms. Grandi said. \u201cThere is tremendous movement in this space, and it\u2019s not surprising that hedge fund managers want to capitalize on this.\u201dThird Point Ventures, the venture capital arm of Daniel S. Loeb\u2019s $16 billion hedge fund Third Point, has made 38 investments in United States tech start-ups since 2000. One of the three fintech start-ups it has backed is SoFi \u2014 short for Social Finance \u2014 an online provider of loans, mortgages and student loan refinancing.Passport Capital, the $4.4 billion hedge fund run by John Burbank, has made a dozen investments in United States tech start-ups, according to the research firm CB Insights. Passport\u2019s fintech investments include CashStar, the maker of prepaid cards for retailers and restaurants, and Prosper, the online marketplace lender.The pace of fintech investments by hedge funds picked up in 2014, said Matthew Wong, a data analyst and researcher for CB Insights. The initial flood of money into Silicon Valley fintech start-ups from hedge funds started two years earlier and was focused on marketplace lending. Now, this money is starting to move into other fintech areas like insurance and management systems for small businesses.Tiger Global, a major investor in Silicon Valley, has also ventured overseas to make bets on fintech companies. In Australia, it has backed Tyro Payments, a company that provides banking solutions for small businesses. In India, it has investments in Razorpay Software, which offers secure online payments systems for businesses, as well as Policybazaar, a website that compares insurance options. In addition to Nubank, in Brazil it has backed ContaAzul, a management system for small businesses to control their finances and sales.A booming Silicon Valley has allowed many hedge funds to shift their focus away from traditional investing strategies that in recent years have resulted in disappointing performance.But with so much money rushing into the space, some observers warn that some companies might be getting more credit than they deserve.\u201cI think there\u2019s the short-term cycle and then there is the long-term shift that\u2019s happening,\u201d said Nick Shalek, a partner at Ribbit Capital, a venture capital firm that has focused on fintech since its founding in 2012. \u201cFintech has been one of the shiniest objects around in recent years. Some of these investors will get spooked in the next year or two, but the bigger trend is that companies are changing their behavior and transforming how financial services are delivered.\u201dHedge funds with little experience or expertise in venture investing risk getting burned, said David Snow, chief executive of Privcap.\u201cThe last time hedge funds were encroaching on private equity territory in a big way was in 2006 and 2007, just before the financial collapse,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "E.C.B. Stands Pat at Meeting, but It Explores Next Options", "Date": "2016-04-21", "News": "Supported byFRANKFURT \u2014 The European Central Bank left its main interest rates and stimulus tools unchanged at its meeting on Thursday, with its president forcefully arguing that the bank\u2019s aggressive monetary policy moves had bolstered economic growth and warded off negative inflation in the eurozone.\u201cOur policies are the necessary policies for the return of the inflation rate to our objective,\u201d Mario Draghi, the European Central Bank\u2019s president, said at a news conference in Frankfurt after the interest rate decision.He added that the policies had provided \u201cthe necessary conditions for the return of growth to a higher level, and the necessary conditions for the return of interest rates to a higher level.\u201d\u201cOur monetary policies have been supporting growth,\u201d he said.Mr. Draghi reacted with vehemence when asked about criticism of central bank policy last week by Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the German finance minister. Mr. Sch\u00e4uble was quoted blaming low interest rates, which he said hurt German savers, as a factor in the rise of right-wing populist parties in the country. He later said that was not what he meant.\u201cCriticisms of a certain type could be viewed as endangering the independence of the E.C.B.,\u201d Mr. Draghi said. Such criticism would only undercut the effectiveness of central bank policy and force it to do even more, he said.Mr. Draghi faulted political leaders for not doing enough to improve their economies. \u201cIf there were also structural reforms, the effect of these policies would be quicker,\u201d he said.Arguing that countries had to do more to overhaul their economies and provide fiscal stimulus, he added, \u201cOur monetary policy has been the only policy in the last four years to support growth.\u201dMr. Draghi said that an internal central bank study indicated that economic growth from 2016 to 2018 would have been lower if it had not put in place the measures over the past two years, and that inflation would have been negative this year.At its last monetary policy meeting, on March 10, the central bank surprised economists and investors with an array of moves that in some cases had never been deployed by a major central bank. Those included a program that allows banks to draw central bank money for free, and then to receive a bonus if they lend the money to businesses and individuals. Banks have to meet certain benchmarks to qualify for the bonus.At the March meeting, the central bank cut its benchmark rate to zero from 0.05 percent. It also increased the penalty it charges banks to park money in its vaults \u2014 a so-called negative interest rate \u2014 to 0.4 percent from 0.3 percent.Some analysts have expressed concern that the central bank could run short of bonds to buy because the market supply is finite.But Mr. Draghi dismissed those concerns, saying the bank did not \u201csee risks of scarcity.\u201dDespite the array of measures, inflation in the eurozone has been stubbornly low. It has not exceeded 0.5 percent in two years and has fallen below zero on several occasions.The fear is that the eurozone could become trapped in deflation, a vicious downward cycle of falling prices that leads people to delay purchases in hopes of even lower prices. The result could be a rise in unemployment as corporations cut costs in the face of falling sales.\u201cIn the current context, it is crucial to ensure that the very low inflation environment does not become entrenched,\u201d Mr. Draghi said.The central bank\u2019s policies, he said, \u201chad the effect of avoiding the second round effects\u201d of low inflation filtering into wage negotiations and the determination of prices.Economists have even begun to debate the wisdom of so-called helicopter money, which would be printed by the central bank and handed out to citizens or used to finance public works. Once considered a radical idea, helicopter money has become a more mainstream proposal the longer inflation has resisted central bank remedies.\u201cThe concept is fraught with operational, legal and institutional difficulties,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the bottom line is, we have never discussed it.\u201d\u201cIt would become very difficult after that to control expectations,\u201d analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a note to clients on Wednesday. \u201cWe would also be very surprised if Draghi had the Governing Council\u2019s majority backing to explore this publicly.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A $700 Juicer for the Kitchen That Caught Silicon Valley\u2019s Eye", "Date": "2016-03-31", "News": "Supported byIn recent years, venture capitalists have funded all manner of improbable ideas. An app that lets random people call and wake you up. A bathroom scale that posts your weight on Twitter.And then there is Doug Evans\u2019s brainchild. With no experience running tech companies and a bungled juice-bar chain under his belt, he has extracted a remarkable $120 million in investments from Silicon Valley titans, including Google Ventures and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, and big companies like Campbell Soup.His pitch: a $700 machine that makes an eight-ounce glass of juice.Mr. Evans is a raw-food evangelist, although \u201coccasionally I eat steamed vegetables, to not be dogmatic,\u201d he said. He wears shoes made of hemp. But even as Silicon Valley retreats from its recent boom, this unlikely entrepreneur has persuaded top investors to throw their money at one of the most enigmatic start-ups in years.His company, Juicero, opens for business this week. But what is it?Is it a juice-ordering app? Is it just another kitchen-counter contraption? Or is it a 111,000-square-foot food-processing factory, staffed by dozens of hourly workers, washing and slicing up fruits and vegetables in Los Angeles?It is all of these things. \u201cIt\u2019s the most complicated business that I\u2019ve ever funded,\u201d said David Krane, a partner at GV, formerly Google Ventures. \u201cIt\u2019s software. It\u2019s consumer electronics. It\u2019s produce and packaging.\u201dMany of the tycoons who inhabit Silicon Valley are obsessed with health and longevity while harboring the conviction that technology can improve anything, even one of nature\u2019s most elementary foodstuffs \u2014 in this case, juice. And they believe that niche trends, if properly disrupted, can become billion-dollar markets. Juicero is the latest expression of these techno-utopian impulses.It is also the latest example of an unproven start-up raising enormous sums of money. Born in an earlier era in the Valley, the headier times of 18 months or so ago, Mr. Evans\u2019s idea captivated some of the industry\u2019s most ambitious investors. In today\u2019s more conservative financing environment, such a pitch might not get funded.No matter. In coming days, Juicero starts taking orders.The machine itself is a white plastic slab roughly the size of a food processor. To get some juice, you insert a pouch that resembles an IV bag and press a button. A couple of minutes later, a thin stream of vividly colored liquid squirts into a glass.For health nuts willing to pay a premium, Juicero promises the platonic ideal of juice. Plus, the machine never needs to be cleaned.But getting from farm to glass involves a daunting mix of hardware, code and food processing. The arrangement relies on a smartphone app, always-on Wi-Fi, QR codes, high-tech packaging and an army of workers slicing fruits and vegetables in very particular ways.Ultimately, however, what makes Juicero so special is not quantifiable by conventional science, said Mr. Evans, the founder and chief executive.\u201cNot all juice is equal,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do you measure life force? How do you measure chi?\u201dNearly as unlikely as Juicero itself is the man behind it. Mr. Evans trained as an Army paratrooper before joining a graphic design firm. His love affair with juice began in 1999, when he met Denise Mari, a vegan, at a nightclub. Soon he was dating Ms. Mari and converted to veganism, too.Hoping to create an eatery compatible with their strict dietary regimen, Mr. Evans and Ms. Mari bought some industrial-strength juicers and developed Organic Avenue, which sold $10 bottles of cold-pressed, unpasteurized juice and other vegan snacks.\u201cIt was a vision of a restaurant someone could go to where no animals were harmed, and no humans were harmed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was so magical to be able to have that. I was drinking several glasses of juice a day as my primary form of hydration.\u201dAfter the first store opened in 2006, the business grew quickly. But margins were persistently thin. New York real estate is expensive, and the inventory was perishable.\u201cWe were on the brink of insolvency,\u201d Mr. Evans said.In 2012, Mr. Evans and Ms. Mari, who are separated but remain friends, sold a majority interest in Organic Avenue to a private equity firm. Shortly after that, both were ousted. (The company was eventually sold to another private equity firm, which shuttered all the stores.)Upon being fired, Mr. Evans said, he had a problem. \u201cFor me, I was just wondering: How am I going to get my juice?\u201d he said.He bought every juicer he could find, but he was never satisfied. \u201cIt didn\u2019t have the magic that I was accustomed to.\u201dSo he resolved to create a miniaturized version of the industrial presses he had used at Organic Avenue. Working with freelance welders and machinists, he built prototypes in his Brooklyn kitchen. By 2013, he had a working model, albeit one that occasionally blew apart, sending pieces of metal and food scraps flying across the room.He approached Ms. Mari and some of the original backers of Organic Avenue, who invested enough money for him to keep going. \u201cThen I got an introduction to a partner at Kleiner Perkins through a vegan fashion designer who knew someone at the Humane Society who knew them,\u201d Mr. Evans said.The partner at Kleiner Perkins, Amol Deshpande, was a believer, and the firm agreed to invest an additional half-million dollars and incubate Juicero in Silicon Valley. Mr. Evans left Brooklyn, moved into temporary housing in a shopping center on Sand Hill Road and raised $16.5 million in Series A financing.With the extra money, Mr. Evans began hiring software engineers, mechanical engineers, food scientists and app developers. It wasn\u2019t long before Mr. Evans realized he needed still more money. The innards of the machine were complex but manageable. It was the software, the production facility, the electrical testing and a thousand other things that necessitated a bigger staff.\u201cI was just na\u00efve,\u201d Mr. Evans said. \u201cI was like Forrest Gump. I had no idea what it took to make a piece of hardware that could ship to consumers safely.\u201dSo in 2015, Juicero raised a $70 million Series B round. But even that was not enough. Mr. Evans is now raising more money, currently $28 million and counting.And cold-pressed juice, the variety that Mr. Evans is hoping to capitalize on, has had a minor renaissance in recent years. Suja, a San Diego company, is selling bottles across the country, including in Costco, for as little as $3.50 each. In 2011, Starbucks acquired Evolution Fresh, and now sells cold-pressed juice in its thousands of coffee shops.\u201cJust five years ago, cold-pressed juice was a niche trend, popular only with health fanatics,\u201d Andrew Alvarez, an analyst with IBISWorld, a market research firm, wrote in a recent report. Now though, it \u201chas hit the mainstream and given rise to hundreds of new juice bars, typically selling juice at higher price points.\u201dStill, there are signs that juice mania may have peaked. Last year, retail juice sales in the United States declined by 2 percent from 2014, according to Euromonitor International, another market research firm. Sales of home juicers were down 6 percent in the United States last year.There are also health concerns. One reason sales have been falling, analysts believe, is that people are increasingly worried about sugar, even the naturally occurring kinds.Finally, there are the environmental questions about the single-serve model pioneered by coffee companies such as Keurig and Nespresso, which creates a throwaway container with each serving. Every glass of Juicero juice needs its own pack, which is shipped from Los Angeles to the customer, although Mr. Evans said he was developing a compostable pack.To succeed, Juicero will have to buck these trends, and also clear a more pedestrian hurdle \u2014 persuading people to pay a premium for another kitchen doodad. \u201cSeven hundred dollars for a small cooking appliance is extremely high,\u201d said Virginia Lee, beverage analyst for Euromonitor. \u201cThere are a lot of appliances competing for counter space, never mind the wallet.\u201dExpensive as it is, what Mr. Evans has packed into that counter space is rather remarkable. Inside the machine is a series of gears and metal plates that exert 8,000 pounds of pressure on packs of chopped fruits and vegetables.To make a glass of juice, you insert a pack ($4 to $10 each) into the machine, close the door and press a button. There are five flavors, including Sweet Roots (carrot, beet, orange, lemon and apple) and Spicy Greens (pineapple, romaine, celery, cucumber, spinach, parsley and jalape\u00f1o).Each pack has a QR code on it. A camera in the machine scans the code on each pack and, using Wi-Fi, checks in with an online database. If the pack is no longer fresh, or has been deemed contaminated, the machine won\u2019t press it. If the pack is O.K., the gears start turning and out squirts the juice.So far, so complicated. But the real logistical feat is behind the scenes. To create those packs in the Los Angeles plant, workers receive truckloads of produce from nearby organic farms, triple-wash it, then chop it into specific shapes (carrots are finely diced, while beets are chunkier).A specialized machine then fills each pack. The packs are then sent by FedEx to users, who order them using Juicero\u2019s smartphone app.Mr. Evans and his investors speak of Juicero being a \u201cplatform\u201d for a new paradigm of food delivery. And they speak of commercial sales. Already, chain restaurants including Le Pain Quotidien have agreed to use Juicero. The hope is that bigger companies will put machines in their office kitchens, too.At this point, however, the investors betting millions don\u2019t have any sales data to reassure them. Instead, they have little more than Mr. Evans\u2019s enthusiasm for juice. He drinks it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. He is so committed to a largely liquid diet that he rarely consumes water.\u201cOrganic cold-pressed juice is rainwater filtered through the soil and the roots and the stems and the plants,\u201d he said. \u201cYou extract the water molecules, the chlorophyll, the anthocyanin and the flavonoids and the micronutrients. You\u2019re getting this living nutrition. It\u2019s like drinking the nectar of the earth.\u201dBut do other people have such refined palates when it comes to juice? Will those who don\u2019t subsist entirely on raw produce be able to tell a difference between organic and nonorganic fruit, as Mr. Evans claims to do? Even if they can, what will they be willing to pay for the privilege of consuming it in their own kitchens? After all, this is a machine that won\u2019t make a glass of carrot juice if your Wi-Fi is down.An article last Sunday about Juicero, a Silicon Valley company that has developed a $700 cold-press juicer as well as packaged ingredients for it, described the Tovala, another high-tech kitchen appliance, incorrectly. It is a programmable oven that can bake, broil, steam or heat by convection in any sequence. It is not a combination microwave/toaster.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Ecuador, Political Aftershocks", "Date": "2016-04-21", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorThe earthquake is historic not only for the magnitude of the destruction and human suffering, but also for giving rise to the most impressive mobilization of civil society in Ecuador I can remember. The country has become one huge relief center, and in almost every neighborhood, in towns large and small, there are collection points for donations of clothing, food and blankets.So many people have joined the aid effort that in some places, they have been asked to stop sending volunteers. Social media has become a citizens\u2019 channel for messaging about offers of help or calls for relief: everything from medicine and mattresses to drinking water and toys for children, and even powdered lime to cover the hastily buried corpses of loved ones.What is striking about this huge humanitarian operation is that it has pushed the state into a secondary role. This may be normal in other countries, but in Ecuador this is an immensely significant development.The earthquake revealed that the vast and expensive official media apparatus worked perfectly when it came to producing government propaganda, but was next to useless at providing vital information for people in a crisis.This news is particularly awkward for Mr. Correa, who still has more than a year in office. The government finances were already in a mess, but now the president could be forced to seek assistance from organizations like the I.M.F. that he despises for ideological reasons.Is the country ready to cope with such an event? Mr. Correa says it is. But it\u2019s clear that it\u2019s not. For now, what we see is that civil society is doing the work that the government was not prepared for.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "De Blasio Donors Took Pride in Connections With Top Police Officials", "Date": "2016-04-11", "News": "Supported byJona S. Rechnitz, the scion of a wealthy Los Angeles family, came to New York City about a decade ago to make his mark. A brash young man eager to fund philanthropic causes, he cultivated connections with the Police Department \u2014 posing with top officials, and once arranging for police bagpipes at a party \u2014 and became a fixture at fund-raising events for Mayor Bill de Blasio.Jeremiah Reichberg came from the more cloistered world of Borough Park, Brooklyn, an Orthodox Jewish enclave where he was a familiar presence, even if his private life and business dealings were not well known. He ran a consulting firm, and hosted Mr. de Blasio to great fanfare at his home in 2014 for a fund-raising event.The federal inquiry, which began in 2013, has laid bare the city\u2019s nexus of political influence and campaign donations, dormant for a decade during the administration of the billionaire Michael R. Bloomberg, as well as the world of those men, like Mr. Rechnitz and Mr. Reichberg, who sidle up to police officials as a kind of informal currency. The two men \u2014 neither of whom has been charged with a crime \u2014 appeared to take great pride in the closeness with which they spoke to senior commanders, including Philip Banks III, once the top chief, who has come under scrutiny as part of the inquiry.\u201cI know of no favorable municipal action that they got,\u201d the mayor said on Monday, as he was peppered with questions about the men. He could not say how or why they ended up on his inaugural committee. \u201cI don\u2019t know the specific process of how each name was determined,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know the exact ticktock of that.\u201dMr. Rechnitz, the 33-year-old son of Robert Rechnitz, a prominent business owner who has raised money for pro-Israel causes in Washington, attended Yeshiva University in New York. After graduation, he found work at a real estate firm, Africa Israel, owned by Lev Leviev, a free-spending Israeli-Russian diamond merchant who invested heavily in New York real estate during the last boom.At the same time, Mr. Rechnitz was expanding his presence in the city\u2019s Jewish community. Rabbi Steven Burg, the former eastern director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center and the New York Museum of Tolerance, said he had met Mr. Rechnitz about four years ago through Mr. Rechnitz\u2019s work at the museum.\u201cAnytime I needed something, he would drop whatever he was doing and help out,\u201d Rabbi Burg said. He said that Mr. Rechnitz helped with the museum\u2019s efforts to provide tolerance training to the Police and Correction Departments starting in 2014.\u201cHe was instrumental,\u201d the rabbi said. \u201cWe did a day of training for correction officers and started a whole program working with the Department of Correction.\u201dRabbi Shlomo Einhorn, who knew Mr. Rechnitz from Los Angeles, said he was \u201ca charitable guy,\u201d a family man \u201cwho is just exceptionally kind and exceptionally giving\u201d to different charities.It was not clear when Mr. Rechnitz met Mr. Reichberg or what brought them together from different corners of New York City\u2019s political and religious world: Mr. Reichberg from Borough Park\u2019s Orthodox Jewish community, Mr. Rechnitz from a less formally religious community on the Upper West Side.\u201cOh, yeah, that\u2019s not Jona,\u201d Rabbi Einhorn said upon learning of Mr. Reichberg and his roots in Brooklyn.Yet they were often seen together at police events around the city and may have bonded over their common fascination with the police and interest in cultivating connections among the top officials.Mr. Reichberg became a volunteer police chaplain for the Westchester County Department of Public Safety in 2013. His appointment coincided with a $15,000 donation from J.S.R. Capital, Mr. Rechnitz\u2019s real estate company, to the re-election bid of the county executive, Rob Astorino. (Mr. Reichberg was suspended from the position last week.)Less is known about Mr. Reichberg, whose company has no public website; fewer public records directly connected to his business, J.R. Consulting, could be found.Neither Mr. Rechnitz nor Mr. Reichberg appeared to have been well known for their political activities. \u201cI don\u2019t know them. If I bumped into them, I wouldn\u2019t know them,\u201d said Assemblyman Dov Hikind, a Democrat who has represented the area of Borough Park in various capacities for more than three decades. \u201cPeople want to be machers. That\u2019s a good thing, if it\u2019s done correctly.\u201dEarly in the 2013 campaign, Mr. Rechnitz told close associates he favored William C. Thompson Jr., who appeared more likely to prevail. After Mr. de Blasio won the September primary, he and his wife donated the limit, $4,950, to his general election campaign. Mr. Rechnitz also acted as a bundler, collecting $41,650 for the campaign in October 2013. Then, a few days before he was named to the inaugural committee, he bundled another contribution of $3,000.Three members of the inaugural committee said they were unaware if it ever held a meeting. \u201cIt was largely ceremonial,\u201d said Janet Dewart Bell, a communications consultant who was on the committee. She said her involvement was essentially limited to a phone conversation with the committee chairwoman, Gabrielle Fialkoff, where they discussed the inauguration in general.\u201cThere was no sitting down, no logistical planning; they were not asking us to do that,\u201d Ms. Bell said.Ms. Fialkoff, the inauguration chairwoman, had been the finance co-chairwoman of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s campaign and is a longtime friend of the mayor. Ms. Fialkoff is now a senior adviser to the mayor, the director of the mayor\u2019s office of strategic partnerships, and a member of the board of the Mayor\u2019s Fund to Advance New York City.By Dec. 3, 2013, weeks before Mr. de Blasio took office, Mr. Rechnitz was sitting in a conference room packed with other potential donors at the Midtown law firm Kramer Levin. There, according to a person who also attended the meeting, the mayor spoke to the group before leaving the room. Those in attendance were then asked for contributions.Mr. Rechnitz \u2014 whose company owns a strip mall in Borough Park, a Midtown building and several other modest properties \u2014 was at other fund-raisers, including on Dec. 10 at B. B. King\u2019s restaurant in Times Square.On Jan. 28, a company controlled by Mr. Rechnitz, JSTD Madison, made a contribution of $50,000 to the Campaign for One New York, a nonprofit formed to press for Mr. de Blasio\u2019s agenda. Mr. Rechnitz appears on real estate documents as a \u201cmanaging member\u201d of the company.In the middle of 2014, Mr. Rechnitz was again at a fund-raiser to help Mr. de Blasio\u2019s efforts on behalf of Democrats in the State Senate. In October 2014, JSTD Madison made a $102,300 contribution to the state\u2019s Democratic Senate campaign committee, at a time that Mr. de Blasio was pushing to shift control of the State Senate to his party.By that time, however, the federal investigation was already well underway.An article on April 12 about two donors to Mayor Bill de Blasio and their connections with police officials who are under federal investigation misstated the rank of a former senior police commander. Philip Banks III, one of the officials under investigation, was once the highest ranking uniformed official in the New York Police Department, not the third-highest-ranking chief. The error was repeated in an accompanying picture caption. This correction was delayed because editors learned of the error only late last week.Jack Begg, Alain Delaqu\u00e9ri\u00e8re and Michael M.

{"Headline": "De Blasio, Denying Misdeeds Again, Says Claims May Be Driven by Politics", "Date": "2016-04-25", "News": "Supported byIt lasted about five minutes, comprising seven questions in all, and it was not one of Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s finest, or most expansive, moments.The queries about a series of investigations into his political fund-raising came one after another on Monday, with the mayor sticking to a still-evolving strategic defense: He said \u201cunequivocally\u201d that no laws were broken, that any suggestion that he sought to circumvent state campaign finance laws was \u201coutrageous,\u201d and that the big question was what or who had prompted the inquiries.A spokeswoman for the mayor then abruptly ended the news conference, and he headed to his car, trailed by cameras and more shouted questions from reporters.The letter, which was sent to the State Board of Elections, sought to rebuff the latest series of accusations against the administration: that Mr. de Blasio\u2019s team in City Hall had committed flagrant violations of campaign finance laws during the mayor\u2019s unsuccessful push in 2014 to win a Democratic majority in the State Senate.The letter came in response to the leak on Friday of a confidential report by the board that accused a team formed by Mr. de Blasio of illegally funneling money to various candidates through county Democratic Party committees and a statewide party committee, in order to evade limits on campaign contributions.Monday\u2019s news conference, held on a sunny street in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, showed how Mr. de Blasio seems to be growing increasingly frustrated as the investigations divert attention from his agenda. (The mayor was in Brooklyn to talk about a homeowner credit for water and sewer bills.) And while his administration struggles to find a way to respond, the mayor remains unable to escape the growing cloud of investigations and questions.Mr. de Blasio has consistently stated that his campaign and his administration did nothing wrong but he added a new element to his message on Monday, questioning whether some of the accusations against him, and the leaks to the news media that have aired them, are politically motivated.\u201cA lot of very good people are having their names dragged through the mud over these last few weeks, a lot of people that I respect greatly and have worked with for years,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cI\u2019m quite convinced that the facts will show that everything was done legally and appropriately.\u201cBut when you see something done in this kind of fashion, when you see an inappropriate leak, when you see the law being misconstrued in such an obvious fashion, of course it begs the question of motivation,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll leave it to all of you to uncover those motivations.\u201dThat statement echoed the letter written on Sunday by Laurence D. Laufer, a lawyer for Mr. de Blasio\u2019s 2013 campaign and his re-election campaign.Mr. Laufer\u2019s letter questioned the integrity of the report\u2019s author, Risa S. Sugarman, the elections board\u2019s chief enforcement counsel, and accused her of failing to understand state law. He called her report a \u201cblatantly political document\u201d and suggested the leak was a \u201cpolitically motivated act.\u201dNeither the letter nor Mr. de Blasio said explicitly what potential political motivation they were referring to. But the implication was that Ms. Sugarman has ties to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who is locked in a bitter feud with the mayor, a fellow Democrat. Mr. Cuomo nominated Ms. Sugarman to her job at the elections board. Before that she held jobs in his administration, most recently as a deputy commissioner in the Department of Taxation and Finance, and when he was attorney general.In his letter, addressed to Ms. Sugarman, Mr. Laufer made a request under the state\u2019s Freedom of Information Law for any emails or other documents that might show how the confidential report reached the hands of someone outside the elections board \u2014 and eventually wound up in the press.In the report, Ms. Sugarman recommended that the board refer the matter of the State Senate financing to the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr. Mr. Vance confirmed on Monday that he had received the referral and had begun an investigation into the state board\u2019s allegations.Mr. Laufer\u2019s letter said that the fund-raising for the State Senate races was fully in compliance with state law. But it failed to address or even mention the statute that Ms. Sugarman said had been violated \u2014 a section of the law that classifies certain efforts to evade contribution limits as a felony.In response to a question about that omission on Monday, Mr. Laufer said through a spokesman that the statute cited by Ms. Sugarman \u201chas no bearing\u201d on the fund-raising in the Senate campaign.Besides the investigation into the 2014 Senate race, Mr. de Blasio faces a slate of other inquiries by state and federal authorities. They have focused in part on the Campaign for One New York, a nonprofit that Mr. de Blasio created to promote his mayoral agenda, as well as two businessmen involved in raising funds for or donating them to that group or his mayoral campaign.William T. Cunningham, who was head of communications for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, said that Mr. Laufer\u2019s letter served only to briefly shift the focus of news coverage away from the mayor and onto the question of potential political motivation.\u201cHe changed the narrative until, of course, the mayor then cut off the questions and left the press conference, giving the press something else to write about,\u201d Mr. Cunningham said. \u201cThe mayor can\u2019t be seen to be running away from the press.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not the image you want,\u201d he added, \u201cso you either have to take questions or you don\u2019t take questions.\u201dThrough it all, Mr. de Blasio has sought to press forward with his programs and policies. The event on Monday featured a giant blowup of a water bill showing the $183 credit that would go to hundreds of thousands of homeowners, although Mr. de Blasio referred to it more than once as a check that consumers would receive.The mayor then delivered what had to be an unintentional straight line: \u201cA large check is a glorious thing, don\u2019t you think?\u201dJames C. McKinley Jr. and William K. Rashbaum contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mayor de Blasio\u2019s Campaign Fund-Raising Scrutinized in U.S. Corruption Inquiry", "Date": "2016-04-08", "News": "Supported byA wide-ranging federal corruption investigation centered on two businessmen with ties to Mayor Bill de Blasio is also examining some aspects of his campaign fund-raising, a person with knowledge of the matter said on Friday.The investigation, which in recent days has garnered attention because the focus on the two businessmen led federal agents to interview roughly 20 senior New York Police Department officials, has for some time been examining the ways the businessmen wielded influence in New York City government, several people briefed on the matter said.That examination has included an aggressive review of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s campaign fund-raising, the person with knowledge of the matter said. The investigation\u2019s focus on Mr. de Blasio\u2019s fund-raising was reported on Friday night by WCBS-TV News.It was unclear what specific aspect of the mayor\u2019s fund-raising was under scrutiny and how it related to the conduct of the two businessmen.The two businessmen under scrutiny are Jona Rechnitz and Jeremy Reichberg. Both served on a large committee that planned Mr. de Blasio\u2019s inaugural celebration in 2014, and Mr. Rechnitz and his wife each contributed $4,950, the maximum amount allowed, to his 2013 campaign. Mr. Rechnitz also raised about $45,000 for him.Dan Levitan, a spokesman for Mr. de Blasio\u2019s campaign, said, \u201cWe are fully confident that the campaign has conducted itself legally and appropriately at all times.\u201d The campaign is expected to return the contributions from Mr. Rechnitz and his wife.Mr. Rechnitz owns a real estate investment, development and management company called JSR Capital L.L.C., which owns buildings in Manhattan and Brooklyn.Mr. Reichberg hosted a 2014 fund-raiser for the Campaign for One New York, a nonprofit created by advisers to Mr. de Blasio in support of the mayor\u2019s agenda. The group, criticized by watchdog groups as a kind of \u201cshadow government\u201d of lobbyists at City Hall, began the process of closing down last month.While the interviews of the police officials attracted far more attention \u2014 and led to discipline on Thursday against four senior department officials \u2014 the examination of the roles of the businessmen, according to several people briefed on the matter, and the mayor\u2019s fund-raising have been the central elements of the inquiry.The restaurateur, Hamlet Peralta, who owned the now-closed Hudson River Caf\u00e9 in Harlem, misappropriated more than $12 million from investors for use in what he said was a wholesale liquor business, according to the complaint, which was unsealed on Friday in Federal District Court in Manhattan. The business was, in fact, fictitious, prosecutors said.Mr. Peralta, who faces one count of wire fraud, was arrested on Thursday by F.B.I. agents in Macon, Ga.; on Friday, a magistrate judge ordered him detained and sent to New York for further proceedings. A lawyer who represented him in court on Friday declined to comment.According to the complaint, Mr. Peralta relied on a recruiter to help him find investors, and he befriended at least one other person who became an investor at his restaurant. That person was one of Mr. Peralta\u2019s largest investors and gave him more than $3.5 million, the complaint says, adding that Mr. Peralta still owes that investor more than $1.5 million.The complaint, signed by Joseph Downs, an F.B.I. special agent, said that the authorities identified about 12 investors in the scheme, none of whom were named in the document. But the person briefed on the inquiry, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because that person was not allowed to discuss the matter, said the investors included the two businessmen, Mr. Rechnitz and Mr. Reichberg.It was unclear whether either of the two men lost money in the alleged scheme, or how much they had invested. Marc S. Harris, a Los Angeles lawyer who represents Mr. Rechnitz, declined to comment. Mr. Reichberg could not be reached for comment, and a lawyer who was said to represent him would not comment on who she might or might not represent.The charge against Mr. Peralta adds another strand to the tangled web of people who have come under scrutiny in the course of the roughly two-year inquiry, which includes police officials; the two businessmen; Mr. Peralta; the police force\u2019s former chief of department, Philip Banks III, who was the top uniformed official before retiring in 2014; and Norman Seabrook. Mr. Seabrook heads the union that represents New York City correction officers and, along with Mr. Banks, was one of the original people whose financial dealings were examined by federal investigators.The investigation, which led to the interviews of about 20 mostly senior police officials, is more narrowly focused on the conduct of Mr. Rechnitz and Mr. Reichberg and how they may have tried to use their influence in City Hall, people briefed on the inquiry have said. Neither man has been charged with a crime and the precise allegations under investigation were unclear.Monica Klein, a spokeswoman for Mr. de Blasio, said in a statement that he and Police Commissioner William J. Bratton were \u201cboth committed to ensuring that the N.Y.P.D. maintains the integrity and trust that the public expects from its Police Department.\u201d\u201cThe mayor is fully supportive of these investigations to learn the truth,\u201d Ms. Klein added.Mr. Bratton said on Thursday that the investigation was examining the \u201cconduct of current and former N.Y.P.D. officers and several others.\u201d The department also said that three deputy chiefs and a deputy inspector had been reassigned to desk jobs as discipline stemming from the investigation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Victim in Wall St. Scheme Was a Classmate of Its Accused Architect", "Date": "2016-04-03", "News": "Supported byWhen Andrew Caspersen sought money for an investment that federal authorities said duped investors out of tens of millions of dollars, one of the people the former Wall Street executive turned to was a college classmate at Princeton University.Mr. McIntyre did not return requests for comment. His identity as a victim in the scheme, however, was confirmed by two people with direct knowledge of the case who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.He and Mr. Caspersen attended Princeton together and graduated in 1999. Each found his own path to work for a Wall Street firm after graduate school: Mr. Caspersen went to Harvard Law School, and Mr. McIntyre received his M.B.A. from Columbia University. Along with their wives, both men shared an interest in Latin America and were donors to Princeton in Latin America, a nonprofit organization that funds projects and fellowships in the region for students, as recently as 2011.It is not clear whether the two men were close, but last fall Mr. Caspersen contacted Mr. McIntyre with what federal authorities have said was a fraudulent pitch for an investment vehicle that Mr. Caspersen had incorporated last summer. At the time, Mr. Caspersen was well regarded on Wall Street and had built up a reputation for being good at his job raising money for private equity investments.Federal prosecutors said Mr. McIntyre was not aware that Mr. Caspersen was raising money for an investment vehicle that was under his personal control and not for a client of Mr. Caspersen\u2019s former firm \u2014 Park Hill Group, a division of PJT Partners, which has been spun off from the private equity giant Blackstone Group.The Moore Charitable Foundation, a $190 million charitable trust that supports conservation causes, invested on the recommendation of Mr. McIntyre, according to a complaint filed by the government last week.Mr. Caspersen\u2019s activities caught up with him in March when Mr. McIntyre and another unidentified employee at Moore Capital suspected something unusual and the Moore foundation asked to redeem its nearly $25 million. On March 26, Mr. Caspersen was arrested on charges of securities fraud and wire fraud.Federal prosecutors working for Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, contend that Mr. Caspersen, 39, had sought to defraud investors of as much as $95 million.Mr. Caspersen\u2019s lawyer has previously declined to comment on the charges against his client.Moore Capital, the $15.5 billion hedge fund led by the billionaire investor Louis M. Bacon, previously confirmed that the Moore Charitable Foundation had invested in the investment vehicle set up last summer by Mr. Caspersen.Federal prosecutors in the criminal complaint filed against Mr. Caspersen simply referred to Mr. McIntyre as \u201cindividual one.\u201dThe complaint describes \u201cindividual one\u201d as being responsible for evaluating and recommending investments for the Moore foundation. Mr. McIntyre eventually told his employer that something did not seem right with the investment in Mr. Caspersen\u2019s vehicle.It is not clear what may have motivated Mr. Caspersen, who comes from a wealthy family. He was well paid at Park Hill, where last year he took home $3.68 million. On Monday, he appeared in court where he was released after posting a $5 million bond, putting up as collateral the homes he and his wife have in Bronxville, N.Y., and Manhattan.His father, Finn M. W. Caspersen, was a prominent philanthropist and the heir to the Beneficial Corporation fortune. The elder Mr. Caspersen was chairman and chief executive of the consumer finance company for nearly two decades before selling the firm in 1998 for $8.6 billion to Household International, which was later acquired by the London-based bank HSBC.In an unexpected twist to the case, Judge Kimba M. Wood of the Federal District Court in Manhattan, who was assigned to a related civil lawsuit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, recused herself on March 31. In an endorsed letter to the court, Ms. Wood disclosed that she had \u201cfamily members who have had in the past contact with Andrew Caspersen.\u201dAn article on Monday about the victims of an investment scheme operated by Andrew Casperson, a former Wall Street executive, misstated the amount of Mr. Caspersen\u2019s bond in some copies. He posted a $5 million bond, not $5 billion.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Police, a Playbook for Conflicts Involving Mental Illness", "Date": "2016-04-25", "News": "In response to high-profile shootings of people with mental illness, police departments around the country are turning to crisis intervention training.Supported byPORTLAND, Ore. \u2014 The 911 caller had reported a man with a samurai sword, lunging at people on the waterfront.It was evening, and when the police arrived, they saw the man pacing the beach and called to him. He responded by throwing a rock at the embankment where they stood.They shouted to him from a sheriff\u2019s boat; he threw another rock. They told him to drop the sword; he said he would kill them. He started to leave the beach, and after warning him, they shot him in the leg with a beanbag gun. He turned back, still carrying the four-foot blade.In another city \u2014 or in Portland itself not that long ago \u2014 the next step would almost certainly have been a direct confrontation and, had the man not put down the weapon, the use of lethal force.At a time when police behavior is under intense scrutiny \u2014 a series of fatal shootings by police officers have focused national attention on issues of race and mental illness \u2014 Portland\u2019s approach has served as a model for other law enforcement agencies around the country.And on that Sunday last summer, the police here chose a different course.At 2:30 a.m., after spending hours trying to engage the man, the officers decided to \u201cdisengage,\u201d and they withdrew, leaving the man on the beach. A search at daylight found no signs of him.People with mental illnesses are overrepresented among civilians involved in police shootings: Twenty-five percent or more of people fatally shot by the police have had a mental disorder, according to various analyses.Studies have found that the training can alter the way officers view people with mental illness. And the approach, which teaches officers ways to defuse potentially violent encounters before force becomes necessary, is useful for officers facing any volatile situation, even if a mental health crisis is not involved, law enforcement experts say.Whether the training leads to less use of force by officers, however, is still an open question: The findings of studies have been mixed, although one study to be published later this year suggests that Portland\u2019s program, which is based on C.I.T., is having an effect. And training alone is not enough, experts say. For the approach to be effective, it needs the full backing of a police department\u2019s leadership, continual checks on its effectiveness, and collaboration with the mental health community.The decision by the Portland police to leave the sword-wielding man on the beach was controversial within the department. Some officers argued that more should have been done: What if the man had injured or killed someone?Others countered that it was late and that the secluded area was deserted. The man had committed no crime. And a confrontation could easily have ended with him or the officers being harmed.But the discussion itself, some officers said, was a sign of change.\u201cTen years ago, we would have been more proactive in dealing with him at the start,\u201d said Officer Brad Yakots, a specialist in mental health issues who was called to the scene. \u201cIt\u2019s a new way of looking at it.\u201dMr. Chasse\u2019s death outraged the public. The Police Bureau, in response, revised policies and required all its officers to complete 40 hours of crisis intervention training.But after more troubling instances involving the mentally ill, a Justice Department investigation concluded in 2012 that the Police Bureau had shown \u201ca pattern or practice of unnecessary or unreasonable force during interactions with people who have or are perceived to have mental illness.\u201dThis time, the Police Bureau\u2019s leadership responded far more aggressively. In addition to the mandatory training for the entire force, a group of about 100 patrol officers signed up for 40 extra hours of instruction to handle more complex calls involving mental illness or drug and alcohol addiction.Teams of officers were paired with mental health clinicians to follow up on cases. New protocols were put in place. And the police connected with housing and mental health organizations to help further.She noted that in cases like that of the man with the sword, \u201cthere\u2019s a potential negative outcome regardless of the decision we make.\u201dIn the past, she said, officers were taught, \u201cIf you do this, I\u2019m going to do that.\u201d Now they are encouraged to question whether \u201cthat\u201d is really necessary.Officers need to be educated about mental illness, many criminal justice experts say, because cutbacks in financing for mental health services have put them on the front lines of dealing with many people who have psychiatric disorders.Jails around the country have filled with mentally ill inmates who, unable to obtain treatment in the community, are arrested time and again for minor offenses like disorderly conduct and petty theft. Police officers have been forced to play dual roles as law enforcers and psychiatric social workers.\u201cWe are working in the backdrop of a fractured mental health system that has gotten worse and worse,\u201d said Portland\u2019s police chief, Lawrence O\u2019Dea III.Yet many police officers know little about mental disorders, and what they do know is often shaped by stigma. Bizarre behavior is often interpreted as a prelude to violence. And routine police actions aimed at control \u2014 placing a hand on a person\u2019s shoulder, for example \u2014 can backfire with someone with a severe mental illness.In the crisis training, officers learn about psychiatric medications, role-play various scenarios, and have opportunities to interact with people who have a mental illness when they are not in crisis.The officers are told, among other things, to use distance and time to try to defuse potentially violent encounters.About 2,700 law enforcement agencies around the country use some form of the approach, said Ms. Usher, of the mental illness alliance, and that number is growing as more departments have come under pressure to change police behavior.\u201cThere\u2019s all kinds of specialization in law enforcement,\u201d Major Cochran said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got bomb technicians, narcotics, robbery. I want all the officers present at a scene to understand that this C.I.T. officer is the leader. That represents clarity, and responsibility brings about a level of accountability.\u201dBut the bureau, the monitors said, had made \u201csubstantial progress\u201d in improving the way they dealt with the mentally ill.And the study of the Portland police that is to be published later this year found that the use of force by officers had decreased by 65.4 percent from 2008 to 2014, as measured in quarterly reports. The researchers attributed the drop in large part to increased training and oversight in recent years, although the study did not specifically look at interactions with the mentally ill.Police shootings, the researchers found, had also dropped, averaging three a year from 2007 to 2014, compared with eight a year from 2002 to 2005.Officer Yakots, who has been on the force for nine years, said he thought that the department\u2019s efforts to shift course had been largely successful. But he added: \u201cDo things fall through the cracks? Yeah, it\u2019s not perfect. A lot of times we have limited resources.\u201dIt was a Monday night in late February when he and his partner, Officer Michael Hastings, were making the rounds of makeshift homeless camps and downtown street corners, listening for radio calls that might require their presence.An adolescent girl was on an overpass, threatening to jump. A college student had called his mother in another city and told her he was going to kill himself. A 38-year-old woman was standing outside a mental health treatment center demanding to be taken to the hospital because, she said, \u201cI am suicidal and homicidal.\u201dOfficer Hastings said that before the department changed its approach, the attitude was \u201cenforce, enforce, enforce, arrest, arrest, arrest.\u201dBut taking people to an emergency room or putting them in jail did nothing. \u201cThese people, they\u2019re out within four hours most of the time,\u201d he said.At least in Portland, Officer Hastings said, most police officers had accepted that part of their job was now dealing with mental illness and helping to find longer-term solutions.\u201cWe\u2019ve realized that it is what it is,\u201d he said, \u201cand we\u2019re the ones that are going to be responding to that.\u201dPicture captions on Tuesday with an article about police departments around the country that are turning to crisis intervention training to deal with people with mental illness referred incorrectly to the credentials of two officers from Portland, Ore. Officers Michael Hastings and Brad Yakots have received crisis intervention training; they are not members of the police force\u2019s Behavioral Health Unit.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Police Leaders Questioned Amid Inquiry of Businessmen Linked to de Blasio", "Date": "2016-04-05", "News": "Supported byThe visits, unannounced and in the early morning hours, began several weeks ago at houses and apartments in and around New York City. They followed a pattern: Two agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation would approach the front door and ring the bell. They would be invited in. Then the questions would come.What set these visits apart from similar house calls that are routinely made by F.B.I. agents investigating crimes, according to three people familiar with the inquiries, was the people who answered the door: Almost all of them, about 20, were senior members of the New York Police Department, many of them chiefs.Some of the questions centered on allegations of free meals and trips given to police officials by members of Orthodox Jewish communities in Brooklyn. But the agents were more focused on two Orthodox businessmen with ties to Mayor Bill de Blasio, according to the three people, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the investigation.Some of the police officials interviewed responded later to follow-up questions from the agents, who are assigned to a squad that investigates public corruption, one of those briefed on the investigation said. The inquiry is being conducted with prosecutors from the United States attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan, and a federal grand jury has begun hearing evidence in the case, two of the people familiar with the matter said.The two businessmen, Jona Rechnitz and Jeremy Reichberg, served on Mr. de Blasio\u2019s inaugural committee in 2013, along with more than 70 others, including the actress Sarah Jessica Parker, the author Junot D\u00edaz, the billionaire businessman Ronald O. Perelman, the real estate developer Steve Witkoff and Mark G. Peters, who was Mr. de Blasio\u2019s campaign treasurer and is now the commissioner of the Investigation Department.The precise allegations under investigation are unclear; neither man has been charged with a crime.Mr. Rechnitz raised nearly $45,000 in donations for Mr. de Blasio\u2019s 2013 campaign, and he and his wife each gave the maximum amount allowed, $4,950. Mr. Rechnitz owns a real estate investment, development and management company called JSR Capital L.L.C., which owns several buildings in Manhattan and Brooklyn according to the company\u2019s website.A spokesman for the mayor\u2019s re-election campaign said that it would not accept contributions from the two men while the investigation was underway.A lawyer for Mr. Rechnitz, Marc S. Harris of the Los Angeles law firm Scheper Kim & Harris, said his client had broken no laws and had not been notified that he was the subject of any investigation.Mr. Reichberg could not be reached for comment, and it could not be determined whether he had retained a lawyer.The head of the union that represents Police Department chiefs, inspectors and captains said the chiefs who had been interviewed were cooperating with the investigation and that all had been told that they were not targets of the inquiry.The F.B.I. and the office of the United States attorney in Manhattan declined to comment.Police Commissioner William J. Bratton, asked on Tuesday at an unrelated news conference about the interviews of senior police officials, also declined to comment about the inquiry, other than noting that one officer, whom he did not identify, had been placed on modified assignment. That officer is a detective who other officials have said declined to testify before the grand jury investigating the matter.A grand jury subpoena served on Mr. Seabrook\u2019s union in May 2015 sought a wide range of union and business records, including any relating to JSR Capital, according to a copy of the subpoena that was reviewed by The New York Times.Mr. Banks, who has emphatically denied wrongdoing on several occasions, said on Tuesday that he had never been contacted in connection with any investigation and did not want to comment.An article last Wednesday about the questioning of top police officials in connection with an inquiry into two businessmen\u2019s ties to Mayor Bill de Blasio misstated the connection between one of those men and a property at 23 Wall Street. JSR Capital L.L.C., a real estate company owned by Jona Rechnitz, one of the businessmen, was previously the owner\u2019s representative and manager of 23 Wall Street, according to JSR\u2019s website. It does not own the property.Al Baker, Michael Schwirtz and Michael Winerip contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "G.O.P. Donors, Eager to Defeat Donald Trump, Learn to Love Ted Cruz", "Date": "2016-04-07", "News": "Supported byNestled in the neo-Georgian sanctuary of the Knickerbocker Club, one of New York\u2019s oldest and fustiest social establishments, a select group of Republican donors gathered late last month to take up an unexpected task: reconsidering Ted Cruz.\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to attack people in New York,\u201d said Mr. Cruz, a senator from Texas, explaining that he had been criticizing the state\u2019s policies, not its populace. \u201cI love New York.\u201dOf all the teeth-gritting alliances being forged over opposition to Mr. Trump\u2019s rampaging bid for the Republican presidential nomination, few are as unlikely as the emerging bond between Mr. Cruz and his party\u2019s elite donor establishment.But in recent weeks, at small events from the Upper East Side of Manhattan to the Republican precincts of Newport Beach, Calif., they are learning to love Mr. Cruz.\u201cThat was then,\u201d said Anthony H. Gioia, a Buffalo businessman and ambassador to Malta under President George W. Bush who expects to meet with Mr. Cruz in the coming weeks. \u201cAnd now is now.\u201d\u201cLots of people are giving him a second look,\u201d said John A. Catsimatidis, a New York investor and grocery store magnate who attended the event at the Knickerbocker Club. \u201cPeople are scared of Donald Trump, that\u2019s why.\u201dStarting on Friday in Las Vegas, Trusted Leadership, the chief \u201csuper PAC\u201d supporting Mr. Cruz, will host a gathering intended to draw new donors to the group, until now financed by a handful of wealthy families. Not coincidentally, the event will be held at the Venetian, the casino hotel owned by the Republican megadonor Sheldon Adelson, perhaps the most sought-after contributor of all.Kellyanne Conway, the president of Trusted Leadership, summed up how prominent donors\u2019 view of the Cruz-Trump fight had evolved. \u201cIt\u2019s not just, \u2018Would you rather be shot or poisoned?\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cNow it\u2019s, \u2018This isn\u2019t so bad.\u2019 \u201dOne goal is to pry loose some of the large-scale money that went to candidates like Mr. Rubio and Mr. Bush earlier in the campaign. In recent months, as Mr. Cruz rose, some of the party\u2019s wealthiest donors, such as the billionaire New York investor Paul Singer and the Ricketts family, chose to pour money into super PACs that are directly attacking Mr. Trump, rather than openly backing Mr. Cruz.But the courtship is a delicate one. Some donors said that if Mr. Cruz was perhaps not their ideal choice for president \u2014 or even their third or fourth choice \u2014 he now seemed to be the only candidate with enough delegates to force a contested convention and deny Mr. Trump the nomination.The rules for how Republican delegates are selected could end up turning votes for one candidate into delegates who will support another candidate at the convention.\u201cIt\u2019s never really been a part of his brand, to be the unifying figure who could bring together the party, and it certainly was never part of his pitch,\u201d said Chris DeRose, an Arizona lawyer who raised money for Mr. Rubio. \u201cBut the specter of Trump has done wonders to show us the downsides of losing this primary.\u201dFor Mr. Cruz, help from establishment donors could dilute his outsider message and provide a new cudgel for Mr. Trump, who has denounced rivals for their dependence on contributions from the wealthy and powerful.Forty percent of his overall cash has come from small donors, many in Texas, and only about a fifth of his money for the primary has come from donors giving the maximum $2,700 contributions. At the end of February, according to the most recent financial disclosures, the campaign reported about $8 million cash on hand.Mr. Cruz\u2019s challenge is to broaden his reach in the world of midlevel Republican fund-raisers \u2014 those who can raise tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars for his campaign \u2014 and among the elite group of billionaires who could write larger checks to the super PACs supporting him.But doubts remain. Mr. Catsimatidis, one of about 30 people who attended the event at the Knickerbocker Club, pronounced Mr. Cruz \u201cvery, very smart,\u201d but he said he wondered why \u201cout of 100 people in the Senate, 99 don\u2019t like him.\u201dMr. Cruz is not always good at asking for help, sometimes giving the impression that he could as easily do without it. Even in private, donors said, he can be prone to sanctimony, disinclined to adjust his television-ready populism. Allies view Mr. Cruz\u2019s uncompromising style as a virtue, but they concede it can make life difficult on the donor circuit.An interactive delegate calculator that lets you simulate how the 2016 Republican nomination process could unfold.Asked what was the biggest worry of prospective supporters, Doug Deason, a major Cruz donor in Dallas, did not hesitate.\u201cI think his personality, mostly,\u201d Mr. Deason said, before defending him as likable to those who get to know him.A wider embrace by donors has also been hampered in some quarters by genuine political disagreement between more middle-of-the-road potential donors and Mr. Cruz, a professed conservative purist on economic and social issues.Andy Sabin, a former Bush supporter who runs a Long Island precious metals company, said that when a fund-raiser from Mr. Cruz\u2019s campaign reached out recently, he insisted on one condition.\u201cI told him, \u2018For me to have any interest in Ted, I need him to accept that the earth has warmed, and that we can solve the problem and create plenty of jobs,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Sabin recalled. Mr. Sabin said that he was offered a spot on one of Mr. Cruz\u2019s policy advisory committees, but that when he still asked that Mr. Cruz publicly voice a belief in climate change, he never heard back. Even a signal in the right direction would have been enough for him, Mr. Sabin said.\u201cAll he had to do was say, we think it\u2019s an issue for the general election, and maybe put Ted on the phone,\u201d Mr. Sabin said, adding, \u201cI felt I was being hustled for a donation.\u201dMr. Cruz has reported raising only a few thousand dollars from registered lobbyists \u2014 a mainstay of fund-raising for Mr. Rubio and Mr. Bush \u2014 suggesting that he is still a tough sell among those he continues to deride as the \u201cWashington cartel.\u201d\u201cThere is no more staunch and vocal supporter of the state of Israel than Ted Cruz has been,\u201d the elder Mr. Zeidman said. \u201cAnd it is the primary reason I felt I had to support him.\u201dElsewhere, support for Mr. Cruz has required fewer caveats. He is regarded warmly among Republicans in his home state, Texas, where he has deeper personal relations with a wider portion of the donor class. For longtime Cruz fund-raisers there who seek to expand Mr. Cruz\u2019s fund-raising footprint in other corners of the country, it has been a heady few weeks. There are new calls to make and pitches to massage, given many audiences\u2019 deep reservations.\u201cWe weren\u2019t their No. 1 draft pick,\u201d Mica Mosbacher, a Cruz fund-raiser based in Houston and New York, said of her discussions with new prospects. Ms. Mosbacher is among the supporters assigned to attest to Mr. Cruz\u2019s charms.\u201cI call him a steady Eddie,\u201d she said, before paraphrasing a Cruz answer from a past debate. \u201cHe might not be the most fun to have a drink at the bar with, but America needs a designated driver.\u201dMr. Cruz has taken to making light of his d\u00e9tente with former critics and opponents, donors and otherwise. When Mr. Cruz appeared recently on \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live,\u201d the late-night host took note of his patience in winning new friends.\u201cThere you go,\u201d Mr. Cruz replied. \u201cListen, it is a powerful strategy.\u201dKitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Federal Prosecutors Cast a Wider Net in New York City Hall Inquiry", "Date": "2016-04-10", "News": "Supported bySigns of a sprawling municipal investigation in New York City have emerged in a seemingly random fashion over the last week. Four senior police officials were abruptly transferred or put on modified duty. A Manhattan restaurateur was arrested and charged with operating a Ponzi scheme. Among his investors were two men who had raised money for Mayor Bill de Blasio, and one of the men was also a generous campaign donor.A federal grand jury in Manhattan has begun hearing evidence in the case, according to several people briefed on the matter. The inquiry has come to focus on the two fund-raisers: Jona Rechnitz, who raised money for Mr. de Blasio\u2019s campaign and was also a donor to both the campaign and to a nonprofit group that supported the mayor\u2019s agenda; and Jeremy Reichberg, who held a fund-raiser for that nonprofit.Federal wiretaps in the case have captured their conversations, two of the people said, without elaborating on the substance of the discussions.Both Mr. Rechnitz and Mr. Reichberg served on a committee that planned Mr. de Blasio\u2019s 2014 inaugural celebration. Mr. Rechnitz owns a real estate development and management firm that controls several buildings in Brooklyn and Manhattan. Mr. Reichberg operates a consulting company, but the precise nature of its business is unclear.Two of the people briefed on the matter suggested that investigators were trying to determine whether Mr. Rechnitz and Mr. Reichberg benefited from some type of favorable municipal action, or the promise of some action, in exchange for their donations, their fund-raising or some other gesture. But the precise allegations under scrutiny by federal prosecutors in Manhattan and agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation are unclear. The two people, like others interviewed for this article, spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk about the case publicly.Neither man has been charged with a crime.To date, there has been no suggestion that Mr. de Blasio was involved in any improprieties, and it remains unclear whether the prosecutors and F.B.I. agents working on the case have developed evidence, conclusive or otherwise, of the kind of quid pro quo necessary to prove most corruption crimes in federal court. Speaking to reporters on Sunday, Mr. de Blasio said no one in his administration had been contacted by investigators, and he described his relationship with the two businessmen as cursory.A lawyer for Mr. Rechnitz, Marc S. Harris, said last week that his client had broken no laws and that he had not been notified that he was the subject of any inquiry. Mr. Reichberg could not be reached for comment. A lawyer who was said to represent Mr. Reichberg said last week that she does not comment on who she does or does not represent.Both the United States attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan and the F.B.I., which are conducting the investigation, declined to comment.The investigation brings into sharp relief a central distinction between Mr. de Blasio\u2019s administration and that of his predecessor, Michael R. Bloomberg: Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s enormous personal wealth freed him from the traditional politician\u2019s burden of raising money for re-election campaigns, and essentially gave him independence from those seeking favorable treatment from City Hall.Mr. de Blasio\u2019s administration, on the other hand, has come under consistent criticism from good-government groups and political opponents who have denounced his relationship with a network of consultants and lobbyists who are close to the mayor and represent clients with business before the city.The investigation began in late 2013. In recent months, agents and prosecutors investigating Mr. Rechnitz and Mr. Reichberg learned that they were both also in close contact with roughly a score of high-ranking police officials, and may have lavished gifts upon them, some of the people said. This tangential discovery led the police commissioner, William J. Bratton, to reassign four senior police officials to desk duty last week. Two were stripped of their guns and badges and two others were transferred to less prestigious posts, a rare public rebuke.Investigators also learned that Mr. Rechnitz and Mr. Reichberg had been investors in the alleged Ponzi scheme, two of the people said. This led to the arrest of the restaurateur, Hamlet Peralta, who owned the now-closed Hudson River Cafe in Harlem. Mr. Peralta is accused of misappropriating more than $12 million from investors.The origins of the investigation had little to do with campaign finance.Instead, it was prompted by the discovery of a flurry of large financial transactions through a small Harlem liquor store, a law enforcement official said. The federal authorities began working to trace the funds, which they suspected might be linked to a narcotics or money laundering operation.This strand of the investigation, however, led them to focus on Norman Seabrook, the head of the union that represents city correction officers, and his close friend, Philip Banks III, then the highest-ranking uniformed official in the Police Department. Precisely how is unclear.Investigators eventually discovered that those transactions were, in large measure, movements of money by Mr. Peralta, whose sister owned the liquor store. She has not been charged with any wrongdoing.One part of the investigation remains focused on Mr. Seabrook and Mr. Banks, who were both friendly with Mr. Rechnitz and Mr. Reichberg, and whether Mr. Seabrook enriched himself through the union\u2019s funds, some of the people briefed on the matter have said.The inquiry became public in the last week because F.B.I. agents, weeks earlier, had made early-morning visits to the homes of senior police officials to question them about trips, meals and other gifts they may have received from Mr. Rechnitz and Mr. Reichberg, several of the people briefed on the matter have said.Also, at the end of March, a police detective who had also dealt with the two men declined to answer questions before the grand jury investigating the matter, several of the people said.With so many police officials aware of the F.B.I. visits, news began to spread inside the Police Department, and media reports appeared on Monday night and Tuesday morning.While most of the articles that followed focused on allegations that police officials took free trips and other gifts from Mr. Rechnitz and Mr. Reichberg, several of the people briefed on the matter said that for some time, the central focus of the inquiry had been on the two fund-raisers and how they sought to wield their influence.Mr. Rechnitz and his wife each contributed $4,950, the maximum amount allowed, to Mr. de Blasio\u2019s 2013 campaign, and Mr. Rechnitz also raised about $45,000 for the mayor. Mr. de Blasio\u2019s campaign has said it will return the contributions from Mr. Rechnitz and his wife. Through a company he controls, Mr. Rechnitz also donated $50,000 to the Campaign for One New York, a nonprofit that supported Mr. de Blasio\u2019s agenda.In May 2014, Mr. Reichberg held a fund-raiser at his home for the Campaign for One New York, raising $35,000. The group is in the process of being shut down.Mr. de Blasio, asked on Sunday how he knew Mr. Rechnitz and Mr. Reichberg, told reporters that he met them in 2013.\u201cIt\u2019s not a particularly close relationship,\u201d he said. \u201cAs I said, I met them first around the time of the general election. I hadn\u2019t known them previously, really haven\u2019t seen them in the last year or more.\u201dAsked what kind of work they did on the inaugural committee, Mr. de Blasio said, \u201cThey supported the effort.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Obamacare Seems to Be Reducing People\u2019s Medical Debt", "Date": "2016-04-20", "News": "Supported byPublic HealthEven if you lack health insurance, you\u2019ll probably be able to get treatment at a hospital in the event of a catastrophe \u2014 if you\u2019re struck by a car, say. But having insurance can mean the difference between financial security and financial ruin.A new study is showing that, by giving health insurance to low-income people, Obamacare seems to have cut down on their debt substantially. It estimates that medical debt held by people newly covered by Medicaid since 2014 has been reduced by about $600 to $1,000 each year.\u201cFinancial distress has many subsequent consequences,\u201d said Mr. Kaestner, a professor of health economics at the University of Illinois. \u201cIf people are skipping bills and going into debt, then it can have other repercussions \u2014 for example you lose your car, you fall behind on rent.\u201d\u201cI just turned 26, and I can\u2019t even get a new contract with AT&T without a $750 security deposit, let alone finance a new (used) vehicle,\u201d wrote Richard Barnes, a reader who was uninsured when he was struck with appendicitis three years ago. \u201cWhen I was moving in May 2015, I had extreme trouble finding somebody who would rent to me.\u201dThe new study homed in on the impacts for the lowest-income Americans. The researchers examined credit reports on a sample of Americans across the country. They compared debt incurred by people in two very different sets of states: those that expanded Medicaid to provide free insurance to all individuals earning under about $16,000 and those that either chose not to cover that popuation or had expanded their programs earlier.By focusing on the 25 percent of ZIP codes with the highest percentage of low-income, uninsured people before 2014, the researchers were able to compare debt incurred by people in the unchanged states with the debt of residents of states that offered new insurance options.Over two years, they didn\u2019t find major changes in every measure of financial distress. But Medicaid expansion did move the needle on the number of bills sent to collections and the amount of debt sent to collections. That\u2019s important because that\u2019s the pattern of debt-stressed people after an expensive health crisis, Mr. Kaestner said.The researchers\u2019 estimate of $600 to $1,000 involved some back-of-the-envelope math, but the money is substantial in the context of a population earning less than $16,000 a year. Medical debt also isn\u2019t spread out evenly across the population; about 20 percent of low-income Medicaid beneficiaries end up hospitalized in a given year. That means that a smaller group of people was protected against huge bills.The research also couldn\u2019t tell whether any particular individual got Medicaid. Instead, it tracked everyone in the places where researchers anticipated the biggest changes in Medicaid enrollment. But the differences were clear enough that the researchers are confident that they represent a real change in the financial circumstances of people who signed up for new Medicaid plans.The authors pointed out that the lower debt burden for the newly insured indirectly helps other people. The credit reports also track debt and unpaid bills outside of health care. The insurance coverage means more bills are paid to doctors and hospitals \u2014 but also to banks, utility companies and landlords.Those financial ripples often receive less attention than the health law\u2019s more obvious effects on people\u2019s access to health care. But they are also an important effect of the law.Advertisement"}

He offered career advice to Maya Angelou, then a struggling young cabaret singer whom, he said, he dated for a time.\u201cI was very shapely and nice to look at, but Seymour saw more than that,\u201d Ms. Angelou told The Wall Street Journal in 2006. \u201cHe knew I was always writing and encouraged me to be more than a cocktail singer.\u201d On the acknowledgments page of her book \u201cAll God\u2019s Children Need Traveling Shoes,\u201d she thanked him \u201cfor belief in my youthful ambition.\u201dBored with the law, Mr. Lazar jumped headfirst into the stock market. He became one of the largest independent traders in the United States, buying and selling more than $300 million in stocks in 1967, most of it related to mergers and acquisitions.\u201cI was an in-and-out trader,\u201d he told New York magazine in 1976. \u201cIf I bought a stock in the morning, and still owned it at noon, that was a long-term investment.\u201dHis wild deals and even wilder personal style \u2014 he had a long ponytail, refused to wear socks and was on occasion seen in a Pierre Cardin leather suit with no shirt \u2014 earned him a walk-on role as Seymour the Head in \u201cSupermoney,\u201d George Goodman\u2019s 1972 account of the global financial game, written under the pen name Adam Smith.Working with the celebrity lawyer Marvin Mitchelson, Mr. Lazar invested $250,000 in efforts to prove that a mysterious document discovered in the headquarters of the Church of Latter-day Saints in Salt Lake City represented the final wishes of the reclusive tycoon Howard Hughes, who died in 1976.The Mormon Will, as it was known, left millions to an unusual collection of beneficiaries, most peculiarly to a gas station owner named Melvin Dummar. Mr. Dummar said he had earned Hughes\u2019s gratitude after giving him a ride when he was wandering in the desert. A Nevada jury pronounced the will a fake.\u201cIf I lose, I\u2019ll just go on to something else,\u201d Mr. Lazar said at the time.The something else was class-action lawsuits, filed scattershot against companies large and small, claiming offenses large and small. In 1980 he filed suit against Hertz, claiming that it had overcharged him for gas on a rental car, to the tune of $11.15. That claim was denied, but others, often connected to the poor performance of stocks he owned, succeeded.Mr. Lazar eventually pushed his luck too far. In 2005 a federal grand jury in Los Angeles indicted him on multiple counts, including mail fraud and money laundering. He was accused of taking $2.6 million in kickbacks over 25 years from the law firm of Milberg Weiss to initiate suits on its behalf in his own name and the names of relatives.In 2007, as part of a plea bargain, he pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice, filing a false tax return and making a false declaration. He was sentenced to six months in home detention and ordered to pay a $600,000 fine, on top of a previously ordered $1.5 million forfeiture.\u201cSeymour was living in an unregulated age,\u201d Sheridan Hill, who is completing a biography of Mr. Lazar, said in an interview on Tuesday. \u201cHe was engaging in arbitrage before anyone called it arbitrage. The same with entertainment law. He was doing deals because he saw they were there to be done.\u201dSeymour Manuel Lazar was born on June 14, 1927, in Brooklyn and grew up on a ranch in the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles. His father, Nathan, an accountant, moved the family west in 1933. His mother, the former Rita Tannenbaum, came from a family that ran a wholesale meat business in Beverly Hills.By the time he was 12, Seymour was keeping the books for his father\u2019s accounting business. After graduating from Los Angeles High School in 1943, he took a job at Lockheed, which trained him as an electrical engineer, before enrolling in the pre-law program at the University of California, Berkeley.Drafted into the Army Air Corps, he served two years before resuming his studies. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in economics from Berkeley in 1949 and a law degree from the University of Southern California in 1951.After setting up in private practice, Mr. Lazar found his niche when a Hollywood producer walked into his office and asked if he specialized in entertainment law. He did not, but he said yes and played catch-up. He also bought the Caf\u00e9 Gala, just off the Sunset Strip, which generated a stream of clients.In the 1960s he somehow managed to combine two personas: Wall Street shark and dharma bum. He drove a Rolls-Royce and pushed vast sums through offshore accounts in the Bahamas. His gains and losses were staggering. When a proposed merger between Armour and General Host fell through in 1969, he took a $10 million hit.At the same time, while soaking up the sun in the expatriate community in Cuernavaca, Mexico, he amassed a serious collection of pre-Columbian art. He later collected African and Oceanic art as well. He financed an ashram in Arizona and a monastery in Nepal.It was in Cuernavaca that Mr. Goodman, quite skeptical of the Lazar lore he had heard so much of, met the man behind the myth. \u201cSeymour was real,\u201d he wrote, describing him as a \u201cformerly respectable lawyer with a respectable wife and child, who discovered arbitrage, mind-blowing chemicals and a new lifestyle all at the same time.\u201dMr. Lazar\u2019s first marriage ended in divorce. In addition to his daughter, he is survived by his wife, Alyce Lou; two sons, Job and Adam; a sister, Eileen Russell; and six grandchildren.Mr. Lazar remained defiant after being indicted and in the stressful period that ensued. He languished for months at his home in Palm Springs, wearing an ankle bracelet that he was allowed to remove only when he had to undergo triple-bypass surgery. The so-called kickbacks, he insisted, were referral fees and perfectly legal.The court disagreed. It rankled.\u201cI swear, they treated me like an absolute thug,\u201d he complained to The Wall Street Journal. \u201cDid I hurt anybody? Who did I cheat? Did anybody get screwed?\u201dAdvertisement"}

When you do that, you can unearth a whole bunch of people who think the film was made just for them.\u201d\u201cGreen Room\u201d flexes its knowledge of the genre\u2019s intricacies and offshoots casually, drawing subtle but meaningful distinctions between the protagonists\u2019 good-natured, casual left-wing ethos and the more militant corners of hardcore punk, where skinheads can be either staunch antiracists or nativist neo-fascists, with varying levels of speed and heaviness in the corresponding music.Using music by Dead Kennedys was another reference to adolescence for Mr. Saulnier, who discovered punk when he dubbed an acquaintance\u2019s copy of the band\u2019s 1980 album, \u201cFresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables,\u201d over his own cassette of the \u201cBeverly Hills Cop\u201d soundtrack. Other songs were by his old friends.Though such adherence to punk authenticity can seem outmoded, and the plights of sincere bands with nonexistent commercial prospects are rarely played for drama onscreen, neither punk dogmas nor the violence in \u201cGreen Room\u201d become caricature, despite its B-movie DNA.\u201cI didn\u2019t want to get mired in ideology,\u201d Mr. Saulnier said. \u201cThe value of punk for me cinematically is the energy and the aesthetic and the atmosphere.\u201dHe provided the four actors playing the Ain\u2019t Rights a syllabus for the world he imagined, including the Penelope Spheeris films \u201cSuburbia\u201d and \u201cThe Decline of Western Civilization,\u201d about the Los Angeles punk scene, along with music by the Germs, Bad Brains and Social Distortion.Mr. Yelchin, 27, has dabbled in rock and said: \u201cIt helped that I knew what it was like to be in a band, because emotionally, playing music with your best friends, there\u2019s this shared love that is so powerful. Some of my favorite times that I\u2019ve ever had were piling into a car, getting belligerent, playing a show and sounding awful.\u201dThanks to the genre-defining simplicity of the songs, the fictional band became a real one, said Alia Shawkat, 26, who plays the group\u2019s guitarist and de facto manager, Sam. \u201cI bought a guitar, and we\u2019d play just for fun,\u201d she said. \u201cWe even played two songs as the Ain\u2019t Rights \u2014 one we wrote \u2014 at the wrap party.\u201dThen there was the urbane Mr. Stewart as the ruthless club owner of a graffiti-covered skinhead hangout. \u201cObviously he wanted to shake up his image,\u201d Mr. Saulnier said.Mr. Stewart, on the phone from Los Angeles while tending to his birdbath, confessed to only a passing familiarity with punk \u2014 \u201cI listened to the angry, expletive-filled songs, and I enjoyed them\u201d \u2014 but said that the film\u2019s aesthetic aside, he was drawn to the \u201cdeep unease\u201d that \u201cGreen Room\u201d conjured in him.\u201cI didn\u2019t know the name Jeremy Saulnier, I had not heard of his previous film, I knew nothing about white supremacists in the Pacific Northwest \u2014 it was all brand-new to me,\u201d Mr. Stewart said. \u201cBut I sat down at my house in rural West Oxfordshire, and I had read about 35 pages of Jeremy\u2019s script when I put it aside, got up and went all around my house checking that the doors and windows were locked.

{"Headline": "How Argentina Settled a Billion-Dollar Debt Dispute With Hedge Funds", "Date": "2016-04-25", "News": "Supported byThe Waldorf Astoria hotel in Manhattan has long been a location for secret diplomacy, but few meetings there would have seemed as unlikely as the one that took place one day in early December.In a hotel conference room, a top Argentine politician drank coffee with two hedge fund executives \u2014 a meeting that was nothing short of remarkable after more than a decade of bitter legal skirmishes between Argentina and a group of disgruntled debt holders who at one point seized an Argentine Navy ship. The previous Buenos Aires government reviled the hedge funds as \u201cvultures.\u201dLast week, Argentina successfully sold $16.5 billion in bonds to international investors, a record amount for any developing country. And on Friday, Elliott and the other bondholders finally received their reward in the form of billions of dollars in repayment, representing returns worth multiple times their original investments.\u201cToday, we have put a definitive close to this chapter,\u201d Alfonso Prat-Gay, Argentina\u2019s economic minister, told an Argentine radio station on Friday.The negotiations that led to the deal were set in motion by the election in November of President Mauricio Macri, who ran on a promise to reignite Argentina\u2019s flailing economy. Striking a deal with the country\u2019s aggrieved bondholders was central to getting that done.How Argentina and the hedge funds were able to break the long stalemate and reach a deal in a matter of weeks is a story of furious back-channeling and clashes that nearly derailed an agreement. Details of those negotiations have emerged from interviews with eight people who were involved in those meetings, as well as court filings and emails reviewed by The New York Times. Many of those people spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.There were moments when the talks nearly fell apart. Three days before a deal was signed with Elliott, Mr. Caputo, exasperated by a back-and-forth with bondholders over whether they would return government assets they had seized, emailed the court-appointed mediator: \u201cTHIS IS A JOKE; NO DEAL.\u201dThat mediator, Daniel Pollack \u2014 who had not previously met Mr. Pollock at Elliott \u2014 was appointed by the court in June 2014 and played a central role in the final negotiations.Indeed, hours before his December assignation with the Elliott executives, Mr. Caputo had been just a few blocks down Park Avenue at the offices of the McCarter & English law firm. There, he introduced himself to Mr. Pollack, a prominent trial lawyer best known for arguing two landmark mutual fund cases before the United States Supreme Court in 1979 and 1983.Mediating in closed-door negotiations, Mr. Pollack cajoled both sides, at times resorting to theatrical moves like getting a court order to summon Mr. Singer, the founder of Elliott, to his office.Mr. Pollack\u2019s rule of no pens and paper during crucial negotiations frustrated some, with two hedge fund managers complaining privately that the mediator was an obstacle to the settlement process.Others spoke highly of Mr. Pollack\u2019s ability to get a deal in a matter of weeks.\u201cYou have to give Dan Pollack immense credit for creating an environment where, if they wanted to, they could get together and have a discussion,\u201d said Michael Straus, a principal at Montreux Partners and one of the first in the group originally led by NML Capital, a unit of Elliott, to sign a deal.Despite the groundwork that had been laid, formal negotiations got off to a rocky start.At a news conference in Davos, President Macri had insisted that Argentina\u2019s proposal would be made public.So on Feb. 1, when Argentine officials presented an informal agreement to a group of six hedge funds \u2014 Elliott\u2019s NML Capital unit, Aurelius Capital Management, EM Ltd., Montreux Partners, Bracebridge Capital and Davidson Kempner \u2014 several people in the room loudly protested the public approach.But two of the firms, Montreux Partners and EM, accepted Argentina\u2019s proposal. EM\u2019s deal, which was signed by its lawyer, Kenneth E. Johns, had been written out on a piece of notepad paper.Argentina struck another deal that same week to pay $1.35 billion to a group of Italian investors who were holding defaulted bonds. The other four main bondholders instead submitted a document outlining their terms and the conditions of any agreement.Undeterred, on Feb. 5, Argentina publicly announced an offer to pay $6.5 billion to the holdout bondholders.\u201cAfter a 15-year legal battle we\u2019re going to agree to a long-form napkin?\u201d Mr. Pollock said in an interview, referring to the deal with Montreux Partners and explaining the initial reluctance. He added that he had a duty to his investors to negotiate something more secure.The core group of bondholders, led by NML, remained obstinate.In a recent interview, Mr. Pollack, the mediator, said that the bondholders had wanted to turn negotiations into a complex debt restructuring, while he argued that a business transaction would be simpler. The holdouts were deeply cynical, he recalled.Argentina\u2019s recent history was still fresh on their minds. The populist administration of Mr. Macri\u2019s predecessor, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, had an economy minister with Marxist leanings who lectured bondholders that they would never get more than 30 cents for every dollar of their bonds.\u201cIf you are at war long enough, it\u2019s very difficult to shift to a mode of peace,\u201d Mr. Pollack said.Concerned that they would not be able to get a deal with the conditions they wanted, one Elliott executive met with Mr. Mindlin on Feb. 17 in New York and expressed his concerns over dinner. The following day, Mr. Mindlin spoke with Mario Quintana, the secretary of the government\u2019s economic cabinet. Argentina representatives met with bondholders later that day.On Feb. 19, Judge Thomas P. Griesa of Federal District Court in Manhattan, who presided over the dispute in the courts, dealt a blow to the remaining holdouts by agreeing to lift an injunction that prevented Argentina from making any bond payments or raising new money.Two days earlier, Mr. Pollack, the mediator, requested that Judge Griesa sign an order summoning Mr. Pollock and Mr. Singer of Elliott to his offices.On Friday, Argentina paid all of the holdout creditors who had agreed to deals \u2014 a total of $9.3 billion, the economy ministry said. Elliott received $2.4 billion, a 392 percent return on the original value of the bonds, according to the ministry.Writing to Elliott employees hours later, Mr. Singer thanked them for \u201cpersisting through this lengthy, complicated and contentious process.\u201dAn article on Monday about the settlement between Argentina and a group of disgruntled debt holders referred incorrectly to the returns received by hedge funds holding defaulted bonds. They were in the hundreds of percentage points, not hundreds of times, their original investments.Jonathan Gilbert contributed reporting from Buenos Aires.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inquiry of Mayor de Blasio Fund-Raising Extends to \u201914 State Senate Races", "Date": "2016-04-19", "News": "Supported byThe federal investigation of Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s campaign fund-raising apparatus has expanded to focus on efforts to raise money for Democratic candidates for the State Senate in 2014, when the party was battling to retake the chamber, according to people with knowledge of grand jury subpoenas issued in the inquiry.Earlier this week, federal agents and local investigators served state grand jury subpoenas for records related to fund-raising on behalf of Democratic candidates who were in the midst of half a dozen hotly contested races that year, two of the people said. In the end, the Senate remained in Republican control.Several of the Democratic candidates themselves were among those contacted by Federal Bureau of Investigation agents and investigators working with prosecutors from the office of the Manhattan district attorney. The agents and investigators contacted some of the candidates to serve the subpoenas and, in some cases, conduct interviews, the people said.Mr. de Blasio made retaking the chamber a priority in 2014 and personally solicited contributions for his fellow Democrats in Senate races as part of that effort. There is no indication that Mr. de Blasio is a target of the inquiry. Spokesmen for his re-election campaign and the city\u2019s Law Department declined to say whether they had received subpoenas.Prosecutors are focused on whether there was an effort to evade campaign contribution limits. They are trying to determine whether contributions solicited by the mayor went to smaller county committees with the intention that they then be passed on to candidates in the contested races, the two people said. Those county committees have no limits on campaign contributions from individuals, groups or companies, but candidates\u2019 committees do.In addition to the focus on the Senate campaign, federal authorities are continuing their investigation of the fund-raising of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s mayoral campaign. On Monday, F.B.I. agents and state investigators made an early morning visit to the Brooklyn home of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s former finance director, Ross A. Offinger, two other people said.Mr. Offinger was not home, and it was unclear whether the agents had intended to serve him with a subpoena. He declined to comment through a spokesman.The corruption investigation came to light two weeks ago. Initially a largely federal effort, it has centered on the activities of two businessmen, Jona Rechnitz and Jeremy Reichberg. Mr. Rechnitz raised money for the mayor\u2019s election in 2013, and he and his wife also made personal donations. That inquiry is being conducted by federal prosecutors in Manhattan, the F.B.I., and the city\u2019s Investigation Department. Those agencies, and the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office, all declined to comment.The subpoenas issued this week, the people said, sought all communications with the mayor\u2019s office and documents regarding solicitations, donors and donations to the Campaign for One New York, a nonprofit group that supported the mayor\u2019s agenda. Mr. Offinger had served as the group\u2019s finance director.The group, which Mr. de Blasio shut down last month, has drawn the ire of government watchdog groups, which said it created \u201ca shadow government\u201d of lobbyists and businesses with interests before city government. Mr. Rechnitz donated $50,000 to the group through a company he controls, and Mr. Reichberg held a fund-raiser for the group. A spokesman for the Campaign for One New York also declined to say whether it had received a subpoena.Investigators were initially focused on whether Mr. Rechnitz and Mr. Reichberg received some favorable city action \u2014 or a promise of some action \u2014 in exchange for their financial support, people briefed on that case have said, but it was not immediately clear what that action might be.As part of the investigation into Mr. Rechnitz and Mr. Reichberg, F.B.I. agents and Internal Affairs investigators in the New York Police Department have questioned roughly two dozen police officials who were suspected of taking gifts and trips from the men, people briefed on the matter have said. Nine mostly senior police officials have been transferred or placed on administrative duty as a result of the inquiry. As part of the investigation, a member of a volunteer security patrol in Borough Park, Brooklyn, was charged with bribery on Monday after being accused of offering cash to police officials in exchange for handgun licenses.Mr. de Blasio, fresh off his 2013 mayoral election, became involved in the 2014 State Senate battle when he saw an opportunity for Democrats to take control of the chamber, which had been in the hands of Republicans. A Democrat-controlled Senate, the logic went, would be more sympathetic to the city\u2019s financial needs.Mr. de Blasio was stepping into a vacuum left by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who had agreed to help fellow Democrats regain control of the chamber \u2014 as opposed to standing on the sidelines as he had in 2012 \u2014 but ended up doing little to help Democratic candidates. Still, in the end, the Republicans held on to their majority.An article on Wednesday about the broadening of a federal investigation into Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s campaign fund-raising apparatus to focus on efforts to raise money for Democratic candidates for the State Senate in 2014, using information from the New York Police Department, misstated the number of police officials who have been transferred or placed on administrative leave. It is nine, not eight.Michael M. Grynbaum contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iceland\u2019s Prime Minister Steps Down Amid Panama Papers Scandal", "Date": "2016-04-05", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 The revelation of vast wealth hidden by politicians and powerful figures across the globe set off criminal investigations on at least two continents on Tuesday, forced leaders from Europe to Asia to beat back calls for their removal and claimed its first political casualty \u2014 pressuring the prime minister of Iceland to step down.Public outrage over millions of documents leaked from a boutique Panamanian law firm \u2014 now known as the Panama Papers \u2014 wrenched attention away from wars and humanitarian crises, as harsh new light was shed on the elaborate ways wealthy people hide money in secretive shell companies and offshore tax shelters.The repercussions have come quickly. In Iceland, Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson, confronted by demands for his resignation after documents revealing that he and his wealthy wife had set up a company in the British Virgin Islands led to accusations of a conflict of interest, asked his deputy to take over on Tuesday.In Britain, Prime Minister David Cameron faced calls for a government inquiry and accusations of bald hypocrisy by championing financial transparency \u2014 when the leaks showed that his family held undisclosed wealth in tax havens offshore.In Pakistan, where roughly 20 percent of the population live on less than $1.25 a day, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif angrily rebuffed opposition calls to resign, defended his riches as legally acquired, and demanded that his opponents back up their allegations of wrongdoing. His daughter said on Twitter to critics: \u201cprove or apologize.\u201dOfficials in France, Germany, Austria and South Korea said they were beginning investigations into possible malfeasance, from money laundering to tax evasion. France\u2019s finance minister, Michel Sapin, told Parliament the government was putting Panama back on a blacklist of havens for tax evaders.In China, where the figures identified in the leaked papers include a brother-in-law of President Xi Jinping, the government denounced reports about them as a groundless attack. Its media censors purged mentions of Panama and blocked Internet search inquiries with that word.And in Russia, where officials also dismissed the leaked documents as a baseless political attack on Mr. Putin, the prosecutor general\u2019s office said Tuesday it would look into the reports that high-profile Russian individuals were beneficiaries of offshore companies.The ripple effects from the documents extended across continents, from a West African diamond mogul to relatives of a former South Korean president and soccer celebrities in Latin America. Even the Chilean head of Transparency International, a prominent anticorruption advocacy group, was forced to step down after his name appeared in the leaked papers as an agent for offshore companies in the Bahamas.None of the published leaks have identified American officials so far. Nor do they necessarily show evidence of crimes. But anger and reproach about the revelations have started to swell nonetheless.\u201cCorruption, whether private or public, is enabled by secrecy,\u201d said John Marti, a former federal prosecutor who is a partner at the international law firm Dorsey and Whitney, based in New York. The revelations, he said, are \u201ckind of pulling back the curtain on the secrecy that exists.\u201dPresident Obama, while not commenting directly on the leaked documents, said money shielded by tax avoidance \u201cis a huge problem\u201d and could be in the trillions of dollars.\u201cA lot of this stuff is legal, not illegal,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cAnd unless the United States and other countries lead by example in closing some of these loopholes and provisions, then in many cases you can trace what\u2019s taking place but you can\u2019t stop it.\u201dGabriel Zucman, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and the author of \u201cThe Hidden Wealth of Nations,\u201d said in an interview with National Public Radio that the Panamanian law firm represents a fraction of the total in riches obscured from public scrutiny.\u201cYou know, it\u2019s just one firm in one tax haven, and there is much more going on,\u201d Mr. Zucman said, calculating that about 8 percent of the world\u2019s financial wealth is held in tax havens. \u201cSo that\u2019s about $7.6 trillion today, a huge amount of wealth.\u201dIt was not immediately clear how Mr. Gunnlaugsson\u2019s decision to step aside would affect Iceland, a tiny island nation of 323,000 that is still recovering from the global financial crisis eight years ago.In a reflection of the political turmoil and maneuvering that the Panama Papers have created, the prime minister\u2019s office issued a statement on Tuesday night saying that he had proposed stepping down in favor of his deputy \u201cfor an unspecified amount of time\u201d \u2014 as a sort of indefinite leave of absence \u2014 and not a formal resignation. It was unclear whether Mr. Gunnlaugsson, who would remain leader of his party, would succeed in his effort to avoid a formal resignation in the face of significant public anger.Mr. Gunnlaugsson had said that the leak contained no news, adding that he and his wife, Anna Sigurlaug Palsdottir, had not hidden their assets or avoided paying taxes.The controversy of the leaks was also loud in Britain, in part because it illustrated the outsize role of British-governed territories as tax havens.The leader of Britain\u2019s opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, called for an independent investigation into the tax affairs of all Britons linked to the Panama revelations \u2014 including Mr. Cameron\u2019s family \u2014 and for Britain to impose direct rule on its overseas territories and dependencies, if necessary, to get them to comply with British tax law.\u201cThe government needs to stop pussyfooting around on tax dodging,\u201d Mr. Corbyn said.The focus of anger in Britain centered on Mr. Cameron\u2019s late father, Ian, a stockbroker and investment manager, who was among those named as having used the Panamanian law firm to set up a company based in the British Virgin Islands, a British territory.While there was no suggestion of illegal activity, the overseas investment fund paid no British tax. The Labour Party wants to know if the prime minister retained any interest in the offshore fund, which Mr. Cameron denies, and wants him to publicize his tax returns.With economic inequality a growing political issue in Britain, Mr. Cameron\u2019s privileged upbringing and personal wealth make him vulnerable to such attacks, particularly at a time when his government is reducing spending on welfare payments to the poor.In a further embarrassment to Mr. Cameron, who has claimed leadership in the global fight to crack down on tax havens, the documents also reveal that Britain\u2019s self-governing overseas territories, especially the British Virgin Islands, proved a favored location for companies handled by Mossack Fonseca.The political temperature over the leaked documents has been rising in Britain since Monday, when, asked whether Mr. Cameron\u2019s family still had money offshore, his official spokeswoman, Helen Bower, described this as a \u201cprivate matter.\u201d Mr. Cameron\u2019s denial came only on Tuesday.Holding money offshore would not be illegal, providing interest earned was declared to the authorities. Despite saying that he is \u201cvery relaxed\u201d about calls to publish his tax returns, Mr. Cameron has not done so.Reports about the Cameron family\u2019s Panamanian connections first surfaced in 2012 when it emerged that Ian Cameron was a director of a fund established in Panama in 1982 called Blairmore Holdings, named after a family mansion in Scotland.The leaks have shown how the company used bearer shares, which do not identify owners by name, to conceal who was investing in Blairmore Holdings.Mr. Cameron said: \u201cI own no shares, no offshore trusts, no offshore funds, nothing like that.\u201d His office said later that neither he, his wife nor his children benefit from \u201cany offshore funds.\u201dSteven Erlanger and Stephen Castle reported from London, and Rick Gladstone from New York.

{"Headline": "Saudi Threat to Sell U.S. Assets Could Hurt, but Mostly the Saudis", "Date": "2016-04-19", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 If Saudi Arabia follows through on its recent threat to sell off its investments in the United States, the financial maneuver could be painful \u2014 mostly for Saudi Arabia.The kingdom has pumped some of its oil profits into the United States, acquiring billions of dollars in Treasury securities and investments that include a giant oil refinery in Port Arthur, Tex., and a $10 million stake in an Arkansas company that makes industrial lubricants.Such a fire sale might roil financial markets or cause problems for companies that lost funding, but experts say it is hard to imagine a significant or lasting impact on the American economy. Global investors continue to shovel money into the United States; if the Saudis go, the experts say, others will take their place.\u201cThe world is desperate to lend money to anybody that\u2019s credible at very low rates, so I don\u2019t see this as an issue at all,\u201d said Michael Pettis, a finance professor at Peking University who says that foreign divestment \u2014 by China or other nations \u2014 poses little threat to the American economy.However, a sell-off could be self-defeating for Saudi Arabia. The Port Arthur refinery highlights the cost of pulling back.The refinery is owned by Motiva Enterprises, a joint venture between Royal Dutch Shell and Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil giant. Aramco has a long history of investing in the United States, in part to facilitate the sale of Saudi oil to American consumers. Last month, Aramco announced a deal to take full ownership of the refinery, along with a network of 26 distribution terminals and the rights to sell fuel under the Shell brand name across a large swath of the United States, including Texas.The Saudis might be able to sell the refinery, but they would lose a strategic investment.There is no comprehensive public accounting of the Saudi government\u2019s investments in the United States, although American officials say $750 billion is a plausible figure.And the single largest chunk of that money is probably invested in Treasury securities.The Treasury Department says a group of 15 \u201coil-exporting\u201d nations including Saudi Arabia held a total of $281 billion in Treasuries in February, deposited either in the United States or in one of the 15 countries. That number may actually understate the Saudi government\u2019s holdings, however, because it does not include Treasury debt the kingdom may have deposited in other countries like Switzerland.Regardless, it is clear that Saudi Arabia\u2019s holdings are only a small share of the roughly $14 trillion in Treasury securities not held by the federal government. There\u2019s little doubt the Saudis could sell all of it, gradually, without causing a ripple in the market, experts say.\u201cI would guess that any reserve manager would be able to find a way to sell this amount in under a year without much of a ripple,\u201d said Stephen G. Cecchetti, a professor of international economics at Brandeis University.The Saudis could roil markets by offering discounts and selling quickly. But again, they would suffer most from such a sale.Their departure from the Treasury market would tend to put upward pressure on interest rates. Fewer buyers for the same pool of assets makes sellers try harder, and rates on Treasuries serve as a benchmark for a wide range of other borrowing costs. But the Federal Reserve could calibrate its management of interest rates to take account of those effects, essentially insulating the domestic economy.Louis Crandall, chief economist at the research firm Wrightson ICAP, described the likely consequences as \u201clots of short-term technical impacts, depending on how fast they did it, rather than fundamental problems.\u201d He noted that large movements in foreign Treasury holdings had become a fact of life for the Treasury market.The share of Treasuries held by foreign investors has climbed sharply over the last few decades, leading some experts to caution that any flagging of foreign appetites could increase borrowing costs both for the federal government and for American consumers and businesses.There is little danger from Treasury sales by a specific country, so long as foreign demand in aggregate remains strong. A broader sell-off could be more dangerous, but those worries have ebbed. The demand for Treasuries has seemed insatiable in recent years.Still, Francis E. Warnock, a professor at the University of Virginia and an expert on international economics, said there was a still a long-term risk.\u201cIf the Saudis do it, others might do it as well,\u201d Mr. Warnock said. \u201cTo me that\u2019s the bigger issue. If we\u2019re in a world where foreign governments think more carefully about holding U.S. assets, then we\u2019re in a very different world.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Outraged by Kansas Justices\u2019 Rulings, Republicans Seek to Reshape Court", "Date": "2016-04-01", "News": "Supported byTOPEKA, Kan. \u2014 Washington is locked in partisan warfare over control of the Supreme Court. But it is hardly the only place. Look at the states, where political attacks on judicial decisions are common and well-financed attack ads are starting to jar the once-sleepy elections for State Supreme Court seats.\u201cA political bullying tactic\u201d and \u201can assault on Kansas families, taxpayers and elected appropriators\u201d is how the president of the Senate, Susan Wagle, a Republican, responded to that ruling, which was based on requirements in the state Constitution. Mr. Brownback spoke darkly of an \u201cactivist Kansas Supreme Court.\u201dPartisan conflict over courts has erupted in many of the 38 states where justices are either directly elected or, as in Kansas, face periodic retention elections, without an opposing candidate. As conservatives in Washington try to preserve a majority on the federal Supreme Court, politically ascendant conservatives in several states are seeking to reshape courts that they consider to be overly liberal vestiges of eras past.Television spending in the election of two justices in Arkansas on March 1 reached $1.2 million, and candidates attacked as being too cozy with trial lawyers were defeated there, in part with money from outside business interests.On the other side, unions and plaintiffs\u2019 trial lawyer groups last year spent about $2.9 million in Pennsylvania on television ads that helped elect Democratic candidates to three Supreme Court seats.In Oklahoma, where the court is under attack for ruling that a Ten Commandments monument must be removed from the Capitol, bills are being considered that would give the governor and legislative leaders more control over the selection of justices. In Georgia, a Republican bill some described as \u201ccourt-packing,\u201d to increase the number of Supreme Court seats, has passed the General Assembly.Driving the conflict in Kansas is the recent dominance of conservative Republicans led by Mr. Brownback. Many legislators say the courts have overstepped their role by ruling that cuts in school funding violate the state Constitution\u2019s guarantee of a basic level of education.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to make political rulings, then you should be politically accountable,\u201d said Senator Dennis Pyle, a sponsor of the bill to broaden the grounds for impeachment.The impeachment bill is not likely to clear the Legislature this year, but Mr. Brownback is also pushing for an amendment that would give the governor more control over choosing new justices, who are now winnowed through a merit system.In response to the Supreme Court ultimatum, the Legislature last week passed a plan to give more money to the poorest districts. But the court is also expected to rule in coming months on the more intractable issue of whether the shrunken pool of money for all K-12 education is enough to meet minimum standards.Since Mr. Brownback took office, state aid has declined to $3,800 per pupil, from $4,400, according to the Kansas branch of the National Education Association. Because of the cuts, some rural districts have disbanded, some schools have closed and, last spring, six districts ended the school year days early to cut costs.All but one of the seven sitting Kansas justices were appointed by a Democrat, former Gov. Kathleen Sebelius, or by her predecessor, a moderate Republican.Mr. Brownback has condemned the existing system for choosing justices, in which a committee of five lawyers (selected by their peers) and four non-lawyers (appointed by the governor) provides candidates.\u201cI don\u2019t know how much more democratic you can get,\u201d he said of the retention elections that justices must face every six years.But Senator Jeff King, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said, \u201cI think we need to change our judicial selection process, absolutely.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t usually have a Supreme Court issuing rulings that affect 53 percent of the budget,\u201d he said of the clash over school funding.Charles G. Geyh, a professor at the Indiana University Maurer School of Law and the author of \u201cCourting Peril: The Political Transformation of the American Judiciary,\u201d warned that increasingly bitter, partisan battles threatened to undermine faith in the courts.\u201cWe need to get past the fiction that judges are umpires that just call balls and strikes,\u201d he said. \u201cIdeology will affect their decisions,\u201d he acknowledged, \u201cbut we need to give them some breathing room. They are not hijacking the law.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jianbing, a Chinese Crepe, Migrates to Manhattan", "Date": "2016-04-20", "News": "Supported bySinosphereFresh from China, they came ashore in the San Francisco Bay Area. They stormed Seattle. They descended on Portland, Ore.Now, they are sweeping across Manhattan, with sightings near Washington Square Park, Midtown and Columbia University.Resistance is futile.Jianbing, a street-food crepe from northern China made with eggs, chili and sweet sauce, cilantro, scallions and a crunchy deep-fried dough wafer, is Beijing\u2019s latest culinary flexing of soft power.Made in the ubiquitous street carts that dot Beijing, Tianjin and other northern Chinese cities, jianbing can be eaten on the go, doubling as a hand-warmer on those frigid days when the wind invades from Siberia. The going price in the more upscale sections of the Chinese capital now is about 5 renminbi, or 77 cents.Despite its humble origins, making jianbing is an art. Mess up the secret sauce \u2014 generally some combination of sweet sauce and bean paste \u2014 and it could overpower the crepe, dominating the chili, humbling the cilantro, running roughshod over the scallions.That is why Yolanda Lee and Dolkar Tsering, friends from Pace University in New York, spent months in northern China in late 2014 going from city to city. They sampled more than 100 kinds of jianbing, learning from the street-side masters, who, more often than not, were happy to offer advice.\u201cWe both gained 20 pounds after that,\u201d Ms. Lee said. \u201cNo joke.\u2019\u2019Ms. Lee, 25, a Beijing native who studied marketing and art history, and Ms. Tsering, 26, an ethnic Tibetan from Sichuan Province who studied finance, wanted to recreate the classic jianbing in New York, with a few modifications.\u201cWe initially wanted a very, very small restaurant, but obviously the rent in New York City is outrageous,\u201d Ms. Lee said. \u201cBut then I realized that a truck was a better idea, because jianbing was supposed to be sold on the street.\u201dThe travels of Ms. Lee and Ms. Tsering in northern China appear to have paid off. Their jianbing captures most of the flavors of their native land, and the crispy fritter shell, known as bao cui, is superior to many found in Beijing. It\u2019s crispier.The Flying Pig variety adds elements rarely found in China. For one, my two-egg version came with fresh lettuce. It takes a brave soul in Beijing to countenance having a food vendor on a dusty alleyway slip a raw vegetable of unknown origins inside a breakfast jianbing, regardless of intestinal fortitude, though that option is available from longtime Beijing jianbing-makers like Guo Xueping, who draws a crowd of regulars to her bike-powered cart in the Dongzhimen neighborhood.And, this being America, the Flying Pig jianbing is supersize. Forget eating this monster on the go. This is the S.U.V. of jianbing. It comes in a small box. You are even given a knife and fork. Eat one for lunch and give your stomach a rest for the remainder of the day. You won\u2019t be hungry come sundown.For this, Ms. Lee and Ms. Tsering say they are prisoners of the French crepe. The skillets that came with their truck were designed to make much bigger wrappings than the Beijing variety such as those made by Ms. Guo, though for an additional cost, she can throw in another egg or two.Ms. Lee and Ms. Tsering have also included a few specialty items on their menu. If the Beijing Original does not satisfy you, add pork belly, their specialty. A tuna-melt variety is $9.50. They even have a gluten-free jianbing.In a sign of the times, Ms. Lee said that she and Ms. Tsering had attracted Chinese investment. They plan to expand in the homeland with the Flying Pig\u2019s version in jianbing ground zero: Beijing. They will be able to market a crepe that has passed the rigors of New York City\u2019s Health Department. That is a selling point in China, where customers can never be sure of a street food\u2019s provenance.\u201cWe\u2019re focusing on food safety, making the entire production line transparent,\u201d Ms. Lee said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jacob Zuma Must Go", "Date": "2016-04-03", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorCAPE TOWN \u2014 On Thursday, the 11 judges of South Africa\u2019s Constitutional Court ruled unanimously that President Jacob G. Zuma had broken his oath of office. Mr. Zuma, the court found, had used his position to enrich himself and his family improperly, and had refused to abide by an earlier finding against him from the constitutionally mandated public protector. He had thus, said Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng, \u201cfailed to uphold, defend and respect the Constitution as the supreme law of the land.\u201dThe matter had been brought to the court by the two major opposition parties, the left-wing Economic Freedom Fighters and the right-of-center Democratic Alliance. They sought to compel the president to repay the state for nonessential spending on his private residence at Nkandla.In an address to the nation, Mr. Zuma responded that he respected the Constitution and the judgment; that he had acted \u201cin good faith\u201d in his faulty interpretation of the public protector\u2019s powers; and that he had been poorly advised regarding the overspending on his house. He pledged to repay the money, and apologized for the \u201cconfusion and frustration\u201d he had caused \u2014 though not for his unconstitutional actions.Yet it was not the self-enrichment (the precise extent of which is yet to be determined) that outraged South Africans so much as the lengths to which Mr. Zuma went to avoid accounting for it, and thus tried to sidestep checks on the abuse of executive power.Since he came to power in 2008, Mr. Zuma has combined a Putinesque mastery of the darker arts of statecraft with insouciance toward anything beside his own enrichment and impunity. In December, Mr. Zuma fired his respected finance minister, Nhlanhla Nene, for opposing questionable deals that would enrich Zuma cronies further. In the resulting market instability, the country\u2019s economy lost billions of dollars.Then, several respected members of his party, the African National Congress, came forward with allegations that an influential business family, the Guptas, had offered them cabinet posts on behalf of the president, in return for favors. At that point, Mr. Zuma\u2019s critics in the party began to assert themselves. Now the highest court in the land has wounded him further, and also censured the A.N.C.-dominated Parliament for failing to check the leader\u2019s abuses.South Africans can take heart from the judiciary\u2019s resolve against corruption and autocracy, but it is also a devastating indictment of post-apartheid governance. The judgment resets South African democracy to the precepts established by the 1996 Constitution during the presidency of Nelson Mandela.That Constitution called for a public protector, a watchdog with real teeth, to investigate complaints about the abuse of state power. In 2009, Mr. Zuma appointed to the position Thuli Madonsela, a lawyer and A.N.C. member who turned out to be a fearless crusader against corruption.When she found against Mr. Zuma over the Nkandla affair, however, the president simply ignored her, and set up his own inquiries to \u201csecond-guess\u201d her, as the court put it. Such was the ruling party\u2019s contempt for taxpayers that the police minister declared a chicken run to be a vital security feature of the president\u2019s home, and his swimming pool a fire precaution.Chief Justice Mogoeng is an evangelical lay preacher, and he reached for the Bible to explain in his ruling the public protector\u2019s role. Ms. Madonsela was, he said, the embodiment of impoverished ordinary people who do not have access to justice, \u201ca biblical David\u201d who represented the public against \u201cthe most powerful and very well-resourced Goliath\u201d of official corruption.Such language draws South Africans back to the struggle against apartheid. \u201cThe unchecked abuse of state power,\u201d the chief justice reminded us, \u201cwas virtually institutionalized during the apartheid era.\u201dMr. Zuma himself went to jail and into exile during that fight; now, he has been found guilty of institutionalizing similar abuse. It is hard to see how he can stay in office.The opposition parties have begun impeachment proceedings against him, but that strategy will fail: The A.N.C. has an outright majority in Parliament and tends to settle issues behind closed doors. The party could fire Mr. Zuma (as it did his predecessor, Thabo Mbeki, in 2008), but after the Constitutional Court judgment, officials insisted that the party would do no such thing, to avoid tearing itself apart.Keeping him in power, though, could have the same effect. Mr. Zuma secured control of the A.N.C. through intricate networks of patronage, but with local government elections due later in the year, a critical mass of his colleagues are finally viewing him as a liability. While Mr. Zuma remains popular in rural areas, especially his Zulu heartland, he is widely loathed in the cities. A powerful group of A.N.C. veterans, too, has called on him to go.With Mr. Zuma seemingly determined to hold onto power, the Economic Freedom Fighters\u2019 leader, Julius Malema, has threatened mass protests, violent if need be, to force him to quit. Despite such populist militancy, however, Mr. Malema has also now found success with a different kind of activism \u2014 initiating the Constitutional Court case. After the ruling, he waved a pocket-size copy of the Constitution at reporters, calling it \u201cour bible.\u201d He exclaimed, \u201cWe must all live by this book!\u201dIt remains to be seen how Mr. Malema \u2014 the leading beneficiary, politically, of last week\u2019s judgment \u2014 will reconcile his insurrectionary instincts with constitutionalism. For now, we South Africans who are committed to nonviolence and the democratic aspirations of the Mandela era have little choice but to join Mr. Malema in the streets. We will, at least, be asserting the agency that the Constitution vested in us, and that the court affirmed last week.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Man Arrested on Charges of Improperly Obtaining Handgun Licenses", "Date": "2016-04-18", "News": "Supported byThe man, Alex Lichtenstein, 44, was arrested on Sunday at his home in Pomona, N.Y., by agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and detectives from the Police Department\u2019s Internal Affairs Bureau, officials said. A criminal complaint unsealed on Monday in United States District Court in Manhattan charged him with bribery and conspiracy to commit bribery.Deputy Inspector Michael T. Endall, who heads the Police Department\u2019s License Division, was one of three men transferred from that division on Monday, a statement from the department said. Inspector Endall was reassigned to an administrative position pending further review; Sgt. David Villanueva and Officer Richard Ochetal were placed on modified assignment, and have also been transferred.Mr. Lichtenstein tried to bribe an officer to help him obtain pistol licenses, offering him $6,000 per license and telling him he had already obtained an estimated 150 permits over the last year through his connections at the License Division, a claim the officer secretly recorded, the complaint said.The allegations that the handgun licenses, particularly full- and limited-carry permits, which are difficult to obtain in New York City, were being sold as part of a corruption scheme has prompted a top-to-bottom review of the License Division, the police saidIn one instance, a man whose license application fee was paid for with Mr. Lichtenstein\u2019s credit card was approved for a full-carry permit in July 2013, despite a forgery arrest, four domestic violence complaints, three car accidents and 10 moving violations. They were all red flags that could have barred him from obtaining a permit. Months later, a complaint was made to the police that Mr. Lichtenstein used his connections to get the man a license despite his history of domestic violence, but it apparently was not investigated, the criminal complaint said.The case against Mr. Lichtenstein is being prosecuted by the same three assistant United States attorneys assigned to the fund-raising inquiry, Russell Capone, Martin Bell and Kan Nawaday. All are assigned to the Public Corruption Unit in the office of Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York.Mr. Lichtenstein came under scrutiny this month after he approached a police officer he knew and offered him cash to help him obtain gun licenses, the complaint said. The officer contacted the Internal Affairs Bureau and recorded a subsequent meeting with Mr. Lichtenstein, who was so nervous he patted the officer down, looking for a recording device, and telling him he would rather meet him \u201cin your underpants and undershirt.\u201dAfter offering the officer $6,000 per permit and estimating he had obtained 150 permits over the course of a year, Mr. Lichtenstein took out his calculator and multiplied $6,000 by 150, showing the officer that he stood to make $900,000 a year, the complaint said.The complaint said that Mr. Lichtenstein had previously dealt with the sergeant, who was not identified in the complaint, and that he told the officer he needed a new contact because the commander of the License Division got upset after hearing that Mr. Lichtenstein was \u201cbeing paid so much money.\u201d A person briefed on the matter said the sergeant was Sgt. Villanueva. The commander, Mr. Lichtenstein said, was concerned people would think he \u201chad his hand in the cookie pot.\u201dRoy Richter, the head of the police union that represents captains, deputy inspectors, inspectors and chiefs, defended Inspector Endall, saying he is \u201can honest cop who is sickened by what he reads in the federal complaint.\u201dMr. Lichtenstein, a member of the Shomrim, a volunteer Orthodox Jewish patrol society in Borough Park, was released on a personal recognizance bond of $500,000. During his arrest, two licensed firearms were taken away from Mr. Lichtenstein; on Monday, a magistrate judge, Henry Pitman of Federal District Court in Manhattan, ordered Mr. Lichtenstein to surrender all firearms, including a shotgun that was still in his possession.The mayor was asked about the arrest at the end of an unrelated news conference on Monday; Mr. de Blasio did not acknowledge the inquiry. Before that, he said that any person accused of wrongdoing \u201cshould suffer the consequences.\u201d\u201cI believe that anyone who does something wrong should suffer the consequences, as some of our police individual chiefs are at this point,\u201d he said.J.

{"Headline": "House Hunting in ... Ireland", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported byInternational Real Estate20 PhotosA FOUR-BEDROOM RESTORED FARMHOUSE ON TWO AND A HALF ACRES IN WEST CORK$678,000 (595,000 EUROS)This 150-year-old farmhouse in coastal southwest Ireland, with four bedrooms and two and a half baths, was carefully renovated in the early 2000s to enhance its rustic charms. The 2,500-square-foot property, set on two and a half acres, is in western County Cork, a region informally called West Cork. Within a 10-minute drive of Skibbereen, a town of roughly 2,000 with ample shopping and dining, the house is about a mile from the sea. It is just over an hour from the international airport in Cork, said Se\u00e1n Carmody, an agent with Charles McCarthy Estate Agents and Valuers, which has the listing.The main farmhouse, constructed from the traditional cement plaster over stone, is linked to the former milking parlor and pigsty by a wide, window-lined corridor that serves as both a living area and an entrance hall. The parlor and pigsty have been converted to a large kitchen and dining area, along with an adjoining studio/office with a separate entrance. All have underfloor heating. The house is being sold unfurnished, but individual pieces, such as the very large kitchen table, are negotiable.The kitchen is brightened by a skylight running lengthwise along a whitewashed vaulted ceiling. A striking elmwood arch frames a recessed AGA cast-iron stove. A stable-style door provides access to the private courtyard, which has raised flower beds and stone outbuildings.The living room has stained wooden floors and a wood-burning stove. Off the living room is a study with a fireplace flanked by floor-to-ceiling book shelves.All four bedrooms, on the second floor of the farmhouse, have vaulted ceilings. Three share the main bathroom, which has a separate shower cubicle.The master bedroom has French doors leading to a private balcony, which affords distant views of Mount Gabriel and, \u201con a very clear day,\u201d Roaringwater Bay, Mr. Carmody said. The master bath and dressing room are on the main floor, reached by way of a staircase. The bath has an open shower area, or wet room, and a heated towel rail.The surrounding grounds have mature gardens, stone walls, a paddock and a fruit enclosure that produces currants, blueberries and raspberries.While the nearby seaside villages in West Cork tend to be seasonal destinations, Skibbereen, on the River Ilen, has more of a year-round population, Mr. Carmody said. Something of a foodie\u2019s paradise, it hosts a weekly farmers\u2019 market, with locally raised organic meats, produce, and cheeses, as well as the annual Taste of West Cork Food Festival, to be held Sept. 9 to 18 this year. One of Ireland\u2019s better-known chefs, Carmel Somers, recently moved her restaurant and cooking school, Good Things Cafe, to a prominent downtown property.The West Cork Arts Center opened a 10,000-square-foot exhibition space in the town center last year: called the Uillinn, it has a gallery, artists\u2019 studios and a flexible performance space.The coastal areas closest to the house have coves, jetties and piers; big beaches are within 10 miles.MARKET OVERVIEWThe West Cork market began to rebound last year after an extended downturn that stretched from 2007 to 2014. At bottom, prices were off 60 percent from their peak, said Pat Maguire, the principal at Pat Maguire Properties, in Skibbereen. In 2015, as sales picked up, prices rose by about 10 percent to 15 percent. While they have leveled off some, Mr. Maguire predicted that values would likely climb another 5 percent this year.Irish buyers in West Cork are gravitating toward property in towns and villages, while non-Irish buyers tend to want more remote coastal properties, he said. Prices on and near the coast range from around 250,000 euros to upward of 1 million euros, or about $285,000 to $1.14 million.WHO BUYS IN WEST CORKBuyers from Britain are the main group driving the market at the moment. \u201cTheir perception of the quality of life here is very good,\u201d Mr. Maguire said, citing as reasons West Cork\u2019s \u201claid-back\u201d atmosphere, milder climate relative to more northerly locations, easy access to Cork airport, and value, especially compared with much of the British market.More foreign buyers are beginning to consider Ireland, Mr. Carmody noted. And West Cork\u2019s simpler way of life, as it is still largely rural, appeals to harried professionals from Dublin and London, he said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s the charm that really sells it.\u201dLast year, \u201cfor the first time in a long time,\u201d Mr. Maguire observed, Irish-Americans and Irish expatriates living in the United States began showing more interest in relocating to West Cork. American buyers are still scarce.BUYING BASICS Both the buyer and the seller typically hire a solicitor, a type of lawyer, to represent them, according to Liam O\u2019Donovan, a solicitor based in Skibbereen. Legal fees range from about 0.5 percent to 1 percent of the purchase price.The Irish government collects a stamp duty on all property transfers. The duty, paid by the buyer, is 1 percent of the purchase price up to a value of 1 million euros, or about $1.14 million, and 2 percent on any value above that.Both Mr. O\u2019Donovan and Mr. Maguire said foreign buyers might have a difficult time lining up sufficient financing with Irish banks. \u201cIt\u2019s better for non-Irish buyers to have the funding organized on their own side,\u201d Mr. Maguire said.WEBSITESWest Cork Tourism: westcork.ieLANGUAGES AND CURRENCYIrish, English; euro (1 euro = $1.14)TAXES AND FEESLocal property taxes on this home are approximately 1,035 euros, or about $1,180, annually, according to Mr. Carmody. In addition to stamp duty, land registry fees must be paid by the buyer; these range from 400 to 800 euros, or about $455 to $910, depending on the price of the property.CONTACTAdvertisement"}

This should be a wake-up call to leaders of both parties. They are missing something big about their own members\u2019 priorities, and their mood.

{"Headline": "Brazil Impeachment Debate Hinges on a Thorny Legal Question", "Date": "2016-04-19", "News": "Supported byBRAS\u00cdLIA \u2014 As she fights for her political life, President Dilma Rousseff has been tirelessly describing the drive to remove her from office as nothing less than a coup.In a country with bitter memories of military dictatorship \u2014 the most recent one having given way to civilian rule in 1985 \u2014 the word is especially fraught, and it has become a rallying cry that has energized supporters who are battling to stave off an impeachment trial in the Senate that could begin as early as next month.\u201cI am the victim of a process that is rooted in injustice, and legal and political fraud,\u201d she said during a news conference on Tuesday, two days after the lower house of Congress voted by a wide margin to approve an impeachment measure.The debate about removing her from office, which is convulsing a polarized nation, centers on a crucial question: Did she commit an impeachable offense?There is broad agreement that Ms. Rousseff\u2019s administration employed budgetary tricks to conceal a looming deficit and enhance her prospects during a bitterly fought re-election campaign in 2014.Experts say Ms. Rousseff\u2019s administration effectively borrowed some $11 billion from state banks, an amount equal to almost 1 percent of the economy, to fund popular social programs that have been a hallmark of the Workers Party\u2019s 13 years in power. These programs included payments to Brazil\u2019s poorest residents, credits to small farmers and the financing of homeownership for low-income families.But legal experts and constitutional scholars are divided over whether that action rises to the level of an offense that merits removal from office.\u201cThe government lied about the messy state of their house by putting up a pretty window,\u201d said Carlos Pereira, a political scientist at Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Get\u00falio Vargas, a leading Brazilian university. \u201cThe government betrayed the people, and for this they must be punished.\u201dBut the president\u2019s defenders say such fiscal irregularities do not qualify as a crime, the constitutional requirement that would allow the Senate to remove her from office if she is convicted after trial by a two-thirds majority.Pedro Serrano, a constitutional law scholar at Pontif\u00edcia Universidade Cat\u00f3lica de S\u00e3o Paulo, said Ms. Rousseff\u2019s enemies were using an overly broad interpretation of the law, a move that will harm the nation\u2019s young democracy.\u201cIn any civilized country in the world that has legal democratic institutions, such a punishment must be very narrowly interpreted,\u201d he said, referring to removal from office.Dilma Rousseff, Brazil\u2019s president, is facing removal from office. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the proceedings.Oscar Vilhena Vieira, a professor of constitutional law at Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Get\u00falio Vargas, said the law required that Congress approve changes to the annual budget, and prohibited the president from borrowing money from state-owned banks.\u201cThe nature of these crimes are administrative crimes,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are not penal crimes, so you cannot be put in prison because of them, but you can lose your mandate.\u201dHe added: \u201cIs it politically desirable for her to be impeached for that? It is up to Congress to decide. It is a political decision.\u201dThe practice used by Ms. Rousseff\u2019s administration, known as \u201cpedaladas fiscais,\u201d or pedaling fiscal obligations into the future, is illegal under a 16-year-old law that was designed to end the budgetary practices that had led to devastating bouts of hyperinflation in the 1980s.In the years since, the tactic of using money from state-owned banks to temporarily fund the government has been used by numerous elected officials, though no president has faced punishment for it until now.Andr\u00e9 Rehbein Sathler, an economist who works for the lower house, said Ms. Rousseff\u2019s administration broke the law by failing to reimburse the banks for these expenditures, a move he likened to printing money with abandon. The government did reimburse the banks after the election.\u201cDilma claims that other presidents did the same thing, but just because other people commit a crime doesn\u2019t justify your own crimes,\u201d he said.Ms. Rousseff\u2019s defenders say her opponents in Congress are cynically using the law to depose an unpopular president. Brazil is suffering through the worst recession since the 1930s, and an unfolding corruption scandal involving the national oil company, Petrobras, has infuriated the public with revelations that billions of dollars in kickbacks were funneled into the campaign coffers of powerful political parties.The scandal has implicated numerous political figures, including leading members of her own party, but so far Ms. Rousseff has not been accused of any wrongdoing in the case, although she was the chairwoman of Petrobras at the time the kickbacks were said to have taken place.On Tuesday, Ms. Rousseff sought to plead her case to an international audience, summoning members of the foreign news media to the Pal\u00e1cio do Planalto, the building that houses her offices. For more than an hour, she defended her fiscal policies and denied that she had broken the law. \u201cI\u2019m not a person who gets desperate, and will fight for my convictions,\u201d she said. \u201cI have fought for them my whole life.\u201dJos\u00e9 Murilo de Carvalho, a prominent historian, expressed sympathy for Ms. Rousseff\u2019s predicament, but said it was inaccurate to refer to the impeachment initiative as a coup. Until now, he said, the process has followed the law and has been subject to oversight by the nation\u2019s highest court.\u201cImpeachment is a very poor instrument for getting rid of a president because it\u2019s political,\u201d the professor said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have control of Congress, you can be impeached, even if the arguments are not so strong.\u201dVinod Sreeharsha contributed reporting from Rio de Janeiro, and Paula Moura contributed reporting from Bras\u00edlia.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Snoopy the Destroyer", "Date": "2016-04-11", "News": "Supported byHas Snoopy just doomed us to another severe financial crisis? Unfortunately, that\u2019s a real possibility, thanks to a bad judicial ruling that threatens a key part of financial reform.The episode showed that traditional financial regulation, which focuses on deposit-taking banks, is inadequate in the modern world. It\u2019s not just that anyone who borrows short term to finance risky investments \u2014 which is what Lehman did \u2014 creates the same kind of danger as a conventional bank. There\u2019s also a high degree of interconnectedness: A.I.G. wasn\u2019t a bank, but it was selling guarantees on financial assets, and fears that it might fail to honor those guarantees threatened to topple dominoes across the economy.Oh, and yes, the episode also showed that making the breakup of big banks the be-all and end-all of reform misses the point.What we need is regulation that limits the risks from nonbank institutions \u2014 and the 2010 financial reform tries to do just that. The way it does this is by allowing regulators to designate some firms \u201csystemically important,\u201d meaning that, like A.I.G., their failure or the prospect thereof could threaten financial stability. Once an institution is so designated, it is subject to extra oversight and regulation.What determines whether a firm is systemically important? There aren\u2019t any cut-and-dried rules \u2014 there can\u2019t be, because if there were, corporate lawyers would find ways to evade them. Instead, it\u2019s a judgment call. But financial giants that don\u2019t like being regulated are trying to use litigation to question those judgments.Which brings us to Snoopy, who has, for reasons I don\u2019t fully understand, long been the emblem of the insurance giant MetLife.It was a peculiar ruling. Judge Collyer repeatedly complained that the regulators had failed to do a cost-benefit analysis, which the law doesn\u2019t say they should do, and for good reason. Financial crises are, after all, rare but drastic events; it\u2019s unreasonable to expect regulators to game out in advance just how likely the next crisis is, or how it might play out, before imposing prudential standards. To demand that officials quantify the unquantifiable would, in effect, establish a strong presumption against any kind of protective measures.The federal government will appeal the MetLife ruling, but even if it wins the ruling may open the floodgates to a wave of challenges to financial reform. And that\u2019s the sense in which Snoopy may be setting us up for future disaster.It doesn\u2019t have to happen. As with so much else, this year\u2019s election is crucial. A Democrat in the White House would enforce the spirit as well as the letter of reform \u2014 and would also appoint judges sympathetic to that endeavor. A Republican, any Republican, would make every effort to undermine reform, even if he didn\u2019t manage an explicit repeal.Just to be clear, I\u2019m not saying that the 2010 financial reform was enough. The next crisis might come even if it remains intact. But the odds of crisis will be a lot higher if it falls apart.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Treasury Secretary at the Center of Obama\u2019s Most Pressing Policies", "Date": "2016-04-07", "News": "Supported byNo more.Mr. Lew is leading Mr. Obama\u2019s history-making re-engagement with Cuba as well as efforts to resolve Puerto Rico\u2019s financial crisis. And on Monday, he will deliver another administration policy manifesto \u2014 \u201cAmerica and the Global Economy: The Case for U.S. Leadership\u201d \u2014 at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, and in a 5,000-word essay in Foreign Affairs magazine.Those events, culminating with this week\u2019s surprisingly muscular tax clampdown and his own public relations efforts, have raised Mr. Lew\u2019s profile higher than any time since he became secretary three years ago. That has brought praise from Democrats, and harsh criticism from Republicans and some business groups, which say the Treasury is overreaching its authority and damaging the economy.Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a Republican economist, called the tax regulations \u201cadministrative attacks that raise the cost of capital\u201d at a time \u201cof chronic slow growth and poor productivity.\u201dMr. Lew succeeded Timothy F. Geithner, another self-effacing career public servant, but one who assumed national and international prominence in overseeing the Treasury during the most severe financial crisis since the Great Depression.Yet Mr. Lew, in an interview, bristled at the implication that until now his stewardship had been low-key.\u201cIf you look at any of the periods of the last three-plus years that I\u2019ve been secretary, there have been issues that have been high-profile issues at every point. There is a coincidence that there are a number of things happening at the same time now,\u201d he said.\u201cI can\u2019t tell you why some things get people\u2019s attention more than others, but there hasn\u2019t been a slow period in the time I\u2019ve been here,\u201d Mr. Lew added. \u201cIf anything, it\u2019s been surprising to me how intense it is and how nonstop the inbox is.\u201dHis outbox has included two previous rounds of anti-inversion regulations to stem corporate tax avoidance, in each of the last two years. Also: showdowns with congressional Republicans over the periodic need to raise the nation\u2019s debt limit; negotiating, unsuccessfully, with Republicans to overhaul the corporate tax code to close loopholes and lower tax rates; and enforcing economic sanctions \u2014 against countries, terrorist groups, individuals and companies \u2014 that have become a major tool of foreign policy in recent years.Even so, the widespread image of Mr. Lew has been that of a low-profile steward for a low-profile time, at least relative to the eventful first years of the Obama administration during a global recession and with the nation\u2019s financial, housing and auto sectors near collapse.Both of Mr. Obama\u2019s choices to head the Treasury \u2014 Mr. Lew, known as Jack, and Mr. Geithner \u2014 had r\u00e9sum\u00e9s long on jobs in government, not in finance, industry or elective office like many past secretaries. Both could chafe at the demands of political celebrity and a secretary\u2019s role as the public face of economic policy for the world\u2019s richest power.\u201cIt certainly is nothing I ever asked for,\u201d Mr. Lew said of his job, and broke into laughter. But Mr. Obama, who favors a tight inner circle, promoted him, Mr. Lew said, \u201cfor reasons that had to do with my own personal record and his relationship with me.\u201d\u201cTim and Jack are both old-school staffers at heart: They\u2019re willing to accept credit when it\u2019s given, but they won\u2019t seek it out,\u201d said Mark Patterson, who was chief of staff at the Treasury for Mr. Geithner and then briefly for Mr. Lew.Within the administration and among those who deal with the Treasury, Mr. Lew is seen as a cautious technocrat, with a grasp of issues and which levers to pull that reflects his experience over decades \u2014 as top adviser in the Reagan era to the House speaker, Thomas P. O\u2019Neill; budget director to both President Bill Clinton and Mr. Obama; deputy to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton; and Mr. Obama\u2019s White House chief of staff.That grasp of policy facts and Mr. Lew\u2019s intensity of argument have at times annoyed members of Congress in both parties. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, is not one of them \u2014 although, he said, \u201cWe\u2019ve had some spirited discussions about the budget sometimes.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s easy to see how the president feels very comfortable with Secretary Lew,\u201d Mr. Wyden said. \u201cHe\u2019s very knowledgeable on the substance, but he\u2019s been around politics enough so that he gets the intersection of politics and policy.\u201dThe secretary and the senator, who have known each other since Mr. Wyden served in the House and Mr. Lew advised Speaker O\u2019Neill, talk weekly about pending matters. So Mr. Wyden was among the few in Washington or corporate America who were not surprised by the regulations introduced this week against \u201cserial inverters\u201d like Allergan and foreign parent companies\u2019 \u201cearnings stripping\u201d their new American subsidiaries to reduce their American taxes. \u201cI like the approach,\u201d Mr. Wyden said.Tony Fratto, who was an adviser to all three Treasury secretaries of President George W. Bush, does not. He called the new regulations \u201ca horrible precedent\u201d stretching the Treasury\u2019s authority \u201cto the breaking point.\u201d But he had praise generally for Mr. Lew\u2019s tenure as Treasury secretary.\u201cIt\u2019s one of the two or three biggest jobs in the cabinet \u2014 you are going to be in the limelight. He is not a guy who seeks the limelight,\u201d Mr. Fratto said. What Mr. Lew does well, he added, is the quiet, behind-the-scenes work of reaching out to hear from all sides on issues: \u201cHaving worked for three Treasury secretaries, and knowing Geithner a little, I think Jack is probably the best of them.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chinese Housing Market Shakes Off a Slump", "Date": "2016-04-18", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 China\u2019s slowdown, which has cast a shadow over the global economy and worried investors around the world, stems in part from a deep slump in its crucial property market.Now that slump appears to be easing, as construction cranes return in some cities and real estate offices in some of the best neighborhoods fill up again with buying customers.Prices for new homes in the country\u2019s biggest cities are rising sharply, led by the southern boomtown of Shenzhen, where prices jumped a staggering 62 percent in March, compared with the same period a year earlier, according to official data released on Monday.The real estate resurgence comes as growth across the rest of the economy is slowing, providing a welcome and significant boost. Some economists estimate property accounts for as much as a quarter of China\u2019s gross domestic product.But the figures also provide more evidence that China is increasingly a two-track economy, something Premier Li Keqiang himself has nodded to, as the gap between winning and losing industries and regions has become increasingly pronounced.That raises the risk that the rebound is too narrow to be sustainable \u2014 it is concentrated in China\u2019s biggest and richest cities \u2014 and that it will not outgrow the huge oversupply of unsold homes that haunts China\u2019s smaller and farther-flung metropolises.The sharp price increases make it difficult for policy makers to justify further economic stimulus. They also raise the risk that the government could face complaints from urbanites getting priced out of the housing market.\u201cPeople living in major cities increasingly find property prices unaffordable,\u201d said Raymond Yeung, China economist at the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group.\u201cAlthough the pickup of the property sector helps stabilize economic growth, it will also restrain the central bank\u2019s appetite for further monetary policy easing,\u201d Mr. Yeung added.Analysts noted that the current uptick in prices had been helped by illegal financing, in which sales agents or other third parties provide loans to cover down payments. That practice recently prompted a crackdown by the authorities.The rebound has meant brisk business for people like Wu Chao, a manager at a branch office of Maitian, a popular Beijing real estate agency.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.In an interview on Monday at his sales office Shuangjing, an affluent area in central Beijing with a nice view of the main business district and a short walk to an international school, Mr. Wu explained some of the main reasons for the property price rally.Nearly all of the factors cited by Mr. Wu involved changes in or market reactions to government policy. Those included restrictions on home purchases in Beijing by nonresidents, the annual meeting last month of the national legislature, the official end of the one-child policy and recent central bank actions.Most wealthy Chinese prefer not to borrow for home purchases, settling the deals in cash instead. But Mr. Wu said a round of interest rate cuts had made mortgages increasingly attractive.\u201cEven very rich people sometimes would not pay the full amount,\u201d he said of this trend. \u201cThey will take advantage of loans to buy homes.\u201dStill, some economists doubt the recent rally can be sustained for much longer.Zhao Yang, the chief China economist at Nomura in Hong Kong, pointed to the huge supply of homes either still under construction or completed but unsold. He calculates that floor space under construction is enough to supply more than six years\u2019 worth of sales.\u201cThe sector still faces long-term destocking pressures,\u201d Mr. Zhao wrote on Monday in an email.A turnaround in the government\u2019s policy stance is also a factor, as it seeks to limit the risk that the market could deflate in a messy fashion.\u201cDuring this round of price surge, there are signs of bubble factors,\u201d Mr. Zhao wrote. \u201cThe government has started to roll out policies to rein in the increase of housing prices.\u201dOwen Guo contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Argentina Re-Enters International Bond Markets", "Date": "2016-04-18", "News": "Supported byBUENOS AIRES \u2014 Argentina returned to global bond markets on Monday after a 15-year hiatus, unveiling the biggest sovereign issuance by an emerging-market nation in two decades as the government ends a prolonged feud with hedge funds in New York.The country was receiving offers from investors for its sale of $10 billion to $15 billion of bonds. Most of the cash raised will go toward paying off a small number creditors, including the hedge fund billionaire Paul E. Singer, who had rejected restructuring offers and took Argentina to court seeking full payment after it defaulted in 2001.Although some investors remain cautious, the bonds are expected to attract broad interest. \u201cIt won\u2019t be very problematic for the government to get the $15 billion,\u201d Miguel Kiguel, an economist and former deputy finance secretary, wrote in El Cronista, a local business newspaper.Creditors accepted 70 to 75 percent of their claims in agreements earlier this year. The bond sale was expected to close on Tuesday, with the creditors receiving their money by Friday.Payment to the creditors is expected to total about $10.5 billion, ending a decade of mudslinging after the new government of President Mauricio Macri sought to reignite a sluggish economy with policies intended to lure foreign investors.\u201cThe issuance of external debt is likely to have a significant impact on the economy over the medium term,\u201d Edward Glossop, an economist who tracks Argentina for Capital Economics, an economic analysis firm in London, said in a research note.Argentina has included clauses in the new bonds intended to protect it from similar lawsuits in the future in the case of another default. If a majority of creditors agree to a restructuring, in theory everybody must conform.Even though investors look favorably on Mr. Macri\u2019s administration, Argentina is still viewed as risky. It therefore needs to pay higher rates on the bonds \u2014 about 7 to 9 percent \u2014 than some of its neighbors in Latin America have done in recent years.An article last Tuesday about Argentina\u2019s return to the bond market misstated the currencies in which bond sales were made in emerging markets. The bonds were sold in several currencies, not just the dollar. The article also misstated the amount of Mexico\u2019s bond sale in 1996. Mexico sold $18.1 billion of bonds, not $16 billion.Advertisement"}

Scholarships of up to $17,000 were available, it added. \u201cLetter in one day.\u201d The offer, by a college recruiter based in India, was part of a campaign so enticing that more than 300 students swiftly applied to a college that many had probably never heard of.More than 8,000 miles away, at Western Kentucky, professors were taken by surprise when they learned last fall of the aggressive recruitment effort, sponsored by their international enrollment office. Word began to spread here on campus that a potential flood of graduate students would arrive in the spring 2016 semester.The problem \u2014 or one of them \u2014 was that many of the students did not meet the university\u2019s standards, faculty members said, and administrators acknowledged.Western Kentucky\u2019s deal with the recruiting company, Global Tree Overseas Education Consultants, is a type of arrangement that is becoming more common as a thriving international educational consultancy industry casts a wide net in India and other countries, luring international students to United States colleges struggling to fill seats. The university agreed to pay Global Tree a commission of 15 percent of the first year\u2019s tuition of students who enrolled, or about $2,000 per student.But as colleges increasingly rely on these international recruiters, educators worry that students may be victimized by high-pressure sales tactics, and that universities are trading away academic standards by recruiting less qualified students who pay higher tuition.The university senate and the student government association also expressed concerns. \u201cIt is ethically wrong to bring students to the university and let them believe they can be successful when we have nothing in place to make sure they\u2019re successful,\u201d the student association president, Jay Todd Richey, said.With about 1,400 international students and a little more than 20,000 students over all, Western Kentucky, the state\u2019s third-largest public university, has been at the forefront of efforts by universities across the country to increase foreign enrollment. Its slogan is \u201cA leading American university with international reach.\u201dAdministrators say the India Pilot Project, as the recruitment effort is known here, is an experiment to increase enrollment and to diversify the international student body, and fits in with a previously announced plan to double international enrollment.They also say the students \u2014 57 of whom enrolled in January \u2014 were admitted conditionally and have been placed in remedial classes to help them adjust.\u201cInternational is good, but it\u2019s not always easy,\u201d Gary Ransdell, the university\u2019s president, said in an interview. \u201cIt can\u2019t be business as usual. We\u2019re learning that. There are growing pains.\u201dGlobal Tree\u2019s director, Subhakar Alapati, also acknowledged that the program had glitches, saying in a telephone interview, \u201cA problem with the students has arisen because the education system in India is more theoretical than practical.\u201dDr. Ransdell said the university had decided to recruit international students years ago to expose local students to global cultures. But recently, he said, the effort has become more of an economic necessity, partly because of drastic state funding cuts for higher education \u2014 a pattern seen across the country.To combat these cuts, colleges began to look at foreign students, who pay full tuition, as their financial salvation. And although federal law prohibits them from using recruiters in the United States who are paid based on the number of students they enroll, the law does not ban the use of such recruiters abroad.\u201cThe use of agents who are compensated in the form of bonus, commission or other incentive payment on the basis of the number of students recruited or enrolled creates an environment in which misrepresentation and conflicts of interests are unavoidable,\u201d the draft said.A major criticism of the recruiters is that their sales tactics can pressure students by creating a sense of urgency.Other international recruiting companies are also offering so-called \u201cspot admission\u201d or \u201cspot assessment\u201d to a variety of United States universities. One is Study Metro, in Bangalore, India, which posted notices on Facebook offering quick admission, seemingly to the University of Oklahoma, along with fast turnarounds on a document called the I-20, required to obtain a visa.\u201cDear Students, Study Metro invites you with open arms to make avail of the spot admission and I20 program on 31st Jan 2016,\u201d it adds. \u201cDon\u2019t miss the opportunity to fulfill your aspiring dream of studying in USA. Call now for FREE registration. First comes First served.\u201dAbhishek Bajaj, the managing director of Study Metro, said his company\u2019s reference to the University of Oklahoma was an error. Its client, he said, is the University of Central Oklahoma.He defended the urgent tone of the posting, saying that university representatives were in his office that day. \u201cThe urgency is to tell them this is a golden opportunity to meet,\u201d Mr. Bajaj said.Global Tree, the company working with Western Kentucky, also recently offered on Facebook \u201cspot assessment\u201d to \u201cworld top\u201d Purdue University, with a notice saying, \u201cLow Scores, Don\u2019t Worry.\u201d The smaller print reveals that the ad is for Purdue University Calumet, in Hammond, Ind., about 100 miles from the flagship campus in West Lafayette.After being notified about the Facebook posting, a spokesman for Purdue Calumet said the university was reviewing its relationship with Global Tree, calling the message \u201cunfortunate and disconcerting.\u201d\u201cWe do not lower the requirements for our international students,\u201d the spokesman, Wes Lukoshus, said.Global Tree\u2019s director, Mr. Alapati, said in the telephone interview that Purdue Calumet had approved its marketing materials in advance.\u201cThe families are going to pay to have their students flown here, but they\u2019re going to flunk out because they don\u2019t have the academic preparation, and then go home,\u201d Mr. Gough said. \u201cThat\u2019s not good.\u201dMr. Alapati said that Global Tree had dealt with Western Kentucky for years, but that the recent India project was the first time the university had sent its own employees \u201con site in India doing evaluations on the spot.\u201d The idea of \u201cspot admission\u201d was to eliminate long waiting times, he said.He recently visited Western Kentucky\u2019s computer science department, where most of the students enrolled. A professor told him that the students\u2019 knowledge was below that of second-year undergraduates. \u201cThe dean said the department is going to give extra help,\u201d Mr. Alapati said.Eric S. Reed, the interim dean of the graduate school, said that nearly all the conditionally admitted students were required to take language remediation classes, and that some were required to take \u201cdeficiency\u201d classes to teach them a necessary skill.One of the newer buildings on campus is the Honors College/International Center, a three-story, $22 million structure that houses the university\u2019s 17-member international staff.A large bronze globe dominates the atrium-style lobby.

But for those of us who denounce these prejudices, it\u2019s also important to acknowledge that there truly are dangerous strains of intolerance and extremism within the Islamic world \u2014 and for many of these, Saudi Arabia is the source.I\u2019m glad that President Obama is visiting Saudi Arabia, for engagement usually works better than isolation. But let\u2019s not let diplomatic niceties keep us from pointing to the insidious role that Saudi Arabia plays in sowing instability, and, for that matter, in tarnishing the image of Islam worldwide. The truth is that Saudi leaders do far more to damage Islam than Trump or Cruz can do, and we should be as ready to denounce their bigotry as Trump\u2019s.The much better reason to be concerned with Saudi Arabia is that it has promoted extremism, hatred, misogyny and the Sunni/Shiite divide that is now playing out in a Middle East civil war. Saudi Arabia should be renamed the Kingdom of Backwardness.As the land where Islam began, Saudi Arabia has enormous influence among Muslims worldwide. Its approach to Islam has special legitimacy, its clerics have great reach, its media spread its views worldwide and it finances madrasas in poor countries to sow hatred.To be blunt, Saudi Arabia legitimizes Islamic extremism and intolerance around the world.

The 4,500-seat stadium, Provident Bank Park, opened in June 2011.But Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, said that while assuring the public that no town money would be used to build the stadium, Mr. St. Lawrence and a co-defendant, \u201cthrough lies and accounting manipulations, found a way for the town to fund more than half of the $58 million it cost to build that stadium.\u201d\u201cThe defendants then filled the big hole opened up by these costs in the town\u2019s general fund with a series of fake accounting entries,\u201d Mr. Bharara added.Mr. Bharara said the prosecution was believed to be the first criminal securities fraud case brought against city officials in the United States for accounting fraud in connection with the sale of municipal bonds. \u201cBut I suspect that it will not be the last,\u201d he said.His remark underscored an eccentricity of America\u2019s $3.7 trillion municipal bond market, which state and local governments routinely tap to raise money for public works. It is lightly regulated, operating on a level of faith that can seem quaint, even out of date, in an age of increasingly sophisticated global markets.While the Securities and Exchange Commission is an active watchdog of companies that issue stocks and bonds, it has largely left state and local governments to police themselves. But as concerns about fraud and deceptive accounting have mounted, the agency has filed lawsuits against municipalities and states like New Jersey and Illinois, which have typically been resolved with cease-and-desist orders. The S.E.C. filed a lawsuit against Ramapo on Thursday, but the bringing of criminal charges by federal prosecutors suggested a change in the government\u2019s approach.The co-defendant, N. Aaron Troodler, was the executive director of the Ramapo Local Development Corporation, a nonprofit organization that undertook development initiatives in Ramapo.Each man was charged with securities fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy in connection with municipal bonds, according to an indictment unsealed in Federal District Court in White Plains.In one instance in 2013, the indictment said, Mr. St. Lawrence, after making a false statement to the town\u2019s bond rating service, urged town employees to carry out a refinancing of short-term debt as quickly as possible: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to all be magicians to get to some of those numbers.\u201dMr. St. Lawrence, 65, who was arrested at his home by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Mr. Troodler, 42, were each released on bond after court appearances on Thursday. Both men pleaded not guilty. A lawyer for Mr. St. Lawrence did not return a message seeking comment. Joseph G. Poluka, a lawyer for Mr. Troodler, declined to comment.Mr. St. Lawrence, Mr. Troodler, the town of Ramapo, the development corporation and two other defendants were also named in the lawsuit filed by the S.E.C.\u201cThe object of the fraud was to mask the deterioration of the town\u2019s primary operating fund,\u201d the lawsuit said.The stadium project was the subject of harsh criticism in 2012, when the state comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli, issued an audit that said town officials had \u201cinappropriately mingled the activities of the town\u201d and the development corporation.\u201cAn already stressed and struggling town will end up being harmed even more,\u201d Mr. Bharara said.Advertisement"}

Shireman, NASA\u2019s manager for the space station program, said during a news conference on Thursday.Forecasts call for a 90 percent chance of favorable weather.SpaceX, founded by Elon Musk, a tech entrepreneur, revamped the design of the strut and its manufacturing process; it now individually tests every strut to ensure that each meets strength requirements.For Friday\u2019s launch, SpaceX will again try to land the booster, on a floating platform instead of on land. So far, SpaceX is 0-for-4 in landing attempts at sea. Each time, the booster has reached the platform, but then toppled over and exploded.\u201cI certainly hope we will nail the landing this time,\u201d said Hans Koenigsmann, SpaceX\u2019s vice president for flight reliability.If launched on Friday, the Dragon capsule on top of the Falcon 9 rocket will arrive at the space station on Sunday. Plans are for it to stay at the space station until May, and then return to Earth carrying experimental samples including blood samples of Scott Kelly, the NASA astronaut who returned to Earth last month after nearly a year in space.Among the nearly 7,000 pounds of supplies, equipment and experiments packed in the Dragon are seeds that will be grown on the space station. Last year for the first time, station astronauts ate red romaine grown and harvested in orbit.This time, Chinese cabbage, chosen as the best growing and best tasting among tested vegetables, was added to the mix.Gioia D. Massa, the principal investigator of the experiment, said the research \u201cgives us a lot more information on how we can grow crops to provide supplemental nutrition to the astronauts as we start to do regular salad crop lettuce production on space station.\u201dOther experiments include an effort to track and catalog the variety of microbes living on the space station and a study of fungi in hopes that the weightless environment could spur them to produce novel compounds potentially useful as medicine.The payload also includes 25 students\u2019 experiments that were lost on the earlier SpaceX flight.The biggest piece will be the $17.8 million Bigelow Expandable Activity Module, or Beam. Unlike the other metal modules of the International Space Station, Beam has soft sides made of layers of materials including tough fabrics similar to those found in bulletproof vests. The soft sides allow the module to be packed into a tuna can-shape enclosure at the bottom of the Dragon capsule.A few weeks from now \u2014 exactly when has not yet been scheduled \u2014 the space station\u2019s robotic arm is to pluck the 3,100-pound module and attach it to a port on the space station.Fans will blow air from the rest of the station into Beam, pushing the walls outward to its final configuration, a cookie jar-like shape 12 feet long and 10.5 feet in diameter.During at least two years attached to the space station, sensors inside will take measurements like temperature, radiation, leakage of air, to gauge how well such structures perform.Bigelow Aerospace of North Las Vegas, Nev., has been pursuing an ambitious project developing expandable modules after licensing technology that NASA had developed in the 1990s then abandoned.Jason Crusan, director for advanced exploration systems at NASA, said the space agency has long been intrigued by expandable modules, especially for habitats on the surface on Mars, but the uncertainties of the technology made them less appealing.The Beam design incorporates much higher levels of safety than other parts of the space station, but the data could enable simpler, more cost effective designs in the future.Bigelow has also developed the B330, a much bigger module, with 20 times the volume of the Beam.The company intends to create private space stations that it could lease to companies, other countries or even NASA, but has slowed its work because there is currently no transportation other than Russian Soyuz rockets to take people to and from orbit.NASA is financing two companies, Boeing and SpaceX, to develop spacecraft to take astronauts to the space stations with the first flights as soon as 2017.If that occurs, Robert T. Bigelow, the founder and president, said he hoped to hook up two B330s together in orbit into a space station in 2020.\u201cWe are in the early phase of a new kind of spacecraft that offers a lot of promise,\u201d Mr. Bigelow said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "House Hunting in ... Ontario", "Date": "2016-04-20", "News": "Supported byInternational Real Estate18 PhotosA FOUR-BEDROOM VICTORIAN NEAR TORONTO$1.17 MILLION (1,499,900 CANADIAN DOLLARS)This four-bedroom Victorian house, built around 1876 in Unionville, a village in the Toronto suburbs, has served several purposes. Part of its ground floor was once a bank, and later the building was used as a boardinghouse and a creamery.A wide veranda stretches across the front of the house, which is about 3,000 square feet and painted pale yellow. The front door leads to an open foyer and a spacious living room with a fireplace. To the left of the fireplace, a doorway leads to the formal dining room, which has walls of Wedgwood blue.The kitchen, with a granite island and countertops, is past the dining room, through double glass doors. Next to the kitchen is a sunroom with a heated stone floor, which serves as the painting studio of the owner, Linda Fearnley. A family room, added in the 1960s, has a cast iron stove and doors that open onto the back deck. The backyard has a large lawn, chestnut and maple trees, and landscaping with native perennials.Stairs near the front door lead to the bedrooms. There\u2019s a half-bath under the stairs. On the second floor, the master bedroom has an en-suite bath with a claw foot bathtub and a separate shower. Its cabinetry came from a church, said Alanna English, a broker with Re/Max All-Stars Realty in Unionville, who has the listing. The second upstairs bathroom serves the other three bedrooms, including one in the converted attic.The home, on a quarter-acre lot, was renovated around 12 years ago, with upgrades to the kitchen, bathrooms and roof. The random-width pine plank floors and some of the windows and light fixtures are original.The house is in Unionville, a village in the Toronto suburbs within the city of Markham, which has about 350,000 residents. Nearby are a pond, which is sometimes used for skating in winter, Mrs. English said, and walking trails.The train station is about a five-minute drive, Mrs. English said. The trip to Union Station in Toronto (train at rush hours, bus at other times) is about 45 minutes. Restaurants and boutiques are a short walk away, and a large mall is a 10-minute drive, Ms. Fearnley said. The village has annual festivals, she added, and its streets are sometimes used for filming. Downtown Toronto is about 20 miles away; the international airport, about 25 miles.MARKET OVERVIEWIn the first quarter of 2016, 475 homes with prices starting at 2 million Canadian dollars, or about $1.56 million, were sold, compared with 259 in the same period last year, Mr. McLean said.According to a report from his organization, the number of sales over all was up 16 percent over the same period. The average selling price for all home types combined was up 12.1 percent year over year in March.Several factors are contributing to this strong market, he and other real estate agents said. Growing traffic congestion and the rising appeal of downtown living have led to increased demand for the city\u2019s center and its near suburbs. Low interest rates have made borrowing attractive. And international buyers are also creating demand, partly because of a weak Canadian dollar.According to Andy Taylor, a senior vice president of sales with the Toronto-based Sotheby\u2019s International Realty Canada, condominium prices per square foot start at 750 Canadian dollars, or around $585, and reach 2,000 Canadian dollars, or $1,560, for the top of the luxury market.In recent years, the ceiling for Toronto\u2019s luxury home prices has increased. Prices above 10 million Canadian dollars were \u201calmost nonexistent five or 10 years ago,\u201d Mr. Taylor said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a huge market here, but we\u2019re starting to see a lot more properties listed and selling above the 10 million mark.\u201d Most of those buyers are foreign, he added.Mrs. English said prospective home buyers were drawn to Markham because it has a good job market and good schools, train access to downtown Toronto and lower corporate and industrial tax rates than Toronto. The average price of a single-family home in Markham in March was just under 1.3 million Canadian dollars, or about $1.01 million, which was slightly higher than in Toronto, according to a report from the Toronto Real Estate Board.WHO BUYS IN TORONTOChinese buyers, once focused on Vancouver, started spilling over to Toronto about six or seven years ago in search of better values, Mr. Taylor said. That interest has continued to grow more recently, he added.Large estates in the central Bridle Path area and in Bayview Village, which is farther from the city\u2019s downtown, are both \u201chighly sought after\u201d by Chinese buyers, he said. Quality schools are \u201cprobably the number one factor that they look for,\u201d Mr. Taylor said.Mr. Taylor estimated that 20 percent to 30 percent of luxury single-family homes in the Rosedale, Forest Hill and Lawrence Park neighborhoods, where prices cost between 3 million and 5 million Canadian dollars ($2.34 million and $3.9 million), go to foreign buyers.BUYING BASICSOntario\u2019s real estate laws are similar to those of the United States, said Jerry B. Udell, a partner at the McTague Law Firm in Windsor, Ontario, who specializes in real estate.Buyers and sellers hire their own real estate lawyers, who function as notaries in Canada, Mr. Udell said. No additional notary is required, he said.Legal fees range from several hundred to several thousand dollars, depending on the complexity of the transaction and the scope of the work required.Denise Lash, the founder of Lash Condo Law, a Toronto condominium law firm, said the buyer\u2019s closing costs include land transfer taxes for the province of Ontario and the city of Toronto, both of which are calculated on a sliding scale based on the purchase price. For newly constructed homes and condominiums, there is a 13 percent Harmonized Sales Tax, also payable by the buyer, unless it is included in the purchase price, she said.Both lawyers recommended getting title insurance, which is not mandatory.It is \u201crelatively easy\u201d for foreign buyers with good credit to get financing in Canada, Mr. Udell said. Legal fees are higher, Ms. Lash said, if a buyer requires a mortgage.WEBSITESLANGUAGES AND CURRENCYEnglish, French; Canadian dollar (1 Canadian dollar = $0.78)TAXES AND FEESProperty taxes for this house in 2015 were approximately 5,300 Canadian dollars, or about $4,135.CONTACTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Cites Extramarital Affairs as Misuse of Power in Sheldon Silver Case", "Date": "2016-04-15", "News": "Supported byFederal prosecutors in Manhattan have evidence that Sheldon Silver, the former speaker of the New York Assembly, engaged in extramarital relationships with two women connected to his position in Albany, according to newly unsealed court documents.The women were not identified in the papers, which were released on Friday, but one of them lobbied Mr. Silver \u201con a regular basis on behalf of clients who had business before the state,\u201d the government said in a memorandum to a judge.In the case of the other woman, prosecutors said, Mr. Silver \u201cused his official position\u201d to help her get a state job, \u201cover which he exercised a particularly high level of control.\u201dThe government said it wanted to use evidence of the affairs at Mr. Silver\u2019s sentencing, most likely to counter testimonials from the defense that he was a man of good character, strong ethics and integrity. The alleged relationships also lent credence to the notion that the former speaker had long engaged in questionable behavior, using his influence to dole out preferential treatment in return for favors.The court papers added a new and unexpected dimension to Mr. Silver, a Democrat from the Lower East Side of Manhattan who became one of the most feared and powerful politicians in New York State. With one of the two women, for example, he kept a separate cellphone to talk primarily to her; it was not in his name and bills were not sent to him, the memo said.The allegations were in sealed court papers that federal prosecutors in Manhattan first presented to a judge last fall, in hopes of being allowed to use the material in Mr. Silver\u2019s trial on federal corruption charges.The judge, Valerie E. Caproni of Federal District Court, did not unseal the materials at the time, but the issue arose again after the trial ended, when the office of Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, asked to be allowed to use the materials at Mr. Silver\u2019s sentencing, which is scheduled for May 3.\u201cI view this as of a piece with the crimes for which Mr. Silver stands convicted,\u201d Judge Caproni said on Thursday in court, where she said she would unseal the materials. \u201cNot exactly the same; no one is suggesting a quid pro quo, but of a piece of a misuse of his public office, and that\u2019s why I think it\u2019s relevant.\u201dSteven F. Molo and Joel Cohen, lawyers for Mr. Silver, said on Friday morning after the release, \u201cThese are simply unproven and salacious allegations that have no place in this case or public discussion.\u201dManuel Ortega, a lawyer for one of the women, denied the government\u2019s assertion that his client had had an affair with Mr. Silver. He said the government\u2019s \u201cattempt at smearing the defendant with baseless allegations is not an attempt to seek justice, which is the prosecutor\u2019s obligation, but a way to publicly embarrass innocent families and innocent people.\u201dMr. Silver, the Assembly speaker for more than two decades, automatically forfeited his seat in the Legislature with his conviction, and faces up to 20 years in prison on six of the seven counts.In seeking to introduce the information last fall, prosecutors noted that after Mr. Silver was charged in January 2015, they had obtained \u201cnumerous recordings\u201d on which he could be heard.In one case, Mr. Silver is heard discussing state and private business with a woman, apparently the lobbyist, according to the memo, which is heavily redacted, making it at times difficult to determine which woman he is talking to.In the conversation, Mr. Silver and the woman discussed \u201ctheir desire to conceal the truth about their relationship from reporters inquiring about extramarital relationships,\u201d and how they should handle such inquiries, the government said.The woman told Mr. Silver that she had been trying to see him urgently because a reporter was calling state legislators, asking whether certain other legislators were having affairs, the memo said.Mr. Silver is heard responding, \u201cI don\u2019t think he caught us,\u201d but he also said that reporters had requested his travel and campaign finance records. He then expressed concern that those materials and telephone records \u201ccould reveal their relationship,\u201d prosecutors said.The memo says Mr. Silver said \u201cit was \u2018not safe\u2019 for them to be seen together, and that he did not see the press inquiries \u2018dissipating for a long time,\u2019\u201d the memo says.In one ruling also unsealed on Friday, Judge Caproni acknowledged that disclosure of the alleged relationships risked greater harm to the women than to Mr. Silver, given that they had not been connected to or named in the prosecution. But the judge ruled that the women were not \u201centirely \u2018innocent\u2019 third parties.\u201d She added, \u201cEach allegedly had an extramarital affair with a public official and then exploited her relationship with the public official for personal gain.\u201dJudge Caproni, in ordering the documents released, said on Thursday that the public had an interest \u201cin understanding the whole scenario,\u201d and in what she would be looking at to determine an appropriate sentence for Mr. Silver, who has been married to his wife, Rosa, for roughly 50 years. The allegations, she added, were \u201cnot one of his better moments.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It also remained unclear how much of a stake the French government, which owns a minority stake in Orange, would have retained if the takeover had been approved.\u201cIn a market where the possibility of consolidation is now ruled out for the long term, Bouygues Telecom will continue its stand-alone strategy,\u201d the company said in its statement.The proposed deal would have created one of France\u2019s largest telecom operators as the industry faces a cutthroat price war that has pitted Orange against upstart rivals like Iliad and Numericable-SFR.Orange has more than 260 million subscribers worldwide, including roughly 28 million in France, while Bouygues Telecom has 14 million customers, all in France.This is not the first time that Bouygues Telecom has been at the heart of takeover talks.Two years ago, the company failed to acquire SFR, another French carrier, in a lengthy takeover battle with Altice, the Amsterdam-listed cable company that controls the French cable operator Numericable.After Bouygues Telecom\u2019s failure to acquire SFR, analysts said that it did not have the financial muscle to compete against better-financed rivals, including Orange.That 2015 deal would have combined two of France\u2019s largest mobile providers \u2014 Numericable-SFR and Bouygues Telecom \u2014 to overtake Orange as France\u2019s largest cellphone company.Advertisement"}

The company also agreed to several concessions to appease driver concerns, including giving more information on how and why drivers are barred from using the app, as well as aiding in creating new \u201cdrivers associations\u201d in both states.\u201cImportantly, the case is being settled \u2014 not decided,\u201d Shannon Liss-Riordan, the attorney representing the drivers in the suit, said in a statement.\u201cThis case, however, with this significant payment of money, and attention that has been drawn to this issue, stands as a stern warning to companies who play fast and loose with classifying their work force as independent contractors,\u201d Ms. Liss-Riordan said.The settlement is a significant victory for Uber on the matter of its drivers\u2019 status. By keeping its drivers as contractors, the San Francisco-based company can keep its costs low. And while the settlement applies only to two states and is nonbinding elsewhere, the agreement and the changes that Uber is adopting may influence regulators in other places where the issue has surfaced.\u201cDrivers value their independence \u2014 the freedom to push a button rather than punch a clock, to use Uber and Lyft simultaneously, to drive most of the week or for just a few hours,\u201d Travis Kalanick, chief executive of Uber, said in a company blog post announcing the settlement.\u201cThat said, as Uber has grown \u2014 over 450,000 drivers use the app each month here in the U.S. \u2014 we haven\u2019t always done a good job working with drivers,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s time to change.\u201dThe settlement\u2019s changes are aimed at reducing points of contention for drivers. In the past, Uber has been able to boot drivers from its platform with little explanation, something that Uber said it would no longer be able to do. The company published a lengthy document detailing all the reasons a driver may be deactivated, from unsafe driving and carrying a firearm \u2014 which is prohibited \u2014 to using drugs and alcohol.Uber said it would also provide drivers with more information about their ratings system \u2014 a measurement based upon individual scores from passengers \u2014 and how ratings were calculated. The company is exploring creating an appeals process for Uber drivers who have been deactivated because of a low rating.Uber also agreed not to deactivate drivers who regularly decline to accept requests for rides from passengers, a practice that previously would contribute negatively to a driver\u2019s overall standing with the company. Instead, drivers may be temporarily logged out of the app and unable to accept new requests if they are \u201cconsistently not accepting trip requests.\u201d\u201cWe know that sometimes things come up that prevent you from accepting every trip request, but not accepting dispatches causes delays and degrades the reliability of the system,\u201d the company said in its newly published driver deactivation policy.Uber penalizes drivers who accept trips from riders and then cancel them shortly thereafter. Each city will have a maximum cancellation rate based on the average cancellation rate of the drivers in the area, the company said. It could eventually deactivate those who persistently exceed the rate.Uber said many of the changes were a part of its overall maturation process, as it has grown from a small start-up to a global organization in roughly six years.Yet many of the policy changes Uber announced as part of its settlement \u2014 particularly changes to its protocol on deactivating drivers over their cancellation and acceptance rates \u2014 appear designed to defuse the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments that Uber drivers should be classified as employees rather than independent contractors, as the company maintains.\u201cIt\u2019s a tweaking of the relationship to move the classification closer to the factors that define independent contractor and a little bit further away from factors that define employee.\u201dOther legal experts said that Uber drivers would appear to retain many of the characteristics of employees even under the company\u2019s proposed changes.For example, the fact that drivers whose acceptance rates are too low could be shut out of the app for short periods of time, and that those with unacceptably high cancellation rates could eventually be deactivated from the platform, may suggest a level of control that is normally reserved for employees rather than contractors.\u201cUltimately this is a deterrent to drivers actually refusing to accept trips,\u201d said Rachel Bien, an employment lawyer at Outten & Golden LLP who has litigated similar cases. \u201cIf it\u2019s the kind of business that needs a driver to be at a certain place at a certain time regularly, it\u2019s not a business that\u2019s suitable for independent contractors, who should have the freedom to choose which jobs they want to do and when they want to do them.\u201dMs. Bien also points out that unlike what is frequently the case with true contractors, Uber drivers will not be able to negotiate the price of the service they provide customers. They will also continue to be deactivated if their ratings from customers are low and don\u2019t improve.The proposal to create an association of drivers in California and Massachusetts that would meet with company officials quarterly to discuss issues of importance to drivers also raised eyebrows in some quarters.\u201cIf Uber is going to be genuine about this, I think it\u2019s a very, very good move forward,\u201d said Joesph Sandoval DeWolf, president of the California App-based Drivers Association, an organization that claims to represent more than 2,500 ride-sharing drivers in Southern California.But he expressed skepticism that this would be the case, saying that whenever the association has asked to meet with Uber to discuss drivers\u2019 concerns in recent years, it has been told that Uber will only meet with individual drivers, not any association representing them, which he said was not effective.Mike Isaac reported from San Francisco and Noam Scheiber from Washington.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "272 Slaves Were Sold to Save Georgetown. What Does It Owe Their Descendants?", "Date": "2016-04-16", "News": "Race/RelatedIn 1838, the Jesuit priests who ran the country\u2019s top Catholic university needed money to keep it alive. Now comes the task of making amends.Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The human cargo was loaded on ships at a bustling wharf in the nation\u2019s capital, destined for the plantations of the Deep South. Some slaves pleaded for rosaries as they were rounded up, praying for deliverance.But on this day, in the fall of 1838, no one was spared: not the 2-month-old baby and her mother, not the field hands, not the shoemaker and not Cornelius Hawkins, who was about 13 years old when he was forced onboard.Their panic and desperation would be mostly forgotten for more than a century. But this was no ordinary slave sale. The enslaved African-Americans had belonged to the nation\u2019s most prominent Jesuit priests. And they were sold, along with scores of others, to help secure the future of the premier Catholic institution of higher learning at the time, known today as Georgetown University.Some of that money helped to pay off the debts of the struggling college.Although the working group was established in August, it was student demonstrations at Georgetown in the fall that helped to galvanize alumni and gave new urgency to the administration\u2019s efforts.An alumnus, following the protest from afar, wondered if more needed to be done.That alumnus, Richard J. Cellini, the chief executive of a technology company and a practicing Catholic, was troubled that neither the Jesuits nor university officials had tried to trace the lives of the enslaved African-Americans or compensate their progeny.Mr. Cellini is an unlikely racial crusader. A white man, he admitted that he had never spent much time thinking about slavery or African-American history.But he said he could not stop thinking about the slaves, whose names had been in Georgetown\u2019s archives for decades.Dr. Rothman, the Georgetown historian, heard about Mr. Cellini\u2019s efforts and let him know that he and several of his students were also tracing the slaves. Soon, the two men and their teams were working on parallel tracks.What has emerged from their research, and that of other scholars, is a glimpse of an insular world dominated by priests who required their slaves to attend Mass for the sake of their salvation, but also whipped and sold some of them. The records describe runaways, harsh plantation conditions and the anguish voiced by some Jesuits over their participation in a system of forced servitude.\u201cA microcosm of the whole history of American slavery,\u201d Dr. Rothman said.The enslaved were grandmothers and grandfathers, carpenters and blacksmiths, pregnant women and anxious fathers, children and infants, who were fearful, bewildered and despairing as they saw their families and communities ripped apart by the sale of 1838.The researchers have used archival records to follow their footsteps, from the Jesuit plantations in Maryland, to the docks of New Orleans, to three plantations west and south of Baton Rouge, La.The hope was to eventually identify the slaves\u2019 descendants. By the end of December, one of Mr. Cellini\u2019s genealogists felt confident that she had found a strong test case: the family of the boy, Cornelius Hawkins.There are no surviving images of Cornelius, no letters or journals that offer a look into his last hours on a Jesuit plantation in Maryland.He was not yet five feet tall when he sailed onboard the Katharine Jackson, one of several vessels that carried the slaves to the port of New Orleans.The notation betrayed no hint of the turmoil on board. But priests at the Jesuit plantations recounted the panic and fear they witnessed when the slaves departed.Some children were sold without their parents, records show, and slaves were \u201cdragged off by force to the ship,\u201d the Rev. Thomas Lilly reported. Others, including two of Cornelius\u2019s uncles, ran away before they could be captured.But few were lucky enough to escape. The Rev. Peter Havermans wrote of an elderly woman who fell to her knees, begging to know what she had done to deserve such a fate, according to Robert Emmett Curran, a retired Georgetown historian who described eyewitness accounts of the sale in his research. Cornelius\u2019s extended family was split, with his aunt Nelly and her daughters shipped to one plantation, and his uncle James and his wife and children sent to another, records show.But the decision to sell virtually all of their enslaved African-Americans in the 1830s left some priests deeply troubled.They worried that new owners might not allow the slaves to practice their Catholic faith. They also knew that life on plantations in the Deep South was notoriously brutal, and feared that families might end up being separated and resold.\u201cIt would be better to suffer financial disaster than suffer the loss of our souls with the sale of the slaves,\u201d wrote the Rev. Jan Roothaan, who headed the Jesuits\u2019 international organization from Rome and was initially reluctant to authorize the sale.But he was persuaded to reconsider by several prominent Jesuits, including Father Mulledy, then the influential president of Georgetown who had overseen its expansion, and Father McSherry, who was in charge of the Jesuits\u2019 Maryland mission. (The two men would swap positions by 1838.)Mismanaged and inefficient, the Maryland plantations no longer offered a reliable source of income for Georgetown College, which had been founded in 1789. It would not survive, Father Mulledy feared, without an influx of cash.Father Mulledy promised his superiors that the slaves would continue to practice their religion. Families would not be separated. And the money raised by the sale would not be used to pay off debt or for operating expenses.None of those conditions were met, university officials said.Father Mulledy took most of the down payment he received from the sale \u2014 about $500,000 in today\u2019s dollars \u2014 and used it to help pay off the debts that Georgetown had incurred under his leadership.In the uproar that followed, he was called to Rome and reassigned.The next year, Pope Gregory XVI explicitly barred Catholics from engaging in \u201cthis traffic in Blacks \u2026 no matter what pretext or excuse.\u201dBut the pope\u2019s order, which did not explicitly address slave ownership or private sales like the one organized by the Jesuits, offered scant comfort to Cornelius and the other slaves.By the 1840s, word was trickling back to Washington that the slaves\u2019 new owners had broken their promises. Some slaves suffered at the hands of a cruel overseer.Father Van de Velde begged Jesuit leaders to send money for the construction of a church that would \u201cprovide for the salvation of those poor people, who are now utterly neglected.\u201dHe addressed his concerns to Father Mulledy, who three years earlier had returned to his post as president of Georgetown.There is no indication that he received any response.African-Americans are often a fleeting presence in the documents of the 1800s. Enslaved, marginalized and forced into illiteracy by laws that prohibited them from learning to read and write, many seem like ghosts who pass through this world without leaving a trace.After the sale, Cornelius vanishes from the public record until 1851 when his trail finally picks back up on a cotton plantation near Maringouin, La.His owner, Mr. Batey, had died, and Cornelius appeared on the plantation\u2019s inventory, which included 27 mules and horses, 32 hogs, two ox carts and scores of other slaves. He was valued at $900. (\u201cValuable Plantation and Negroes for Sale,\u201d read one newspaper advertisement in 1852.)The plantation would be sold again and again and again, records show, but Cornelius\u2019s family remained intact. In 1870, he appeared in the census for the first time. He was about 48 then, a father, a husband, a farm laborer and, finally, a free man.He might have disappeared from view again for a time, save for something few could have counted on: his deep, abiding faith. It was his Catholicism, born on the Jesuit plantations of his childhood, that would provide researchers with a road map to his descendants.Cornelius had originally been shipped to a plantation so far from a church that he had married in a civil ceremony. But six years after he appeared in the census, and about three decades after the birth of his first child, he renewed his wedding vows with the blessing of a priest.Ms. Crump, a retired television news anchor, was driving to Maringouin, her hometown, in early February when her cellphone rang. Mr. Cellini was on the line.She listened, stunned, as he told her about her great-great-grandfather, Cornelius Hawkins, who had labored on a plantation just a few miles from where she grew up.She found out about the Jesuits and Georgetown and the sea voyage to Louisiana. And she learned that Cornelius had worked the soil of a 2,800-acre estate that straddled the Bayou Maringouin.All of this was new to Ms. Crump, except for the name Cornelius \u2014 or Neely, as Cornelius was known.The name had been passed down from generation to generation in her family. Her great-uncle had the name, as did one of her cousins. Now, for the first time, Ms. Crump understood its origins.\u201cOh my God,\u201d she said. \u201cOh my God.\u201dShe prides herself on being unflappable. But the revelations about her lineage \u2014 and the church she grew up in \u2014 have unleashed a swirl of emotions.She is outraged that the church\u2019s leaders sanctioned the buying and selling of slaves, and that Georgetown profited from the sale of her ancestors. She feels great sadness as she envisions Cornelius as a young boy, torn from everything he knew.Meanwhile, Georgetown\u2019s working group has been weighing whether the university should apologize for profiting from slave labor, create a memorial to those enslaved and provide scholarships for their descendants, among other possibilities, said Dr. Rothman, the historian.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to know what could possibly reconcile a history like this,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat can you do to make amends?\u201dMs. Crump, 69, has been asking herself that question, too. She does not put much stock in what she describes as \u201ccasual institutional apologies.\u201d But she would like to see a scholarship program that would bring the slaves\u2019 descendants to Georgetown as students.And she would like to see Cornelius\u2019s name, and those of his parents and children, inscribed on a memorial on campus.Her ancestors, once amorphous and invisible, are finally taking shape in her mind. There is joy in that, she said, exhilaration even.\u201cNow they are real to me,\u201d she said, \u201cmore real every day.\u201dShe still wants to know more about Cornelius\u2019s beginnings, and about his life as a free man. But when Ms. Riffel, the genealogist, told her where she thought he was buried, Ms. Crump knew exactly where to go.The two women drove on the narrow roads that line the green, rippling sugar cane fields in Iberville Parish. There was no need for a map. They were heading to the only Catholic cemetery in Maringouin.They found the last physical marker of Cornelius\u2019s journey at the Immaculate Heart of Mary cemetery, where Ms. Crump\u2019s father, grandmother and great-grandfather are also buried.The worn gravestone had toppled, but the wording was plain: \u201cNeely Hawkins Died April 16, 1902.\u201dThe New York Times would like to hear from people who have done research into their genealogical history.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pennsylvania, Where Everyone Is \u2018Furious\u2019", "Date": "2016-04-26", "News": "Supported byReading, Pa. \u2014 KEITH MANDICH had been to this theater before, to see John Mellencamp.Now Mr. Mandich, a retired steelworker, was back in downtown Reading, Pa., to see another guy he thought of as a hero for working-class America: Senator Bernie Sanders.In his bid for the Democratic nomination, Mr. Sanders has nurtured vocal support from young, college-educated liberals. But he also has fervent support from people who remember the era of well-paying union jobs at manufacturing plants \u2014 and who are very aware of how far we are from that time.\u201cI just like Bernie because he\u2019s old like me,\u201d joked Mack Richards, 70, another retired steelworker at the Reading event.This time around, the fight for these voters has focused significantly on a somewhat unlikely contender for juiciest campaign issue: international trade deals and their repercussions.Any presidential candidate on the stump knows how to work a good metaphor into a speech, and Mr. Sanders knew to use the very ZIP code he was rallying in.He went on to list corporations, including the Dana Corporation, that had shut down plants in Reading and moved overseas.Kevin Wright, a high school physics teacher in line to see Mr. Sanders, saw parallels between the populism on the left and similar sentiments on the right.\u201cWe\u2019re the response to the Tea Party,\u201d he said.His sister, standing next to him, laughed nervously. \u201cCareful!\u201d she warned.\u201cThe Tea Party has taken over the Republican Party,\u201d Mr. Wright continued. \u201cI think our movement\u2019s stronger, and has more numbers, and is more rational and grounded in reality. And you can see that just based on the people here.\u201dThe crowd in Reading skewed a bit older than a typical Sanders rally \u2014 possibly because it took place on a weekday afternoon. Fritz Von Hummel, 55, a self-employed appliance technician who was laid off from his previous job in November, canceled a couple of appointments to come to the event. He said he had not had health insurance for the past seven years because he could not afford it, and he was eager to talk about the shortcomings of President Obama\u2019s signature health care law.\u201cI\u2019m just furious with the situation the way it is,\u201d he added.There was more fury elsewhere in Pennsylvania. Driving directly from a Bernie Sanders rally to a Donald Trump rally is an easy way to get political whiplash. The two candidates couldn\u2019t be further apart on the political spectrum. Mr. Sanders was introduced by a young undocumented student who tearfully spoke about wanting to come \u201cout of the shadows.\u201d Mr. Trump opened his rally at an expo center in Harrisburg with his familiar \u201cbuild that wall\u201d refrain.At both rallies, four similar grievances emerged among their supporters, over health care, Social Security, campaign finance and trade.At his rally in Harrisburg, Mr. Trump asserted that Harrisburg had lost nearly 40 percent of its manufacturing jobs since 2001, and pledged to bring back jobs from countries like Mexico, China, Japan, Vietnam and India.\u201cPennsylvania has taken harder hits on trade than just about anywhere else in the United States. Not good! The state of Pennsylvania has lost more than 35 percent of its manufacturing jobs since 2001. Not good,\u201d he said. \u201cMexico has been taking your companies like it\u2019s candy from a baby.\u201dAfter Mr. Trump\u2019s rally in Harrisburg let out, supporters clashed with protesters separated by a line of police officers. The two groups flung chants back and forth. From the pro-Trump side: \u201cBaby killers!\u201d \u201cBernie sucks!\u201d \u201cBuild that wall!\u201d And from the anti-Trump side: \u201cBlack lives matter!\u201d \u201cGo to college!\u201d \u201cGet more chants!\u201dJennifer Poole, a self-employed Trump supporter from Port Royal, Pa., couldn\u2019t get into the rally, so she watched him outside on her phone instead.\u201cI don\u2019t know what has made these people feel that Trump is racist and he\u2019s not, he\u2019s clearly not,\u201d Ms. Poole said. \u201cI was never a registered voter until now. I really believe that he can do great things and turn the world around. I really do.\u201dIn conversations with both Sanders and Trump supporters, the same questions kept coming up: What do you do if you\u2019re a middle-aged factory worker who has made a decent living for most of your life, only to see not only your job, but your entire industry, go up in smoke? Do you go to college? Take on a lower-paying job? Retire early? Or just hope that something better comes along, someday?Neither party seems to have a monopoly on the answers. Mr. Mandich, the Sanders supporter, said if it came down to a Trump-Clinton election in November, he would not vote for Mrs. Clinton.\u201cI probably would go for Donald Trump,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Weill has been known for his huge donations to East Coast institutions, including his alma mater, Cornell University.Now Mr. Weill, the former Citigroup chairman, plans to step up his philanthropy on the West Coast, where he and his wife, Joan, now spend much of their time.On Tuesday, the Weills plan to announce that they have given $185 million to the University of California, San Francisco to finance a new center for neuroscience research.The gift to the U.C.S.F., the biggest ever to the school, is also among the biggest ever by the Weills, who have sought over the years to make themselves known at least as much for their philanthropy as for Mr. Weill\u2019s business achievements.\u201cResearch on the brain, which is the most complex part of the human body, is far behind\u201d work done in other areas of medicine, Mr. Weill said in an interview in Sonoma. \u201cWe\u2019ve always liked to support the underdog.\u201dThe target of their latest gift isn\u2019t lacking for donations. Roughly 3 percent of U.C.S.F.\u2019s revenue comes from state funds; the bulk comes from grants by the National Institutes of Health or from private donors like Marc Benioff, the founder of Salesforce.com.To the Weills, backing research in neuroscience hits home. Mr. Weill said that his mother died of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and his father had symptoms of depression. Friends of the Weills have been afflicted with other disorders, including Parkinson\u2019s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease.\u201cWhen people had a mental illness, there was a stigma attached,\u201d Ms. Weill said, adding that it was important that such disorders be treated as medical diseases.Giving to U.C.S.F., one of the top-ranked neuroscience research centers in the United States, seems to have been part of a natural progression: Since last year, Mr. Weill has been the chairman of the school\u2019s executive council, a group that has helped the institution think about its long-term strategy.The money is intended to underpin an ambitious research effort. Their gift will help pay for a new 270,000-square-foot building at the university\u2019s Mission Bay campus that will house the neuroscience initiative. It is meant to emphasize what Mr. Weill called \u201cbench-to-bedside\u201d work, from laboratory research to patient care.\u201cIt will remove the completely artificial boundaries that we in academia use,\u201d Sam Hawgood, U.C.S.F.\u2019s chancellor, said of the donation. \u201cIt will transform and be a beacon for other programs in the country.\u201dYet giving to U.C.S.F. doesn\u2019t mean that Mr. Weill plans to abandon his longstanding ties to Weill Cornell. The two schools will begin an annual neuroscience symposium that will alternate between them.An article on Tuesday about a donation to the University of California, San Francisco from the former Citigroup chairman Sanford I. Weill and his wife, Joan, misstated the portion of the university\u2019s revenue that comes from state funds. It is 3 percent, not 97 percent.An earlier correction on this article misstated the name of Mr. Weill\u2019s wife. As the article noted, she is Joan, not Jane.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Breaking Ground Where Echoes of Edison Linger in New Jersey", "Date": "2016-04-05", "News": "Supported bySquare FeetWEST ORANGE, N.J. \u2014 The facade of Thomas Edison\u2019s last factory in this town crumbles behind a chain-link fence on Main Street. The dilapidated building sits on several acres of fallow land, a sharp contrast to its state in 1914, when it was just one piece of the American inventor\u2019s formidable manufacturing operation.In the last few weeks, workers have begun restoring the 400,000-square-foot Edison Storage Battery factory, the first step in a $230 million redevelopment project. Called Edison Village, it is intended to transform 21 acres in this New York City suburb into a neighborhood with shops, parking and housing.The start of construction brings a decade of setbacks to a close, despite lingering concerns from some residents that the project might not deliver on its promise of renewal.The second phase, with about 230 townhouses and 20,000 square feet of retail, which could include a small grocery store, according to the developer, will replace a CVS pharmacy and a Barton Press factory about a block from the battery factory.\u201cThis is a big opportunity for the downtown to see some rebirth,\u201d said West Orange\u2019s mayor, Robert D. Parisi. \u201cOld downtowns are struggling to survive in a modern world.\u201dThe town adopted a redevelopment plan for the area in 2003, and designated a redeveloper, Prism Capital Partners of Bloomfield, N.J., three years later. The original plan to build condos was derailed by the recession. The project hit another roadblock in 2012, when five West Orange residents filed a lawsuit challenging the town\u2019s decision to issue $6.3 million of municipal bonds to finance infrastructure improvements.Last December, the State Supreme Court upheld a lower-court ruling in favor of the town, clearing a path for redevelopment to begin. And in February, Prism secured a $70 million construction loan.Like many older American suburbs, West Orange struggles to draw visitors to its aging downtown. Its Main Street winds along a mile-and-a-half-long stretch of houses, municipal buildings and offices interspersed with pockets of disconnected retail. It makes for an unwieldy stroll.The plan\u2019s critics oppose using public money to finance a private development that might not deliver sufficient revenue to a middle-class community burdened with high property taxes. An influx of new residents could strain public schools and worsen traffic on a congested artery, they say.\u201cI shudder to think about the impact of a failed project,\u201d said Joe Krakoviak, a member of the town council and a critic of the plan.Edison Village\u2019s detractors argue that the approval process was opaque, leaving questions about the viability of the plan. Among the concerns are that Edison Village is not within walking distance of a train station, unlike similar projects in other New Jersey suburbs, and that the nearest stop for a bus to Manhattan is about a half-mile walk. Prism, though, says it plans to offer shuttle service to a train station.In its prime, the area around the factory, at Main Street and Lakeside Avenue, was a center of industry, not retail. At its peak, 10,000 workers toiled in dozens of buildings here. Around 850 of them worked in the four battery factory buildings, which made batteries for industrial uses like submarines and mining lamps.\u201cMany residents still tell me stories about their grandfathers who worked for Edison,\u201d said Joseph Fagan, a local historian. \u201cEdison helped place West Orange on the map.\u201dBut by the 1960s, many of the American inventor\u2019s businesses had been spun off. The businesses slowly failed, said Leonard DeGraaf, an archivist at the Thomas Edison National Historical Park. \u201cThat had an enormous impact on the community,\u201d he said. In the early 1970s, the factories were razed, except for the battery complex, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1996.Mr. Parisi, who grew up near the factories and still lives in the neighborhood, remembers gathering with neighbors on the street as a young boy to watch the buildings implode. For days afterward, he and his friends climbed through the rubble, scouring for remnants of Edison\u2019s inventions and finding some of the wax cylinders that had been used for phonographs.Edison Village, with grounds open to the public during the day, is intended to usher into the downtown the new era of the American urban center. New retail will open in about a year and a half, bringing coffee shops and restaurants to a drab block that faces an auto body shop, a bar and some houses.The Edison factory, which will house nearly all of the apartments, will open in about two and a half years. Planned building renovations include restoring the facade and replacing the roughly 800 windows that wrap around the buildings, offering views of the neighboring brick laboratory and, in the distance, the New York City skyline.The complex will have a pool, a fitness center and 20 penthouse duplex apartments. Asking rents for the loftlike apartments could start around $1,600 a month for a studio and $2,600 for a two-bedroom. Streetscape improvements will add lighting, replace sidewalks and move utility poles. Supporters of the project hope that the investment will draw other businesses and developers that might be reluctant to be the first to invest in downtown.Still, some residents are skeptical of the deal, particularly the decision to issue municipal bonds to finance the infrastructure work. Under a 30-year tax-alternative agreement, the mayor estimates that the town could receive as much as $1.188 million a year in payments from Prism, but only after the first phase of the development is fully occupied. At a minimum, it would receive $650,000 a year. The town now collects $465,683 in property taxes for the Edison site, Mr. Parisi said. A tax agreement has not yet been reached for the second phase of the project.\u201cThe taxpayers should not be subsidizing these guys,\u201d said Mark Meyerowitz, a plaintiff in the lawsuit against the town. \u201cIt\u2019s just a bad deal for the citizens of West Orange.\u201dMr. Parisi said he expected that the development would not draw a large number of families with school-age children, arguing that such developments tend to appeal to young professionals and empty nesters. As for traffic, Ashland Avenue, a street that runs parallel to Main Street, will be extended during the second phase of the project, easing congestion.Ultimately, Mr. Parisi sees the alternative \u2014 leaving a hulking eyesore in the middle of town \u2014 as the greater risk. \u201cThe goal,\u201d he said, \u201cwas to revitalize a neighborhood.\u201d Mr. Parisi added that increasing tax rolls was not the main objective.\u201cWe have tried to do everything we can to roll out the red carpet for this type of development,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "With Iraq Mired in Turmoil, Some Call for Partitioning the Country", "Date": "2016-04-28", "News": "Supported byMemo From IraqWith tens of thousands of protesters marching in the streets of Baghdad to demand changes in government, Iraq\u2019s Shiite prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, appeared before Parliament this week hoping to speed the process by introducing a slate of new ministers. He was greeted by lawmakers who tossed water bottles at him, banged on tables and chanted for his ouster.\u201cThis session is illegal!\u201d one of them shouted.Leaving his squabbling opponents behind, Mr. Abadi moved to another meeting room, where supportive lawmakers declared a quorum and approved several new ministers \u2014 technocrats, not party apparatchiks \u2014 as a step to end sectarian politics and the corruption and patronage that support it.But, like so much else in the Iraqi government, the effort fell short, with only a handful of new ministers installed and several major ministries, including oil, foreign and finance, remaining in limbo. A new session of Parliament on Thursday was canceled.Almost two years after the Islamic State swept through northern Iraq, forcing the Obama administration to re-engage in a conflict it had celebrated as complete, Iraq\u2019s political system is barely functioning, as the chaotic scenes in Parliament this week demonstrated.\u201cI generally believe it is ungovernable under the current construct,\u201d said Ali Khedery, an American former official in Iraq who served as an aide to several ambassadors and generals.Mr. Khedery said that a confederacy or a partition of Iraq might be the only remedy for the country\u2019s troubles. He called it \u201can imperfect solution for an imperfect world.\u201dMr. Khedery is now a sharp critic of American policy in Iraq, saying it has consistently ignored the realities of the country\u2019s underlying political problems. Iraq, he said, \u201cis a violent, dysfunctional marriage, and we keep pouring American lives and dollars into it, hoping for a miracle. We should instead seek to broker an amicable separation or divorce that results in self-determination for Iraq\u2019s fractious communities.\u201dWriting last year in Foreign Affairs, Mr. Khedery said Washington should \u201cabandon its fixation with artificial borders\u201d \u2014 a reference to the map of the Middle East drawn by the British and the French after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire at the end of World War I \u2014 and allow Iraq to break up.American officials have said that maintaining Iraq\u2019s unity is still their policy, but United Nations officials in Baghdad have quietly begun studying how the international community might manage a breakup of the country.The political problems of Iraq have been made worse by the collapse in the price of oil, the country\u2019s lifeblood; the grinding war against the Islamic State; and, more recently, fighting between Shiite militias and Kurds in the north that analysts worry could foreshadow a new, violent struggle in the country.Iraq, it seems, is stuck in a cycle of history that endlessly repeats.Mr. Biden has worked to promote Iraqi unity, despite his proposal a decade ago to divide Iraq into thirds. But in comments on Thursday to American diplomatic and military personnel in Baghdad, he harked back to that proposal.\u201cThink of all the places we are today trying to keep the peace,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the places we\u2019ve sent you guys and women. They\u2019re places where, because of history, we\u2019ve drawn artificial lines, creating artificial states made up of totally distinct ethnic, religious, cultural groups, and said: \u2018Have at it. Live together.\u2019 \u201dEven today, her legacy is felt: This week, Mr. Abadi put forward Sharif Ali bin Hussein, a descendant of King Faisal, who was chosen by Ms. Bell in 1921 to rule Iraq, as foreign minister. But lawmakers rejected him as a reminder of Iraq\u2019s failed monarchy.Much of what troubles Iraq today is the legacy of Saddam Hussein\u2019s brutality. Shiites and Kurds, oppressed under Mr. Hussein\u2019s Sunni-dominated administration, have been unable to overcome their grievances. Sunni Arabs say their entire community has been unfairly marginalized for the crimes of Mr. Hussein.\u201cIraq, it seems, has a long memory but is short on vision,\u201d Kate Gilmore, a human rights official at the United Nations, said this week in unusually descriptive language after visiting Iraq. \u201cIt is like a vehicle traveling over rocky terrain, with a large rearview mirror but only a keyhole for a windscreen, despite a vicious contest for the wheel. The dominant narrative among many of Iraq\u2019s leaders is of \u2018my community\u2019s grievance,\u2019 failing to acknowledge the widespread nature of Iraqis\u2019 suffering and failing to chart a course for an inclusive future.\u201dMr. Maliki, in an interview this year with The New York Times, acknowledged that he had been unable, while in office, to overcome this history.\u201cThe Kurds want compensation for the past,\u201d said Mr. Maliki, who seems determined these days to undermine Mr. Abadi at every turn. \u201cThe Shia, too. Sunnis still fear from the majority and fear being called in to account for what Saddam did.\u201dDivisions within the Shiite leadership \u2014 with Mr. Maliki and others pushing back against Mr. Abadi\u2019s efforts at restructuring \u2014 are also at the core of the current political crisis.Mr. Maliki, whose grandfather participated in an armed uprising against the British in the 1920s, became one of Iraq\u2019s three vice presidents after he lost the prime minister\u2019s post in 2014. One of the first changes proposed by Mr. Abadi last summer, when he faced protests, was to eliminate the offices of vice president. But two of the occupants refused to leave, even though their salaries were cut off.One of those was Mr. Maliki, who still occupies his palace and insists he is still a vice president of Iraq.Still, he said he had no ambition to return to office, even though many Iraqi officials and Western diplomats believe he has been scheming to do so.\u201cI don\u2019t miss it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to return to it.\u201dHadi al-Ameri, a Shiite rival to Mr. Abadi, who runs a powerful militia that is supported by Iran, is seen by many as harboring ambitions to replace him.Even so, Mr. Ameri said, \u201conly if I were crazy would I accept\u201d the job of prime minister.\u201cWe don\u2019t have democracy in Iraq,\u201d he said. \u201cHere, everyone wants to drive the car. The winner and the loser.\u201dHe added, as a way of defending Mr. Abadi\u2019s failures in uniting the Iraqi state, \u201cEven if a prophet came to rule Iraq, he wouldn\u2019t be able to satisfy all sides.\u201dFollow Tim Arango on Twitter @tarangoNYT.Tim Arango reported from Baghdad and Istanbul.

{"Headline": "In Spain, Catching Up With Cervantes", "Date": "2016-04-21", "News": "Supported byMADRID \u2014 Two giants of Western literature, William Shakespeare and Miguel de Cervantes, are being honored this weekend in their native countries on the 400th anniversaries of their deaths.But while Britain has gone all out to fete Shakespeare, with a yearlong slate of high-profile events, readings, concerts and stagings of his plays, Spanish officials have been accused of not doing enough to promote Cervantes, whose \u201cDon Quixote\u201d is considered to be a foundational text of modern fiction.As Spain heads into its fifth month without an elected government, after inconclusive elections in December, the criticism has taken on a distinctly political flavor.A few weeks ago, Juan Luis Cebri\u00e1n, the chairman of Prisa, the Spanish media group that owns the newspaper El Pa\u00eds, paid tribute to Cervantes at his shareholders\u2019 general assembly. But he took a swipe at \u201cthe absence and anomia of the authorities of our country in terms of everything that relates to this event.\u201dIn January, Socialist lawmakers presented a parliamentary proposal to push the acting conservative government to improve the commemoration plans. Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s Torres Mora, a Socialist lawmaker, accused the government of \u201ccrossing its arms.\u201dSpanish officials insist that such criticism is misplaced, saying the government never sought to take full control over how Cervantes should be honored, nor foot the entire bill for the celebration.Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Lassalle, the state secretary for culture, said in a telephone interview that his aim was \u201cto break with the philosophy\u201d of the 1980s and \u201990s, when Spain was mostly under a Socialist government. During that time, he argued, huge cultural projects were heavily subsidized and organized from the top, with a strict hierarchy.Instead, he said, the Cervantes commemoration should be more collaborative and \u201cdemocratic.\u201dThe Culture Ministry recently added 129 projects to the official commemoration agenda, raising the total to 329. The government said it had allocated a total of 4 million euros, about $4.55 million, to finance events linked to the anniversary. Regional authorities are spending about half that amount.In Britain, nearly every major cultural institution has planned a splashy Shakespeare event. On Saturday \u2014 the date of his death \u2014 the Royal Shakespeare Company hosted \u201cShakespeare Live!,\u201d a performance broadcast by the BBC. Actors joining the event include Helen Mirren, Judi Dench and Benedict Cumberbatch. Prince Charles was also to be part of the festivities.The National Theater, the British Library, the Royal Festival Hall, and the Victoria and Albert Museum, among others, scheduled events for this weekend.Spain\u2019s comparatively low-key treatment of Cervantes has rankled not a few of the country\u2019s writers and intellectuals.The government\u2019s handling of the commemoration, Mr. P\u00e9rez-Reverte wrote, amounted to \u201cthe international embarrassment of the year of Cervantes.\u201dStill, on Wednesday, Mr. Rajoy gave a copy of \u201cDon Quixote\u201d to Carles Puigdemont, the new separatist leader of Catalonia \u2014 a gesture that was also politically charged, as Mr. Rajoy then warned against any Catalan attempt to break away from Spain.But in a recent phone interview, Mr. Villanueva said, \u201cI was worried, but now I\u2019m a bit more relaxed, because I think that things are functioning and coming into place.\u201dThat Spain is not fully united behind the Cervantes events is, perhaps, in keeping with the writer\u2019s tumultuous life.One of the main events, which runs until May 22, is an exhibition at the National Library. On display are nine of the 11 known letters that Cervantes wrote, mostly while working as a tax collector. The show also traces the writer\u2019s footsteps around the Mediterranean \u2014 not always of his own will, since he spent five years in prison in Algiers after pirates captured him.The last part of the exhibition, dedicated to \u201cthe myth of Cervantes\u201d and his legacy, highlights how English writers followed Cervantes\u2019s lead in fiction, including Henry Fielding and his novel \u201cTom Jones.\u201dOn a recent visit, a guide told his group that Cervantes would have been better honored had he lived in London instead of Madrid, even though he lived in the same district of the city, aptly known as the Barrio de Las Letras (the literary quarter), as several other writers of the so-called Spanish Golden Age.Developing the literary quarter as a cultural center is \u201cthe big dream that Madrid needs,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Manuel Luc\u00eda Meg\u00edas, a literature professor and the curator of the national library exhibition.Over all, Mr. de Prado said, \u201cthere has been no attempt to think about how Cervantes and this special year could be beneficial for the longer term.\u201dPoliticians, he added, \u201care now only interested in what will happen in the politics of Spain, so Cervantes for them is just about wanting to appear on the event photo.\u201dNothing in the national library\u2019s exhibition was translated into English, something that the curator called an institutional mistake.\u201cIt is a complete error not to think of the public beyond people who speak Spanish,\u201d Mr. Luc\u00eda Meg\u00edas said. \u201cI think that in this country we sometimes lack marketing vision.\u201dStill, Mr. Lassalle, the state secretary, argued that Madrid\u2019s exhibition compared favorably with one in the British Library about Shakespeare. He also cited a new choreography of the ballet \u201cDon Quixote\u201d from the Spanish National Dance Company that has received favorable reviews, and a summer theater festival in Almagro that will be devoted almost exclusively to Cervantes.Some government-funded efforts did not receive media and public attention but were major achievements in terms of promoting Cervantes, including a project to digitalize his works.Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about complaints that Spanish officials are not doing enough to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the death of Miguel de Cervantes misstated, in some editions, the day of the 400th anniversary of the death of another Western literary giant, William Shakespeare, and a commemorative Royal Shakespeare Company performance. The two events were on Saturday, April 23 \u2014 not on Sunday, April 24.Christopher D. Shea contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Housing Bias Outlasts Ruling in a Long Island Village", "Date": "2016-04-23", "News": "Supported byGARDEN CITY, N.Y. \u2014 Mary Crosson, a housing activist, remembers moving to Long Island from Bayside, Queens, in the 1990s and being struck by the sharp divisions that seemed to keep blacks and whites apart.\u201cI come from South Carolina, so I understand discrimination,\u201d said Mrs. Crosson, 68, who is black and lives in the village of Hempstead, where nearly half the residents are African-American. \u201cIn Queens, it was more of a mixed neighborhood. I came out here and I felt like I went back to the South all over again.\u201d\u201cSomething was amiss here,\u201d a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit wrote in its decision. \u201cGarden City\u2019s abrupt shift in zoning in the face of vocal opposition to changing the character of Garden City represented acquiescence to race-based animus.\u201dThe more aggressive posture reflects a growing impatience with the persistence of segregation a half-century after the passage of the federal Fair Housing Act, and an effort to apply more pressure on communities to finally open themselves up to black and Latino residents.In the case of Garden City, however, the legal victory may have come too late. The litigation dragged on for so long that a courthouse is now planned for the land at the center of the case, and local officials, advocates said, claim there are few other parcels on which to build.Bryan Greene, the agency\u2019s general deputy assistant secretary for fair housing and equal opportunity, said the requirement would help prevent what happened in Westchester, where some of the country\u2019s most affluent communities sit next to hardscrabble towns and where, a judge found, officials had failed to consider race when they certified that the county had taken steps to promote fair housing.Westchester, which entered a sweeping desegregation agreement with the federal government in 2009, helped \u201cillustrate to many people nationwide that communities were getting millions and millions of dollars in block grant funding\u201d without evaluating the problem of racial segregation, Mr. Greene said.In the case of Garden City, local officials had not received federal housing money, but the Fair Housing Act applies to all housing transactions and policies, even when federal money is not involved.The lawsuit that led to the appeals court ruling last month was filed against the village and Nassau County in 2005. It accused the village of discrimination by catering to residents who had protested the board of trustees\u2019 initial embrace of a zoning classification that would have allowed multifamily housing on a 25-acre parcel that the county owned and planned to sell to a private developer.While the classification did not specifically refer to affordable housing, the appeals court said, residents who opposed the move raised the specter of such housing being built and urged the trustees to \u201cplay it safe\u201d by allowing only townhouses or single-family homes on the property. The trustees did just that.Using what the appeals court called code words, residents said that multifamily housing would change the \u201cflavor\u201d and \u201ccharacter\u201d of the village and would lead to \u201cfour or 10 people in an apartment,\u201d and demanded a guarantee that the housing be \u201cupscale.\u201d\u201cThe tenor of the discussion at public hearings,\u201d the judges wrote, and a flier that circulated in the village, \u201cshows that citizen opposition, though not overtly race-based, was directed at a potential influx of poor, minority residents.\u201dGarden City officials have yet to decide whether to appeal. The trustees said in a statement that the village had already begun to apply remedies ordered by the district court judge, Arthur D. Spatt, adopting a fair-housing resolution and appointing a fair-housing compliance officer.Judge Spatt also ordered Garden City to require that 10 percent of new residential developments with five units or more be set aside for residents with household incomes of 80 percent or less of Long Island\u2019s median income.Nonetheless, Ms. Goins, who lives in Hempstead, called the ruling historic. \u201cHaving grown up in African-American communities on Long Island, I always knew that we were locked into certain places,\u201d she explained. \u201cYou could visit Garden City, but you could not stay.\u201dThe lawyers for the plaintiffs said Garden City and Nassau County were not unusual. \u201cThere are many violations going on all across the country, but unless someone catches them, it\u2019s of no moment,\u201d one of the lawyers, Frederick K. Brewington, said.The broader implications of the case, and the appeals court\u2019s question about whether Nassau had engaged in racial steering, could be far-reaching. Nassau \u201cis one of the most segregated counties in the country,\u201d said Stanley J. Brown, another lawyer for the plaintiffs.A federal judge agreed, ruling that the county had \u201cutterly failed\u201d to meet its obligations. The county said it would build 750 units of affordable housing in 31 overwhelmingly white communities. The units \u2014 intended for working, middle-class families \u2014 were to be aggressively marketed to nonwhite residents.At the end of 2015, according to county officials, financing was in place for 649 units, 588 of which had building permits or certificates of occupancy.But a thornier element of the Westchester settlement required the county to \u201cuse all available means as appropriate\u201d to promote nondiscriminatory housing. That included pressing local governments to change zoning rules that discouraged the construction of apartments.The federal housing agency has repeatedly accused Rob Astorino, the Westchester County executive, of moving too slowly on the issue. He, in turn, has accused the agency of trying to expand the agreement\u2019s scope.The Nassau and Westchester cases have their roots in a much older housing-discrimination battle near New York: a seminal case in Mount Laurel, N.J.The Mount Laurel case began in the 1960s when a group of African-Americans found themselves priced out of the township, a Philadelphia suburb. They sued in 1971, after local officials blocked an affordable-housing project.The case reached New Jersey\u2019s highest court, which in two key rulings limited the use of exclusionary zoning to prevent the construction of affordable housing.More important, the ruling, known as the Mount Laurel doctrine, asserted that all municipalities had an obligation to provide a \u201cfair share\u201d of affordable housing. Since the mid-1980s, a total of more than 65,000 units have been built across New Jersey\u2019s 21 counties.Professor Silverman of SUNY Buffalo said continued litigation of fair-housing cases highlighted both the intractable nature of the problem and the robust enforcement now unfolding nationally.\u201cThe fact that discrimination has been sustained over time, despite a series of different court challenges, has kept the issue salient,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople see the inequalities.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But some of those same supporters are also already mulling over whether to support Mrs. Clinton should she prevail, and grappling with what his campaign might mean for progressive politics in the future.Cynthia Kral, 38, of Pittsburgh, said she would never vote for Mrs. Clinton. \u201cI cannot trust her,\u201d Ms. Kral said, adding that she planned to vote for a third-party candidate or write in Mr. Sanders\u2019s name in the general election. \u201cI feel like she can be bought on anything, and for her to be president \u2014 that kind of scares me.\u201dMs. Kral, an education assistant at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and another Sanders supporter who lives in Pittsburgh, Geoff Sanderson, 31, said they hoped that even if Mr. Sanders loses, the progressive movement he has ignited will continue past his candidacy.\u201cPart of it feels crushing,\u201d Mr. Sanderson, who manages a theater, said of the race. \u201cThe other part of it feels hopeful that at least this started something and that this isn\u2019t the end of it.\u201dMrs. Clinton currently has 1,446 delegates to Mr. Sanders\u2019s 1,202, with 2,383 needed to capture the nomination. But her lead in superdelegates leaves her only about 400 delegates short of that majority. And polls show Mr. Sanders down in at least four of the five states voting on Tuesday, with the senator trailing Mrs. Clinton in Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Maryland.Katherine Duncan, 30, of West Hartford, Conn., is holding out hope that Mr. Sanders will win, citing personal reasons. A career coach, she has more than $130,000 in student debt after getting her bachelor\u2019s in communications and her master\u2019s in public relations.\u201cIt\u2019s just so overwhelming I don\u2019t know where to start,\u201d Ms. Duncan said. \u201cIt makes me have trouble sleeping at night. It\u2019s changing the course of my life in some ways, because I can\u2019t do things I want to do because I want to pay that debt off.\u201dDetermined to bolster the candidate\u2019s chances, she came to a Sanders rally in Hartford on Monday to take pictures and post them on social media sites in an effort to excite her family and friends about his candidacy.\u201cI feel confident that he\u2019s giving it everything he has, and so this is the least that I can do,\u201d she said.Her steadfast support is echoed in the crowds Mr. Sanders continues to draw. About 1,800 people attended the rally in Hartford on Monday and another 800 showed up for one in Pittsburgh, his campaign said. At each event, supporters cheered as Mr. Sanders laid out his plans to combat income inequality and tackle campaign finance reform.During the Connecticut rally on Monday, Mr. Sanders showed no signs of letting up as he repeatedly called on his supporters to cast ballots for him. \u201cWhen we stand together and fight for an agenda that works for all of us, fight for a government that represents all of the people and not just the one percent, when we do that, there is nothing we cannot accomplish,\u201d he said.\u201cHe should very much be in the race,\u201d Mr. Merkley said of Mr. Sanders. \u201cBoth candidates have motivated many people to be involved. It has also prepared them to be better candidates in the general election.\u201dBut interviews with some Sanders supporters suggest that their loyalties may not long remain with the party.Mr. Wacker, the striking Verizon technician, was once an independent, but switched his party affiliation recently to become a Democrat so he could vote for Mr. Sanders.He said that he did not trust Mrs. Clinton because of her ties to Wall Street, and that he believed she would make decisions from \u201can ivory tower.\u201d\u201cEven if she has good intentions, her mind is not really geared toward people like me,\u201d Mr. Wacker said of Mrs. Clinton. \u201cIt\u2019s geared toward people who are going to help her out.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obscure Ban Is Driving Inquiry Into de Blasio\u2019s Fund-Raising", "Date": "2016-04-21", "News": "Supported byDuring most election cycles, Putnam County, N.Y., is a sleepy backwater, with few donations of more than $1,000 coming into the local Democratic committee in the decade beginning in 2004.But 2014 was different. Amid an aggressive push by Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City to wrangle donors to help secure Democratic control of the State Senate, a flood of large contributions started pouring into the Putnam committee and at least two other county committees.Over two weeks in October that year, the Putnam committee received 16 donations, totaling $547,300, from labor unions, real estate interests and individuals including the grocery store magnate John A. Catsimatidis. The money then went to two Democratic candidates in tight Senate races, Terry Gipson and Justin Wagner, who would have been barred by state election law from collecting such large sums directly.Now those donations, solicited in part by the mayor\u2019s campaign apparatus, are under scrutiny as part of a multipronged criminal investigation being conducted by federal and state authorities, several people briefed on the matter have said.The inquiry into the 2014 donations is based on a state ban on contributions to a party committee if they are given or solicited for a particular candidate, with an intent to evade individual contribution limits. Party committees can receive contributions of up to $102,300, far more than the $11,000 general-election maximum from individuals directly to for State Senate candidates. And the committees are not restricted in how much they can transfer to candidates.It appears that prosecutors have never made a criminal case under this section of state election law, a violation of which would be a felony: Records going back to 1999 show no arrests or arraignments on the charge, according to the State Division of Criminal Justice Services.There seemed to be little question where the money sent to county committees should ultimately end up, officials with the committees said.\u201cWe were told, before we got it, how it was going to be used,\u201d said Louis Epstein, the first vice chairman of the Democratic committee in Putnam County, a far-northern suburb of New York City. A similar message was received in Monroe County, where an incumbent state senator, Ted O\u2019Brien, faced a tough re-election in Rochester.\u201cGenerally what happened was somebody said we have a donor who would like to help Ted,\u201d said Dave Garretson, chairman of the Monroe County Democratic Committee at the time. \u201cThey would like to make a contribution to the county committee where the contribution limit is higher.\u201dMr. Garretson said that he had made it clear he could not promise how the money would be spent, and that there were never \u201cany conversations with donors where there was a wink-wink arrangement.\u201d He and Mr. Epstein also said that their committees sought advice to ensure that their handling of the money was proper, adding that they did not deal directly with donors.Neither the county officials nor Mr. de Blasio, who held fund-raisers in September and October of 2014 in New York City on behalf of upstate Senate Democrats, has been accused of any wrongdoing.Money has always played an outsize role in political races, but its influence increased in 2014, when an aggregate limit of $150,000 on individual donors was struck down in a court, paving the way for a single donor to give the $102,300 maximum to more party committees and, ultimately, embattled candidates.The process of soliciting donations for the county committees, which political-campaign veterans characterized as commonplace and legal, appeared to be a central part of the state prosecutors\u2019 investigation into the fund-raising for the Senate races.Mr. de Blasio\u2019s efforts to raise money on behalf of Senate Democrats began early in his administration. On Sept. 10, 2014, he convened roughly 160 potential donors, many of whom had contributed to his mayoral campaign, at a breakfast meeting at the Midtown Manhattan offices of a law firm, Kramer Levin, making the case for why his liberal agenda would falter in Albany unless the Democrats gained control of the Capitol.At the meeting, the mayor\u2019s top political aide, Emma Wolfe, outlined which of the swing races that year could tip the balance in favor of Democrats in the State Senate. While politicians are not usually shy about asking for money for their campaigns, Mr. de Blasio left the meeting before his campaign finance director, Ross A. Offinger, made the pitch for donations, according to two people who were present. The mayor returned to the room soon after. Mr. Offinger has come under scrutiny in two different aspects of the sprawling federal investigation.The use of local committees stemmed, in part, from a belief among some political consultants and de Blasio administration officials that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo had not pressed forcefully for a Democratic takeover of the Senate, several people with knowledge of the strategy said. The state Democratic Party committee is closely allied with Mr. Cuomo.\u201cYou can\u2019t give money to the state committee, forget it,\u201d Bill Samuels, the founder of EffectiveNY, a nonprofit group devoted to government reform, who is a supporter of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s, said in an interview this week. \u201cTotal arm of the governor.\u201dSeveral of those who gave to the county committees in 2014 were also major donors to Campaign for One New York, a nonprofit organization created to support Mr. de Blasio\u2019s agenda. The group\u2019s fund-raising has become a focus of a sprawling investigation by the United States attorney in Manhattan, Preet Bharara, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation., that has ensnared top Police Department officials and extended into the political sphere. Mr. Bharara\u2019s office, as well as state prosecutors, have now also issued subpoenas to Nyclass, a group that donated to the mayor\u2019s campaign, and had spearheaded an effort to ban horse carriages in the city, according to Michael McKeon, a spokesman for the group.The main federal investigation, which covers fund-raising by Mr. de Blasio and his staff since his 2013 election campaign, is examining whether donors were promised or received favorable municipal treatment in exchange for their contributions.The nonprofit is in the process of closing down, the mayor said last month, explaining that its work advocating universal prekindergarten and affordable housing was finished. \u201cI hold myself and my administration to the highest ethical standards,\u201d he has said repeatedly when asked of the federal investigation.A review of state campaign records and voluntary disclosures by Mr. de Blasio\u2019s nonprofit show an interlocking web of donors with interests before the city. Beyond the labor unions, which give lavishly to Democratic campaigns in any election, there are men with little prior experience as major donors in New York politics on the rolls of local and state campaign committees.Jona S. Rechnitz, a young real estate developer from Los Angeles who is under scrutiny by the federal authorities, gave $102,000 to the statewide Democratic Senate Campaign Committee and $50,000 to the mayor\u2019s nonprofit and bundled more than $44,000 for Mr. de Blasio\u2019s 2013 election.A company linked to Michael Kohn, a businessman with real estate interests in Brooklyn, gave $100,000 to the Ulster County Democratic Committee in October 2014; in early 2015, another company associated with him gave $50,000 to the nonprofit.Others donors, like Mr. Catsimatidis, the grocery chain owner and a former Republican mayoral candidate, were first-time contributors to the mayor\u2019s causes.\u201cI saw him at the Al Smith dinner and he said, \u2018Can you do me a favor and send it to them?\u2019\u201d said Mr. Catsimatidis, recalling a conversation with Mr. de Blasio. \u201cI never got anything in return. Later on I found out they sent it to the State Democrats, the Senate. You know how I found out? I found out because someone told me, thank you.\u201dAn assistant of Mr. Catsimatidis\u2019s who handles some of his political donations said that Mr. Offinger, who was also the treasurer of the Campaign for One New York, instructed him on the details of where to send the check. \u201cI take hundreds of these guys\u2019 phone calls every day,\u201d the assistant, Matthew Wanning, said. \u201cRoss was one in the mix.\u201dIn all, the Democratic committees in Putnam, Ulster and Monroe Counties raised at least $1.2 million in large donations from union political action committees, private companies and individual donors, state records show, and sent money to four Senate candidates in close races.Cecilia Tkaczyk, who received money in October 2014 from the Ulster County committee during her unsuccessful re-election campaign, said the state party\u2019s efforts, which included fliers attacking her opponent, ended up working against her. She declined to comment on whether she had gotten a subpoena from state prosecutors, which people familiar with the investigation said had gone to some candidates in tight races that year.Mr. O\u2019Brien, who received money from the Monroe County committee, said he had not received a subpoena. \u201cI have not been contacted by a soul about it,\u201d he said.Mr. O\u2019Brien said he was not privy to the conversations about how the money ended up in his campaign coffers. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any conversations with anybody that I recall,\u201d he said. \u201cI was so busy trying to run the day-to-day campaign stuff.\u201dDespite the push by Mr. de Blasio to alter the balance of power in the Capitol that year, the effort failed. Mr. O\u2019Brien and other Democrats who got the influx of donations lost, and Republicans maintained control of the Senate.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rich People Are Living Longer. That\u2019s Tilting Social Security in Their Favor.", "Date": "2016-04-22", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewSocial Security is designed to ensure that no workers go penniless in old age and also as an equalizer between rich and poor. It is structured to give more generous retirement benefits to low-income people, given the taxes they pay during their working years.For example, an American man who is consistently in the top 1 percent of earners \u2014 making $2 million last year \u2014 will, if he starts taking Social Security benefits at age 66 and lives to be 87, end up with more money than he and his employers paid into the system in taxes during his lifetime. In the language of finance, he would receive an inflation-adjusted \u201cinternal rate of return\u201d of 1.07 percent.By contrast, if a member of Mr. Moneybags\u2019s household staff, born the same year, made about $30,000 annually and also lived to be 87, he would receive a 2.57 percent return after inflation. That\u2019s quite a decent return \u2014 a higher rate than any inflation-adjusted United States Treasury bonds pay, for example.That\u2019s progressivity in action. Or rather, it would be if Mr. Moneybags and his gardener actually lived to the same age.But in reality, a large body of research shows that the rich live longer \u2014 and that the life span gap between rich and poor is growing. And that means that the progressive ideal built into the design of Social Security is, gradually, being thwarted. In some circumstances, the program can actually be regressive, offering richer benefits to those who are already affluent.Alas, a gardener earning $30,000 a year is unlikely to live that long. Men in that income tier die, on average, at age 78. In this hypothetical case, that nine-year gap in expected life span radically shifts the relative financial return the two men would receive on their tax dollars.If the gardener died at the age Mr. Chetty\u2019s research suggests is typical for men at that income level, he would lose about $115,000 in benefits, compared with what he would receive if he lived as long as the wealthy man. And he would earn a 0.92 percent rate of return on his tax dollars \u2014 a bit lower than that earned by his much wealthier boss.That result wasn\u2019t obvious when Social Security benefits were designed. The benefits were intended to replace 90 percent of a person\u2019s first dollar of earnings but only 15 percent of their earnings over $5,157 a month (and nothing above the income cutoff of $9,875 a month), giving less affluent people a theoretical advantage.But Social Security has always been designed as a social insurance program, not as an investment fund. Essentially, the people who die unusually young subsidize those who live unusually long lives, so if you look at the program on narrow return-on-investment grounds, a person who lives to 110 is getting a far better deal than people who die a month after they first draw benefits.And because different groups of people have different life expectancies, some groups receive more value from every dollar of payroll taxes they and their employers pay into the system. Over all, women live longer than men and African-Americans die younger than whites.The research from Mr. Chetty and his colleagues indicates that the richest 1 percent of Americans gained three years of life expectancy from 2001 to 2014 alone, while the poorest had almost no gain (0.3 of a year).For anyone who believes that it\u2019s important for the Social Security program to remain progressive, the life-span shifts have big implications that are made more acute by the program\u2019s financial problems.A popular idea among many fiscal centrists and conservatives is to fix the finances of Social Security by increasing the full retirement age. (It is currently 66 and on track to rise to 67, though retirees can take a reduced level of benefits at age 62 and higher levels up to age 70.)But the life span differential suggests that such a change would fall heavily on the backs of the poor. It\u2019s true that on average Americans are living longer than they were in 1983, when the last major overhaul to the finances of the program was made.\u201cThe way it\u2019s usually put is: Has the health status of people near retirement age improved across the board?\u201d said Mr. Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. \u201cBut for many people it has not. People who have done backbreaking work or physically demanding work were no more fit in 1984 than in 1964.\u201dBy contrast, he argued that raising the maximum annual income level on which Social Security taxes are paid, currently $118,500, would maintain long-term solvency while not putting more of a burden on the poor. That would effectively raise taxes for higher-income people. Another alternative might be to make the benefits structure more progressive, essentially reducing benefits for high-paid workers only.That points to an important reality: The battles over Social Security aren\u2019t confined to merely technocratic questions. They also concern core issues about government and social justice, and in formulating answers, the new body of research on income and life span really matters.Advertisement"}

Compared by rivals to a \u201cbutler in a horror movie\u201d because of his formal bearing and cryptic demeanor, Mr. Temer is trying to make his case to the nation much more forcefully now.He seems particularly worried that Ms. Rousseff, who has been denouncing the campaign to oust her as illegal, will be heading to the United Nations on Friday, where she will be able to broadcast her claims to the world.Ms. Rousseff has condemned her vice president as a traitor. But Mr. Temer, whose political party was part of her governing coalition, said he was treated terribly by the president during his time in her cabinet.They were never friends, merely greeting each other ceremoniously, he said. The last time they even spoke was in late January, he said.\u201cI spent four years being absolutely ostracized,\u201d said Mr. Temer, a former lecturer on constitutional law. \u201cWe were not friends because she did not consider herself my friend.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m very worried about the president\u2019s intention to say that Brazil is some minor republic where coups are carried out,\u201d said Mr. Temer, expressing concern about Ms. Rousseff\u2019s trip to the United Nations on Friday.In the 30-minute telephone interview from his office in S\u00e3o Paulo, Mr. Temer rebutted such claims, arguing that \u201cimpeachment is allowed under Brazil\u2019s Constitution.\u201d He also said he would not seek to quash corruption inquiries into the Petrobras scandal unsettling his own centrist Brazilian Democratic Movement Party if he takes office.Mr. Temer defended himself and top allies who are under a cloud of accusations in the scheme. He expressed support for Eduardo Cunha, the scandal-plagued speaker of the lower house who is leading the impeachment effort in Congress, saying he would not ask Mr. Cunha to resign. Mr. Cunha will be the next in line for the presidency if Mr. Temer takes over.\u201cThat\u2019s a matter for the Supreme Federal Tribunal to decide,\u201d Mr. Temer said, referring to Mr. Cunha\u2019s trial at Brazil\u2019s highest court on charges of pocketing as much as $40 million in bribes in the scheme around Petrobras.One of these executives, Jo\u00e3o Augusto Henriques, oversaw an ethanol-purchasing scheme that investigators claim benefited legislators from Mr. Temer\u2019s party.In the interview, the vice president said he was innocent of any wrongdoing, contending that his connections to the disgraced former Petrobras executives involved his bureaucratic responsibilities as the head of the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party. The party served as an anchor for the coalition that enabled Ms. Rousseff\u2019s Workers\u2019 Party to govern for more than a decade.Making matters worse for Mr. Temer, only 2 percent of Brazilians would vote for him in the 2018 election, Datafolha said, placing him well behind potential candidates like Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, the former president who backed Ms. Rousseff\u2019s rise, and Jair Bolsonaro, an ultraconservative congressman from Rio de Janeiro.The Datafolha poll, conducted on April 7 and 8 in interviews with 2,779 people, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus two percentage points. In addition to the vice president\u2019s low approval ratings, a justice on the Supreme Federal Tribunal ruled that Congress must consider a request for Mr. Temer\u2019s own impeachment.Putting together a government has been challenging for Mr. Temer. Arm\u00ednio Fraga, a respected former central bank president, has made it clear that he does not want a cabinet post in Mr. Temer\u2019s government. The opposition Social Democrats have also held back from forging a coalition, even as they hope to oust Ms. Rousseff.\u201cPessimistic views of Michel Temer and his possible government among the winners are growing with surprising velocity,\u201d wrote J\u00e2nio de Freitas, a columnist for the newspaper Folha de S. Paulo.Mr. Temer, the youngest of eight children in a family of Maronite Christians who immigrated from Lebanon to S\u00e3o Paulo in the 1920s, said he remained hopeful that he could promote a catharsis of sorts by assembling \u201ca government of national unity.\u201dCiting as inspiration Juscelino Kubitschek, the president who ordered the construction of the futuristic capital, Bras\u00edlia, in the late 1950s, Mr. Temer said he wanted to create a \u201cgovernment of optimism.\u201d He also mentioned his admiration for American presidents like Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin D. Roosevelt, emphasizing that he planned to improve ties with the United States.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "De Blasio Plays Down Contact With Men at Heart of U.S. Inquiry", "Date": "2016-04-13", "News": "Supported byMayor Bill de Blasio said on Wednesday that he had conversations \u201cover the course of 2014\u201d and into the next year with two financial backers who are now at the center of a federal investigation, acknowledging more extensive contact with the men than he had previously.But he refused to say what the conversations were about or how frequently they occurred.Mr. de Blasio said that in response to news accounts of the investigation into fund-raising by the men, Jona S. Rechnitz and Jeremy Reichberg, he had instructed a lawyer for his political campaign to contact the office of Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, which includes Manhattan.\u201cHe reached out at my request and simply said, \u2018We\u2019d like to be helpful in any way we can, happy to provide any information that would be helpful,\u2019\u201d Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, said of the lawyer, Barry Berke. He added that he had no knowledge of any investigation beyond what he had learned from news reports, and that neither he nor anyone in his administration had been contacted by federal investigators regarding an inquiry into his campaign fund-raising that focuses on the two men.The investigators then discovered a web of contacts between the two men and high-level Police Department officials. In questioning about 20 such officials, the investigators asked about links to the men and allegations of free trips and meals the men may have provided.At the same time, the people briefed on the case said, the federal investigators were focusing on substantial donations that Mr. Rechnitz gave to Mr. de Blasio and groups allied with the mayor in 2013 and 2014, and other money he raised. They were also looking at Mr. Reichberg\u2019s role in hosting a fund-raiser at his Brooklyn home in May 2014, which was attended by the mayor. Both men were named to the mayor\u2019s inauguration committee in late 2013, along with a roster of more than 70 other supporters, including actors and writers.The two men and the police officials have not been charged with a crime.Mr. de Blasio said on Sunday that he had not met the two men until after he won the Democratic primary for mayor in September 2013 and was not particularly close to them, adding that he really had not \u201cseen them in the last year or more.\u201dBut on Wednesday, Mr. de Blasio announced that his lawyer had reached out to prosecutors and was then pressed again to provide more details about his relationship with the men.\u201cIt\u2019s very simple,\u201d he said. \u201cTo the best of my memory, I did not know them before the fall of 2013.\u201dDuring the general election campaign, he said, \u201cthey did a lot to support the effort,\u201d adding that it was \u201ca very normal thing\u201d to include them in the inauguration committee, which was a largely honorific body.Referring to the May 2014 fund-raiser for the Campaign for One New York, a group organized to support the mayor\u2019s agenda, he said, \u201cThey held one event at one of their homes, which I don\u2019t remember really that well because it was just another event at someone\u2019s home.\u201d The event raised at least $35,000.He continued, \u201cAnd then I had some conversations with them over the course of 2014 but really haven\u2019t had many conversations since the beginning of 2015.\u201dAsked for more information on the conversations, he said, \u201cI\u2019ve told you all I\u2019m going to tell you for now.\u201dDetailed records of the mayor\u2019s schedule kept by his office show no meetings or other contact with either of the men except for the May 2014 fund-raiser held at Mr. Reichberg\u2019s home in Borough Park, Brooklyn. A video posted online shows Mr. de Blasio arriving outside Mr. Reichberg\u2019s three-story brick home, with a mansard roof, and being greeted by a large crowd. A man can be heard telling the mayor that the crowd had waited for him for two and a half hours, and Mr. de Blasio responds incredulously before giving a bearhug to a man on the sidewalk.In at least one respect, Mr. Rechnitz appeared to distinguish himself as a donor in a way that was likely to have caught the mayor\u2019s attention. In the fall of 2014, when Mr. de Blasio was making a major and ultimately unsuccessful push to help Democrats take control of the State Senate, a company controlled by Mr. Rechnitz donated $102,300 to the New York State Democratic Senate Campaign Committee. State records show that it was the single-largest donation to the committee; the only comparable donations were made by union-affiliated political action committees.\u201cSomeone who makes a donation, that\u2019s their choice; they should expect nothing in return,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cYou\u2019d like to believe people are making donations because they think someone would be a good leader.\u201dReferring to allegations against the few top officials, he said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to prejudge them. They deserve due process, but anyone who accepts personal gifts in the year 2016 is not paying attention to today\u2019s ethics standards or the ethics training that I\u2019m sure they were given along the way.\u201dThe person with knowledge of the matter said the federal prosecutors were monitoring the inquiry, but that it remained unclear whether the deals rose to the level of criminal conduct.On Tuesday night, Mr. Bharara, who recently won convictions of prominent state legislators, said he would \u201ckeep looking hard at corruption in our legislative branch as we have been.\u201d\u201cBut not just there,\u201d he added. \u201cIn the executive branch too, both in city and in state government. Executive offices in government are far from immune from a creeping \u2018show me the money\u2019 culture that has been pervading New York for some time now.\u201dJ. David Goodman, William K.

The senator, Delc\u00eddio do Amaral, had been caught detailing an elaborate plan for an oilman ensnared in Brazil\u2019s spiraling graft scandal to flee the country on a private plane.Mr. Amaral, 61, was until his arrest in Bras\u00edlia that morning in late November the governing party\u2019s most powerful leader in the Senate. He quickly sought a plea agreement, but prosecutors let him fester in prison for weeks, making a deal only after the disgraced senator provided one stunning disclosure after another that betrayed his former comrades and brought the government of President Dilma Rousseff ever closer to collapse.\u201cI felt like I had just crashed into a wall after a high-speed chase,\u201d recalled Mr. Amaral, who was freed in February. \u201cI messed things up, so I figured I needed a chance to make them right again. You need to be pragmatic.\u201dThe senator\u2019s accounts of colossal bribes, back-room oil deals and desperate cover-ups \u2014 pieced together from interviews, leaked intercepts of telephone conversations and court filings \u2014 offer a rare glimpse into how a leftist party that rose to power vowing to stamp out the corruption of a privileged political elite ended up embracing its predecessors\u2019 practices. His testimony has accelerated Brazil\u2019s political crisis, in which fearful rulers are masterminding power grabs, secretly recording each other and preparing for the day that they, too, might find themselves on the wrong side of an early-morning police raid.Even the judge who at first was heralded for fearlessly pursuing the powerful now stands accused of breaking the law for releasing evidence from the investigation.Dilma Rousseff, Brazil\u2019s president, is facing removal from office. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the proceedings.The upheaval began two years ago when prosecutors discovered a scheme inside the national oil company, Petrobras: Contractors had paid nearly $3 billion in bribes to executives who in turn channeled money into the campaigns of parties in Brazil\u2019s governing coalition. Nearly 40 politicians, business moguls and black-market money dealers have been jailed since, and the list is expected to grow, with prosecutors investigating suspects including the leaders of both chambers of Congress.Scholars say the corruption scandal ranks among the most far-reaching in the developing world, likening it to an earthquake hitting the nation\u2019s privileged elite. It has unspooled alongside crushing economic challenges, as falling commodities prices have sent unemployment soaring to 9.5 percent from 6.8 percent a year ago. In 2015 alone, Brazil lost 1.5 million jobs, a stunning turnabout from the nation\u2019s 7.6 percent economic growth in 2010.The double whammy of political and economic meltdown has devastated the global ambitions of Latin America\u2019s largest nation at the worst possible time: Brazil is simultaneously grappling with an epidemic of birth defects linked to the mosquito-borne Zika virus and preparing to host the Olympic Games this summer.That the heart of the scandal is Petrobras, founded in 1953 and surrounded by a mythical nationalist aura, has only multiplied its ripple effect. The company is the centerpiece of a web of state-controlled energy companies and banks that form the cornerstone of Brazil\u2019s economy, projecting power across the nation and abroad. It also financed an array of arts programs including a symphony orchestra, modern dance troupes and painting exhibitions, activities the company has slashed along with its own jobs.Brazilians often joke about corruption\u2019s deep roots here, tracing it back to when the Portuguese navigator Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral arrived in 1500, bearing gifts as a strategy to lay claim to lands inhabited by indigenous peoples. It was only a quarter-century ago that another president, Fernando Collor, was forced to resign over an influence-peddling scandal, lapses that seem bush league in light of what is happening today.It was when Senator Amaral began wrecking the government he once loyally supported that many Brazilians began to grasp how pervasive the skulduggery had become.He testified that Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, the former president and founder of the Workers\u2019 Party, had arranged to purchase the silence of a businessman convicted of running a vote-buying scheme.He contended that Vice President Michel Temer, who is maneuvering to impeach President Rousseff, was involved in an illegal ethanol-purchasing operation. He also targeted A\u00e9cio Neves, the opposition leader who narrowly lost the 2014 election, revealing that his family had a secret bank account in Liechtenstein. (Mr. Neves said his mother had opened the account to pay for the education of her grandchildren.)Before Mr. Amaral\u2019s revelations, Ms. Rousseff had largely managed to stay above the fray, in part by boasting of bolstering judicial independence by allowing prosecutors to pursue graft in her own party. Then the senator claimed that the president had instructed him to sabotage the investigation into Petrobras by persuading a high-ranking judge to seek the release of construction tycoons charged with corruption.Both Ms. Rousseff and Mr. da Silva say Mr. Amaral is lying. More broadly, Ms. Rousseff said in a recent interview that she had not known about the corruption at Petrobras, despite serving as its chairwoman from 2003 until 2010, when she was elected president, a period when graft was thriving. She also insists that her campaigns got no illegal financing.Mr. Amaral, assailed by leaders across the spectrum as a fabulist, smiled through interviews like a Cheshire cat. A gifted orator, he intersperses his accounts with sayings from the Pantanal, the vast wetlands where his family owns cattle ranches. Reaching for ways to explain the political maelstrom, he at one point recited a verse from an old Brazilian song.\u201cI\u2019m just doing my part to help the republic,\u201d the senator said.In hindsight, Mr. Amaral said, he recognizes that he never should have trusted Bernardo Cerver\u00f3, a struggling young actor from Rio de Janeiro.The senator, who had been director of gas and energy at Petrobras in 2000 and 2001, said he had agreed to meet with Mr. Cerver\u00f3, 34, in November because of his friendship with the actor\u2019s father, Nestor, who was sentenced to prison on corruption charges stemming from his own tenure at the oil company. The younger Mr. Cerver\u00f3, an actor in an experimental theater troupe, surreptitiously recorded on his phone their conversation at the Royal Tulip, the horseshoe-shaped hotel where the senator lives in Bras\u00edlia, a short drive from the presidential palace.Mr. Amaral first assured Mr. Cerver\u00f3 that he would persuade justices on Brazil\u2019s highest court to release his old friend on house arrest. Then he explained how he would arrange to pay the Cerver\u00f3 family $1 million plus a stipend of about $13,000 a month, which prosecutors suspect was to ensure the family did not inform on his own dealings at Petrobras.And Mr. Amaral laid out how he would help the elder Mr. Cerver\u00f3 flee to Spain, including details like deactivating his electronic monitoring device. The actor suggested an escape by boat, but the senator said a private plane was preferable, adding: \u201cThe best way for him to leave is through Paraguay.\u201dThat was enough for obstruction charges against both Mr. Amaral and Andr\u00e9 Esteves, the billionaire banker the senator said would finance the journey.Before his arrest, Mr. Amaral was known in Bras\u00edlia as a skilled behind-the-scenes negotiator, drawing from his long experience in the oil business.Schooled by Jesuits and trained as an engineer, he worked in the Netherlands for the energy giant Royal Dutch Shell in the early 1990s. Back home, he climbed the bureaucracy of Brazil\u2019s government-controlled energy industry.It was while serving in the Energy Ministry in 1993 that he got to know Ms. Rousseff, an obscure functionary in charge of energy policy in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul.\u201cI met Dilma during a fight,\u201d he said, recalling his first meetings with Ms. Rousseff when she was seeking to renegotiate the debt of a public electric utility with the federal authorities. \u201cShe\u2019s extremely aggressive. Always has been.\u201dMr. Amaral joined the Workers\u2019 Party in 2001 and won a Senate seat the next year, when Mr. da Silva ran successfully for president.Brazil is in the midst of its deepest political crisis in decades, with its president facing impeachment proceedings and many in Congress facing criminal or corruption charges.As Brazil grew richer with the discovery of deep-sea oil fields, so did Mr. Amaral.Some colleagues in the Workers\u2019 Party still recoil at the quincea\u00f1era that Mr. Amaral and his wife hosted in 2011 for their daughter\u2019s 15th birthday. Comparing the event, in the western city of Campo Grande, to the balls organized by European nobility, society columnists fawned over every lavish stroke: 240 bottles of Veuve Clicquot Champagne, and a gown made from Givenchy crystals for the birthday girl.In December, while the senator languished in prison, his old friend from Petrobras, Nestor Cerver\u00f3, told investigators that Mr. Amaral had pocketed a $10 million bribe back in 2001, during a deal to buy turbines from Alstom, the French power company.Mr. Amaral denied that and all accusations that he had illegally enriched himself, declaring: \u201cI am not a corrupt man.\u201dMr. Amaral was the first sitting senator to be arrested since Brazil re-established democracy in the 1980s, and his jailing spawned panic and outrage in the Workers\u2019 Party, which Mr. da Silva and other union leaders founded in 1980 in resistance to Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship.The senator\u2019s readiness to double-cross his colleagues made one thing certain: More secret recordings were about to enrich the saga of Brazil\u2019s political impasse.Shortly after the arrest at the Royal Tulip, Education Minister Aloizio Mercadante, one of Ms. Rousseff\u2019s top aides, contacted Eduardo Marzag\u00e3o, a confidant of Mr. Amaral\u2019s, offering to help defray his family\u2019s legal expenses.\u201cHell, Marzag\u00e3o, you tell me how I can help,\u201d Mr. Mercadante said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m here for, to help.\u201dHe was unaware, of course, that Mr. Marzag\u00e3o was recording the call; prosecutors now have Mr. Mercadante on their target list, too.The education minister maintains that he was acting on his own. But other powerful people in the Workers\u2019 Party were also scrambling.Jaques Wagner, Ms. Rousseff\u2019s former chief of staff, was recorded discussing the situation with Mr. da Silva. He expressed alarm at Mr. Amaral\u2019s testimony that Ms. Rousseff was aware of graft involved in the 2006 acquisition of a Houston oil refinery by Petrobras.For more than a year, Sergio Moro, a crusading judge in southern Brazil, had overseen the Petrobras inquiry. He seized on new anticorruption legislation allowing defendants to reduce their jail sentences in exchange for information, helping prosecutors jail one powerful figure after another.The labyrinthine inquiry eventually led to Mr. da Silva, universally known as Lula. It was clear that the former president had profited from connections to magnates at the helm of construction companies, which paid him millions of dollars for speeches.Then prosecutors found that such companies had paid to renovate a country estate near S\u00e3o Paulo and a beachfront apartment in the city of Guaruj\u00e1, two properties they contend he controls. (Mr. da Silva denies owning either one.)At the country house, police agents found a mug with the logo of Corinthians, Mr. da Silva\u2019s favorite S\u00e3o Paulo soccer club, engraved with the words \u201cto the illustrious President Lula.\u201d The wine cellar had bottles dedicated to the former president. Docked at a wharf in the lake, pedal boats were inscribed with the names of his grandchildren, Pedro and Arthur.As the investigators encircled him, Mr. da Silva grew increasingly alarmed, according to intercepts of his phone calls obtained in the inquiry. He disparaged the Supreme Federal Tribunal, used vulgar epithets to describe the heads of both houses of Congress and called on his comrades in the Workers\u2019 Party to ratchet up pressure on prosecutors.\u201cWhy can\u2019t we intimidate them?\u201d the former president asked one congressman. Instructing him on how to irritate an investigator, Mr. da Silva said: \u201cHe needs to go to sleep knowing that the following day he\u2019ll have 10 legislators irritating him at his house, irritating him at his office, facing a case at the Supreme Federal Tribunal.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the only person who could set this country on fire,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to do what Nero did, you know?\u201dAs the pressure mounted, Mr. Amaral\u2019s 255-page plea deal was leaked into the news media in early March, provoking a round of angry denials and desperate moves. Ms. Rousseff nominated Mr. da Silva, her predecessor and patron, to be her chief of staff, which would give him broad legal protections.For a few hours on March 16, the audacious plan seemed to work.That same day, Judge Moro released recordings of Mr. da Silva\u2019s phone calls with Ms. Rousseff and an array of other politicians. The calls depicted a former president seeking to salvage his heroic narrative alongside a sitting leader trying to stave off impeachment proceedings she has likened to a slow-motion coup.Justices on the Supreme Federal Tribunal suspended Mr. da Silva\u2019s nomination. But the soft-spoken judge also faced recriminations, for revealing conversations of the nation\u2019s leader without the authorization of its highest court, leading to accusations that his once-admired inquiry had become a partisan witch hunt.As the legal case grinds on, more allies are abandoning Ms. Rousseff with an eye on seizing power for themselves. They say she should be impeached for violating fiscal laws by using funds from state banks to cover budget gaps.In Congress, lawmakers accused of immense personal corruption are speeding up the impeachment process of the president, who has not been tainted with claims of illicit personal enrichment.Mr. Amaral, whom the Senate ethics committee is trying to expel from his seat, has not watched this spectacle from the sidelines. On March 13, he revved up a Harley-Davidson motorcycle and joined hundreds of thousands of antigovernment protesters in S\u00e3o Paulo. But he did not remove his helmet, wary of how the angry crowd might react.Days later, during an interview in the comfortable villa in S\u00e3o Paulo where he is now under house arrest, Mr. Amaral turned to song to try to capture the political upheaval that he helped create.Specifically, he invoked the 1978 song \u201cFortune Teller,\u201d by Ivan Lins, about the targeting of dissidents by Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship. Only instead of dissidents tumbling from the perch, today it is leaders of nearly every ideological stripe.Gazing out the window, Mr. Amaral voiced the lyrics:The King of Diamonds is falling,The King of Spades is falling,The King of Clubs is falling, They\u2019re all falling, Nothing remains.\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d the senator said. \u201cEveryone is falling together.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Or how did Mrs. Clinton blow such an opportunity to totally dominate the campaign? Or is this a sign that Mrs. Clinton will not get things done, even the very doable ones, if president?Or that Mr. Sanders, despite the constant media line that what he wants to do is a leap too far, will be able to get done the things that more and more people are indicating they want done \u2014 universal health care, affordable college, public financing of elections, criminal justice reform, no more nonsensical regime-changing wars.

{"Headline": "Is Hillary Clinton Dishonest?", "Date": "2016-04-23", "News": "Supported byAFTER the New York primary, the betting websites are giving Hillary Clinton about a 94 percent chance of being the Democratic nominee, and Donald Trump a 66 percent chance of ending up as the Republican nominee.All this is, I think, a mistaken narrative.One of the perils of journalism is the human brain\u2019s penchant for sorting information into narratives. Even false narratives can take on a life of their own because there is always information arriving that can confirm a narrative.Thus once we in the news media had declared Gerald Ford a klutz (he was actually a graceful athlete), there were always new television clips of him stumbling. Similarly, we unfairly turned Jimmy Carter into a hapless joke, and I fear that the \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d narrative will drag on much more than the facts warrant.It\u2019s true, of course, that Clinton is calculating \u2014 all politicians are, but she more than some. She has adjusted her positions on trade and the minimum wage to scrounge for votes, just as Sanders adjusted his position on guns.Sanders\u2019s positions seem less focus-group tested than Clinton\u2019s, and she can be infuriatingly evasive. Partly that\u2019s because she\u2019s more hawkish than some Democrats, and partly that\u2019s because she realizes she\u2019s likely to face general election voters in November and is preserving wiggle room so she can veer back to the center then.Does that make her scheming and unprincipled? Perhaps, but synonyms might be \u201cpragmatic\u201d and \u201celectable.\u201d That\u2019s what presidential candidates do.Then there are the State Department emails, which are the subject of an F.B.I. investigation. What was she thinking in using a private email server? Why on earth would she do such a stupid thing?Clinton is thin-skinned, private, controlling, wounded by attacks on her and utterly distrustful of the news media. Where Bill Clinton charms, she stews. My bet is that she and her staff wanted to prevent her emails from becoming public through Freedom of Information Act requests.All this is self-inflicted damage, which Clinton compounded with evasions and half-truths, coming across as lawyerly and shifty. A more gifted politician might have gotten away with it, but Clinton is not a natural politician. Her warmth can turn to remoteness on the television screen, her caution to slipperiness.As for the fundamental question of whether Clinton risked American national security with her email server, I suspect the problem has been exaggerated. As President Obama put it, \u201cshe has not jeopardized America\u2019s national security.\u201dThe bottom line: If she had followed the rules and used her official email address, Vladimir Putin might actually have had a leg up on reading her correspondence.So as we head toward the general election showdown, by all means denounce Hillary Clinton\u2019s judgment and policy positions, but let\u2019s focus on the real issues. She\u2019s not a saint but a politician, and to me this notion that she\u2019s fundamentally dishonest is a bogus narrative.An earlier version of this column misstated some of the percentages of true statements as judged by PolitiFact. Based on PolitiFact numbers, the percentage of statements by each presidential candidate rated to be \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cmostly true\u201d were: John Kasich, 52 percent; Hillary Clinton, 50 percent; Bernie Sanders, 49 percent; Ted Cruz, 22 percent; and Donald Trump, 9 percent. They were not 33 percent, 95 percent, 46 percent, 23 percent and 12 percent, respectively.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Volkswagen Reaches Deal in U.S. Over Emissions Scandal", "Date": "2016-04-21", "News": "Supported byVolkswagen agreed on Thursday to fix or buy back nearly 500,000 diesel cars in the United States that are equipped with illegal emissions software.But a settlement announced in federal court in San Francisco left open numerous legal and financial issues stemming from the carmaker\u2019s admission that it rigged diesel vehicles to cheat on pollution tests.\u201cThere is still a lot of work to be done,\u201d Judge Breyer said.It is already clear, though, that Volkswagen will have to increase the amount it has set aside to cover costs of the emissions scandal, which will easily run into billions of dollars.Kelley Blue Book, a research firm, has estimated the cost of buying back all the cars in the United States at $7 billion. The company is certain to face additional billions in fines and compensation paid to owners beyond the costs of repairs or buybacks in the United States. And there are many more faulty cars in Europe and elsewhere in the world still to be dealt with.Volkswagen has set aside only 6.7 billion euros, or $7.6 billion, against the eventual global costs from the scandal.\u201cIf they agree to buy back the cars, the costs will be higher than the current provisions,\u201d said Matthias Hellstern, managing director for corporate finance at Moody\u2019s Investors Service in Frankfurt.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.Kevin Helmich, owner of a 2010 Audi A3 with a diesel engine, said on Thursday that he would lean toward having the company buy his car back rather than get it repaired. Volkswagen is \u201cmaking a real effort to do right by customers,\u201d said Mr. Helmich, who lives in Ann Arbor, Mich. But he added, \u201cI probably wouldn\u2019t buy another car from them.\u201dVolkswagen faces a theoretical maximum government fine of $18 billion in the United States. Legal experts expect the legal penalties to be much lower, but still in the billions. Judge Breyer said that owners would also receive \u201csubstantial compensation.\u201dAnd the company could still be hit with criminal charges by the Justice Department, which is investigating Volkswagen\u2019s cheating.Under the agreement announced Thursday, the company will offset some of the environmental damage caused by the cars by investing in clean technologies. The judge did not give details about the form the investment might take.In a statement, Volkswagen said it \u201cintends to compensate its customers fully and to remediate any impact on the environment from excess diesel emissions.\u201dWhile many questions remain unanswered, the court hearing on Thursday suggested that Volkswagen and those with claims against it had made substantial progress toward a settlement that would clear up some of the company\u2019s financial uncertainty. It should also help Volkswagen restore some good will with owners of 480,000 Volkswagens and Audi A3 models with the affected 2-liter diesel engines.The models with the cheating software in the United States include Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche cars with 2-liter or 3-liter diesel engines from the model years 2008-15.Owners will have the option either to get their cars fixed so they are compliant with clean-air laws, or sell them back to the company. People who have leased vehicles will be able to cancel their contracts without penalty. But a solution for about 100,000 cars with 3-liter diesel engines, including Audi and Porsche models, has not yet been agreed to, the judge indicated.\u201cI wish we had more details, and I wish we could get back to the business of selling\u201d diesel models, said Alan Brown, owner of a Volkswagen dealership in Lewisville, Tex. \u201cBut it\u2019s great to see we\u2019ve got movement. Without customers, none of us dealers has a business.\u201dMany more European cars, over 10 million, are also affected by the Volkswagen cheating. But the company\u2019s financial fines and any consumer liabilities in Europe are not expected to be nearly as high because of differences in air-quality regulations and consumer-protection laws.Given the uncertainties over the potential costs of the United States settlement, Volkswagen has delayed earnings reports for the last two quarters. That has impaired the company\u2019s ability to raise money on debt markets because it could not provide financial information demanded by investors.And even when the details of Thursday\u2019s announced settlement emerge, the company\u2019s troubles will be far from over. It faces official investigations and possible criminal proceedings in other countries, including Britain, France, Germany and South Korea. And owners of its models in Europe, who account for a vast majority of the 11 million diesel vehicles with the cheating software, are angry that they are not receiving any compensation.Volkswagen is recalling the cars in Europe to reprogram the engine software and, in some cases, to install a plastic part that is supposed to help lower emissions. But it has balked at offering European owners money.Analysts at the investment bank UBS had estimated the total cost of the scandal for Volkswagen at 38 billion euros, or about $43.1 billion, of which \u20ac14 billion was for expenses outside the United States.Judge Breyer had given Volkswagen until Thursday to reach a settlement with the federal government and with vehicle owners in the United States. The judge had expressed dissatisfaction that the cars were still on the road emitting illegal levels of pollution seven months after the cheating became public.The defeat device allowed Volkswagen to cheat on the emissions tests in the United States by recognizing when cars were being monitored and changing the exhaust settings. In testing, the cars increased pollution controls.But on the road, pollution controls were scaled back to enhance performance and fuel mileage, and to protect emissions equipment from wear. When that happened, the cars spewed as much as 40 times the allowed amounts of nitrogen oxides, a pollutant that poses health hazards.Judge Breyer is overseeing almost all of the litigation in the United States, including claims filed by federal and state governments as well as Volkswagen owners. The company still faces separate suits by Volkswagen dealers and by dealers of competing brands, who say the cheating gave Volkswagen an unfair advantage in the market.Eric T. Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, said Thursday\u2019s announcement \u201cdoes not in any way resolve\u201d claims being pursued by a 45-state coalition, which he said would continue its investigation and pursuit of penalties. The states have not yet filed a suit against Volkswagen.Volkswagen\u2019s legal troubles were focused in the United States because limits on nitrogen oxides are more stringent and the penalties more severe than in Europe. In addition, United States law gives owners significant scope to seek redress in court.Rob Martens, a retired musician in Boulder, Colo., said he was eager to have Volkswagen buy back his 2015 Passat diesel. While he likes the car\u2019s roominess and ride, he\u2019s not happy to be driving a car that emits more pollutants than it should. On top of that, the car\u2019s electronics have given him headaches \u2014 its infotainment system often freezes up and its rearview camera sometimes goes out.\u201cThis is not what they call German engineering,\u201d Mr. Martens said. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to dump it.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Friday about Volkswagen\u2019s agreement to fix or buy back 500,000 diesel cars in the United States that are equipped with illegal emissions software misstated the number of states in a coalition that is investigating Volkswagen. It is 45, not six. Also because of an editing error, the article misstated the way the illegal software enabled cars to cheat on emissions tests. It increased the pollution controls; it did not reduce them.Neal E. Boudette contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

In the network\u2019s first year on the air in 2013, the suit asserts, citing tax returns, it had a net operating loss of $250 million, and in 2014 it lost an additional $335 million.Mr. Gupta, who is Indian, said Al Jazeera America\u2019s chief executive, Al Anstey, had reneged on a promise made by his predecessor, Ehab Al Shihabi, that would have elevated Mr. Gupta to the position of chief financial officer.Mr. Gupta also asserted that the network had tried to push him out of his job after he formally complained about Mr. Anstey. He is seeking lost wages and damages, among other things.In the suit, Mr. Gupta asserts that, among other freewheeling spending habits, the network continued to pay more than $11,000 a month for an apartment intended for Mr. Shihabi, which went empty after he was ousted last year. It also asserts that Al Jazeera America is responsible for more than $800 million in the process of winding down, if it pays out its contracts to cable operators in full.\u201cWe strongly disagree with the allegations made in Mr. Gupta\u2019s complaint, which contains many factual inaccuracies, and we intend to vigorously defend the company\u2019s position,\u201d Molly Morse, a spokeswoman for Al Jazeera America, said in a statement on Friday.She said the former network \u201cfirmly believes it acted appropriately and properly in its interactions with Mr. Gupta at all times, and Mr. Anstey has worked tirelessly to ensure that all employees were treated fairly during their employment since he came on board last year.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Trump, a barrage that threatens to undermine his candidacy even as he continues to march toward the Republican nomination.In addition to Mr. Trump\u2019s opponents, three Republican \u201csuper PACs\u201d have made it their main focus to take him down. The Club for Growth, Our Principles PAC and the American Future Fund, all unaligned with any particular candidate, have spent more than $23.5 million on negative ads against him.On Monday, Hillary Clinton crossed primary lines to add to the onslaught, releasing a commercial that highlights comments Mr. Trump has made about immigration and abortion and argues that he is trying to get Americans to turn against one another.\u201cWhat is unusual and unprecedented is the array of advertisers who are out there flogging Trump on the air,\u201d said Elizabeth Wilner, a senior vice president at Kantar Media/CMAG. \u201cYou have general election foes attacking him, you have his primary foes attacking him, and you have specific groups whose whole focus in life is just to make sure that he\u2019s not the nominee.\u201dBut despite claims that campaign advertising has lost its potency, there is growing evidence that negative ads still work \u2014 and that they are beginning to take their toll on Mr. Trump.\u201cNegative ads are never a silver bullet,\u201d Mr. Goldstein said. \u201cWhat negative ads in particular do is allow people to introduce or amplify messages that are out there with movable people.\u201dBeyond the primary battle, the surge of negative advertising could start to harm Mr. Trump\u2019s general election prospects.Mike Murphy, who was the chief strategist for Right to Rise, said the ads had kept Mr. Trump from consolidating more support in the Republican primary.\u201cI think the negative ads are having a chilling effect on his ability to grow his natural share with converts,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. However, he added, Mr. Trump\u2019s own mouth plays a role.\u201cHe creates an environment where negative ads are a little more fertile,\u201d Mr. Murphy said, adding that the ads were having more impact now that fewer candidates are in the primary race.Larry McCarthy, a Republican strategist who worked with Mr. Murphy and now produces ads for Our Principles PAC, said his group had found, through polling and focus groups, that the best way to go after Mr. Trump was to use the bombastic billionaire\u2019s own words against him.\u201cCampaigns use negative ads because they work,\u201d said Ryan Williams, a Republican strategist and vocal critic of Mr. Trump. \u201cAnd Donald Trump has provided his opponents with a bonanza of negative information to use in ads targeting his candidacy.\u201dCompounding the risks for Mr. Trump is that he has done little to counteract the effort with his own spending. He has spent just over $16 million on television ads, and in later contests, he went on the air late or not at all. A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump, Hope Hicks, did not respond to an email requesting comment.Mr. Williams, who worked on Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign, recalled how allies of President Obama aired a devastating ad that eviscerated Mr. Romney\u2019s character. It was paired with the Obama campaign\u2019s own ads, which began running in the late spring and stayed on the air through the election.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.Mr. Romney, who was still duking it out in his own primary campaign, did not start airing ads in earnest until the fall. By then, he was well defined in the public\u2019s eye.\u201cPresident Obama\u2019s super PAC ran an ad that basically accused Mitt Romney of giving a woman cancer,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cThe ads were outrageous, offensive and widely panned by the media and fact checkers. But unfortunately, with several million dollars behind them, they were effective in damaging his image.\u201dBut in those cases, the targets were easier: Neither Mr. Rubio nor Mr. Christie was particularly well known at a granular level among voters, so new information helped shape voters\u2019 perceptions. Mr. Trump is an established brand for many people, which means that damaging his reputation is likely to require a more concentrated effort.To that end, Priorities USA \u2014 the super PAC supporting Mrs. Clinton, which also backed Mr. Obama in 2012 \u2014 has begun reserving $70 million in television ad time from the Democratic convention in late July through Election Day, air time that is almost certain to be dedicated to ravaging Mr. Trump if he is the nominee.Steve Murphy, a veteran Democratic ad maker, said that Mr. Trump should view the primaries as a mere taste of what is to come.\u201cAsk Donald Trump if he thinks negative ads hurt him in Wisconsin,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. \u201cThen tell him the Democrats have another half a billion dollars\u2019 worth ready to go in the general.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Winds From Washington Chill Wall Street\u2019s Deal Making", "Date": "2016-04-14", "News": "Supported byOn Wall Street, the phones have been a little quieter. The workload has been a little lighter. The happy hours have been starting earlier.For most people, that would be a good thing. But not for deal-hungry lawyers and bankers, who are experiencing a recent slowdown in megadeals. A series of broken transactions and stock-market volatility have shaken the confidence of some in the boardroom to tackle their next big acquisition.The value of abandoned deals has been higher than that of newly signed deals in the United States so far this year. Almost $340 billion worth of mergers have been withdrawn in 2016, while $282 billion worth of newly signed deals were announced, according to data compiled by Dealogic. The cancellations are skewed toward megadeals, defined as those worth $10 billion or more.The divergence in the deal market comes largely as a result of a regulatory clampdown.Over the last year, with shareholder encouragement, companies ventured into large, complex and risky deals. Last week, the government fought back, in a lawsuit by the Justice Department and new rules from the Treasury Department, to stop many of the transactions.One lawyer described a depression that set over mergers and acquisitions as a result of those two actions. A banker said that Wall Street had come to a grinding halt. These deal makers requested anonymity, so as not to be seen at odds with the government\u2019s decisions.During an election year, advisers say, the big, politically unpopular deals may just have to wait.\u201cCompanies were concerned that their large deals would draw political focus and be criticized as part of the campaigning,\u201d Marc-Anthony Hourihan, co-head of Americas mergers and acquisitions at UBS, said.Robert A. Profusek, who heads Jones Day\u2019s global mergers and acquisitions practice, said, \u201cThe gargantuan deals, they\u2019re harder; there\u2019s no question in my mind.\u201d\u201cThe government has been tougher, but they would say: \u2018That\u2019s because you guys have been jamming these giant deals at us. What do you expect us to do?\u2019\u201d Mr. Profusek said.There is plenty of blame to go around. Bankers and executives would argue that with little global economic growth, mergers have been the best way for companies to jump-start their businesses. Lately, though, they say there has been more uncertainty about what the government will and will not approve, resulting in an abatement in activity.That has been a concern for months, some say, and last week\u2019s government actions, and subsequent deal terminations, merely provided validation.The law firm Kirkland & Ellis said in a note on Wednesday, \u201cThe proposed regulations are so far-reaching that, if finalized in their current form, they likely will affect the way every multinational corporate group with a U.S. presence does business.\u201dThe firm was referring to new rules regarding so-called earnings stripping, in which an American subsidiary borrows from its foreign parent and uses interest costs from the loan to help shrink its United States tax bill.The drug makers Pfizer and Allergan called off their merger as a result of the new rules, which also essentially disqualified Allergan as a merger partner for Pfizer because it had made a few too many inversions.But ever-optimistic bankers say there is opportunity to be had in all of this. After Pfizer\u2019s and Allergan\u2019s deal was terminated, pharmaceutical stocks rallied as investors speculated which companies would become the next targets. And the factors that led to such rampant deal making last year \u2014 slower growth and cheap financing \u2014 have not gone away.It just may be the smaller companies that feel more confident in pulling the trigger.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it a day yet on the M.&A. wave,\u201d said Mr. Profusek of Jones Day.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "18 Philippine Soldiers Killed in Firefight With Militant Group", "Date": "2016-04-10", "News": "Supported byMANILA \u2014 At least 18 soldiers were killed and more than 50 wounded in a gun battle in the southern Philippines between government forces and the militant group Abu Sayyaf, military officials said Sunday.Among the militants, the dead included a Moroccan bomb maker and the son of a rebel leader, the military said. It also said more than 20 rebels were believed to have been wounded, but offered no additional details.The firefight took place on Saturday on the southwestern island of Basilan and lasted 10 hours, the military said. The day before, Abu Sayyaf had released Rolando del Torchio, a former Italian missionary turned restaurateur who was kidnapped from his pizzeria in the southern Philippine city of Dipolog in October.At least 20 other foreign citizens are still being held by the group.The military did not make a connection on Sunday between the release of Mr. del Torchio and the gun battle, other than that both involved factions of Abu Sayyaf.A group of soldiers hunting for members of Abu Sayyaf near the small town of Tipo-Tipo was attacked at 8 a.m. on Saturday, said Capt. Filemon Tan, a spokesman for the military. Among the soldiers wounded in the ensuing fighting, he said, six were in critical condition.Captain Tan said that among the dead was a Moroccan, Mohammad Khattab, whom he described as a \u201cbomb instructor and Islamic jihadist preacher who was trying to organize and unite local lawless armed groups to link with international terrorist groups, as well as spread radicalism and extremism.\u201dAbu Sayyaf and other rebel groups in the southern Philippines have released videos on YouTube proclaiming their allegiance to the Islamic State, but the Philippine military has said that the militants are simply admirers of the international terrorist group and that there is no indication they are receiving financing, expertise or other support from it.On Sunday, the Philippine defense secretary, Voltaire Gazmin, and the chief of staff of the military, Gen. Hernando Iriberri, flew to Zamboanga City, near Basilan Island, to assess the situation and visit the wounded, Captain Tan said. Neither official addressed whether the slain Moroccan was believed to have had links to the Islamic State.On April 1, Abu Sayyaf abducted four Malaysian sailors in the southern Philippines, less than a week after kidnapping 10 Indonesians from a cargo ship in the same area. In September, it kidnapped two Canadians, a Norwegian and a Filipino from a resort in the southern Philippines. A Dutch bird-watcher and a Japanese treasure hunter are also being held by the group.Ransom demands have been made for all of those being held, according to the military. It is unclear if any money was paid for Mr. del Torchio\u2019s release, but security analysts say that ransom is usually the only path to freedom for hostages held by Abu Sayyaf, short of a successful rescue mission.The Philippines signed a preliminary peace deal in 2012 with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, the largest Muslim separatist group in the Philippines, but the deal did not include Abu Sayyaf.Advertisement"}

In particular, neighbors have been rankled by what they say are unsavory characters and behaviors \u2014 prostitution, fights and drugs \u2014 that the hotel\u2019s low prices and loose policies draw to their sleepy neighborhood.\u201cPrince Hotel has long been a notorious hot spot for drug dealing and prostitution, made worse by a slew of Building Code violations and zoning-related problems,\u201d Austin Finan, a spokesman for Mayor Bill de Blasio, said in an email. \u201cFor too long, the property has impinged on local residents\u2019 quality of life.\u201dAccording to the city, the hotel has amassed hundreds of thousands of dollars in unpaid fines for various code violations.The Prince was originally a 20-unit apartment building, according to the New York City Buildings Department. Over the years it has been sliced into ever smaller compartments and rented out by the day or month. There are now over 40 rooms, but the entire building has had no certificate of occupancy since a temporary one expired in the 1980s. It has still managed to keep operating, while piling up fines.In past interviews regarding troubles at his hotels over the years, including prostitution at the Prince in Clinton Hill, Mr. Fried, who is Jewish, has repeatedly said that his faith would not allow him to condone such activities and that he was not responsible when they occurred. Instead, he blamed nefarious staff members or bad residents.Vincent J. Gentile, the city councilman who represents Bay Ridge, dismissed such explanations, pointing to similar problems at all of Mr. Fried\u2019s properties. \u201cWe are the victims of Moses Fried,\u201d Mr. Gentile said. \u201cThis community is the victim.\u201dBut the Prince in Bay Ridge has its loyalists. About a half-dozen people call it their permanent home, said one resident, who declined to give her name, citing neighbors\u2019 revulsion at the building and its occupants. She has lived there 37 years, she said, in a one-bedroom unit without a kitchen and with a bathroom across the hall; she said she paid less than $200 a month.The fate of the few residents should the Prince close is unclear.\u201cAny hotel is going to have something sometimes,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you don\u2019t go off the deep end with it, \u2018Oh, we have to close it down!\u2019 Where do we go from here? Where do we go with high rents?\u201dIn the past two years, there have been 70 calls to 911 involving the address, according to the New York Police Department, for complaints that included fights and disorderly persons. \u201cEvery iteration of the neighborhood for the past couple of decades has had a problem with this place,\u201d said Justin Brannan, 37, a lifelong resident who, like many, has called for the hotel to shape up or close.The Prince drew renewed attention when the city announced plans for a new prekindergarten on 93rd Street, just a few steps from the Prince, leading to fears of small children mingling with the people that the hotel supposedly draws.In February, Mayor de Blasio held a town-hall-style session in Bay Ridge. During the meeting, a resident asked what steps the mayor was taking about the Prince \u2014 the hotel had been under investigation for months following a concerted push by Community Board 10, which for years has compiled a dossier of the Prince\u2019s problems. A day after the session, deputies from the Brooklyn sheriff\u2019s office raided the building, for which nearly $400,000 is owed for code violations, according to the city\u2019s Finance Department.The auction, scheduled for June 8, is intended to ensure that the city is paid what it is owed, and possibly to lead to the replacement of the Prince.For now, the hotel, with its pretty lobby of chandeliers and ceiling fresco of the zodiac in gold, is still operating, advertising rates of $75 to $95 a night, and receiving a polarized mix of pleased and disgusted reviews from customers on rating sites like Yelp.\u201cYou may see people who look shady,\u201d said a man in the lobby recently who gave his name as Vinny Borgese, 40, and said he had been coming to the Prince every month for over 15 years, but refused to say what his profession was or why he was in the neighborhood so regularly.\u201cBut it\u2019s clean,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing bad to say going on here. It\u2019s a good hotel.\u201d He grabbed a towel from the concierge and headed to his room.Advertisement"}

The scene is a more elegant demonstration of Richie\u2019s thrill-seeking nature than his vacuum-cleaner approach to cocaine. Even though his marriage is on the line, he doesn\u2019t care at that moment: he\u2019s got a bat to catch. He\u2019s so vigorous with the tennis racket that he catches Billy in the forehead and makes him bleed. After Richie downs the winged mammal with an overhead smash like he\u2019s Jimmy Connors, he and Billy stare at each other, their collective triumph dissipating as they remember they are competitors for Devon. Billy wordlessly backs out of the room.The attempted reconciliation with Devon goes poorly: Richie\u2019s upset by her affair with Billy and the prominent display of a photograph she took of the TV he smashed with a guitar, while she remembers all too well why she left him. When he puts his hand on her throat, it\u2019s a reminder of the intimacy they shared and also an implicit physical threat.\u201cVinyl\u201d is gaining confidence in its storytelling as the series progresses. While the show still has plenty of over-the-top moments where it tries to funnel emotions through a Marshall stack, it now lets many of its scenes, like the silent staring contest between Richie and Billy, play on a human scale. One of the best moments in this episode is a short one where the top American Century executives discuss how to work within the budget constraints of mob financing, dealing with it matter-of-factly, like the exchange rates for a Canadian pressing plant.Consider the episode\u2019s other love triangle, between Jamie and the two principal Nasty Bits, Kip and Alex. Jamie\u2019s finally been thrown out of her aunt\u2019s apartment (probably at her mother\u2019s behest), with her possessions in garbage bags on the sidewalk. Despite a lecture from Andrea on the inadvisability of sleeping with an artist she\u2019s the A&R rep for, she ends up crashing at Kip\u2019s place. When Kip is uncooperative during the photo session for the band\u2019s album cover, the guitarist Alex argues with him and then saves the day by submitting to a haircut from Kip; Jamie flirtatiously thanks Alex.Later on, it feels very natural, in that sybaritic 1973 way, for the three of them to end up in bed together. But what makes it more than a gratuitous pay-cable sex scene is the look on Kip\u2019s face late at night, gazing regretfully at the nude bodies of Jamie and Alex as they sleep wrapped around each other. Since that the emotional connection between Kip and Alex seems much more intense than his relationship with Jamie does; it\u2019s not clear whose arms he\u2019d rather be in. A relationship tip from the \u201cVinyl\u201d creative team: Even when a love triangle is consummated by all three parties simultaneously, it can still be a competition.You didn\u2019t have the decency to change the sheets\u2022 When Zak gets a phone call from the Vegas casino where he and Richie stayed, offering to fly him back on a private plane as a high roller, he realizes that he didn\u2019t lose the money from the sale of the American Century jet: Richie gambled it away. In a fury, Zak pummels Richie in the elevator until they tumble into the lobby of the Brill Building.\u2022 Richie returns to the Chelsea and tells Devon, in a mixture of confession and self-justification, that he killed a man and has been abusing drugs because he was trying to protect her from the truth.\u2022 As Maury Gold sets up camp in the American Century offices, he proposes releasing a compilation of his 1950s hits, capitalizing on nostalgia for the decade. It\u2019s completely wrong for a label trying to rebrand itself as modern, but under the financial thumb of the mobster Galasso, Richie agrees.\u2022 Andrea says that she can lure Hannibal back to American Century, since he hasn\u2019t signed his new contract yet. But there\u2019s an unanticipated complication as he has impregnated Cece and dumped her.\u2022 Looking to cut costs, American Century decides to drop the R&B band Indigo. Clark and his mailroom pal Jorge take a copy of the album to the D.J. at their favorite underground dance club, and \u2014 in a moment that would be tense except that Clark is such a dweeb \u2014 discover that the label has a potential hit on its hands.\u2022 After Richie spends the weekend in jail, the feds put the squeeze on him, telling him he can become an informant and feed them information about Galasso or stand trial for the murder of Buck Rogers. At the end of the episode, knowing he\u2019s making a very dangerous choice, Richie takes the deal.Advertisement"}

A ruling in this case, experts say, could also help establish powerful guidelines for what constitutes acceptable corporate behavior.\u201cUp until now, we just have not had judicial decisions that help us consider these sorts of relationships,\u201d said Sara Seck, an expert on corporate social responsibility at the Faculty of Law, Western University, in London, Ontario. \u201cFor once, the court is going to look at what really happened here, and that is important.\u201dThe behavior of multinational companies working in poor countries has come under increasing fire in recent years. Social expectations have changed, experts say, with many citizens of rich countries demanding that corporations be more responsible in the countries where they operate.In Canada, efforts to define a code of good behavior for extractive corporations are longstanding, if so far unsuccessful. Many mining companies are based there because Canada offers a concentration of expertise in mining finance and law, and the government offers incentives including tax breaks.A bill that would have created an ombudsman to investigate complaints and deny access to government loans \u2014 and even consular services \u2014 to companies accused of behaving poorly failed by a narrow margin in 2010 after facing fierce opposition from the extractive industry. John McKay, a member of Parliament from the Liberal Party who sponsored that bill, said he expected Canada\u2019s new government to try again soon.\u201cThere are companies out there doing things that they would never do in their own countries,\u201d he said.At the same time, the report said, local people were being injured, arrested or, in some cases, killed for protesting.Victims, however, have had little success gaining access to Canadian courts. Their lawyers have often tried to get cases heard on the basis of violations of human rights or international criminal law. But most were told that Canada had no jurisdiction, and that their claims would be more appropriately heard in the country where the events took place, even if that country\u2019s courts were notoriously corrupt or otherwise dysfunctional.The lawyers for the plaintiffs in the Hudbay case, Murray Klippenstein and Cory Wanless, took a novel approach, however, making a simpler claim. They said the Canadian parent company was negligent for failing to put an effective monitoring system in place to understand what its Guatemalan subsidiary was doing. Framing the claim in this way allowed the plaintiffs to draw a clear connection between the negligence and Canada.In addition to the claims brought by Mrs. Caal and the other women who say they were raped in Lote Ocho, Hudbay, based in Toronto, is facing claims over the death of a prominent local leader, Adolfo Ich Cham\u00e1n, 50, and the shooting and paralysis of a bystander, German Chub, 28, during demonstrations against mining in the nearby town of El Estor in 2009.Hudbay lawyers moved to have the case dismissed both because of jurisdictional grounds and because it was \u201cplain and obvious\u201d that the claims would fail. Before the ruling on jurisdiction, they dropped that claim and went forward with the other one. In July 2013, however, the judge ruled it was not obvious that the claims were without merit.Turning to the courts has not been easy for the plaintiffs, most of whom speak only Q\u2019eqchi\u2019, a Mayan language, have had little or no schooling, and find the prospect of going to Canada terrifying. In addition, they face animosity from a sizable portion of the local population, particularly in El Estor, where there is a giant nickel processing plant. Hudbay officials dispute most of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. They say that no mining security officials were present during the Lote Ocho evictions and that no rapes took place. The company\u2019s website also points out that at the time, Hudbay had nothing to do with the mine. It was owned by Compa\u00f1\u00eda Guatemalteca de N\u00edquel, a subsidiary of another Canadian company, Skye Resources Inc., which Hudbay bought in 2008, assuming its liabilities. Hudbay has since sold the mine.Hudbay officials also maintain that there was no negligence in 2009 when it did own the mine. Officials say the killing of Mr. Ich, a teacher, and the shooting of Mr. Chub, a farmer, took place as the mine\u2019s security guards were defending themselves from armed protesters.But some recent events appear to lend credence to the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. The head of the mine\u2019s security during the 2007 evictions and the 2009 shootings, a former army colonel named Mynor Padilla, is now on trial in Guatemala over the shooting of Mr. Ich and Mr. Chub.Moreover, an army officer and a paramilitary officer were convicted in February of raping and enslaving indigenous women in the 1980s, during Guatemala\u2019s long civil war, suggesting, some advocates say, that such behavior has long been entrenched in this country. During the war between the United States-backed government and leftist rebels, the indigenous population in this region was repeatedly attacked for trying to make land claims.Even now, the local Q\u2019eqchi\u2019 population believes much of the land in the area belongs to it, and not to the mining company.At the time of Mrs. Caal\u2019s eviction, there was no mining anywhere near Lote Ocho, but mining officials moved to evict the villagers anyway. The community is made up of about a dozen scattered, flimsy wooden houses, home to about 100 people, most of them children.There is no electricity here or a school for the children. The village is a bumpy 45-minute ride in a pickup truck uphill from the nearest town. But that costs money, so most of the villagers walk there using a footpath, which takes about two hours.Mrs. Caal said the armed men who attacked her during the eviction were so brutal with her that she could not get up from the spot where they had left her. But when her husband asked what had happened to her, she told him only that she had fallen, afraid of how he might react.It is still a subject she turns to reluctantly.\u201cRemembering is reliving,\u201d Mrs. Caal said. \u201cIt hurts. It hurts as a woman.\u201d Advertisement"}

Ms. Musk laughed, her blue-gray eyes twinkling.Ms. von Furstenberg\u2019s team had dressed her that afternoon. Tina Brown walked by, absorbed in her smartphone. \u201cThey both invited me,\u201d Ms. Musk whispered of Ms. Brown and Ms. von Furstenberg. \u201cI hope I get to meet them tonight.\u201d\u201cI was famous until Elon became famous,\u201d Ms. Musk said, half-joking, over oatmeal at Caf\u00e9 Luxembourg the day before.\u201cWe are at a point where people are demanding diversity and inclusion,\u201d said Ivan Bart, president of IMG Models, which has begun representing Ms. Musk. He added, \u201cPeople want to see age and size because that is who their friends are.\u201dBut his client\u2019s motivation is simpler. \u201cI just want to work,\u201d she said.She was born in Regina, Saskatchewan, in 1948, a twin and one of five children, and moved with her family to Pretoria, South Africa, in 1950. Her parents, Joshua and Wyn Haldeman, had a thriving chiropractic practice and a thirst for adventure. In 1952, the couple flew 22,000 miles around the world in a plane Mr. Haldeman brought in pieces from Canada.Her mother prepared maps and slide shows of the trips, which she shared with ladies\u2019 groups and other travelers. \u201cMy parents were very famous, but they were never snobs,\u201d Ms. Musk said.In 1970, she married Errol Musk, an engineer she had met in high school, and a year later, Elon was born, followed by another son, Kimbal, and a daughter, Tosca. Ms. Musk earned a master\u2019s degree in dietetics from the University of the Orange Free State in South Africa. (And later another in nutritional sciences from the University of Toronto.)She worked at home, counseling nutrition clients, while modeling for extra money. The marriage, though, lasted barely nine years, and Ms. Musk left Pretoria for Durban, a coastal town. \u201cI think it\u2019s tougher being in an unhappy marriage,\u201d she said, than being a single mother.In his teens, Elon moved to Pretoria to live with his father, followed by Kimbal. \u201cI think, at the end of the day, she was very hurt,\u201d said Tosca, 41, who stayed with her mother. Ms. Musk would say only that it was \u201csad,\u201d and that their relationship is now good. Kimbal and Elon were not made available for interviews, but in statements Kimbal called his mother \u201camazing\u201d and \u201cdynamic\u201d; Elon chose \u201cawesome.\u201dWith South Africa in upheaval over its apartheid policy, Elon wanted to pursue his interest in technology in Canada, where Ms. Musk\u2019s relatives lived and where she was still a citizen. To pay for his trip to Toronto, Ms. Musk said she sold stock she gave Elon when he was born. \u201cI got a collect call,\u201d she recalled. \u201cHe said: \u2018I\u2019m at the airport. What do I do now?\u2019\u201d Their Canadian relatives weren\u2019t home. \u201cI told him to go to the Y.M.C.A.\u201dShe moved with Tosca to a rent-controlled apartment in Toronto a year later. \u201cWe were not wildly rich people; people forget that,\u201d said Tosca, now a filmmaker living in Los Angeles. Kimbal, a restaurateur and investor, joined his siblings soon after.\u201cThe children knew they wouldn\u2019t have a future in South Africa,\u201d said Julia Perry, Ms. Musk\u2019s longtime stylist.Elon and Kimbal asked their mother to move to San Francisco in 1996, where they started Zip2, a software company. \u201cI was lonely there,\u201d she said. Her children threw her a 50th birthday party at the home of an investor. \u201cJulia flew into San Francisco and said, \u2018We have to get you a nice dress,\u2019\u201d recalled Ms. Musk, adding she told her, \u201c\u2018I can\u2019t afford this.\u2019\u201dMs. Perry had a dress made for Ms. Musk, she said, a gift she believed was from her children. \u201cThey gave me a tiny wooden house and wooden car,\u201d she said. \u201cThey said, \u2018Someday we will buy you a house and a car.\u2019\u201d She now drives a Tesla and owned an apartment in New York for 13 years before moving to Los Angeles in 2013 after visiting Tosca, who had just had twins on her own.Now the Musk family gets together for regular dinners, often at home because Elon is interrupted when they go out. Ms. Musk says she gets at least 100 requests a month from people who want to meet her son.\u201cIt\u2019s all about a pitch,\u201d she said. \u201cI had a New York photographer Facebook Messenger me yesterday and said, \u2018Let\u2019s get together for coffee.\u2019\u201d She hadn\u2019t seen him in six years and asked why. \u201cHe said, \u2018I have a project I want to run by you,\u2019 and I know what that means,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a project he wants Elon to finance.\u201d Ms. Musk politely deferred the request.But being Elon\u2019s mother also has its perks. Last September, Ms. Musk and Nell Rebowe, another model, attended the Banana Republic presentation during New York Fashion Week. There, Charlotte McKinney, the curvaceous GQ cover girl and Carl\u2019s Jr. pitchwoman, walked in with a friend, Zachary Scott, a 26-year-old technology entrepreneur.\u201cNell,\u201d Ms. Musk said she told her friend, \u201cwe have to get a photo with her because it will increase our Instagram followers. I thought: \u2018Oh gosh. I am really going to drop Elon\u2019s name. How else are we going to get a photo?\u2019\u201dMs. Musk was introduced to Mr. Scott. \u201cDo you know Elon Musk?\u201d she asked, adding, \u201cHe\u2019s my son.\u201d Mr. Scott shouted to Ms. McKinney. \u201cThis is Elon Musk\u2019s mother!\u201d\u201cI saw she had 15 agencies in markets all over the world,\u201d Mr. Scott said. \u201cSo I sent her an email and said: \u2018Are you happy with your agencies? They are all small and I think you could have better representation.\u2019\u201dModeling in Los Angeles is tough: fewer fashion shoots, more actresses increasing the competition. \u201cShe knew I was obsessed with Elon,\u201d Mr. Scott said. \u201cBut then she said she was having to go to casting calls and sit in a lawn chair, and I thought: \u2018This is crazy. You\u2019re Maye Musk. How could they treat you that way?\u2019\u201dHe agreed to be her business manager, teaming with Marlon Stoltzman, a fashion agent from South Africa who manages Candice Swanepoel. Mr. Scott said he renegotiated Ms. Musk\u2019s outstanding contracts and began searching for a new home.Mr. Bart of IMG Models started getting calls from agents and others about Ms. Musk last December, and met with her soon after at Chateau Marmont in West Hollywood, Calif.\u201cShe was vocal about wanting to elevate her brand,\u201d he said. But though Ms. Musk is interested in promoting fitness and health, she said she would not take a modeling job that would embarrass her 10 grandchildren. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to see grandma naked,\u201d she said.\u201cShe is the sort of person that it does not matter if it is Vogue or catalog work,\u201d Mr. Bart said. \u201cShe loves to be in the studio. And that is what we are going to do.\u201dOn a recent Monday, Ms. Musk met with Ms. Perry at the design office of Yuna Yang, who is creating Ms. Musk\u2019s outfit for the Met Gala. With the evening\u2019s theme technological, Ms. Yang had constructed an electric-blue pantsuit and cape embellished with brocade, lace and airy ostrich feathers, to be worn with nude Ferragamo heels. Ms. Musk ducked behind a rack of dresses to slip into the outfit, which Ms. Yang and an assistant adjusted to fit her shape.They debated whether she should wear a one-piece undergarment. \u201cI\u2019ve done the jumpsuit thing,\u201d Ms. Musk said. \u201cIt takes a half-hour to take it off, and then people think you got lost.\u201dShe held up her finger. She smiled and shifted her hip. She pouted like a schoolgirl.\u201cThis is my party,\u201d she said, and beamed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Clampdown in China Restricts 7,000 Foreign Organizations", "Date": "2016-04-28", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 China took a major step on Thursday in President Xi Jinping\u2019s drive to impose greater control and limit Western influences on Chinese society, as it passed a new law restricting the work of foreign organizations and their local partners, mainly through police supervision.More than 7,000 foreign nongovernment groups will be affected, according to state news reports.Foreign groups working across Chinese civil society \u2014 on issues including the environment, philanthropy and cultural exchanges, and possibly even in education and business \u2014 will now have to find an official Chinese sponsor and must register with the police. This also applies to groups from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau.Those organizations that do not receive official approval will be forced to stop operating in the country. Many groups will probably curtail or eliminate programs deemed politically sensitive, such as training lawyers, in order to remain.Groups that may have a hard time getting approval include those promoting workers\u2019 rights, ethnic equality and religious freedoms.Mr. Xi makes loud pronouncements about ideology, and is expected to enact other sweeping security laws. He has departed sharply from the direction of several of his predecessors, who for decades guided China in seeking out foreign expertise to modernize society. (He did, though, send his own daughter to Harvard.)Countries including the United States began campaigning for Beijing to scrap or drastically change the proposed law. Universities also weighed in, since vague wording in early drafts indicated that educational institutions could be affected. Business associations raised objections as well.In China, where the domestic security apparatus has enormous power, the police could do that anyway, but foreign groups fear that the police will monitor their activities with much greater vigor given this newly formalized authority. The law states that any employee of such a group can be interrogated at any time.In addition, such groups must find an official Chinese partner organization. The law does not define what kinds of Chinese groups will be approved partners, and it is unclear how that determination will be made and by whom. Foreign groups fear that Chinese organizations will not want to take the risk.\u201cI think more important than the law itself will be its implementation, and I think overseas NGOs now need to turn their focus to how they can be involved in the implementation process, which will be long and drawn out,\u201d said Shawn Shieh, a deputy director at the China Labor Bulletin in Hong Kong who closely tracks the work of nongovernment groups in China.The Public Security Ministry will need to hire staff members and take other steps to enact the law, he said, \u201cand overseas NGOs will need to communicate frequently with Public Security, educate them and maybe even provide services such as workshops, trainings and advice on how to manage NGOs and their projects and activities in China.\u201dSome officials in Beijing have characterized foreign nongovernment groups as \u201cblack hands\u201d working to undermine one-party rule in the country. Those suspicions have grown under Mr. Xi.Officials have accused such groups of instigating the pro-democracy Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong and protests in Tibet, as well as trying to quietly usher Chinese society toward Western ways via what Mao Zedong called a \u201cpeaceful evolution.\u201d\u201cThe foreign NGO management law is like many other Xi-era initiatives: yet another tool to legalize human rights abuses,\u201d said Sophie Richardson, the China director at Human Rights Watch.Xinhua, the state news agency, said this week that the third draft of the law included a new phrase that broadly defined the groups affected by the law \u2014 groups \u201csuch as foundations, social groups or think tanks.\u201dThe draft also said that academic and research groups and hospitals would be beholden to \u201crelevant provisions of national law.\u201dXinhua interpreted that to mean that those organizations might not fall under the new law, since foreigners had expressed concern over the potential harm to academic programs.China has not had regulations allowing for the registration of foreign nongovernment organizations, so almost all such groups have been operating here in a legal gray area.Foreign legal experts say China should have a law that approves the work of such groups. But from a civil society perspective, they say, it makes no sense for the Ministry of Public Security, rather than the Civil Affairs Ministry, to be the regulator.A few foreign nongovernment groups, including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, do operate with official sanction in China now, but they will still need to comply with the mandatory police registration.Certain types of nongovernment organizations \u2014 like groups that work with Chinese human rights activists or lawyers \u2014 will have little chance of finding an official partner or registering with the police.Beijing is already suspicious of foreign and Chinese nongovernment organizations that receive funding from outside sources deemed politically suspect, like the National Endowment for Democracy and the Open Society Foundations, both based in the United States. Groups that operate here with any financing from those sources will be even more vulnerable under the new law.The passage of the law also raises questions of whether more mainstream foreign nongovernment organizations will independently decide to cut certain programs, like initiatives promoting government transparency, or self-censor to secure a Chinese partner and register with the police.The bar association has a small office in Beijing that runs a rule-of-law program, although the headquarters said in a statement on Monday that its employees in China had no say in the decision.Advertisement"}

Joshua Rosenkranz, a lawyer for Mr. Kirtsaeng, told the justices that there was more to the analysis than \u201cjust trying to punish those who took unreasonable positions.\u201d The Copyright Act, he said, also sought to ensure that people sued for copyright infringement did not fold at the outset.\u201cIt wanted to encourage parties to advance important principles even where the other side\u2019s arguments are good; indeed, I would say, especially where the other side\u2019s arguments are good,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen a defendant is trying to decide whether to fight for a principle, the availability of attorneys\u2019 fees can make all the difference in that decision, and in turn can make all the difference in whether the public\u2019s rights are vindicated.\u201dSeveral justices appeared unpersuaded by the argument. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg asked whether Mr. Kirtsaeng might just as easily have been dissuaded from mounting a defense for fear of having to pay the publisher\u2019s legal fees.The empty seat left by Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death leaves the court with two basic options for cases left on the docket this term if the justices are deadlocked at 4 to 4.Justice Elena Kagan agreed.

{"Headline": "Will You Sprint, Stroll or Stumble Into a Career?", "Date": "2016-04-05", "News": "Supported byAt the age of 18, G. Stanley Hall left his home in the tiny village of Ashfield, Mass., for Williams College, just 35 miles away, with a goal to \u201cdo something and be something in the world.\u201d His mother wanted him to become a minister, but the young Stanley wasn\u2019t sure about that plan. He saw a four-year degree as a chance to explore.Though Hall excelled at Williams, his parents, who were farmers, considered his undergraduate years a bit erratic. He didn\u2019t think he had the requirements for a pastor, but nonetheless enrolled in Union Theological Seminary in New York after graduation. The big city was intoxicating, and living there persuaded him to abandon his religious studies. After securing a loan, he set off for Germany to study philosophy, travel and visit the theaters, bars and dance halls of Berlin.\u201cWhat exactly are you doing over there?\u201d his father sternly asked. Hall added physiology and physics to his academic pursuits and told his parents he was thinking about getting a Ph.D. in philosophy. \u201cJust what is a Doctor of Philosophy?\u201d his mother wanted to know.His parents wanted him to come home and get a real job, and even Hall, having \u201cscarcely tried my hand in the world to know where I can do anything,\u201d wondered what was next. He was out of money and in debt, so he returned home after his parents refused to support him financially. He was 27 years old.Hall\u2019s story is similar to that of many young Americans today. They go off to college, resist pressures to choose a job-connected major, then drift after graduation, often short of money and any real plan. But here\u2019s the difference: Stanley Hall grew up in a totally different America, the one of the mid-1800s.We think this kind of lengthy takeoff is relatively new, but even in the 19th and early 20th centuries, when the economy offered fewer career choices, there were college graduates who roamed through their third decade of life. Hall was an outlier, of course, as most of his generation launched into adulthood right after high school, if they even went. But his story might serve to lessen the anxiety of today\u2019s parents about their own children\u2019s long stumble toward independence: Stanley Hall went on to great success.He eventually earned an advanced degree in psychology, taught at Antioch College, Harvard and Johns Hopkins and became president of Clark University in Massachusetts, where he developed a fascination with the period in life between childhood and adulthood. He founded the American Psychological Association and in 1904 wrote an influential book about a new life stage he called \u201cadolescence.\u201dHall described this transitional period \u2014 between ages 14 and 24 \u2014 as full of \u201cstorm and stress.\u201d But in reality, the adolescent stage in the early 1900s was much shorter than Hall imagined. Teenagers were able to get a solid full-time job right after high school, followed quickly by marriage and parenthood. It wasn\u2019t until around the middle of the last century that the job market began requiring that a college degree be added to the equation, and with the G.I. Bill allowing returning World War II veterans to go for free, enrollments boomed.That postwar era cemented in our minds an idea that remains to this day: Teenagers graduate from high school, earn a college degree, secure a job, and move out of their childhood home \u2014 all by the age of 22 or so.But by the 1960s, as Americans started spending more time in college, the trend of a relatively quick launch to adulthood was ending. Census figures show that the number of 19- to 24-year-olds living with their parents started edging up, from 30 percent in 1960, to 35 percent in 1980, to 47 percent today.The difference between the \u201cboomerang generation\u201d of the 1960s and 1970s and now is that manufacturing was still the foundation of the economy, allowing more than one pathway to solid middle-class jobs. The 1970s marked the last full decade when a large slice of the population didn\u2019t need a college degree for financial success. The recession of the early 1980s effectively killed off manufacturing, and with the next decade\u2019s technology revolution, the wage premium for attending college started to speed up, turning into a runaway train. In 1983, the wage premium \u2014 how much more a typical bachelor\u2019s degree recipient earns compared to a high school graduate \u2014 was 42 percent. Today, it surpasses 80 percent.The huge run-up in the number of undergraduate and graduate students \u2014 eight million more than in 1980, according to the National Center for Education Statistics \u2014 has led to further delays in passing the milestones of adulthood, forever changing how we view the transition from education to the work force. In the 1980s, college graduates achieved financial independence, defined as reaching the median wage, by the time they turned 26, according to Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Education and the Workforce. In 2014, they didn\u2019t hit that mark until their 30th birthday.In the 1990s, Jeffrey Jenson Arnett, a psychology professor at the University of Missouri, interviewed young people around the country and determined that his subjects felt both grown up and not quite so grown up at exactly the same time. This led Dr. Arnett to conclude that the period between 18 and 25 was a distinct stage separate from both adolescence and young adulthood. In 2000, he published a paper defining this slice of life as \u201cemerging adulthood,\u201d a phrase that immediately entered the cultural lexicon, especially for parents trying to figure out why their children were struggling to launch into adulthood.\u201cEmerging adulthood is a time of life when many different directions remain possible,\u201d Dr. Arnett wrote, \u201cwhen little about the future has been decided for certain, when the scope of independent exploration of life\u2019s possibilities is greater for most people than it will be at any other period of the life course.\u201dBy the time I caught up with Dr. Arnett, he had moved to Clark University. In the fall of 2014, 14 years after he had coined the term, I was curious whether the journey to adulthood was getting even longer.\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he said. \u201cThe changes that are happening are permanent structural changes that have only sped up all over the world.\u201d The biggest change, he said, is the move to an information economy that requires even more education and job-hopping in one\u2019s 20s.In the journey to adulthood, they are either Sprinters, Wanderers or Stragglers.Sprinters start fast right out of the gate. They pick a major early on and stick with it, enabling a progression of internships that look more and more impressive with each year. Some have the perfect job lined up on graduation; others are laserlike in their focus, moving from job to job up the career ladder. They have little or no student-loan debt, freeing them to pick job opportunities without regard to pay.But speed alone doesn\u2019t define this group. Some are slow but methodical, assembling the building blocks for a successful career by investing in their own human capital, perhaps in graduate or professional school, before hitting the job market.Lily Cua is a classic Sprinter. Well before she got her degree in finance from Georgetown University, she secured a plum position as a consultant with PricewaterhouseCoopers. The job came as so many do these days, from a summer internship. The recruiter, a Georgetown alumnus, was impressed with her Chinese minor and high grades \u2014 signals, he told her, that she was willing to take on demanding assignments. By the end of the summer Ms. Cua was offered a full-time job, 10 months before graduation. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my dream to work there,\u201d she admitted. But she knew it would provide a launching pad. \u201cI wanted to get skills I didn\u2019t have coming out of college. I wanted to work with really smart people. I wanted to be mentored by someone looking out for me.\u201dSuch job hopping is typically seen as a lack of commitment or direction \u2014 and it could be \u2014 but it can also boost chances for more satisfying and higher paying work in the decades that follow.\u201cWe are living in an increasingly complex society with many more choices for occupations,\u201d Dr. Siu said \u2014 more than anyone can reasonably explore while in college. Trying out different occupations is another reason 20-somethings need a longer runway to life\u2019s milestones.The reality, however, is that a growing number of emerging adults lack the financial flexibility to change jobs or to take low-paying positions that might be great career starters. The problem? Student loans.Mr. Busteed wasn\u2019t surprised when I told him that nearly every young person I met at the 1776 incubator was free of student debt. According to Gallup\u2019s polling data, most entrepreneurs owe less than $10,000 in student loans \u2014 debt any greater has a negative impact on the decision to start a business.In the end, fewer emerging adults willing to take a chance on their business idea makes it harder for everyone else to get a job.When I met Valerie Lapointe for coffee, she was studying for the G.R.E. Her job search had stalled, and she had decided to do what many recent college graduates do when they get stuck: go back to school for yet another degree.The master\u2019s degree has become the new bachelor\u2019s degree. In 2013, the most recent year available, about 760,000 master\u2019s degrees were awarded, up 250 percent since 1980. Nearly 30 percent of college graduates are back in school within two years. Graduate school gives structure and direction.As we sipped our coffee, Ms. Lapointe, her smile as quick as her wit, quipped about the relevance of our setting. After all, coffee shops have become emblematic of those wandering through their 20s. The Starbucks barista with a bachelor\u2019s is the underemployed stereotype.\u201cI have applied for jobs from here to kingdom come,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you are unemployed, you can apply for jobs all day.\u201d She likened her job search to dating. \u201cYou look great on paper, they interview you, but then they never call you back. You get used to the rejection.\u201dMs. Lapointe grew up in the affluent suburbs of Northern Virginia. She graduated from a top-notch high school with a 3.9 grade-point average in 2008, a year marked by a boom in the number of 18-year-olds across the country (so lots of competition to get into the college of her choice) as well as by one of the worst economic crashes in the nation\u2019s history (so lots of unemployed recent college graduates).\u201cI had no idea what I wanted to do with my life when I went to college,\u201d she said. I asked her why she hadn\u2019t taken a gap year to discover interests or explore majors at a local community college. \u201cThere was never a question in my parents\u2019 mind that I\u2019d go directly on to college, the question was just where,\u201d she said. \u201cIt had worked out for them, so why not me?\u201dI heard similar stories from many recent graduates with college-educated parents \u2014 that a four-year college was the only pathway right out of high school.Wait-listed at James Madison University, Ms. Lapointe landed at the University of Mary Washington, a public college in south-central Virginia. Unsure about a major, she filled her schedule with general-education courses her first two years. Then she took a journalism class, and she was hooked.But Mary Washington didn\u2019t have a journalism major. Ms. Lapointe found as many writing courses as she could and joined the student newspaper. She thought about transferring but was on track to finish her degree in just three years to save money.\u201cBy the time I figured it out, it was too late,\u201d she said.That described Ms. Lapointe. She took a job as a nanny while living at home. By the time she started seriously looking for a job in her field of interest a year and a half after graduation, she was already competing with the next crop of graduates. She paid to enroll in a summer program that matched her to a media internship, hoping it would lead to better employment prospects. It didn\u2019t. A video production company laid her off after three months. She then patched together a series of jobs through temp agencies.\u201cI knew it would be difficult but not this difficult,\u201d she said. Signing onto Facebook sometimes made her feel even farther behind, as friends posted the highlights of their daily lives. \u201cI honestly believed that I\u2019d have more of my life together.\u201dFinally, last fall, at 25, she began a master\u2019s program at Northwestern, with a scholarship covering half the tuition. \u201cSo now,\u201d she said, \u201clife is good, debt is mounting, and I\u2019m hoping my job prospects will be better once I finish. I do feel far more career-minded than I did as an undergrad, and therefore in a better position to take advantage of career services and internship opportunities, and to utilize the resources a university has to offer.\u201dMany young people are similarly derailed. They settle for any paying job, mostly outside their major, because of financial pressures. Some bypass meaningful internships or jobs because they find them menial or can\u2019t live on a paltry salary (or as with most internships, none at all). And some go back to school and deeper into debt. According to the University of Arizona study of the class of 2011, student debt more than tripled for those not working while in graduate school, from $22,000 to $76,000.Perhaps most critical for Wanderers is that the bulk of salary increases tend to come in the first decade of employment. Three-quarters of a man\u2019s wage growth happens in the first 10 years, according to Richard A. Settersten Jr., director of the Hallie E. Ford Center for Healthy Children and Families at Oregon State University.Lisa Kahn, an economist at Yale, found that students graduating from college in a weak economy have lower earnings even decades later. The graduating classes immediately following the 2008 recession, for instance, now earn a third less than those who left college just a few years earlier and had a better economic footing getting started. New graduates don\u2019t shop for jobs as much in a bad economy, Dr. Kahn explained, and job shopping is how they get bigger paychecks in those critical first years.The longer Wanderers drift through their 20s, the harder it becomes to catch up.On a crisp fall evening in 2014, I found myself in Portland, Ore., the city where \u201cyoung people go to retire,\u201d to steal the tag line from the satirical television show \u201cPortlandia.\u201d With its mountains, mild winters, outdoorsy reputation and streak of independence, Portland has become a magnet for Stragglers \u2014 those who spend much of their 20s looking for what they were meant to do.In the Eastside industrial district, I met up with Josh Mabry. He was about to turn 30, and sported a military buzz cut and forearms filled with tattoos. After a decade of dead-end jobs and false starts at a handful of colleges, he was finally settling into something he cared about: woodworking. Mr. Mabry always liked working with his hands. His father and grandfather were woodworkers. But he took his last woodshop class in seventh grade. Guidance counselors were pushing college.After high school, he followed a girlfriend two hours south to Eugene and enrolled in graphic design classes at Lane Community College. But he fell into the party scene and dropped out. \u201cI was drifting,\u201d he admitted.\u201cI knew that by the time I turned 30 I needed to figure something out for myself,\u201d he said. \u201cI finally have some sort of path.\u201dThe longer life expectancy for children born today means that we can chart new routes to adulthood that space out opportunities in different ways. We no longer should think of college as one physical place we go to at one time in our lives \u2014 i.e., age 18. Yet educators continue to press on families a one-size-fits-all route. It\u2019s almost impossible in our hypercompetitive culture to think differently as a parent about when a college education should happen. The result: Finding a pathway to a fulfilling career and a meaningful life has become much more difficult than it ever should be.\u2022In Dr. Settersten\u2019s critical thinking class at Oregon State University, the classroom conversation on the day of my visit wandered to a discussion of what the students, mostly seniors, wanted to do next in life. Many said they planned to go on to graduate school.Dr. Settersten asked how many of them knew their professors well enough to request a letter of recommendation for the application. Only a smattering of hands went up. He wondered aloud: Why hadn\u2019t more of them visited him during office hours, an easy way to build a one-on-one relationship with a professor who teaches hundreds of students a semester?Dr. Settersten\u2019s research focuses on what it means to become an adult today. Unlike many parents and pundits, he doesn\u2019t worry as much about the longer runway to adulthood, arguing that the timetable is more gradual and varied than it was 50 years ago. The traditional markers such as marriage and parenting are now the culmination of adulthood rather than the start of it.I asked about the somewhat clueless students in his class; doesn\u2019t he worry about them? \u201cSure,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I think of adult life, one of the hallmarks of it is that it\u2019s not predictable.\u201dThe problem is that colleges have attempted to make the four-year experience more predictable by adding a bevy of advising services and amenities so that essentially everything is done for students to ensure they graduate on time and secure a job afterward. But they also prevent students from building the resilience they will need as adults to manage risk and succeed in unpredictable careers.In college, \u201cthere are things you\u2019re taught and then there are things you learn,\u201d Dr. Settersten said. \u201cA lot of what college comes down to is not what happens in the classroom. It\u2019s about navigating life and building relationships.\u201dGraduates who linger through their early career often didn\u2019t take college seriously. They put the social scene before academics, avoiding rigorous majors and courses, according to \u201cAcademically Adrift: Limited Learning on College Campuses,\u201d a 2011 book by Richard Arum and Josipa Roksa that shows just how little students actually learn in college.What happens after they graduate? In their follow-up, \u201cAspiring Adults Adrift,\u201d published in 2014, what they reported was as distressing as the findings in their first book, but not much of a surprise. Poor academic performers were more likely than other recent graduates to be unemployed, stuck in unskilled jobs, or to have been fired or laid off. Where students went to college didn\u2019t matter two years out, the sociologists found, as much as what they did while on campus. \u201cThe most important choice students can make is whether they are on the party-social pathway through college,\u201d Dr. Arum said, \u201cor are investing sufficient attention and focus on academic pursuits.\u201dToo many students, he said, see college as a four-year vacation. Students in 1961 dedicated 24 hours a week to studying outside the classroom. By 2003, that fell to 14 hours. \u201cThere are exceptional students,\u201d Dr. Arum said. \u201cThere are just not enough of them.\u201dHe is concerned about what he calls college\u2019s vast middle. \u201cThe system is not working for large numbers of students and I very much worry about their ability to be successful in the long run.\u201dThis article is adapted from \u201cThere Is Life After College: What Parents and Students Should Know About Navigating School to Prepare for the Jobs of Tomorrow,\u201d by Jeffrey J. Selingo, to be published April 12 by William Morrow, an imprint of HarperCollins.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Should Moms Manage the Money?", "Date": "2016-04-20", "News": "\u00e2\u0080\u009cDaddy has to work! You have to come pick us up!\u00e2\u0080\u009dWhen Kimberly Palmer heard those words come out of the mouth of her 5-year-old daughter, she was dumbfounded. Both she and her husband have full-time jobs, so where had the little girl gotten the idea that Daddy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work mattered more?Ms. Palmer didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know, but she took it as a call to action. Although she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s written about the topic of money management for a living for many years, she wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t handling many of the money management tasks in her own household.Many couples will bristle at the idea that any family task other than breast-feeding should be assigned on the basis of anatomy, even if they are often self-selecting in this manner by choice.In many households, men tend to manage family investments and taxes, and women, if they get involved in money issues, tend to focus only on everyday expenses and charitable donations.Same-sex couples often have separate investment accounts and make individual decisions, which is probably a legacy of the fact that it was hard for them to marry and combine accounts until recently.Or perhaps men simply like handling this task more. Does it really make sense to take it away from them? Ms. Palmer pushes back against concerns over prescribed gender roles in three ways.Divorce happens, too, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good for both spouses to know where the money is (and if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been moved around recently) in the event of a surprise separation.While Ms. Palmer wants women to be the financial captains of the family, she is not advocating a dictatorship. A couple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial discussions should be collaborative, whether the person executing the decisions is male or female. So you sit down at least once a year and remind yourselves of the answers to the following questions: Where is our money now? How do we get to it? Has our willingness to take risks with our investments changed? What are the most important goals for the next year? And what do we want to change?Reading \u00e2\u0080\u009cSmart Mom, Rich Mom\u00e2\u0080\u009d made me acutely uncomfortable, precisely because I could not shake the feeling that I was doing it wrong. At the very least, my wife should be making all the moves for 12 months at a time, once every few years.As for Ms. Palmer, she now has the password to the Excel spreadsheet her husband made that contains all of their financial information. And she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s started bringing her wallet along most everywhere she goes, even if it is a bit bulky.That way, she hopes, her daughter will understand that her mom is just as invested in the money that gets made and spent in their family as her father is.Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "\u2018Outlander\u2019 Season 2, Episode 2: The Wounds We Carry", "Date": "2016-04-16", "News": "Supported byOutlanderSex in pop culture often lacks variety. Usually its only tenor is unadulterated lust and pleasure or on the opposite end of the spectrum, disappointment. But in real life, sex has incredible variety. It can start out tentative or coy then sway into outright passions. Lovers can pause for laughter or switch positions when something is uncomfortable. Nothing in life, especially sexual encounters, is one note. One of the greatest strengths of \u201cOutlander\u201d is its keen, honest understanding of sex between men and women filtered through the relationship of Claire and Jamie. Their sexual chemistry has proved to be a cornerstone of their relationship providing a window into their loyalty for one another. While last week\u2019s episode curiously didn\u2019t touch on Jamie\u2019s abuse and how it currently shapes their relationship with much depth, it takes center stage in \u201cNot in Scotland Anymore.\u201dThe episode opens in the middle of a sex scene between Jamie and Claire. It\u2019s sexy yet slightly off. It seems like Jamie is perhaps a bit too wrapped up in his own thoughts. That\u2019s because he is. It\u2019s a dream. Just when we\u2019re getting comfortable in the dynamic between the pleasure on his face and Claire\u2019s slight laugh, the scene dives into darker waters. Her voice gives way to Randall\u2019s. He breathlessly murmurs \u201cdon\u2019t stop\u201d while lying beneath Jamie. In an instant a setting that was once warm and alluring tips into horror as Jamie stabs Randall again and again. Blood soaks into the sheets, drips from Jamie\u2019s hair, covering both men almost completely. The wounds of his body may be healing but Jamie is still reeling from what Randall has done.Even in his waking life, Jamie struggles to be intimate with Claire. After having her legs and other areas waxed she initiates sex with Jamie. It\u2019s both tender (in the way Claire kisses Jamie) and mildly hilarious (Jamie\u2019s reaction to Claire\u2019s hairlessness). When they start having sex it feels like maybe they\u2019re making progress. Then just as soon as they find their rhythm images of Randall jut into Jamie\u2019s mind. At the end of Season 1 Jamie\u2019s abuse was unflinching and brutal in ways that perhaps contradicted its intent. But its aftermath provides the opportunity to depict a subject matter not seen enough in television: male vulnerability. Sam Heughan\u2019s performance finds incredible nuance in Jamie\u2019s current state, imbuing even his quietest moments with an awareness of how it has wrecked his identity.Jamie\u2019s struggle is just one of the many ways \u201cOutlander\u201d plays with both masculinity and duality. Yes, there is Jamie who on the surface is the picture of a dashing romantic hero but he has a kindness and a vulnerability that has only been magnified by his trauma. Prince Charles Edward Stuart (Andrew Gower) speaks of the incisive nature needed to lead but in actuality is foolish and quite simpering. Even Murtagh who seems like a brute to the aristocratic circles of French society that he\u2019s moving through is a man of surprising depth and loyalty.Claire and Jamie\u2019s time in France is proving to be a complex confidence game. They\u2019re so often ruled by their passions and not considering the consequences that watching them have to hold back their impulses is a fascinating development. To succeed they have to play a game of hiding their anger behind careful smiles and sharp barbs rather than outright machinations or drawing swords. This is especially true in the centerpiece sequence involving the high class party at Versailles where various major players come to the forefront including Joseph Duverney (Marc Duret), the minister of finance whose favor they need.The scenes at Versailles feel poorly structured spending far too much time focusing on King Louis XV (Lionel Lingelser) on the toilet surrounded by his loyal subjects. It\u2019s meant to underscore the mix of vulgarity, elegance and wildly customs of the French, but that was pretty well established earlier with Claire\u2019s frivolous friend Louise de Rohan (Claire Sermonne). Louise is instrumental in getting them all to Versailles. But she can\u2019t stop the prickly class dynamics, the cutting remarks from the French elite who find the Scottish and English to be beneath them, and the various political dealings working beneath the surface of every interaction Claire deals with.At its best, costuming is set construction for the face and body of the actors. The signature here being Claire\u2019s gorgeous red dress, which captures the boldness of her character and a sense of architecture quite neatly. This shift from the grays, browns and green colored landscapes and costuming in Scotland only adds to the sense of duality and con artistry.Despite this beauty, Claire, Jamie and Murtagh are essentially charting a course through a pit of vipers. This is never more clear than when Claire comes face to face with the Duke of Sandringham accompanied by his new secretary, Randall\u2019s younger brother Alexander (Laurence Dobiesz). Claire has been continually reassuring Jamie by noting that Randall is dead. But Alexander casually mentions his brother is very much alive. The Duke doesn\u2019t hide that he relishes the way this news causes Claire to unravel. With Jamie\u2019s progress and the careful con game they\u2019re playing on such fragile ground, the news of Randall\u2019s survival can only spell tragedy.Other Gossip\u2022 What are we to make of Annalise (Margaux Ch\u00e2telier), Jamie\u2019s possessive former paramour who makes a brief appearance at Versailles?\u2022 I can\u2019t speak highly enough of the amazing costume design by Terry Dresbach. While Claire\u2019s red gown is an easy standout I\u2019m quite fond of the black and white dress from the very beginning. In tandem with the lush production design and swooning score Season 2 is proving to be a feast for the senses.\u2022 \u201cYou want to kill a snake, you cut off its head. Kill the prince, kill the rebellion,\u201d Murtaugh says whilst dueling Jamie. Murtaugh\u2019s plan may be too blunt but I can\u2019t help but agree.\u2022 I\u2019m curious about how Claire\u2019s burgeoning friendship with Master Raymond (Dominique Pinon) will develop.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump Settled a Real Estate Lawsuit, and a Criminal Case Was Closed", "Date": "2016-04-05", "News": "Supported byFor Donald J. Trump, it is a long-held legal strategy, if not a point of pride, to avoid knuckling under to plaintiffs in court.\u201cI don\u2019t settle lawsuits \u2014 very rare \u2014 because once you settle lawsuits, everybody sues you,\u201d he said recently.The backdrop to that unusual denouement was a gathering legal storm that threatened to cast a harsh light on how he did business. Besides the fraud accusations, a separate lawsuit claimed that Trump SoHo was developed with the undisclosed involvement of convicted felons and financing from questionable sources in Russia and Kazakhstan.And hovering over it all was a criminal investigation, previously unreported, by the Manhattan district attorney into whether the fraud alleged by the condo buyers broke any laws, according to documents and interviews with five people familiar with it. The buyers initially helped in the investigation, but as part of their lawsuit settlement, they had to notify prosecutors that they no longer wished to do so.The criminal case was eventually closed.Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign for the Republican presidential nomination rests on the notion, relentlessly promoted by the candidate himself, that his record of business deals has prepared him better than his rivals for running the country. An examination of Trump SoHo provides a window into his handling of one such deal and finds that decisions on important matters like whom to become partners with and how to market the project led him into a thicket of litigation and controversy.Trump SoHo is one of several instances in which Mr. Trump\u2019s boastfulness \u2014 a hallmark of his career and his campaign \u2014 has been accused of crossing the line into fraud. Other lawsuits have charged that he peddled worthless real estate sales courses and misled investors into thinking he had built hotels when in fact he had only licensed his name to them. He has won several cases at trial and is continuing to fight others.Alan Garten, the general counsel for the Trump Organization, said that the condo buyers\u2019 lawsuit was not focused on Mr. Trump himself \u201cin any material way\u201d and that there was little reason not to settle it, adding that it cost Mr. Trump nothing. \u201cIt was solely a function of returning deposits,\u201d Mr. Garten said.He described the case as \u201cbuyer\u2019s remorse,\u201d in which people who bought real estate at the wrong time turned to the courts to recoup their investment.Mr. Garten would not talk about the criminal investigation or whether it was a factor in the decision to settle.\u201cThe terms of the settlement are confidential, and thus I\u2019m not at liberty to discuss them,\u201d he said.The district attorney\u2019s office declined to comment, saying it could not provide information on \u201ca criminal investigation which does not result in an arrest or prosecution.\u201dWhen Mr. Trump and his co-defendants made the decision to settle the condo buyers\u2019 lawsuit in 2011, it was a far cry from the heady days of 2006, when Mr. Trump closed an episode of his hit television show \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d with a splashy plug for Trump SoHo. In typical Trump fashion, he piled on the plaudits for \u201cmy latest development.\u201d\u201cWhen it\u2019s completed in 2008,\u201d he said, \u201cthis brilliant $370 million work of art will be an awe-inspiring masterpiece.\u201dTo the artists and creative types inhabiting its trendy downtown Manhattan neighborhood, Trump SoHo was an oxymoron from the start. Many of them loudly opposed a huge glass tower at 246 Spring Street that would stab the sky high above its low-key surroundings.If the plans for it attracted controversy, so too would the company most responsible for its development: Bayrock Group.Mr. Trump was foggy on how he first came to do business with Bayrock, a small development company whose offices were in Trump Tower in Midtown. In a deposition a few years ago, he said it might have been a Bayrock associate, Felix H. Sater, who first approached him in the early 2000s.Mr. Sater, a Russian immigrant, had recently joined Bayrock at the behest of its founder, Tevfik Arif, a former Soviet-era commerce official originally from Kazakhstan. Bayrock, which was developing commercial properties in Brooklyn, proposed that Mr. Trump license his name to hotel projects in Florida, Arizona and New York, including Trump SoHo.The other development partner for Trump SoHo was the Sapir Organization, whose founder, Tamir Sapir, was from the former Soviet republic of Georgia. In addition to receiving a licensing agreement, Mr. Trump would manage the completed condo-hotel, and he was also given a minor equity interest in it.Emails and testimony in several lawsuits show that Mr. Sater and Mr. Arif worked closely with Mr. Trump and others in the Trump Organization. Mr. Trump was particularly taken with Mr. Arif\u2019s overseas connections. In a deposition, Mr. Trump said that the two had discussed \u201cnumerous deals all over the world\u201d and that Mr. Arif had brought potential Russian investors to Mr. Trump\u2019s office to meet him.\u201cBayrock knew the people, knew the investors, and in some cases I believe they were friends of Mr. Arif,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAnd this was going to be Trump International Hotel and Tower Moscow, Kiev, Istanbul, etc., Poland, Warsaw.\u201dWhat sort of due diligence Mr. Trump did before jumping in with his new partners is unclear. But he, as well as many others, apparently missed some dark spots on Mr. Sater\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Mr. Garten said the Trump Organization typically did a background check on potential business partners like Bayrock, but not on their individual employees, so nothing about Mr. Sater would have turned up.Mr. Sater was convicted and sent to prison in 1993 after a New York bar fight in which he stabbed a man in the face with a broken margarita glass. That was a matter of public record. However, what few people beyond insiders at Bayrock knew was that five years later, Mr. Sater was implicated in a huge stock manipulation scheme involving Mafia figures and Russian criminals \u2014 and that he became a confidential F.B.I. informant.Recently unsealed federal court records show that Mr. Sater helped the government disrupt an organized crime ring on Wall Street and deal with an unexplained national security matter involving his foreign connections. He was not the only F.B.I. informant in Bayrock\u2019s offices. Another was Salvatore Lauria, an associate of Mr. Sater, who sometimes showed up to work wearing a court-ordered ankle monitor.Mr. Lauria brokered a $50 million investment in Trump SoHo and three other Bayrock projects by an Icelandic firm preferred by wealthy Russians \u201cin favor with\u201d President Vladimir V. Putin, according to a lawsuit against Bayrock by one of its former executives. The Icelandic company, FL Group, was identified in a Bayrock investor presentation as a \u201cstrategic partner,\u201d along with Alexander Mashkevich, a billionaire once charged in a corruption case involving fees paid by a Belgian company seeking business in Kazakhstan; that case was settled with no admission of guilt.The official unveiling of Trump SoHo in September 2007 was quintessential Trump: a red-carpet announcement followed by a big bash, where flavored vodka flowed, dancers whirled and models wandered about. Amid the hoopla, Mr. Trump took the microphone to extol the greatness of the project. Standing beside him, beaming, were Mr. Arif and Mr. Sater.The timing of Trump SoHo\u2019s completion and marketing could hardly have been worse. The real estate bubble was bursting, and the global economy was on the brink of crisis as the developers began advertising luxury condo-hotel units costing as much as tens of millions of dollars.The economics of the investment were largely untested in New York real estate. To get around residential zoning restrictions, owners of Trump SoHo units were allowed to live in them only 120 days a year. The rest of the time, the units would be rented as hotel rooms, with the owners sharing in the revenue.The project was marketed aggressively to potential investors overseas, where exchange rates were favorable and the Trump brand carried a certain cachet. Many early buyers were from Europe, including a French former soccer star, Olivier Dacourt, who put down a deposit of $460,400 on a $2.3 million unit.According to data the Trump SoHo developers filed with state and federal agencies, only 15 to 30 percent of the units had been sold by the start of 2009. But those numbers did not come close to the grand-sounding sales figures promoted, publicly and in private, by people affiliated with Trump SoHo, according to a lawsuit filed in August 2010 by Mr. Dacourt and other people who had bought units.The lawsuit also suggested that Mr. Trump had contributed to the deception, citing a claim he made at the project\u2019s unveiling. Depending on the news account, he said 3,200 prospective purchasers either had signed up to see the units or had requested applications to buy them; the plaintiffs argued that this figure was exaggerated, given how few units had actually been sold at the time. The Trumps and the other defendants denied that there had been any deception.The inflated numbers were more than just harmless self-promotion and amounted to fraudulent enticement of investors, who believed they were buying into a project that was healthier than it actually was, said Adam Leitman Bailey, the lawyer representing the buyers.\u201cThey relied on these misrepresentations to their detriment,\u201d he said.The people familiar with the criminal investigation said that not long after Mr. Bailey\u2019s lawsuit was filed, the district attorney\u2019s office began looking into the allegations it had raised. These people insisted on anonymity for fear of legal repercussions from speaking about confidential agreements or sealed criminal matters.Documents reviewed by The Times, including a state grand jury subpoena, make clear that an area of focus for prosecutors was determining whether the accusations in Mr. Bailey\u2019s lawsuit rose to the level of a crime. The investigation was being handled by the Major Economic Crimes Bureau.Shortly before the condo buyers\u2019 lawsuit was filed, another suit appeared, this one by Jody Kriss, a former finance director of Bayrock. It claimed that by concealing Mr. Sater\u2019s criminal record, Bayrock had committed fraud on banks and investors with which it did business. Mr. Trump is not a defendant in that case, which is continuing.Mr. Kriss\u2019s lawsuit was filled with unflattering details of how Bayrock operated, including allegations that it had occasionally received unexplained infusions of cash from accounts in Kazakhstan and Russia. Bayrock and Trump SoHo drew more negative headlines in October 2010, when news spread from Turkey that Mr. Arif had been aboard a luxury yacht raided by the police, who were investigating a suspected prostitution ring that catered to wealthy businessmen. He was charged but later acquitted.The next year, when it was clear that Mr. Bailey\u2019s lawsuit would be allowed to proceed and with the district attorney\u2019s criminal investigation continuing, Mr. Trump and his co-defendants agreed to settle the condo buyers\u2019 suit. The financial terms were announced publicly, but another part of the settlement was kept secret.That part required the plaintiffs to notify any investigative agency with which they \u201cmay have previously cooperated\u201d that they did not want to \u201cparticipate in any investigation or criminal prosecution\u201d related to matters in the lawsuit, according to a confidentiality agreement signed by more than 20 people. The plaintiffs could respond to a subpoena or court order, but would also have to notify the defendants that they had received it, the agreement said. The criminal investigation was closed sometime afterward.As for Trump SoHo, the condo-hotel concept did not pan out. Only about a third of the units were ultimately sold, and one of the project\u2019s lenders foreclosed on the rest, although the property remained open and became a popular luxury hotel, still managed by Mr. Trump\u2019s company.Mr. Sater left Bayrock after the news of his criminal background was reported. But even after that, his association with Mr. Trump did not end. The Trump Organization later gave him a business card identifying him as a \u201csenior advisor\u201d to Mr. Trump, as well an office. Mr. Garten, the general counsel for the organization, said that Mr. Sater was never an employee, but that he had worked independently to steer potential deals to Mr. Trump. The arrangement lasted about six months, Mr. Garten said. Mr. Sater declined to comment on his dealings with Mr. Trump or with Bayrock.By the time Mr. Trump sat for a deposition in a lawsuit in November 2013, it was clear he no longer saw the benefit of knowing the Bayrock executives with whom he had once completed big deals. He said he barely knew Mr. Arif: \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve seen him a couple of times; I have met him.\u201dAs for Mr. Sater, \u201cif he were sitting in the room right now,\u201d Mr. Trump said, \u201cI really wouldn\u2019t know what he looked like.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Is the experience potentially so rewarding that the government should work with nonprofit organizations and the business community to create a universal summer jobs program?\nMayor Bill de Blasio speaks often of narrowing the vast gap that exists between the rich and the poor in New York City. His administration could make a real impact in this area by retooling the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inadequate summer jobs program so that more high school students get work experiences that put them in position to compete for full-time jobs later on. A new proposal by the Community Service Society, a New York nonprofit group, makes a strong case for a universal summer jobs program that would be open to all high school students.The value of summer employment was underscored in a 2015 report by JPMorgan Chase, which found that it yielded year-round benefits. Young people who worked over the summer were less likely to get in trouble with the law, had better performance at school and were 86 percent more likely to have jobs the following year.Work opportunities for young people began to dry up at the end of the 1990s, when Congress restructured a federally financed summer program that once provided work experiences for half a million young people each year. The recession made it even harder for the young, who had to compete with more experienced workers who had lost their jobs.Across the country, about 20 percent of young people who seek summer jobs cannot find them. Minority teenagers, who typically live in areas that have few businesses, have a much harder time finding work.\n\u2014 Should all high school students be able to get a summer job if they want one?\u2014 Do you agree with the editorial board that a summer job can be a valuable learning experience with year-round benefits?\u2014 Is a universal summer jobs program something government should pay for? The business community? Nonprofit organizations? Or all three?\u2014 Have you ever had a summer job? What was your experience like?\u2014 Do you plan on having a job this summer?

{"Headline": "Ruling Behind MetLife\u2019s \u2018Too Big to Fail\u2019 Reprieve Unsealed", "Date": "2016-04-07", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The financial industry now has more information about why a court allowed MetLife to shed its \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d label last week, in a major setback for supporters of the Dodd-Frank Act.A federal judge ruled on March 30 that regulators failed to properly name the country\u2019s biggest life insurer as \u201csystemically important.\u201d But the decision itself was under seal until it was made public on Thursday.The ruling shows that Judge Rosemary Collyer of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia was unimpressed with core aspects of the analysis underpinning the MetLife designation. The judge also found that regulators failed to properly account for the expected costs of heightened oversight under the designation.The Treasury Department said on Thursday that the government would appeal the district court\u2019s decision.Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew, who leads the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which oversees the health of the financial system, said in a statement earlier on Thursday that regulators planned to \u201ccontinue defending vigorously the process and the integrity of F.S.O.C.\u2019s work,\u201d expressing confidence that the government will prevail.\u201cIn overturning the conclusions of experienced financial regulators, the court imposed new requirements that Congress never enacted, and contradicted key policy lessons from the financial crisis,\u201d Mr. Lew added.The opinion, however, contained an important silver lining for regulators.Judge Collyer threw out the insurer\u2019s argument that it was ineligible for designation, which could give the council the opportunity to reissue the label if the government loses its appeal.The verdict is not that MetLife is immune from designation, said Aaron Klein, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former Treasury official, but instead rests on two arguments that the F.S.O.C. didn\u2019t do enough work to merit the designation.Judge Collyer determined that the regulatory council fell short in its designation process in several areas.The Dodd-Frank Act provides regulators with two standards for determining whether a firm is \u201csystemically important,\u201d and while regulators chose to invoke the first standard \u2014 that \u201cmaterial financial distress\u201d at a firm \u201ccould pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States\u201d \u2014 against MetLife, its reasoning did not hold up, according to the judge.Under that standard, the judge found that the council failed to assess the likelihood of MetLife finding itself on the brink of bankruptcy and concluded that analysts did not go far enough in explaining how the company\u2019s hypothetical distress would undermine the financial system as a whole.Regulators failed to account for why they \u201cabandoned the guidance and refused to evaluate MetLife\u2019s vulnerability to material financial distress,\u201d the judge wrote in the opinion, adding that the designation \u201chardly adhered to any standard when it came to assessing MetLife\u2019s threat to U.S. financial stability.\u201dTaken together, she called the departures from the Dodd-Frank law and regulators\u2019 own guidance \u201cfatally flawed.\u201dSeparately, Judge Collyer ruled that regulators also did not consider the costs of heightened oversight and new rules, which the Federal Reserve is still writing.Federal courts have previously overturned several other Dodd-Frank rules on similar grounds. Eugene Scalia, son of the late Justice Antonin Scalia and a lawyer for MetLife in this case, was the architect of some of those earlier lawsuits.\u201cThere is no doubt that F.S.O.C. refused to consider the costs\u201d of its decision, and it did so \u201cpurposefully,\u201d the judge wrote.A spokesman for MetLife, Christopher Stern, said, \u201cWe remain pleased with the U.S. District Court\u2019s decision.\u201dAnalysts for Piper Jaffray have estimated that $2.5 billion to $3 billion of capital could be returned to shareholders or invested in other ways as result of MetLife shedding the too-big-to-fail label, which mandates higher capital requirements and greater scrutiny.It is unclear how the ruling may affect the other three nonbank companies that regulators have designated as \u201csystemically important\u201d: the American International Group, Prudential Financial and General Electric\u2019s financing arm.General Electric filed a request with regulators to repeal its label last week, a day after the MetLife decision came down, arguing that it has greatly pruned its financial assets and considerably reduced its threat to the system.Spokesmen for both Prudential and A.I.G. declined to comment on Thursday.The companies may use the opinion as evidence when their designations are up for annual review in front of the council.\u201cI think this ruling opens the door for other systemically significant companies to basically wiggle their way out,\u201d said Mark Williams, a lecturer at Boston University and former bank examiner at the Federal Reserve.MetLife\u2019s win has provided fresh ammunition for opponents of the Obama administration and the Dodd-Frank law in Congress. House Republicans hailed the decision last week, calling for greater transparency at Treasury and the F.S.O.C.The decision is a blow to supporters of Dodd-Frank, who point out that large, interconnected financial institutions, like A.I.G. and Lehman Brothers, nearly brought down the financial system in the fall of 2008.\u201cI would question whether we\u2019ve really learned the lessons of Lehman,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cThe fact that there\u2019s been a legal overturn doesn\u2019t mean the risk no longer exists \u2014 it\u2019s still there.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Upperclassmen Lose Financial Aid", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported byA few weeks before Ashley Hurst was supposed to commit to college, an email arrived that she thought would change her life. An honors graduate from a magnet high school, Ms. Hurst had been accepted into several colleges with a few good financial aid offers. But they included about $8,000 in loans, and she was dead set against borrowing any money. She kept hoping to snag a free ride somewhere at the last minute.Then came the message from North Carolina Central University, a historically black college: It would be interested in giving her a full scholarship to study pharmaceutical sciences, a relatively new program aimed at helping students move into biotechnology jobs. Ms. Hurst called the scholarship committee the next day, and after a phone interview got a formal offer. She immediately accepted the terms, including the requirement to maintain a 3.8 grade-point average.\u201cI felt really, really relieved,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI felt like the hardest part of college was over.\u201dBut though Ms. Hurst had focused on science in high school, she quickly discovered she couldn\u2019t keep up with the work. At the end of freshman year, she had to forfeit her scholarship. So she spent last summer searching for new sources of money while working as a cashier at Home Goods. She applied for more than 30 scholarships. She didn\u2019t get any, and returned to school last fall as a criminal justice major, yet another student taking out more loans \u2014 $18,500 so far \u2014 than ever expected.Ms. Hurst\u2019s predicament is all too familiar to students hunting for college bargains. Focused on cost, they attend the institution that showers them with the most money. But many learn a bitter economic lesson once they enroll: The debt can mount during the course of an undergraduate career, thanks to fine print, tough academic requirements on grants, and unanticipated tuition and fee increases.In the 2011-12 academic year, Dr. Hershbein found, students at private colleges lost an average of about $1,000 in institutional grant aid between freshman and senior year, more than a 6 percent drop from the average freshman grant of $15,800. Results were quite different at public universities, where the dollar value of institutional grants \u2014 an average of about $4,600 \u2014 remained relatively steady year to year. But far fewer students received them. Only 31.8 percent of freshmen at public colleges got institutional scholarships, compared with 79 percent at private colleges. And that dipped to a low of 28.7 percent during students\u2019 junior year.Dr. Hershbein, who is also a Brookings Institution fellow with a focus on the economics of education, said he had seen similar patterns in 2003-4 and 2007-8. (The survey sample from individual institutions is too small to use to identify trends at specific colleges.)It\u2019s often understandable why upperclassmen would have higher out-of-pocket costs than freshmen. As Ms. Hurst discovered, grants may disappear because of academic problems. Transferring schools has an impact, too, given that transfer students routinely get less money than freshmen. Robert Kelchen, an education professor at Seton Hall University whose research focuses on higher education finance, explains why. Transfer students, he notes, don\u2019t count in federal graduation rates, let alone the algorithms that go toward rankings and reputation. So campuses aren\u2019t invested in luring transfers with a competitive financial aid package; rather, the money is directed at wooing the best freshman class.Fallout from rising tuition and fees is another big factor. Colleges rarely increase monetary gifts to compensate for higher costs. (Some campuses do acknowledge the trend. New York University, for example, now offers special grants for students in their final semesters, and the University of Dayton guarantees that even if a family qualifies for less need-based federal aid in later years, their tuition and fee payments will not rise.)And, finally, there\u2019s the concern that colleges and universities, especially financially troubled ones, front-load merit aid to entice students to enroll, then lower or cut the award in later years.After analyzing the federal survey data, Dr. Hershbein remarked, \u201cIf I were an Education Department official investigating whether colleges front-load aid and I saw these patterns, I would ask for a lot more detail and information.\u201d\u2022Merit aid began proliferating as a potent recruiting tool several decades ago, often offered to fence-sitters who might enroll if nudged in just the right way. In the brave new world of big data, colleges can estimate how much money it takes to attract specific types of students, and studies show that families find named awards more appealing than just a pile of money. Most education experts find this kind of marketing perfectly acceptable. \u201cInstitutions have bills to pay and don\u2019t make money in the basement,\u201d Mr. Nassirian said. And many consider giving freshmen more grants than upperclassmen defensible \u2014 as long as they know what is going on.The problem comes when there\u2019s no warning. \u201cI\u2019ve been a trustee of a number of universities and I\u2019ve seen this,\u201d said Harold O. Levy, executive director of the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, which supports low-income students. \u201cThey tend to mislead students into believing they\u2019re going to be getting the same amount of money for four years.\u201dHe recalls the issue being raised at one university board meeting and talking with students \u201cwho clearly thought they would get the money\u201d the next year. He declined to name the institution. Among the boards on which Mr. Levy has served are Cornell University, which does not award merit aid, the for-profit Kaplan University and Pace University. A Kaplan spokeswoman said all its awards are renewable as long as students meet G.P.A. requirements. Pace said its practice is to \u201cmaintain the amount of aid that is given to students when they first enroll.\u201d Neither could provide data on grants to upperclassmen.After freshman year, the \u201cvery generous awards all of a sudden disappear,\u201d Mr. Griffith said. He knows that because the Gates program picks up the difference. The program pays about 24 percent of scholars\u2019 freshman-year costs, but almost 43 percent of sophomore costs.One school he warned students about was Pine Manor, a small, suburban women\u2019s college that went coed in 2014. He stopped dealing with the college in 2009 because of his concerns.\u201cWe\u2019re not baiting and switching people,\u201d countered Richard M. Regan Jr., who has been Pine Manor\u2019s executive vice president of finance and administration for less than a year. \u201cCutting grants is absolutely, categorically not happening,\u201d he said, producing four years of data to underscore the point.The college, with operating losses close to $8 million between 2009 and 2011, had been experimenting with ways to build enrollment. \u201cWe\u2019re always on the brink of the abyss,\u201d Mr. Regan said. In 2012, it increased grants for incoming students by about $2,800 but couldn\u2019t afford them, he said, and had to lower the amount for subsequent classes. But no one he asked, he said, knew of front-loading in the past.\u2022Most grants get derailed for a valid reason. For many students, G.P.A. requirements and deadlines for filing paperwork are the big stumbling blocks.At Bridgewater State University in Massachusetts, hundreds of upperclassmen lose institutional grants because they forget to file their financial aid forms on time, said Paul F. Jean, the vice president for marketing and communications. \u201cFirst-year students,\u201d he said, \u201care more attuned to deadlines.\u201dAnthony Aviles, a Bridgewater student, had a tough first year. His mother was repeatedly hospitalized; his father was laid off. When his G.P.A. dropped below the 2.0 threshold to keep his grant, he lost more than $9,000 in aid.But Mr. Aviles did not realize he had lost his aid until January of his sophomore year, and by the time he filed an appeal, the university would not retroactively pay for his fall bill. Mr. Aviles\u2019s father, a maintenance man, did not qualify for an education loan so he had to borrow money from his former boss.\u201cThere are so many technicalities,\u201d Ms. Martinez-Pimental said. Some upperclassmen, she said, have to fill out five forms with different deadlines to get government and institutional aid renewed. Aside from paperwork problems, students can lose aid if they don\u2019t take the correct distribution of credits or don\u2019t complete at least two-thirds of the credits they are attempting to earn.Mr. Griffith often talks donors out of setting G.P.A.\u2019s at 3.5 when they want to establish awards through the United Negro College Fund because, he said, even stellar high school students might underestimate what they can achieve in college, often losing half a grade point when they make the transition.The threshold for a government Pell grant is usually 2.0. If students need anything higher than a 3.0, they\u2019re being forced to play Russian roulette, Mr. Nassirian said.Baylor University in Texas, New York University and Eastern Michigan University offer some scholarships that mandate a 3.5 G.P.A. for renewal. At Utah Valley University, recipients of the full-tuition Presidential Scholarship must maintain a 3.7 G.P.A., and Piedmont International University in North Carolina wants a 3.8 on some awards.But students awarded the most competitive scholarships are high-performing enough to keep them. At Baylor, which awarded 381 full-tuition scholarships last fall, fewer than five a year are lost, said Lyn Wheeler Kinyon, assistant vice president for financial aid.It\u2019s the more average students who appear to have the most trouble hanging on to their awards. At St. John\u2019s University in Queens, 18 percent of freshmen lose their G.P.A.-restricted scholarships. For years, 30 percent routinely lost Academic Achievement Scholarships that paid between $5,000 and $12,000 because they could not maintain the required 3.0 average. The university became so concerned that it dropped the minimum to 2.75 last fall, and forecasts that only about 12 percent of students will lose it this year, said Jorge L. Rodriguez, the vice provost.Similarly, in Georgia 81 percent of students retain the state\u2019s full-tuition Zell Miller Scholarship with its 3.3 G.P.A., but only 64 percent retain the less lucrative Hope Scholarship, which requires a 3.0.When Ashley Hurst learned about the 3.8 G.P.A. requirement for North Carolina Central University\u2019s full-tuition scholarship, she wasn\u2019t concerned. She had maintained the same average in high school. She was eager about her studies \u2014 a university official had mentioned that a major in pharmaceutical sciences would be a good foundation for a career in forensic science, which is what Ms. Hurst thought she wanted to pursue.But she had entered the Biomanufacturing Research Institute and Technology Enterprise program, begun in 2006 to help make the university a leader in biotechnology. David J. Kroll, chairman of the pharmaceutical sciences department from 2008 to 2011, said the program was so academically challenging that about 25 percent of its 120 students left the program each year during his tenure. He also said that without A\u2019s and B\u2019s in both high school biology and chemistry, no one had been considered for scholarships, which were typically awarded after face-to-face interviews, not phone interviews like Ms. Hurst\u2019s. A university spokeswoman declined to comment, citing student privacy regulations.Ms. Hurst said she was the only person in her chemistry class who hadn\u2019t taken the subject in high school. She sat in the back of her classroom feeling lost and said she couldn\u2019t find help. Often, she stayed up studying until 4 a.m. yet got C\u2019s and D\u2019s.Last semester, Ms. Hurst switched to the college\u2019s well-regarded criminal justice department, earning a 3.1 G.P.A.\u201cWhen I graduate, I know it\u2019s going to be kind of hard,\u201d she said of the debt she is now accruing. \u201cBut I wanted to continue my education. I don\u2019t want to be left behind.\u201dRochelle Sharpe is a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter in Boston who writes often on health and education. Advertisement"}

Mr. Beach, a veteran Republican operative from California who at the time was a supporter of Senator Rand Paul, is now overseeing fund-raising for Great America PAC.But the Great American PAC, which Mr. Beach is working for, received no such letter, according to the group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawyer, Dan Backer. A top ally of Mr. Paul, Jesse Benton, recently joined the super PAC.Mr. Beach, in an interview, said that the group is augmenting what the candidate is doing, not just through ads but also with a delegate operation to help bolster Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chances of getting the nomination. It also will focus on raising smaller donations, Mr. Beach said.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe art of the super PAC really is to drive a message and to drive a narrative and capture a movement \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it\u2019s not to try to control what the candidate\u2019s doing, and we fit that bill,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Beach, who added that the goal is to capitalize on momentum.The super PAC is a hybrid, not only promoting the candidate, but also raising small-dollar donations that it sends directly to the campaign.The group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first television ad was a positive spot. It has also asked Ben Carson and former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York to hold fund-raising events, two people briefed on the group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s activities said. Both were granted anonymity to discuss the group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plan.It has also released a second spot, seemingly rushed with low-level graphics, asking viewers to call a 1-800 number and \u00e2\u0080\u009cPress 1 if you think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wrong to deny Trump the nomination through a contested convention.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The call eventually funnels those who push \u00e2\u0080\u009c1\u00e2\u0080\u009d to a live operator asking for donations of $50 or $75 to the group.Mr. Beach and aides to Mr. Trump declined to answer questions about whether they had met at any point to discuss the super PAC, which was originally called TrumPAC. The campaign asked the group to change its name several weeks ago, which led to Great America PAC.The group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Federal Election Commission filings show it has spent more than $1 million making reservations for television ads, money that was spent on a group called Rapid Response Media. Mitchell West, of Kantar Media/CMAG, said his organization had seen no sign of its ad spending.Mr. Benton said the super PAC buys advertising time from DirectTV and the Dish Network, and said it does not show up on ad reservations.Another Kantar official, Elizabeth Wilner, said such advertising purchases are relatively new, since DirectTV and Dish only formed a partnership in 2014.Such an approach to advertising \u00e2\u0080\u009ccertainly has its uses and it certainly has its limits,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd it is an effective tool, but it is not going to be replacing broadcast TV advertising anytime soon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Either way, she said, that advertising would show up in reservations tracked by her company. On Wednesday afternoon, Kantar Media/CMAG picked up evidence of a national satellite reservation, at roughly $150,000 for the time being, but it was not an \u00e2\u0080\u009caddressable\u00e2\u0080\u009d buy, meaning it was not targeted toward any specific market or household; a national satellite buy of this nature is unusual.  \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

That represents a 37 percent gain from St. Jude Medical\u2019s closing stock price on Wednesday. In the Alere deal, the premium was more than 50 percent.Abbott said it had received a commitment letter from Bank of America Merrill Lynch to finance the full cash portion of both transactions.

{"Headline": "Report on de Blasio Election Spending Is Full of Details and Holes", "Date": "2016-04-26", "News": "Supported byAbout New YorkNow, bewilderingly, Mayor Bill de Blasio and his crew are said to be in an exotic pile of legal trouble faced by virtually no other politicians who have done just about the same thing.In 2014, the mayor and allies raised millions of dollars in hopes of giving control of the State Senate to the Democrats. By law, there was a limit of $10,300 that an individual could give that year to a campaign. But the same person could give about $100,000 to larger political organizations, like state and county party committees.Those committees can spend away on behalf of the candidates, but everyone has to pretend not to coordinate efforts to get around the limits.Her document is remarkably assiduous in places, and filled with flagrant, or at least gaping, holes in others.Why was the state committee left out of such a meticulous report?\u201cI don\u2019t comment on confidential memos,\u201d Ms. Sugarman said.If we are going to criminalize politics, why spare one committee from the opprobrium heaped on others?\u201cAll my investigations and anything that goes on within my division is confidential,\u201d Ms. Sugarman said.For other committees, she diagrams a web of money that moved from donors associated with Mr. de Blasio into party committees in several counties, and then was spent on, or by, the candidates\u2019 campaigns.The report detects a level of coordination that, in her view, achieved its purpose: to frustrate both disclosure requirements and contribution limits. She cites an email from the campaign manager for a Senate candidate in Ulster County to the treasurer of the county Democratic committee. \u201cHas the check for $60K cleared?\u201d the campaign manager asked. \u201cBelow is our banking info, we need the 60 transferred over ASAP please.\u201dThis email shows that they \u201cpreviously had discussions about this matter,\u201d Ms. Sugarman wrote, adding, \u201cThis pattern of activity indicates that the committees already had committed to these expenditures prior to receiving the funds.\u201d Thus, the everyday plaintive wails of political operatives trying to win elections \u2014 I need that check ASAP! \u2014 was rendered as an act in a nearly sinister conspiracy.Others might see this as tactical spending and fund-raising; to Ms. Sugarman, it amounts to an evasion forbidden by law. It certainly has a long history. Mr. de Blasio\u2019s predecessor as mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, sent $75,000 to the New York State Senate Republican Campaign Committee during the last days before a special election on Long Island in 2007. The check was delivered on Jan. 26, for an election held 11 days later. The money supported a single Republican candidate, in one campaign, with a donation many times the limit Mr. Bloomberg would have been permitted if he had given the money directly to the campaign.If it seems strange that Mr. de Blasio is now on the griddle when so many others could just as easily have provided fixings for the same meal, it\u2019s important to remember that the corrupting force of campaign money was part of the work of the Moreland Commission in 2013 and 2014.The city, unlike the state, has a reasonably strong and effective public financing law. Elsewhere, money in politics finds its own level. It is not a heartening sight, said Bill Cunningham, a former executive director of the state Democratic committee.\u201cThat level,\u201d he said, \u201cis somewhere between a bog and a swamp.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Uncertainty at Top of Ticket, Republicans Back Off in Some States", "Date": "2016-04-21", "News": "Supported byHOLLYWOOD, Fla. \u2014 The Republican National Committee is scaling back its financial commitments to some of the most hotly contested states because of flagging fund-raising, the most concrete evidence yet of how the party\u2019s divisive and protracted presidential race is threatening the party\u2019s entire ticket in November.Committee officials outlined detailed plans in written \u201cplaybooks\u201d distributed this year in the most competitive states about how they intended to assist Republican campaigns up and down the ballot with money and manpower. By July 1, Florida was to have 256 field organizers and Ohio another 176, for example, according to a state party chairman in possession of the strategy books who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters.But Sean Spicer, the committee\u2019s chief strategist, acknowledged this week that the committee had begun informing state parties and statewide campaigns that fulfilling such plans would now be \u201cslower.\u201d He said the pledges had been made with the assumption that Republicans would have \u201ca presumptive presidential nominee by now.\u201dJust as revealing, the party is also taking steps to create a separate fund-raising entity dedicated to Senate races, an acknowledgment that many of the wealthiest contributors are increasingly focused on protecting Republican control of Congress rather than on a presidential campaign they fear is lost.Taken together, the party\u2019s financial difficulties illustrate the considerable fallout Republicans are facing from a nominating contest that could last through mid-July and that features two leading candidates, Donald J. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz, who are deeply troublesome to many leading Republican donors.\u201cI think everything is up in the air,\u201d said Matt Borges, the chairman of the Republican Party in Ohio, which in addition to being a perennial, and perhaps the pre-eminent, swing state is also home to a competitive Senate race this year.That sense of uncertainty, along with ample apprehension, loomed this week over the party\u2019s spring meeting here. What is typically an organizational gathering and convivial reunion for Republican state chairmen and chairwomen and other committee members has been subsumed by an explosive presidential race in which the front-runner is waging open war against the party and its longstanding nomination rules.More worrisome to many veteran Republicans than Mr. Trump\u2019s complaints about the delegate-selection process, though, is what his nomination could mean for the party\u2019s prospects across the board this fall. Mr. Trump has no high-dollar donor network and has given little indication that he is willing to tap into his fortune to give the party the hundreds of millions of dollars it will require to finance its campaigns in the fall.In remarks to committee members here Thursday night, Mr. Trump\u2019s new top strategist, Paul Manafort, sought to allay these fears without being overly specific. \u201cHe is prepared to work with the R.N.C. and the committees to raise the money necessary so that we will be well funded,\u201d Mr. Manafort said.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.In the 2012 elections, the R.N.C. raised more than $409 million. The party has raised $135 million this election, but what is deeply concerning to many Republican candidates, contributors and strategists is that it only had a little more than $16 million on hand, along with nearly $2 million in debt, at the end of March. Mr. Spicer stressed that this was partly because the committee had already begun paying to send staff members to battleground states, well ahead of the same time four years ago.But the party\u2019s modest cash availability underscores how much hangs in the balance with its nominee.\u201cThe minute Trump gets the nomination, the party is going to have to raise another three or four hundred million,\u201d said Al Hoffman, a Florida-based Republican donor. \u201cTrump should pay for it himself.\u201dMr. Hoffman, a former R.N.C. finance chairman, is the sort of contributor who illustrates the party\u2019s predicament. He said he had little appetite to raise money for a Trump-led party and would probably focus his efforts this year on helping a local House candidate and assisting the re-election of his friend, Senator John McCain of Arizona. And he emphasized that he was not alone.\u201cAll the donors I\u2019ve talked to have said they want to sit out the presidential and just focus on the Senate and House,\u201d Mr. Hoffman said.Ray Washburne, a Republican fund-raiser from Dallas who also previously served as a national committee finance chairman, said, \u201cThere\u2019s a big switch to doing the Senate races and trying to hold onto the Senate.\u201dMr. Washburne said Mr. Trump, who has relied on mostly small-dollar contributors in addition to about $36 million of his own money, showed no sign of being prepared for the fund-raising demands of a presidential general election.\u201cThe Trump group has done nothing about putting together a finance team at all,\u201d he said.And Mr. Washburne would know. A former finance chairman of Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s presidential campaign, Mr. Washburne was brought backstage to meet Mr. Trump in February when Mr. Christie, of New Jersey, endorsed Mr. Trump. Mr. Washburne said Mr. Trump lavished him with praise \u2014 \u201che makes you feel like a million dollars\u201d \u2014 but did not ask him for any help raising money or to connect him with other top fund-raisers.In the months since, Mr. Washburne said, he has not heard from Mr. Trump, even as donors have asked him, because of his ties to Mr. Christie, how they could help Mr. Trump. \u201cI don\u2019t even know who the hell to tell them to call,\u201d Mr. Washburne said.This sort of unease about Mr. Trump, along with the dislike many of the party\u2019s business-oriented donors have for the hard-line Mr. Cruz, has prompted the R.N.C. to begin privately assuring donors that it will create a so-called Senate Trust fund. Money earmarked for that fund will go entirely to initiatives aimed at retaining the Senate \u2014 including hiring field operatives and opposition researchers and bolstering digital efforts.\u201cWe want to be able to look a donor in the eye and say, \u2018Yes, your dollars are going to help maintain the Senate,\u2019 \u201d said Mr. Spicer, who confirmed the program\u2019s creation.The idea rankled top officials at the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the party\u2019s Senate campaign arm, who said they had not been informed of the R.N.C.\u2019s Senate plan.The money cannot come soon enough to strategists and campaign officials in the most contested states, many of which, feature a competitive presidential race and hard-fought campaigns for Senate and governor.The situation is particularly urgent in Florida, the largest of the traditional presidential swing states, which this year is holding a wide-open contest for Senator Marco Rubio\u2019s seat, the outcome of which could determine control of the Senate.The usually well-funded Florida Republican Party has encountered financial difficulties since Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s preferred candidate for state party chairman was rejected last year, making it more reliant on national assistance. What is more, the sort of get-out-the-vote efforts that are typically funded by the parties are especially crucial in Florida, because many of its voters cast absentee ballots or take advantage of early voting.\u201cWe\u2019ve never not had a robust absentee and early-voting program in Florida,\u201d said David Johnson, a longtime Republican strategist here.There is similar concern in North Carolina, where what may be the country\u2019s most competitive governor\u2019s race is being fought and where Republicans who have seen private polling say Mr. Trump is trailing Hillary Clinton.But, as in other battleground states, that appears to be delayed until the national party has more clarity about its finances.\u201cThe unspoken concern,\u201d said Mr. Borges, the Ohio chairman, is that if Mr. Trump secures the nomination, \u201che, No. 1, won\u2019t participate in fund-raising for the party, and, No. 2, donors won\u2019t want to help the party if he\u2019s the nominee.\u201d\u201cSo that would put a real damper on fund-raising in a number of ways.\u201dMaggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The New Europeans", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "As refugees stream into Europe, and terror attacks spark security fears, one Bavarian village grapples with newcomers \u2014 and with the question of what it means to be German.Supported byRead in GermanIt was on a Friday in September 2014 that Thomas Kamm, the mayor of Siegsdorf Municipality, an affluent cluster of villages in the foothills of the Bavarian Alps, learned that the world refugee crisis would be coming to his town. He was barbecuing for his wife\u2019s birthday when he received a call from the German Interior Ministry. Four hundred asylum seekers, who recently arrived in the European Union on the Italian island Lampedusa, were being transported to Germany, the ministry official informed him. A vacant bungalow resort located in one of the villages under the mayor\u2019s jurisdiction \u2014 Eisen\u00e4rzt, population, 1,300 \u2014 had been determined a suitable place to house them temporarily. Kamm, a thin, middle-aged former mechanical engineer and a singer in a local a cappella group, managed to negotiate down the number of asylum seekers his town would host, to 200 from 400. The villagers, he told me, were wary of hosting a large number of foreigners from places like Syria and Afghanistan; 400 of them would be \u201cabsolutely a no go.\u201d The first migrants arrived on buses two days later. Kamm said he would never forget the looks on their faces. \u201cPure exhaustion, pure fear,\u201d he said, exhaling so deeply that his lips flapped together. Each of his parents lived through World War II, he told me, but they never said much about their experiences. \u201cI can understand why after seeing those refugees.\u201d That Sunday, Kamm went to local churches to inform the citizenry. \u201cNo one was happy,\u201d he said. Still, most people recognized the need to help: \u201cHumanity stood in the foreground.\u201dThis amalgam of alarm and empathy was once again evident last June, when Kamm returned to church to inform the villagers of Eisen\u00e4rzt that more asylum seekers were on the way. By then, the original 200 migrants had been resettled elsewhere, but many more asylum seekers from places like Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan were arriving on Greece\u2019s Aegean Islands in perilously overcrowded boats, then forging a grueling path through the Balkans toward the security and prosperity of Northern Europe and, most often, Germany. Bavaria was the first German state they encountered along the way. Migrants were showing up in train stations or emerging from the backs of smugglers\u2019 trucks, and it often fell to local officials, people like Kamm, to find somewhere to house them. Asylum seekers ended up in school gymnasiums, shuttered big-box stores and crowded tent encampments.Many of the villagers were not pleased with this development. Some expressed concerns about the safety of local women and children, and others later grumbled about the cost to taxpayers. The mayor argued that the move prevented a more unpalatable outcome. It was clear that the Mallersdorfer Sisters\u2019 mostly vacant residence was an ideal shelter; technically, it was big enough to fit 350 asylum seekers. If the municipality did not buy the building, the district government or a private investor seeking to rent it to the government would, and those outside buyers would likely fill it to capacity. Ownership would provide the town with some ability to control its fate.The mayor\u2019s argument was widely accepted around town, but this did not seem to comfort him. In his office last fall, Kamm suggested that he had barely prevented a citizen uprising. Had 350 asylum seekers come to Eisen\u00e4rzt, the reaction would have been \u201criots,\u201d he told me. The situation, he believed, still remained volatile. I found it hard to imagine rioting in a bucolic Bavarian village and asked the mayor if he was being a bit dramatic. He said that he meant something like the anti-immigrant protests that were occurring weekly in Dresden and had spread to other parts of Germany, sometimes attracting tens of thousands. These were not just peaceful demonstrations, Kamm said; there was something menacing about them. Should the situation in his town \u201cescalate,\u201d he expected similar protests. He said that the majority of asylum seekers were men from Syria, many of whom would try to bring their families \u2014 \u201ctheir three kids and their two wives,\u201d as he put it. \u201cThe number of Syrian people will explode here.\u201dThe mayor told me that he had received anonymous letters that were \u201cclearly xenophobic.\u201d They did not represent the views of the vast majority of his constituents, he said, many of whom exhibited commendable charity. But the mass of people entering the country was so uncontrolled, he said, that even people with good intentions were upset.Kamm had a few policeman friends who had worked on the border; his doctor, too, had volunteered there. They shared with him disconcerting stories about the chaotic registration of migrants, many of whom arrived without documentation. One arriving migrant, he heard, needed a new kidney; others had ailments requiring expensive medicines. The German taxpayer was on the hook for their care.\u201cThey are not voters for far-right parties,\u201d he said of the people who told him these stories. \u201cThey are fulfilling their duties to humanity. But when they see what the reality looks like, they have doubts.\u201d Should the government not act to reduce the migrant influx, he feared an unseemly political backlash. He referred to a German expression to make his point: One should not paint the devil on the wall.By the end of August, the Mallersdorfer Sisters had departed. In September, the first of the Syrians arrived.Merkel, concluding that the only way to hold the European Union together was to curb migration closer to the source, pushed for a deal with Turkey. Turkey \u2014 in exchange for, among other incentives, the revival of stalled talks on its bid to join the European Union \u2014 agreed in March to take back Syrians and other migrants who used the country as a steppingstone to Europe. The deal, questionable in legal and ethical terms, did little to quell the concerns of many Germans about the migrants already among them. Terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels have inflamed fears that ISIS is exploiting the refugee crisis to infiltrate Europe undetected; they have also heightened longstanding concerns about Islamist radicalization in disaffected migrant communities. In February, the head of Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence service assessed the risk of a terrorist attack in Germany as \u201chigh.\u201d And the wave of sexual assaults and robberies attributed to a multitude of young North African and Middle Eastern men, among them asylum seekers, on New Year\u2019s Eve in Cologne drew comparisons to the mass sexual assaults on women in Tahrir Square during the Egyptian revolution, sparking a debate about a clash with \u201cMuslim culture,\u201d as one conservative parliamentarian put it.In that sense, Bavarian towns like Siegsdorf Municipality sit at both the symbolic and the practical heart of the conundrum facing Germany. Whether the nation deals successfully with the migration challenge or succumbs to fear and nationalism will largely be determined by how communities like Siegsdorf \u2014 those directly charged with welcoming the migrants \u2014 confront the challenges ahead. Like much of Bavaria, the town clings steadfastly to a sense of tradition. The vital question the villagers and their asylum-seeking neighbors now face is whether together they will be able to define a new one.When Yasser arrived at the Mallersdorfer Sisters\u2019 former residence in September, he was shown to his single room on an upper floor and greeted by the caretaker of the residence, Beni Beilhack, a multiple-pierced 36-year-old with thinning hair and a persistent smile. In the following days, Yasser, bored, began to follow Beilhack around, hoping to help with work around the residence. Eventually, Beilhack delegated some tasks to Yasser: repairing a broken doorknob, blowing leaves off the hiking trails near the residence. By October, Beilhack had outfitted Yasser with work clothes and made him his unofficial assistant. The two communicated with a peculiar mix of English, German and Arabic. Under Yasser\u2019s tutelage, Beilhack\u2019s command of Arabic profanities expanded rapidly, and Beilhack dispensed this knowledge liberally throughout his workday, to the delight of many of the young Syrian men. Beilhack, who worked as a truck driver before the Syrians came to town, told me he did not miss his old job, and he seemed to relish his interaction with the Syrians. He started inviting Yasser to family dinners. After school, Beilhack\u2019s son, Luca, then 12, often came by the residence. The Syrians were generally \u201cwarmer\u201d than the local residents, Luca told me, adding, \u201cI\u2019d be happy if they lived here forever.\u201dBeilhack\u2019s 64-year-old mother, Evelyn, also works as a caretaker at the residence, where she lives on the ground floor with her husband. Evelyn held the position previously, when the sisters lived there. When Evelyn learned the Syrians would be moving in, she rejoiced. The nuns nitpicked about the smallest details, she told me, creating an oppressive work environment. She grew up in what she called a \u201cvery international\u201d town, a place called Geretsried, south of Munich, which was settled by Germans expelled from Eastern Europe after World War II. Later, Southern European guest workers arrived. Growing up there left her open to seeing what the asylum seekers would be like. \u201cYou hear from a lot of different places about what an abominable people they are \u2014 not Syrians, but altogether, this whole mass of asylum seekers that are streaming in here,\u201d she told me. People called them \u201cterrible and slobs and poorly raised and primitive.\u201d She wanted to find out for herself, she said. \u201cI thought: I\u2019ll take this on. I want to see this. I want to know this.\u201dThrough his conversations with the Beilhacks, Yasser began to understand something of life in Germany. Evelyn told him how much money was deducted from people\u2019s paychecks for taxes and health insurance, and the cost of living generally seemed far higher than in prewar Syria. Back at home, his wife did some work in a private office, but he would not allow her to work for a firm. Women in Syria were not supposed to hold down such jobs, he said. In Germany, however, he would have to reconsider. He and his wife probably wouldn\u2019t be able to afford a house and a car if she didn\u2019t work too. \u201cLife here is hard,\u201d he said. If the war in Syria ended, he told me, he would go back in a minute.Despite his growing friendship with Beni Beilhack, Yasser spent a considerable amount of time cocooned in his room, his mood dark. Yasser had worked since his teenage years. Out at sea, he was a boatswain, supervising deck crews. In Germany, he was living in what was effectively an isolated dormitory with little to do but smoke and sip tea. During his journey from Turkey, another migrant told him that Germany would allow him to bring his wife after six months. Yasser, however, was realizing that it would take a lot longer, if he would be able to bring her at all. \u201cI can\u2019t live without my wife,\u201d he told me. The process of \u201cfamily reunification\u201d \u2014 a legal method for recognized refugees to bring their families to join them \u2014 is often long. German politicians have meanwhile debated whether to seriously limit the practice. In November, the interior minister, Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re, announced that Syrians would, in the future, be granted a lesser form of protection instead of refugee status, and as a consequence, they would lose the right to bring their families. The announcement sparked uproar within the governing coalition, and the ministry backtracked.One day in October, Yasser\u2019s spirits sank still further. Across the street from the residence, next to the small Eisen\u00e4rzt train station, some Syrians found leaflets bearing the message \u201cNo Asylum.\u201d Yasser didn\u2019t leave the residence for several days. \u201cHow would you feel if you found out some people don\u2019t like you?\u201d he told me. Beni Beilhack noticed that the S on the leaflets was written to resemble those used in the angular logo of the Nazi SS. (On another occasion, I found similar fliers at the train station; in addition to the menacing S, the L was shaped like a hangman\u2019s gallows.)Like Yasser, Beilhack took the message personally. \u201cIf some right-wing extremist comes here, I\u2019ll be standing in front,\u201d he said. Last year, Germany had more than a sixfold increase in the number of violent crimes directed at residences for asylum seekers and refugees: 177 offenses, including 94 cases of arson or attempted arson, according to a provisional tally by the Federal Criminal Police Office. The growing violence drove the German president, Joachim Gauck, to speak last August of two Germanys in conflict with each other: \u201cBright Germany\u201d \u2014 the Germany of charity and compassion \u2014 against \u201cDark Germany\u201d \u2014 the Germany of hate and xenophobia.\u201cGood morning,\u201d Bech said to the all-male class in German. \u201cThese are my children.\u201dThe Syrian men responded in unison, as instructed: \u201cThose are your children.\u201dBech seemed to take genuine delight in the Syrians\u2019 progress. \u201cYou\u2019re all very good!\u201d Her children helped with the lesson, holding up colored pencils and announcing the hues. \u201cThis is orange,\u201d said Elena, who was 7. \u201cOrange,\u201d the men repeated. \u201cThis is what a teddy bear looks like,\u201d said Jakob, age 5.Most people I met, however, did not seem embroiled in a cosmic battle between bright and dark sides, as Gauck had outlined it; instead, many occupied a kind of gray Germany, where ambivalence reigned. Even some of those who reached out in fellowship to the asylum seekers were not free of apprehension about their arrival. When I met a local Catholic priest, Thomas Graf von Rechberg, in his office in Siegsdorf, he told me that Pope Francis\u2019 visit to Lampedusa in July 2013 \u2014 Francis\u2019 first trip outside Rome as pope \u2014 had moved him to reach out to asylum seekers arriving in his area in order to calm rising tensions and to \u201cdefuse the social explosive agent.\u201d When, the following year, 16 asylum seekers, many of them from Afghanistan, moved in to a guesthouse near a towering church where he preaches, Graf von Rechberg began making occasional visits. Last November, the day after the terrorist attacks in Paris, he planned to go again, but he was struck by what he described as a \u201cstrange feeling\u201d that made him hesitate. He nevertheless decided to visit the home to hand out pictures of Mary and some sweets.\u201cIt was for me, really, psychotherapy,\u201d he told me. It didn\u2019t matter that not everyone accepted the pictures of Mary. The experience healed him \u201cfrom the mistrust that forms.\u201dGraf von Rechberg is an interesting man. He invited asylum seekers into his home for dinner, but he held an almost apocalyptic view of their presence in Germany. Many of them, he predicted, would come to live in Muslim-majority ghettos like those in Paris, \u201cwhere they don\u2019t do anything, don\u2019t work and then watch some stupid Internet films, and then some will carry out terrorist attacks,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t change that. I can only accept it, and that will be our future.\u201dI asked him if this vision wasn\u2019t a bit fatalistic. He told me that he saw matters in a religious light. Germany\u2019s Christians had grown too complacent and materialistic, and the challenges ahead \u2014 ISIS attacks included \u2014 would force them to remember their Christian values. \u201cCozy postwar Germany\u201d was a thing of the past, he told me. And yet he saw this new unease as good for the soul. For him personally, the discomfort was a chance for self-improvement and an opportunity to double down on values of openness and benevolence in the face of anxiety. \u201cGermany is very much bound in this international migration of peoples,\u201d he said. \u201cI must realize this chance, because if I don\u2019t, then I\u2019ll get bitter.\u201dI sat at a table across from Rainer Klapfenberger, a 62-year-old retiree who serves on the town council. Klapfenberger, a Social Democrat in a part of the country where there are not many Social Democrats, told me it was proper that asylum seekers and refugees in Germany benefit from its expansive social safety net. For Klapfenberger, however, the problem was that the same safety net had proved inadequate for many Germans. \u201cHow many people in Traunstein\u201d \u2014 a small city nearby \u2014 \u201care picking through the garbage for bottles?\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re giving preference to the refugees against our own poor people. Many people don\u2019t understand that.\u201d That sentiment is widespread: In February, Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel, the leader of the Social Democratic Party, called for an increase in public spending \u2014 \u201ca new solidarity package for our own population\u201d \u2014 in order to quell such discontent. Gabriel said he, too, often heard Germans say, \u201cFor them you do everything, for us you do nothing,\u201d and this required remedy. (Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats rejected Gabriel\u2019s idea.)\u201cPeople have justified worries about how things will turn out if other cultures take the upper hand,\u201d the elder Scheck said in the small firehouse meeting room, where we had moved to escape the loud music. He\u2019d seen one Syrian walking around town with a girl on his shoulders, presumably his daughter. \u201cWhere was the wife?\u201d he wondered. Scheck presumed this was a sign of gender inequality. \u201cWith us, men and women are equal,\u201d he said.At this point, Christian, who worked for a medical-supply distributor, chimed in. The refugees, he believed, would have a hard time entering the work force. He praised Germany\u2019s strong apprenticeship and vocational-training tradition, of which he had partaken, and was skeptical that asylum seekers\u2019 qualifications could compare. In September, Germany\u2019s labor minister, Andrea Nahles, warned that fewer than 10 percent of asylum seekers arrived with the qualifications needed to immediately begin a job or apprenticeship. Unemployment, she warned, would rise. Over the long run, many German economists said, the migration wave would benefit the economy, but everyone agrees that this will require significant upfront investment in education and job training.Christian and his father didn\u2019t think it would work out well. Many of the Syrians wouldn\u2019t want to stay in a small village like Eisen\u00e4rzt anyway, Christian said. They would want to go to Munich or Berlin. \u201cThat\u2019s the one advantage that we have.\u201d As an afterthought, he added that his son had enjoyed playing with some of refugee children who briefly stayed in town one year earlier. They met on a soccer field. \u201cThe children can get along with one another a lot more easily than the adults,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re free.\u201dQraluq was not in a good mood. Nobody in the room was. Whereas the Syrians up the road were virtually assured of receiving refugee status, Afghans, who last year were the second-largest group of migrants entering the country, won some form of protection less than half the time. And there were signs that Germany, which for years had considered it impossible to repatriate Afghans, might soon start sending some back. In October, de Maizi\u00e8re, the interior minister, declared it \u201cunacceptable\u201d that so many Afghans were coming, he said, as not all parts of Afghanistan were unsafe. A few months later, he visited Kabul and discouraged Afghans from trying to come to Germany, saying, \u201cYou will lose your money and gain no future.\u201d Qraluq later noted with grim resignation that the day of de Maizi\u00e8re\u2019s visit, a Taliban suicide bomber attacked a Kabul police complex, killing at least 20 people.Many of the Afghans I met in Siegsdorf told me that the Taliban would immediately kill them if they returned. On the night I met him, Qraluq told me not to believe everything I was told. \u201cLots of people who come here are lying,\u201d he said. Qraluq, however, said he had no reason to lie. He told me that he served as an interpreter for British and Danish troops operating in Helmand Province in 2011. The Taliban, he said, got word of his cooperation with foreign troops and threatened him and his family. When that happened, the family fled to Pakistan. From there, Qraluq continued on to Germany. If the German government tried to return him, he was certain he would be killed: \u201cI\u2019m on top of the list.\u201dQraluq went back to his small room, which he shared with an Eritrean asylum seeker with whom he did not get along \u2014 \u201cI\u2019ve become allergic to the sound of the Eritrean language,\u201d he said \u2014 and came back with some evidence of his interpreter service, like letters of appreciation from two Danish captains.\u201cKhalil is very pleasant and never complains,\u201d read one of them. By his own account, though, Qraluq was no longer as pleasant as he once was. Two years of waiting on an asylum decision had left him embittered. He had trouble sleeping and felt constantly tense. He was tired of being an asylum seeker, he said, of getting dirty looks on the street. \u201cWhen they look, they hate me.\u201dQraluq\u2019s unhappiness hadn\u2019t made him idle. He attended vocational school and had learned to speak pretty good German. He also worked roughly 50 hours a month at a supermarket in Traunstein and was set to begin an apprenticeship there later in the year. The day after the drinking session, I met Qraluq at an auto-repair shop where he was interning as part of his vocational-school training. As he cleaned the grease off a hose with turpentine-soaked paper towels, he told me about the time in Helmand Province that he was sitting in a tank with Danish soldiers and a roadside bomb went off in front of them. \u201cThe gunner was bleeding from his eyes, nose and ears,\u201d Qraluq said. A few days later, I accompanied him to his job at the supermarket. We arrived a bit early, and he lit a cigarette outside, in front of a large advertisement that said, \u201cThe Best of the Best.\u201d Qraluq told me that he used to want to be a politician or a diplomat. Now he just wanted a simple life. If everything went according to plan, he would complete his supermarket apprenticeship in three years. A few moments later, the deputy store manager, Philipp Huber, 22, walked out and lit a cigarette. He praised Qraluq for being self-motivated. It wasn\u2019t easy for the supermarket to find good workers like him, he said.Qraluq started his shift in the drinks aisle, making sure the juice cartons were perfectly aligned. Later, he visited a break room and lit a cigarette. After a few drags, a voice echoed over the sound system. \u201cKhalil to the vegetable department.\u201d Qraluq quickly extinguished the cigarette and ran out to stock some persimmons.\u201cHow sweet!\u201d said Sieglinde Seidl, a smiley woman who had just taken a seat in the break room. \u201cVery nice guy.\u201d Seidl was a butcher and had worked in the meats department for 26 years. \u201cWhen I hear people complaining about refugees, I tell them, \u2018You don\u2019t know how good you have it,\u2019\u2009\u201d she said. She then vaguely recalled having some colleagues long ago who were refugees \u2014 she couldn\u2019t quite remember from where \u2014 but they had to leave the country. \u201cMaybe they were from Bosnia?\u201d I suggested. In the early-to-mid-1990s, during the Bosnian War, Germany gave temporary protection to 345,000 refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina. In 1996, the German government started an effort to send them back. Seidl thought Bosnia sounded right. It was a real shame when those former co-workers had to leave, she said. \u201cI hope these refugees get to stay.\u201dWhen I met Qraluq again in late winter, he was more anxious and had dropped out of vocational school because of absences. He was trying to get back into a better mood, he told me, but it was a struggle. He had seen Syrians receive refugee status even though they arrived in Germany long after him. He could not understand why the Europeans didn\u2019t want Afghans. \u201cWhat is the problem with us?\u201d he said. \u201cWhat did we do in Europe? No Afghans attacked Paris.\u201dIt was not entirely surprising, then, that one of the most openly angry people I met in Eisen\u00e4rzt was an American woman from Ohio named Allison Kollmayer. I ran into Kollmayer at the village Christmas bazaar, a small sale to raise money for charity at the local church. The event mostly drew elderly residents, who dined on cake and coffee served to them by women in dirndls. When I arrived, I sat at a table and tried to make conversation about the 100 Syrians in the village. The guests reacted with remarkable silence. Then someone introduced me to Kollmayer, who was holding one of the items for sale \u2014 a pine cone topped with a miniature Santa hat. \u201cWe are against this huge onslaught!\u201d said Kollmayer, who married a local man and has lived in Eisen\u00e4rzt for three decades. \u201cI\u2019m really, really angry.\u201dAfter fuming for a while, she paused and laughed, as if amused by her own anger. She seemed a bit uninhibited for the gathering, and people in the room looked uncomfortable. \u201cYou should not discuss it,\u201d a woman in a dirndl whispered to Kollmayer. \u201cHe\u2019s writing it down.\u201d Kollmayer was not dissuaded. She told me she \u201cwas not prejudiced against anyone\u201d but was angry about the disorderly way the Syrians rode their bikes on the street (\u201cI\u2019ve almost been run over twice!\u201d). She was angry about the amount of cash asylum seekers were getting from the government (\u201cThey should get a little bit, but not what they have\u201d). She was angry that, according to her, the police were not allowed to talk about the crimes migrants committed (\u201cMy girlfriend\u2019s daughter is a police officer, and they\u2019re not allowed to report the truth\u201d).\u201cCan I have a beer?\u201d I said. A woman rose to serve me.\u201cWhere are you from?\u201d said one of the customers. He was tall, and his bald crown nearly reached the portraits of King Ludwig II of Bavaria on the wall above him. When I told him I was from the United States, he smiled as if this was O.K. The man, who later introduced himself as Michael Scholz, a produce-truck driver, told me there were too many migrants coming over the border. \u201cThis is why the Germans will get nasty again,\u201d he said. He then put up his right arm in the manner of a Hitler salute so that there wasn\u2019t any doubt about his meaning.He also told me that asylum seekers had raped three women in Freilassing. (The mayor of that town told me there were no rapes.) Scholz\u2019s companion, sitting next to him, said the police couldn\u2019t speak about such matters because of a \u201cpledge of secrecy.\u201d She didn\u2019t want to give me her name and nearly burst into tears when Scholz did, worried about the consequences. \u201cYou can\u2019t say these things,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no freedom of opinion.\u201d Scholz told her that he didn\u2019t care. He was fed up. Then he turned to me. The municipality had to put in new kitchens for the Syrians, he said. \u201cWho pays for that? I do. And for that, I get massively nasty.\u201d Another couple entered the restaurant and joined the table, ordering sausage and French fries. They nodded approvingly as Scholz went on. \u201cNinety percent of those who come aren\u2019t refugees,\u201d he said. \u201cThey come here because we have the cash.\u201d They wore Adidas shoes and had iPhones, he said. \u201cI can barely look at them because I get so angry.\u201dOthers wished to stay in Siegsdorf Municipality, the only German home they knew. This presented a set of entirely new challenges. The mayor was considering ways to provide low-income housing and how to ease access to the job market. At the same time, he still seemed worried about the local mood. He told me about one nearby municipality where residents got into an \u201copen confrontation\u201d with elected officials over opposition to a residence for asylum seekers. By contrast, things in his town were quiet, he told me, but this could change instantaneously if one of the migrants did \u201csomething bad.\u201d I asked the mayor what he meant. \u201cA rape,\u201d he said in a matter-of-fact manner.A few weeks later, after the attacks in Brussels, Graf von Rechberg noticed what he called \u201ca greater wariness\u201d among his congregants. On Holy Thursday, he gave a sermon on how Christians ought to confront the darkness and evil implicit in the Brussels attack. He advised congregants to pray for peace, to avoid the temptation to hide from outsiders, to accept refugees. During the service, Graf von Rechberg washed the feet of a Pakistani asylum seeker, as Jesus had washed his disciples\u2019 feet before the crucifixion. When I spoke to him later, Graf von Rechberg still seemed resigned to a darker future for Germany. The social problems and fanaticism that led to the attacks in Brussels, he told me, were perhaps unsolvable. Still, it was everyone\u2019s spiritual obligation to try. When I asked him if he visited asylum seekers to hand out gifts after the Brussels attack, as he did following the Paris attack. Graf von Rechberg suggested the violence had become grim routine. \u201cI can\u2019t go by after every attack,\u201d he said.At the Mallersdorfer Sisters\u2019 former residence in Eisen\u00e4rzt, Yasser continued to try to transition to a normal life in Germany. In December, Beni Beilhack accompanied Yasser to his asylum interview in Munich. The questioning lasted about an hour. Had Yasser witnessed an aerial bombardment? (No.) Had he ever fought for Bashar al-Assad? (No.) Had he fought for ISIS? (No.) A few weeks later, Yasser received notice: He had been granted refugee status. Yasser, who was still missing his wife and wondering how long it would take to bring her, was ambivalent about the news. Beilhack seemed to try his best to cheer him up. He helped Yasser file the application to bring her to Germany and found him a modest one-bedroom sublet in Eisen\u00e4rzt.The move took place on a sunny Saturday morning. Beilhack and Evelyn gathered the items they thought Yasser would need, down to small details. Evelyn packed cutting boards and an oven mitt taken from a storage room filled with goods donated by local residents. Beilhack procured plastic chairs and a table for the balcony. That morning, Yasser looked as if he hadn\u2019t slept much. The day before, he asked me if it would be proper, according to German custom, to knock on the neighbors\u2019 doors and introduce himself. I referred the question to Evelyn. \u201cThat\u2019s a hard one,\u201d she said. Some of the neighbors, she added, had complained about a Syrian moving in. Yasser decided he would forgo the introductions.After he arrived in his new apartment, Yasser stood on his balcony and took in the view: the neighboring houses and the pine-tree-covered hill beyond them. It was very quiet. Yasser joked with Beni about disrupting the serenity. He would raise chickens on the balcony and invite all the Syrians over for a party. Yasser grabbed Beni\u2019s son, Luca, by the hand and mimicked a foot-stomping Syrian dance. \u201cAllahu akbar!\u201d he whispered as if screaming. \u201cPolice coming in one minute,\u201d he added wryly.Yasser then stepped out onto the balcony for a cigarette and peered at the lawn below. One neighbor, an old man in his slippers, appeared on the path next to his house. Before turning the corner, the man glanced up at Yasser for a moment and then looked away, saying nothing.James Angelos is a writer based in Berlin and the author of \u201cThe Full Catastrophe: Travels Among the New Greek Ruins.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Leaders Roll Up Sleeves on Climate, but Experts Say Plans Don\u2019t Pack a Wallop", "Date": "2016-04-21", "News": "Supported byBut can they deliver on their promises to fight global warming?After a quarter-century of failed diplomatic efforts, signs are growing that nations have turned a corner in their political willingness to tackle climate change. Many leaders are pushing to make the Paris agreement legally binding years earlier than originally expected. The falling cost of clean energy is providing a powerful tailwind for their efforts.For all the signs of progress and political will, however, new challenges to implementing the accord have arisen just since December. Outside experts also say the countries\u2019 bare-bones plans are still far from enough to keep global warming to tolerable levels. No country has shared a detailed, credible strategy to achieve what scientists think is necessary: ending the era of fossil-fuel emissions and converting entirely to clean energy no later than the middle of this century.Unless countries develop more ambitious plans, the experts say, the world could ultimately suffer profound consequences, including debilitating heat waves, food shortages and fast-rising seas.World leaders are gathering Friday to sign the Paris Agreement on climate change. Here\u2019s a status report on the key players and their efforts to slow greenhouse gas emissions.In developing countries, hundreds of coal-burning power plants are still on the drawing board. And oil and gas companies continue to invest billions of dollars a year searching for new reserves of fossil fuels.\u201cThe signing ceremony, the unprecedented number of countries that are going to sign is creating a momentum,\u201d said Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists, a Washington advocacy group. \u201cBut there is still a lot of work to do, not just in the U.S. but around the world, to nail down these domestic actions.\u201dLooming large over the climate push is the American presidential election. The Democratic candidates, Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, have promised to build on Mr. Obama\u2019s legacy and to pursue strong climate policies. But the two leading Republicans, Donald J. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, have questioned the science of climate change and sharply criticized the Paris agreement.The issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.The fight over a nominee to the Supreme Court is, in part, a fight over the fate of the Clean Power Plan, which is intended to limit emissions from power plants in the United States.The plan still has to move through a June hearing in a federal circuit court, and the deciding vote when it gets to the Supreme Court for a final ruling could well be cast by Justice Scalia\u2019s replacement.Moreover, even if the plan is upheld, some experts have concluded that Mr. Obama is likely to leave office without establishing policies sufficient to ensure the country will meet the pledge he offered in Paris: to reduce American emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent in 2025, compared with their level in 2005.The White House contends that it is still on track to meet those targets, and Brian Deese, the White House climate change advisor, said he and his staff are now preparing models and plans to lay the groundwork for the next president to strengthen the current policies.The signing ceremony on Friday is only an intermediate step. After, countries will still have to present formal ratification documents, and the Paris Agreement will not take effect until 55 countries representing 55 percent of global greenhouse-gas emissions have done so.That was originally expected to take at least a couple of years. But some countries are talking about rushing through the final steps, possibly even bringing the agreement into force by the end of this year, before Mr. Obama leaves office on Jan. 20.The French minister of environment and energy, S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal, alluded to the importance of the American presidential election during a meeting on Monday with reporters at the United Nations, saying the agreement might be \u201csigned and ratified by the time anybody is elected.\u201dAt that moment, the French ambassador to the United Nations, Fran\u00e7ois Delattre, uttered a stage whisper within the earshot of several reporters. \u201cOn esp\u00e8re,\u201d he said, or \u201cOne hopes.\u201dFor all the lingering political uncertainty, however, the economics of clean energy appear to be improving so rapidly that a radical acceleration of the energy transition may become possible, if governments push it along with new policies.For instance, some analyses suggest that keeping climate change to a tolerable level will require mass adoption of electric cars by the 2030s, coupled with a transition to a cleaner electricity grid to power the cars.Most of the existing power plants still run on nonrenewable energy, however, and because the plants last for decades, that is likely to change only slowly. Wind turbines and solar panels are now supplying about 10 percent of the world\u2019s electricity, a figure that has doubled in the last decade. The pace of adoption would need to rise sharply to meet the broad climate goals.As the market for clean power technology has grown, the cost has plummeted, and countries are scrambling to adapt their plans. India has promised a 20-fold increase in solar power, and bids for giant solar farms there have been coming in so low that many analysts are increasingly convinced that the country can pull it off.The promises rich countries made to secure the Paris agreement included mobilizing billions in financing for poor countries like India.\u201cIndia\u2019s needs are going to be astronomical if we are going to succeed,\u201d said Dipak Dasgupta, an Indian economist and a former board member of a United Nations fund intended to channel some of the climate money.Whether the money will materialize is one of the great uncertainties about the Paris deal. Mr. Obama has had trouble persuading Republican lawmakers to provide even small sums to advance his international climate agenda, though Congress did approve tax measures in December that would give a big push to wind and solar power in the United States over the next few years.But if the money promised by rich countries is not forthcoming, the poor countries that pledged strong climate action in Paris could easily decide to walk away, one of the many ways the progress reflected in the deal remains fragile \u2014 and easily reversible.Somini Sengupta and Ellen Barry contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Burst of Energy in Bangladesh", "Date": "2016-04-27", "News": "Supported byIn Dhaka, we are used to the phenomenon called load-shedding. It\u2019s when you\u2019re sitting under the ceiling fan on a particularly hot day, the soles of your feet burning, hoping the evening will bring rain, or at the very least, a slight breeze \u2026 and suddenly the world goes quiet, the lights go out, and the fan\u2019s revolutions slow, then stop.We look at our watches. Load-shedding, we say to one another, hoping that this instance of it will follow the usual pattern, and that the electricity will come on in exactly an hour. Any longer and we worry the food in the fridge will spoil, or that we\u2019ll miss the end of the Bangladesh-India cricket match on television.But this year, despite a scorching spring, the hum of electricity has remained constant in Dhaka. There has been no load-shedding. The Eid meat is safe in the freezer. People watched the entire cricket World Cup without a hitch. So what has changed?Power, of course. This government has done a heroic job of increasing the power output to match demand in a country where industrial and household consumption is running at breakneck speed.How will we find the resources for such aspirations?The Banshkhali plant, a joint venture between Bangladeshi and Chinese companies, has begun construction without securing site permits or carrying out an environmental impact assessment. Yet when faced with public agitation, the authorities have sided with the plant\u2019s owners, accusing protesters of being \u201cstrange\u201d and ignorant, and citing the government\u2019s commitment to supplying the power-hungry nation as paramount.Solar power, in its current form, cannot be the universal answer to Bangladesh\u2019s growing energy needs, but the program is an example of a renewable, environmentally sensitive project that has clear popular consent. There\u2019s a lesson in that for the government: Instead of riding roughshod over its citizens, refusing consultation and shooting down protesters, the authorities have to include the public in their planning decisions for the country\u2019s future energy needs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Radicalization of a Promising Student Turned Bomb Maker in Brussels", "Date": "2016-04-08", "News": "Supported byBRUSSELS \u2014 He attended Catholic school and studied electrical engineering. His immigrant family valued education and discipline. His brother carries the Belgian flag as a national martial arts champion.But none of that stopped Najim Laachraoui from being drawn to the Islamic State, or from turning the technical skills that could have provided a bright future to building the bombs that, the authorities suspect, were used in the recent attacks in Paris and Brussels.Mr. Laachraoui wheeled his handiwork into Brussels Airport on March 22 and, at age 24, blew himself up along with 15 bystanders, the authorities concluded after finding his DNA. Another attacker exploded a bomb nearby, and a third man detonated explosives on a subway, killing 17. The authorities suspect that bomb had also been made by Mr. Laachraoui.His journey from the Brussels neighborhood of Schaerbeek, where he grew up, to Syria \u2014 and back, as a changed and deadly man \u2014 is a trajectory decidedly different from that of many of his cohort, who were possessed of scant prospects and long rap sheets.In the ruthless pecking order of the Islamic State, many of the others amounted to cannon fodder. But Mr. Laachraoui was no doubt a prized recruit: an educated European who radicalized all but invisibly, not in prison, but while in the classrooms of good schools and university study groups.One former university acquaintance posted on Facebook a photograph of Mr. Laachraoui with seven other students in his electrical engineering class who had built a radio together. Mr. Laachraoui is dressed in Western clothes and stands in the back row, a sober look on his face.Why the bomb maker would himself become a suicide bomber remains one of the essential mysteries surrounding him and, much like his radicalization, defies simple explanation.In such cases, experts say, the environmental and circumstantial components can be pieced together. But the personal and psychological ones remain obscure.One practical factor, experts speculate, is a frightening one: that Mr. Laachraoui was not the only Islamic State bomb maker in Europe, and perhaps not even the only one in Belgium. It is quite possible he learned his bomb-making skills from someone more experienced who has yet to be discovered.The French and Belgian news media have reported that a man believed to be a Palestinian member of the Islamic State who has extensive bomb-making experience entered Europe shortly before the Nov. 13 attacks in Paris.While the Belgian authorities have not publicly confirmed that report, it seems unlikely that the Islamic State would allow its sole bomb maker in French-speaking Europe to be killed unless it had a backup plan.Those who knew Mr. Laachraoui in high school say his latent radicalization was hardly evident, though in retrospect perhaps there were some signs of alienation from his adopted Western culture.Mr. Laachraoui was born on May 18, 1991, in Ajdir, Morocco, but he grew up in Belgium, according to court papers. By the time he was a young man, he was clearly grappling with what kind of Muslim he wanted to be.\u201cWe are faced with a person who was in search of his Islam,\u201d said Bruno Derbaix, who taught a religion class at the Institut de la Sainte-Famille, where Mr. Laachraoui studied during high school.At least two of the attackers are believed to have had roles in both plots.In Belgium, it is not uncommon for even Muslim families to send their children to Catholic schools, which supplement the state system, and where the quality of the education and a sometimes greater comfort with religion appeal to them.In his religion class, an 18-year-old Najim Laachraoui wrote a paper on how Islam viewed slavery, a practice that the extremist Islamic State defends, particularly when it comes to non-Muslims. He wrote another on stoning, the Shariah punishment for adultery.At the time, Mr. Laachraoui struck a defensive tone, hoping that Islam would not be judged harshly for such practices.\u201cIslam did not abolish slavery directly and clearly,\u201d he wrote. Yet he emphasized that his hope was for \u201ceach person to gain his true freedom, and be sensitive to those who do not have freedom or from whom it has been taken away.\u201dBy the time of the attacks in Brussels, he had long since shed that sense of moderation. His search for his Islam, instead of enlarging his vision, led him to think more and more narrowly, Mr. Derbaix said.By Mr. Laachraoui\u2019s last year of high school, his teacher recalled, he had adopted the dress favored by Salafist Muslims, rolling his pants to above his ankle, growing a goatee and refusing to shake hands with women. He is not known to have ever had a girlfriend.\u201cOne of his Islams was purist,\u201d Mr. Derbaix said. \u201cThere are many people who practice a purist Islam and who are perfectly content in the West.\u201d\u201cBut in Najim\u2019s case,\u201d he added, \u201cthis was an Islam that had the tendency to say, \u2018Watch out, things are not going so well between Islam and the West,\u2019 so I believe he was on a trajectory where he felt less and less good.\u201dMore than 1,200 people outside of Iraq and Syria have been killed in attacks inspired or coordinated by the Islamic State.His embrace of extremism contrasted with other members of his family, who did not want to speak with reporters.The brother closest to him in age, Mourad, 20, who is also a practicing Muslim, has become one of Belgium\u2019s top taekwondo competitors.At a news conference after his brother\u2019s death, Mourad Laachraoui said that carrying the Belgium flag at international matches was \u201csomething important to me, it is what I have fought for.\u201dHis brother Najim, on the other hand, seemed to have felt increasingly like an outsider, someone who would always be scrabbling to get ahead in a place where unemployment for Muslim youths runs as high as 40 percent in neighborhoods like Schaerbeek.After graduating high school with good grades, especially in math and physics, Najim Laachraoui enrolled at the Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles. There, he was more of a minority, since relatively few Muslims make it to university, said Mr. Derbaix, his former religion teacher.He left after just a year. He then enrolled in another school, according to his former teacher, but dropped out of that as well.To feel apart, even isolated, is not uncommon for a Muslim from Schaerbeek, the third-poorest commune in Belgium and one with a long history of racism.More than Molenbeek, where many of the Paris and Brussels attackers lived, Schaerbeek is a mixed community with a sizable number of native Caucasian Belgians as well as Muslims from Turkey and Morocco.Yet despite its heterogeneity, the groups still live in somewhat segregated communities.Mustapha Chairi, a Schaerbeek native and now the head of the Collective Against Islamophobia in Belgium, remembers how when he was a boy, the mayor, Roger Nols, made no bones about his loathing for immigrants from North Africa.In at least one election year, 1986, he donned ethnic Moroccan clothes, mounted a camel and rode to the central square to declare, \u201cIn 20 years all of Schaerbeek will look like this unless you vote for me,\u201d Mr. Chairi recalled.He stayed in office for 19 years.As a Moroccan son from a working-class family, Mr. Chairi said, \u201cI never went to the street with the grand houses\u201d of the rich, nor even to the streets occupied by less wealthy Caucasian Belgians.This striated social context was where Mr. Laachraoui grew up, deeply conscious of two worlds, separate yet side by side.In all, he seems to have recruited more than 50 young men \u2014 the numbers have come out in two separate trials, in which he was charged with organizing and financing a recruitment network that funneled jihadists to Syria. He is currently in prison in Belgium after being convicted in the first trial.Some of his followers were young petty criminals whom he encouraged to rob people in order to raise money for their trips to Syria. But others were intelligent young men with prospects.One of them was Najim Laachraoui, according to court documents in one of Mr. Zerkani\u2019s trials.By 2013, his parents moved to a new neighborhood of Schaerbeek where there were few Muslims. Whether one reason they did so was because they worried that the eldest of their five children was growing increasingly radical and they wanted to pull him out of Mr. Zerkani\u2019s orbit is not clear.In any case, it was too late.During the move, Najim disappeared, Mourad Laachraoui, the taekwondo champion, said at his brief news conference, in which he begged reporters to leave his family alone.The family learned of his departure from a phone call. Mourad said he never spoke to his brother again and had not known where he was until after his death.\u201cI could not find him,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I had found him, I would have tried to get him back to reason with him.\u201dMr. Laachraoui returned to Europe from Syria in September using a false passport with the name Soufiane Kayal and traveling with Salah Abdeslam, who is now the only surviving Paris attacker.After Mr. Laachraoui arrived back in Belgium, investigators say, he was at least one of the people involved in making explosives for the suicide vests worn by the Paris attackers. His DNA was found on several of the suicide vests used by the Paris attackers as well as in the house in Schaerbeek, which was used to make the explosives and vests, according to a statement from the Brussels prosecutor\u2019s office.Mr. Abdeslam was captured just days before the Brussels bombings, for which Mr. Laachraoui is also believed to have prepared the explosives, as he shuttled between houses in and around Brussels. He was among the three men picked up by a taxi driver on the morning of the Brussels attacks from a house in Schaerbeek where the police later found more than 30 pounds of explosives.Why death became more important to him than the \u201cfreedom\u201d that he had told his high school teacher he hoped everyone could enjoy is impossible to guess.In one of their last conversations before graduation, Mr. Laachraoui told his teacher that he believed Islam was superior to the Western model.\u201cI said that one day his idealism would be put to the test and that he must pay attention not to set himself on a path of pride and anger,\u201d Mr. Derbaix recalled. \u201cWith his great smile, he said to me, \u2018Don\u2019t worry.\u2019 \u201dLilia Blaise contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "At the World Bank, a Shortage of Concrete (Language)", "Date": "2016-04-14", "News": "Supported byForecast CloudyThe trend is probably not a surprise to anyone with a glancing interaction with international institutions. But the numbers and examples are amusing.The unusual collaboration was hatched in the spring of 2013 when Mr. Pestre and Mr. Moretti, a literary critic by trade, met while working in Berlin.The result is titled \u201cBankspeak,\u201d a play on doublespeak, referring to language that is intentionally ambiguous, meant to obscure or confuse.The most striking discovery, Mr. Pestre said, speaking from his home in Geneva, was the emergence of a language that \u201cdoes not offer specificities, it remains at a more abstract level.\u201dIn the early decades, for example, bank reports consistently referred to specific places, projects, equipment, tools and activities. Past and present tense verbs were common, marking completed activities and allowing for comparisons.In the last 20 years, that kind of nuts-and-bolts language disappears, Mr. Pestre said. Verbs are turned into nouns \u2013 something that linguists have argued converts specific actions taken by named actors into \u201cabstract objects.\u201d (People and countries no longer \u201ccooperate,\u201d for example; there is just \u201ccooperation.\u201d)At the same time, the use of adverbs that refer to a particular time frame (such as \u201cnow,\u201d \u201crecently\u201d or \u201clater\u201d) declined by more than 50 percent. Past tense verbs grew rarer, while jargon and acronyms proliferated.\u201cHere is how the bank\u2019s report described the world in 1958:The Congo\u2019s present transport system is geared mainly to the export trade, and is based on river navigation and on railroads which lead from river ports into regions producing minerals and agricultural commodities. Most of the roads radiate short distances from cities, providing farm-to-market communications. In recent years road traffic has increased rapidly with the growth of the internal market and the improvement of farming methods.And here is the report from a half-century later, in 2008:Countries in the region are emerging as key players on issues of global concern, and the Bank\u2019s role has been to support their efforts by partnering through innovative platforms for an enlightened dialogue and action on the ground, as well as by supporting South\u2013South cooperation.\u201dThe 2012 report does not refer to preventing hunger but rather to \u201cfood security.\u201dPerhaps most intriguing, though, is the series of graphs mapping the specific changes in word usage.As one might expect, some reflect the World Bank\u2019s changing priorities and concerns as well as historical events. For instance, in the late 1960s, when Robert McNamara becomes president and made \u201cthe war on poverty\u201d a central mission, references to \u201cfamilies,\u201d \u201cfarmers,\u201d \u201ceducation\u201d and later, \u201cwomen,\u201d become more noticeable. In the 1980s, when many countries in the developing world are at risk of defaulting on loans, the language of debt becomes omnipresent, and there are frequent references to \u201cexpanding trade,\u201d \u201cexpanding the private sector\u201d and \u201craising competitiveness.\u201dThe word \u201cgovernance\u201d makes its first appearance in 1990, signaling a new preoccupation with ethics, responsibility and rectitude. The language of finance replaces the language of agriculture and industry. In the previous decade, the word \u201cportfolio\u201d is used 10 times as frequently as it was throughout the \u201960s, \u201970s and \u201980s.There are other quirks. In 66 years of reports, the verb \u201cdisagree\u201d never appears (though disagreement is used twice.) The implication, the authors said, is that \u201cthere is only one way to do things\u201d \u2014 no alternative policies are possible. And \u201csuperlatives are de rigueur,\u201d the essay notes. \u201cPeople, behavior and results are \u2018outstanding,\u2019 \u2018significant,\u2019 \u2018relevant,\u2019 \u2018consistent,\u2019 strong,\u2019 \u2018good\u2019 (and \u2018better\u2019).\u201dThe analysis did not necessarily produce conclusions startlingly different from what Mr. Pestre had suspected merely through his regular reading, but the statistical confirmation was comforting. Peculiar usages and clusters of words also prompted him to take a closer look at certain phenomena \u2014 like the decrease in past tense \u2014 that he otherwise might have missed.Mr. Pestre noted that \u201cthe World Bank is not alone in speaking this way.\u201d A similar kind of discourse can be found in most organizations involved in global business, whether the United Nations, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or the World Wildlife Fund, he added.\u201cWe are not saying it was good, and it\u2019s now bad,\u201d Mr. Pestre said of the evolution in the World Bank\u2019s language. \u201cWe are saying that the level of structural change is profound. When that happens, it means: Be aware!\u201dAdvertisement"}

The fallout, combined with the country\u2019s prolonged recession, has eroded Ms. Rousseff\u2019s support so much that she faces impeachment proceedings. Brazil\u2019s Senate is expected to vote next month whether to begin an impeachment trial over allegations of fiscal crimes.Mr. Esteves, a billionaire who built BTG Pactual into a banking powerhouse, is under suspicion of conspiring with a leader of the Senate, Delc\u00eddio do Amaral, to interfere with testimony regarding the kickbacks at Petrobras. He was accused of financing the silence of a key witness and former Petrobras executive. Mr. do Amaral \u2014 who was arrested on Nov. 25, the same day as Mr. Esteves \u2014 was freed after he agreed to a plea deal in which he implicated both Ms. Rousseff, his former political ally, and a former Brazilian president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.In December, Brazil\u2019s highest court ordered that Mr. Esteves be released from jail but placed under house arrest and barred from taking any management roles.On Monday, Justice Teori Zavascki lifted the orders that had placed Mr. Esteves under house arrest and barred from work. The lifting of multiple injunctions restricting his movement and activity is preliminary and requires upholding by other high court justices, but it allows Mr. Esteves to return to work immediately, his lawyer, Antonio Carlos de Almeida Castro, said in the telephone interview Tuesday.BTG Pactual declined a request for comment. Its shares rose by over 6 percent by early afternoon on Tuesday on the S\u00e3o Paulo bourse after reports of Justice Zavascki\u2019s decision.The broader investigation brought on by Brazil\u2019s attorney general that accuses Mr. Esteves of obstruction of justice is still underway, but Mr. Almeida Castro said that he continued to work on clearing his client\u2019s name of all charges and that Monday\u2019s decision gave him hope that could happen.\u201cYesterday\u2019s decision is recognition that Andr\u00e9 did not have anything to do with this case, what we have always argued,\u201d Mr. Almeida Castro said. In making that argument, he cited testimony by Mr. do Amaral, who later said that he had lied about Mr. Esteves\u2019s role, though his credibility has come under question.As to what comes next for Mr. Esteves, who faces other accusations, his lawyer declined to comment. He said that as a result of Monday\u2019s ruling, he could return to BTG Pactual if he wanted to, but that was a decision for him and the bank\u2019s current management to make.In December, after his arrest, and in a move to protect the bank, Mr. Esteves ceded control in a share swap with a group of seven partners. Around that time, Marcelo Kalim and Roberto Sallouti were made co-chief executives.A spokeswoman at the Supreme Federal Tribunal, Brazil\u2019s highest court, declined to comment on Tuesday, saying that the ruling was under seal.An article on Wednesday about the freeing from jail of Andr\u00e9 Esteves, former chief of BTG Pactual, misstated his history with the bank in some copies. As chief executive, he built the bank into a giant, but he did not found it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Make Home Renovations Pay Off", "Date": "2016-04-07", "News": "Supported byYour Money AdviserDespite recent snowy and chilly weather in some parts of the country, the calendar says it\u2019s spring \u2014 and many homeowners are contemplating upgrades to their houses and yards. This year, remodeling activity is expected to accelerate at a brisk pace.As home values have recovered from the housing crash, real estate sales have returned to more normal levels, and that drives remodeling, too, said Abbe Will, a research analyst in the Remodeling Futures program at the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University. \u201cThe remodeling market tends to follow the housing market,\u201d she said.Sellers spend on renovation projects to help make their homes more attractive to potential buyers, and buyers also spend on upgrades after they purchase a home, Ms. Will said, to make the house better fit their needs.About 36 million people, or more than a quarter of homeowners in the United States, are expected to make upgrades to their property in the coming year, according to a survey out this week from Bankrate. (The telephone survey of 1,000 adults was conducted in March by Princeton Survey Research Associates. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 4 percentage points.)The most popular options, the survey found, are fixes to a home\u2019s exterior or yard renovations, including driveways, decks, patios, landscaping or fencing, followed by updates like new flooring and windows, roofing or siding.Homeowners may find, however, that getting financing for renovations still isn\u2019t quite as easy as it was before the housing downturn, when many people borrowed against their home equity \u2014 the difference between their home\u2019s value and their mortgage. While many housing markets have recovered, some still haven\u2019t made up for the loss of home equity that occurred in the housing debacle.Typically, banks look for equity of at least 20 percent when considering home equity loans or lines of credit to fund renovations, said Mike Cetera, personal loans and credit analyst for Bankrate. \u201cBanks are just starting to loosen the purse strings,\u201d he said.Brendan Coughlin, head of consumer lending at Citizens Bank, said the bank has seen applications for home equity lines of credit increase by about 30 percent a year over the last two years. In part, the increase is because of refinancings of credit lines that were taken out 10 years ago and are now resetting to higher monthly payments. (Lines of credit typically require interest-only payments for 10 years, and then shift to interest plus principal payments for another 10 to 20 years.)But roughly half of the demand is from new borrowers who are feeling more confident about taking on debt and are seeking to use the equity in their homes for projects like significant home remodeling, he said. Unlike before the economic downturn, when homeowners used their home equity to finance vacations and luxury items, today\u2019s borrowers are not using their homes as all-purpose piggy banks, he said. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a huge trend toward responsible borrowing,\u201d he said.If you qualify, a home-equity loan or line of credit is generally the most affordable financing option. Interest rates will usually be lower since the loan is secured with your home as the collateral.Borrowers generally need strong credit to get the best rates. Fifth Third Bank, for instance, is promoting introductory \u201cteaser\u201d rates as low as 1.99 percent on home equity lines of credit for borrowers with credit scores of 750 or higher.If you don\u2019t qualify, there are more options available now for personal loans \u2014 unsecured loans made for a variety of purposes. Rates may be higher, since the loans are unsecured. But for borrowers with excellent credit, online lenders like LightStream, an arm of SunTrust Bank, are offering personal loans for home remodeling with rates as low as 3.99 percent. (Often, such lenders offer the lowest rates only if the borrowers agree to have payments automatically deducted from their bank account.)With a personal loan, if you run into trouble \u2014 say, losing your job \u2014 and can\u2019t pay back the loan, you\u2019ll hurt your credit rating and you may be hounded by debt collectors, but you won\u2019t lose your home, Mr. Cetera noted.He cautioned, however, that most personal loans are for shorter periods of time, typically three years. So borrowers need to consider how quickly they can pay back the debt.If you have good credit and the amount needed for a renovation is relatively small, he said, a zero-interest credit card may be an option. Just be sure you can repay the debt before the introductory zero-percent period expires, which is often within 12 to 18 months, or you\u2019ll be hit with double-digit interest rates.Or you could just pay for the project out of savings. Research last year by Piper Jaffray on home improvement found that 70 percent or more of homeowners planned to pay for major remodeling at least partly with cash.Here are some questions and answers about home renovations:After the housing crash, many skilled construction workers left the residential construction industry, and the labor pool for remodeling work probably has been affected, too, Ms. Will said. Homeowners, she said, should expect that renovation projects will take longer to schedule and complete than they did before the housing downturn.The interest paid on loans secured by your main home, like a mortgage or a home-equity loan, is usually tax deductible. Generally, interest on personal loans and other types of unsecured debt, like credit card debt, can\u2019t be deducted on your income tax return.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "German Economy, Once Europe\u2019s Leader, Now Looks Like Laggard", "Date": "2016-04-05", "News": "Supported byFRANKFURT \u2014 China is cutting back on mining machinery as its economy slips. The United Arab Emirates and other Middle Eastern countries are no longer awash in oil money, putting luxury car brands at risk. Russia, still facing Western sanctions, cannot buy as much high-tech energy equipment.The downshift in the emerging markets is leaving Germany vulnerable \u2014 and, by extension, Europe.As many businesses in the region struggled just to tread water in recent years, German companies prospered by selling the goods and technology that emerging countries needed to become more modern economies. As they did, Germany\u2019s strength served as a counterweight to the economic malaise, financial turmoil and Greek debt drama that dragged down many European countries.Now, Germany, which accounts for the largest share of the European economy, is looking like the laggard. Compared with the economies of other countries in the region, Germany\u2019s has been more deeply tethered to emerging markets. And the political climate is only adding to the uncertainty, as Germany deals with a wave of migrants and a potential exit of Britain from the European Union.Against that backdrop, the country\u2019s export engine is sputtering, while business confidence is eroding.During the good times, the German manufacturer Eickhoff Bergbautechnik sold 20 machines a year as China dug ever more coal mines to feed its energy-hungry factories. The machines, shearer loaders that use giant spinning claws to scrape coal or potash from underground seams, sell for up to 4 million euros, or about $4.6 million apiece.Last year, the company sold just eight. With profit dropping, Eickhoff laid off about 10 percent of its local work force of 300.\u201cWe are going from an unbelievable boom to a down phase,\u201d said Karl-Heinz Rieser, the managing director of Eickhoff.Less torrid sales at Eickhoff and hundreds of other midsize German exporters translate into slower overall economic growth. Suppliers of mining equipment generated exports of \u20ac6.2 billion in 2012, according to the German Engineering Federation, an industry group. Last year, those exports fell to \u20ac3.5 billion, a trend that has played out in a number of industries.The German export machine has been fueled by the growth of emerging markets. As developing countries like China now pull back, it is leaving Germany more vulnerable, and by extension Europe.As exports have slipped, the mood in Germany has turned glum.Pessimists outnumbered optimists in February for the first time since late 2014, according to the survey of business managers by the Ifo Institute in Munich, which is considered a reliable predictor of the growth. Although there was a small uptick in March, manufacturers remain wary. If confidence remains weak, they are likely to cut back plans to invest in new equipment or hire people, prompting growth to slow.A weaker German economy would have political consequences for Europe.As much as other Europeans like to bash the Germans, it is doubtful that the eurozone could have survived its recent debt crisis without Germany\u2019s checkbook. Germany contributes more than a quarter of the financing for the European Stability Mechanism, the new bailout fund used to prevent the total collapse of countries like Greece.For producers around the eurozone, German shoppers also filled the void left by struggling Spaniards, Italians and Portuguese. When auto sales entered a deep slump beginning in 2009, Germans bought not only Volkswagens and Mercedeses but also Italian Fiats and French Renaults.\u201cIt\u2019s the biggest market in Europe,\u201d Thierry Koskas, the executive vice president of sales at Renault, said in an interview. \u201cDue to the weight of this market, it\u2019s big volume for us and it\u2019s important.\u201dThe changing economic picture also threatens to undercut the influence of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.The country\u2019s financial strength has made it the dominant political power. Though protesters in Greece were known to burn effigies of Ms. Merkel over her harsh austerity policies, she helped impose a measure of discipline among bickering eurozone leaders.But there has been a tonal shift in recent months.Austria and other countries have defied Ms. Merkel\u2019s wishes on how to handle the influx of refugees from Syria. While she wanted to preserve Europe\u2019s openness, her counterparts instituted border controls.\u201cGermany\u2019s political standing in Europe has declined in the last number of quarters from a position of undisputed hegemony just to one where they are the most important country,\u201d said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. \u201cIt has been more difficult for Berlin to herd the cats.\u201dDuring the last decade, Germany has been something of a shopping mall for developing countries. If a country was mechanizing its farms, German companies like Claas made the tractors and grain harvesters. If a country needed a factory to produce liquid oxygen or one to bottle beer, German companies like Linde or Krones could design, equip and build the whole plant.Soaring demand from China, as well as places like Russia, Brazil and Kazakhstan, made Germany nearly impervious to the woes of its neighbors. While more than one-fifth of the work force in Spain is jobless, German unemployment has fallen to only 4.3 percent, lower than that of the United States. When Eickhoff, the mining company, had to lay off workers, many of them found jobs at sister companies.China has been particularly good to German automakers, and therefore to the whole country. Autos are Germany\u2019s biggest export and one of the most important sources of jobs. China last year became the biggest market for the German sports car maker Porsche, surpassing the United States for the first time.But there are signs of trouble. Growth in the Chinese auto market is expected to be around 4 percent this year, half what it was last year. \u201cWe will continue to grow,\u201d Detlev von Platen, the head of sales for Porsche, said in an interview. \u201cBut not as quickly as before.\u201dThe Middle East is another boom market turned troubled. Civil war in Syria and plunging oil prices have hurt the confidence and buying power of countries like Kuwait.German exports to oil-producing countries fell 7 percent last year. The decline hurt sales of companies like Voith, based in Heidenheim in southern Germany, which produces motors used to pump large quantities of oil in refineries or drilling sites. \u201cCustomers in these industries are postponing or stopping investments,\u201d said Dirk B\u00f6ckenhoff, a spokesman for Voith.No matter where German executives look, they struggle to identify any region that is booming the way that China did until recently.Growth in the United States is looking mixed. Brazil is in the midst of a severe recession. And Russia has suffered from low commodity prices and political tension with the West.Iran poses an opportunity, since sanctions have been lifted and the country has been opening up. German companies are rushing to exploit the new market. The engineering and electronics giant Siemens last month signed an agreement to deliver electricity-generating equipment to Mapna, an Iranian power and transportation conglomerate.But Iran, with an economy smaller than Turkey\u2019s, is not big enough to support German growth. And German companies will probably have to adapt to a growth rate that is closer to the mediocre eurozone average of about 1 percent \u2014 making it a member of the pack rather than the leader.Mr. Rieser, the maker of coal mining equipment, says his company is reacting to the slowdown by introducing machines for different segments of the market. He does not expect to have to cut any more jobs.But he added, \u201cThere are a lot of firms that are smaller than us that have a lot more trouble.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Swiss Widen Inquiry Into Malaysian Fund to Include 2 Emirati Officials", "Date": "2016-04-12", "News": "Supported byGENEVA \u2014 The Swiss authorities said on Tuesday that they had started a criminal investigation into two officials in charge of a sovereign wealth fund in Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates, as part of an inquiry into the financial transactions of the troubled Malaysian state investment fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad.The attorney general\u2019s office in Switzerland said in a statement that it had widened its corruption investigation into the Malaysian fund, also known as 1MDB, to include the two Emirati officials over an apparent misappropriation of payments. The officials were being investigated for fraud, criminal mismanagement, money laundering, bribery and forgery, the attorney general\u2019s office said. The statement left them unnamed, following normal practice for such investigations.The disclosure adds another twist to a scandal that has rocked the government of the Malaysian prime minister, Najib Razak, who is also the country\u2019s finance minister and the chairman of 1MDB\u2019s advisory board, and that has bruised relations between Malaysia and Switzerland.The Swiss attorney general\u2019s office said it was looking into payments related to a guarantee that Abu Dhabi had provided for a series of bonds issued by 1MDB-related companies to finance electric power plants. The office added that it had asked Luxembourg and Singapore to assist its inquiries.The statement said that the Swiss authorities had information \u201callowing them to suspect that the amounts paid in connection with this guarantee were not returned to the Abu Dhabi sovereign fund that supported the commercial risk.\u201d\u201cTo the contrary, these funds would have benefited others,\u201d including two officials in charge of the unnamed Abu Dhabi fund, a film industry company and a \u201cformer 1MDB body\u201d already under investigation by Swiss authorities, the attorney general\u2019s office said.The announcement is the latest in a flurry of allegations swirling around the affairs of debt-burdened 1MDB, which are under scrutiny by the United States Justice Department and the authorities in Hong Kong, Luxembourg and Singapore.Singapore\u2019s attorney general confirmed on Tuesday that it had received Switzerland\u2019s request and would \u201crender all possible assistance\u201d expeditiously.Switzerland started criminal proceedings against two former executives of 1MDB and froze assets worth tens of millions of dollars in August. It said later that it had \u201cserious indications\u201d that about $4 billion had been misappropriated from 1MDB, with a small part of that amount ending up in Swiss bank accounts.The investigation added to the pressure Mr. Najib faces over deposits in his personal bank accounts totaling nearly $700 million, money that critics and published accounts have linked to 1MDB, focusing attention on the fund\u2019s management and finances.Attorney General Mohamed Apandi Ali of Malaysia cleared Mr. Najib in January of any wrongdoing, describing the payments as a gift from the Saudi royal family and reporting that most of it had been returned. The attorney general said he was closing investigations into the matter, and Mr. Najib said the allegations had been \u201ccomprehensively put to rest.\u201dA report on 1MDB released by the Malaysian Parliament\u2019s public accounts committee last week said billions of dollars had disappeared from 1MDB, calling for an investigation of its senior management. The report did not mention Mr. Najib but recommended dismantling 1MDB\u2019s advisory board, which he leads.Mr. Najib told Parliament that the committee had \u201cidentified weaknesses\u201d in 1MDB\u2019s management and capital structure and the government, after studying the report, would take action if it found any wrongdoing.The parliamentary committee reported transfers totaling $3.5 billion from 1MDB to Aabar Investments PJS Ltd., registered in the British Virgin Islands, and said that it had been unable to identify what subsequently happened to those transfers.Uncertainty over the fate of the missing funds deepened on Monday, when an Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund, International Petroleum Investment Co., and its subsidiary Aabar Investments PJS said that the British Virgin Islands company was not part of their group.Advertisement"}

But \u2018Batman v Superman\u2019 Is the Problem.", "Date": "2016-04-12", "News": "Supported byWhen it was over, I, too, was overcome with the urge to brood, mope and cultivate stubble I could ponderously stroke while asking, \u201cWhat\u2019s the most ridiculous thing about this movie?\u201dWhere \u201cBatman v Superman\u201d weighs a desperate ton, \u201cDeadpool\u201d mocks that weight. Its opening credits announce, for instance, that it was directed by \u201can Overpaid Tool,\u201d which the finished product does little to dispute. In Ryan Reynolds, it has a leading man playing a salty mercenary whose face, body and vanity are so badly disfigured that his costume disguises both who and what he thinks he is: ugly. It\u2019s a get-up that lands somewhere between Spider-Man and the Gimp\u2019s S-and-M outfit in \u201cPulp Fiction.\u201d But where brooding over misfortune typifies this world, Deadpool prattles through action sequences. He prances.Ben Affleck\u2019s Bruce Wayne tinkers over state-of-the-art gadgetry with his manservant Alfred (Jeremy Irons), while Deadpool and his roommate \u2014 a blind black woman (Leslie Uggams) \u2014 trade insults and commiserate over the shoddiness of Ikea furniture. This is to say that \u201cDeadpool\u201d is the most insolent example of where the comic-book movie has been headed: anti-serious, acutely aware of its genre\u2019s clich\u00e9s, arguably satirical, increasingly repulsed by self-consecration and committed to fun.\u201cBatman v Superman\u201d is the sort of movie \u201cDeadpool\u201d is pantsing. So is a series like the \u201cX-Men,\u201d of which \u201cDeadpool\u201d is a spiked offshoot. A great deal of \u201cBatman\u201d revolves around the moral propriety of a great, big public statue of Superman that wouldn\u2019t be out of place on the cover of an Ayn Rand novel. You want to commend this movie\u2019s stabs at thoughtfulness. But it\u2019s stabbing with a spork. At some point you have to laugh.To sit through this \u2014 and there\u2019s a lot to sit through (Senate hearings, newsroom slapstick, Scoot McNairy doing Lieutenant Dan from \u201cForrest Gump\u201d) \u2014 is to see both rage and piety hit a wall. \u201cBatman v Superman\u201d features the latest in a handful of live-action incarnations of Batman since 1989 and Superman since 1978. Putting Gotham City across the river from Metropolis just combines two sites of \u201cbeen there done that.\u201d Insisting on the holiness of it all lands in the tiny crack between \u201cduh\u201d and \u201cyou just told me this.\u201dThe director is Zack Snyder, the maker of \u201c300,\u201d \u201cWatchmen,\u201d \u201cSucker Punch,\u201d and \u201cMan of Steel.\u201d Piety is the only mode he\u2019s got. It\u2019s the only mode most of these comic-book movies have had: suffering, oppression, misunderstanding, apocalypse. For a decade and a half, from the first wave of \u201cX-Men\u201d movies to Christopher Nolan\u2019s \u201cDark Knight\u201d trilogy, terroristic disaster is now the ultimate signifier of seriousness.We\u2019ve seen the movies attempt to refract the world as the great comic books do, but often without their un-self-conscious power and with a sense of burden. The \u201cAvengers\u201d series, for instance, has to top not only its spinoffs but also itself.Directors as different as Jon Favreau (the first two \u201cIron Man\u201d movies), Shane Black (the last one) and Kenneth Branagh (\u201cThor\u201d) have tried to install levity and classicism. The \u201cAvengers\u201d movies, including spinoffs built around Captain America, dramatize the country\u2019s civil-liberty and national-security skirmishes. They also bury those political fights to wage a war whose visual language evokes real-world destruction in a way that cheapens the extant impact of its \u201csource material.\u201dThe distance between \u201cGuardians\u201d and the average Marvel movie captured the spirit of life and lawlessness. It was more concerned with pop moviemaking than with burnishing the larger Marvel brand, per se. (At the end of the day, Marvel still used the movie to whet appetites for more \u201cAvengers\u201d-adjacency. But it maintained the illusion of independence.)But nothing is laughing harder or louder or more obnoxiously at the state of the superhero movie than \u201cDeadpool.\u201d It is nothingness. It believes in violence, but that\u2019s about all it believes in: slashing and stabbing and shooting and \u2014 with Mr. Reynolds splashing figurative vinegar in the title role \u2014 sarcasm. And the nihilism is not without its charms.These self-conscious comedies \u2014 \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy,\u201d \u201cAnt-Man,\u201d \u201cDeadpool\u201d \u2014 seem as if they\u2019ve sprung from the comic-book film\u2019s need to self-preserve, self-regenerate and self-mythologize, while forgoing weirdness and ingenuity and glee.They are almost a fun-house mirror of the presidential election. These insurgent movies rail against establishment pictures, inasmuch as a major studio movie can be insurgent. (And by \u201cDeadpool\u201d standards, the money isn\u2019t all that: \u201cDeadpool\u201d cost a reported $58 million to make, versus $250 million for \u201cBatman v Superman\u201d and the most recent \u201cAvengers\u201d movie.) In both politics and at the megaplex, disgust with the same old, same old has produced an appetite for change.Deadpool spends his movie being nagged into shedding his amorality by joining the dysfunctional but unimpeachably moral X-Men, which, having inspired at least two generations of films, counts as an establishment. Their primary representative here is the steel-skinned (and generally underused) Russian giant Colossus, whose stern earnestness Deadpool joyously mocks. In the manner of a certain billionaire Republican candidate, Deadpool thinks those guys are losers.\u201cBatman v Superman\u201d has grossed well more than a half-billion dollars worldwide, but even fans are grousing. We\u2019re now at a point where these movies are happening to us. Studios make, we go. Our relationship is almost reflexive, like breathing \u2014 or belching.The movie insurgency looked to be a Marvel-only outbreak. But DC Comics, Batman and Superman\u2019s home, is scheduled to release its own allergic reaction later this year with \u201cThe Suicide Squad,\u201d which stars Will Smith leading a bunch of jailbird supervillains and may as well be called \u201cDawn of Injustice.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The problem goes beyond the popularity of Senator Bernie Sanders, who can\u2019t seem to go five minutes without labeling big banks Enemy No. 1.\u201cThe consensus, absolutely, is that the choices couldn\u2019t be worse,\u201d said William D.

The executive said that in election-year conversations with colleagues, around the water cooler or over cocktails, there usually arises a clear favorite. In 2012, that favorite was Mitt Romney by a mile. This year: \u201cIt\u2019s as mixed and confused as I\u2019ve ever seen it.\u201dAll of the Wall Street employees I interviewed took issue with Mr. Sanders\u2019s view of their industry, but they also confirmed his view that, yes, people who work in the financial sector tend to like Mrs. Clinton.\u201cBernie has forced Hillary to run a certain way that she probably would prefer not to, and it\u2019s a race to the bottom. It\u2019s horrible,\u201d said another senior Wall Street executive, a political independent who plans to vote for Mrs. Clinton in the fall. \u201cThe thing you continually hear is, there\u2019s no way Trump can be president, and there\u2019s no way Sanders can be president.\u201dSince the 2008 economic recession, the financial sector has attracted plenty of righteous scorn. Mr. Sanders has harnessed that disgust and resentment to great effect. The Occupy Wall Street movement has played a large role in making Mr. Sanders\u2019s message more broadly acceptable. Marina Sitrin, one of the early organizers of the movement, said it had \u201cnormalized looking at the roots of the problem rather seeing them as individual.\u201dStill, Democrats who work in finance have been frustrated by Mr. Sanders\u2019s broad anti-Wall Street rhetoric. The people I spoke to noted that the \u201cWall Street\u201d Mr. Sanders rails against isn\u2019t just made up of plutocratic hedge-fund types and predatory lenders, but money managers trying to help middle-class workers retire comfortably, and bankers trying to help small-business owners get a loan.Whatever happens today in New York, it does seem as though voters\u2019 trust in large institutions on Wall Street \u2014 along with the news media, Congress and political parties writ large \u2014 has eroded to the point of invisibility.In a recent fund-raising email, Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign achieved a trifecta, criticizing all three industries in the same sentence.\u201cRight now, in lower Manhattan, the Wall Street bankers, corporate media types, and Democratic party establishment figures are hoping you\u2019ll sit this fight out,\u201d the email read.Still, at the very least, Wall Street executives and Mr. Sanders\u2019s supporters can agree on one thing: their utter disgust with the idea of a Trump presidency.Advertisement"}

He\u2019s not sure how he\u2019ll juggle cooking on two continents, but he expects to be dug in at Le Coucou at least through the first cycle of reviews.Eventually, he said wryly, \u201cI\u2019ll get a lot of frequent flier miles, I guess.\u201dIn fact, it was the process of inquiry (along with a desire to meet Frenchwomen, one of whom, the chef Marie-Aude Rose, he wound up marrying) that lured him there to begin with.\u201cFrance was a place \u2014 is a place \u2014 with a tradition of thinking, and in this case a history of thinking about food,\u201d he said. \u201cIt sounds kind of weird, but I\u2019m interested in life.\u201dHe arrived in Paris in the late 1990s after plunging into philosophy and Greek literature at St. John\u2019s College in New Mexico, and he got into cooking (after a failed attempt to join the French Foreign Legion) \u201cthe way I approach a lot of this stuff, which is to ask a question,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is a French restaurant? What is a restaurant? I spend too much time thinking about stuff like that. The antidote to that was the doing.\u201dSo what is a cerebral purist like him doing with Mr. Starr, a guy who oversees (at press time) 34 restaurants? The auteur in Mr. Rose finds it appealing, and reassuring, that Le Coucou will be supported by a well-oiled engine of commerce.Mr. Starr, for his part, takes issue with those who characterize him as resolutely middlebrow. \u201cI dispute that,\u201d he said in the kitchen with Mr. Rose. \u201cI was a populist, and I\u2019m a populist now in order to make money and survive.\u201d\u201cI will never make a lot of money here, in this restaurant,\u201d Mr. Starr said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the point. My heart is in these types of restaurants, but you\u2019ve got to pay for the things.\u201d\u201cI brought a pig\u2019s bladder in my bag,\u201d Mr. Rose recalled.\u201cHow did you get that through customs?\u201d Mr. Starr asked.\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything,\u201d Mr. Rose said, deadpan.If that seems a deeply French gesture, Mr. Rose\u2019s response is apt to be \u201cmais oui.\u201d His success in Paris is attributable not only to his skill in the kitchen, but also to his complete immersion in Frenchness.His cooking betrays little interest in giving the classics a 21st-century tuneup; he says he has never cooked a cheeseburger or pasta, outside of meals he may whip up for his two children, ages 2 and 4.If anything, his dishes stand as reverent personal tributes to the tradition that produced them.Mr. Rose\u2019s approach to hospitality stood out. \u201cSo here comes Daniel with his enthusiasm, natural warmth and a genuine passion for interacting with diners,\u201d Ms. Tramuta said. \u201cIn the first version of Spring, he was cooking entirely alone and had close contact to each and every diner, delivering the dishes to the tables in many instances. Dining in his restaurants feels very much what I would imagine it would be like to dine in his home, and that\u2019s extremely rare.\u201dHis obsession? Ingredients. \u201cThat moment of tasting veal that really tastes like veal is a very powerful thing,\u201d he said.Nearly all chefs these days rhapsodize about the quality of their carrots, but Mr. Rose is known for applying a fanatical focus to finding the best chicken, the best oyster, the most exquisite onion. \u201cNo matter how much it costs,\u201d Mr. Marchand said, \u201che\u2019s really crazy about the quality of the products.\u201dHis madness was on display on a recent Tuesday afternoon as he huddled around the stove with members of his crew at Le Coucou to test the ingredients he had hunted down.\u201cWe put it in a hot pan and cook it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s how we learn about it.\u201d From the sound in the pan, he said, he could divine the quality of certain ingredients \u2014 \u201cnot that I have X-Men powers or something.\u201dIn the oven simmered a rich Alsatian-style stew called a baeckeoffe, layered with sliced potatoes and the melting fat of short ribs, lamb shoulder and pork cheeks.But most of his work this day was radically simple. He poached a chicken. He watched as sea bream was saut\u00e9ed in a pan. He breathed in the scent of oysters.Mr. Rose is particularly serious about chicken. He had at least a dozen varieties to test over the course of a few days. Most disappointed him.He sliced off a knob of meat and nibbled on it. His eyes revealed a man lost in thought. \u201cSame problem,\u201d he said. \u201cBitter. Is that just my tongue or is that for real? I got that funky bitterness again!\u201dTim Lu, Le Coucou\u2019s executive sous-chef, tried it, too. \u201cOh, yeah,\u201d he said.An almost hidden wave of disgust and frustration passed over Mr. Rose\u2019s face. \u201cNow I\u2019m getting kind of grumpy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t taste very good at all. You know where the best chicken we\u2019ve had was from? Chinatown.\u201dMr. Rose\u2019s cooking depends on the delicious integrity of these core ingredients; he is averse to frills and adornments that may interfere with one\u2019s communion with the essence of hen or oyster.And what did he not want? He didn\u2019t need to think about that answer. \u201cMore than it needs,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article, using information from a publicist, misstated the sexes of Daniel Rose\u2019s two children. They are a boy and a girl, not two girls.cookingcookingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Where Berkowitz Did Time and Cagney Spent Time", "Date": "2016-04-15", "News": "Supported byArts | WestchesterThere\u2019s something magical about Sing Sing, the maximum-security prison that sprawls over 75 acres on a bank of the Hudson River where it widens north of the Tappan Zee Bridge \u2014 if the word magical can be used to describe a place that in the late 19th century pioneered the use of the electric chair and that today houses about 1,600 inmates, many of them convicted of rape or murder.As wonderful as all of that makes Sing Sing appear, at least to those without a permanent address there, it may still be surprising that the community that houses it, the Village of Ossining, population 25,600, treats it with pride. It is, after all, still a prison.The village manager, Abraham Zambrano, has an explanation: \u201cIt has kind of put Ossining on the map.\u201dTentative plans call for the opening of an arrival center in the village, where visitors would board a \u201cprison bus\u201d to be taken to the museum, which would be in a former powerhouse building at the prison. Officials say the museum could play a crucial role in shaping a vision for redeveloping the village\u2019s Market Square area.Talk of a Sing Sing museum stretches back at least 20 years. \u201cIt\u2019s now in a different place where it could actually get built,\u201d said Nancy Gold, the marketing consultant for Historic Hudson River Towns.Victoria Gearity, the village\u2019s mayor, is one of the museum\u2019s biggest boosters. \u201cThere are a lot of great opportunities for our downtown economy to take advantage of the hundreds of thousands of visitors we expect,\u201d she said.Lord Cultural Resources will develop plans for visitor experience at the museum and for collecting items to be exhibited. The village has had a head start on acquisitions, thanks to the Joseph Caputo Community Center, which displays replicas of prison cells and of the electric chair, \u201cOld Sparky.\u201d\u201cThe question\u2019s going to be, \u2018How do we fund the construction and the actual operation?\u2019\u201d said Jerry Faiella, the executive director of Historic Hudson River Towns. A board of directors is to be formed to oversee museum operations, which would be sustained through admission fees, memberships and annual giving, among other revenue sources.Initial financing to move the project forward came from a $250,000 grant from Empire State Development, New York\u2019s chief economic development agency.Just over $1 million is already available from the state to stabilize and preserve the powerhouse building and the 1825 cellblock, which remains standing but has no roof and was damaged in a fire in the 1980s.Gail Lord, co-founder and president of the Lord group, said the museum could help navigate the nation\u2019s current conversation on criminal justice.Part of the work now underway is determining just how much more money is needed before construction could begin.In its early days, Sing Sing was known as the House of Fear for its severe punishment and harsh discipline. From 1888 to 1963, when Eddie Mays became the last person to be put to death by the state, more than 600 inmates were executed there.That dark past was counterbalanced by periods of penal enlightenment, including the tenure of Warden Lewis E. Lawes, who saw rehabilitation as his first priority. Lawes had movie stars and sports teams visit Sing Sing, and his memoirs were made into the 1932 movie \u201c20,000 Years in Sing Sing.\u201dWarner Bros. built a gymnasium at the prison in the early 1930s to show gratitude for Sing Sing\u2019s role in so many films, Mr. Glass said.Cagney encountered the prison in \u201cAngels With Dirty Faces\u201d (1938), as Mr. De Niro did in \u201cAnalyze That\u201d (2002). Audrey Hepburn\u2019s character Holly Golightly visits the mobster Sally Tomato at Sing Sing in a scene in \u201cBreakfast at Tiffany\u2019s.\u201dIt would take a year to design the museum and then 18 months to build it. And there still is that pesky issue of getting all the money necessary to go forward.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Syrian Parliamentary Elections Highlight Divisions and Uncertainty", "Date": "2016-04-13", "News": "Supported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 Syria\u2019s president and first lady cast their ballots on Wednesday in front of clapping crowds, as state television captured the moment and set it to a dramatic soundtrack. Across Damascus, government employees were delivered to the polls aboard packed buses. The electricity even stayed on for most of the day in the capital, a rarity in these days of civil war.But beyond the official pomp, Wednesday\u2019s elections for the Syrian People\u2019s Assembly \u2014 a largely powerless parliamentary body in a country where nearly every decision rests with President Bashar al-Assad \u2014 served mainly to highlight the country\u2019s deep divisions and uncertainty.The elections, held on the first day of a new round of diplomatic talks in Geneva, contradict a timetable for political transition agreed on by global and regional powers, including the United States and Russia, Mr. Assad\u2019s most powerful ally.\u201cThese elections aren\u2019t real,\u201d Salem al-Meslet, a spokesman for the High Negotiations Committee representing Syrian opposition groups, said in a statement in Geneva. \u201cIn real elections, the voice of the people can be heard.\u201dIn Hama Province, where government and allied airstrikes have increased in the past week, an air-to-ground missile killed Dr. Hassan al-Araj, one of the few doctors still working in rebel-held territory, according to rescue workers and colleagues. It struck his car near a hospital that had been set up inside a cave to protect it from bombardment.In several mainly Kurdish areas along the Turkish border in northern Syria where residents have declared self-rule, the local authorities announced that they would not participate in elections.In government-held areas, where schools were closed and state employees were warned that they must show up to vote, some said they had cast ballots largely out of fear that they would otherwise be punished.In Hama, one voter said he had spent 49 days in prison because his name had been confused with that of someone suspected of antigovernment activity. He added that he was voting for the government\u2019s preferred candidates because he was afraid that if he did not, he would be thrown back in prison.The few tolerated opposition parties that often take part in elections that others dismiss as political theater boycotted the elections, including some parties that had sanctioned the 2014 vote that endorsed Mr. Assad\u2019s rule and was widely disputed as illegitimate.Those boycotting Wednesday\u2019s ballot included several parties that Russia has recognized as legitimate opposition groups, such as the party of the former finance minister, Kadri Jamil.Polling places in Damascus did not appear to be particularly busy, even though the government had taken extra measures to increase turnout.At the border post where people cross from Lebanon into Syria, ballot boxes were provided, and the authorities appeared to be requiring Syrians to cast ballots before entering or leaving the country.And for the first time, military members were allowed to vote in parliamentary elections, something that had been long banned by Mr. Assad and his father to avoid political involvement by army officers and potential coups.Members of the military were allowed to vote anywhere in the country, while civilians had to vote in their hometowns. The government made an exception for voters from insurgent-held areas, setting up polling places in Damascus. Turnout appeared low there, too.Abu Fadi, a pro-government fighter serving in the desert gas fields west of Palmyra, said in a text message that a polling place there, mostly for soldiers, had closed three hours early. The area was under threat from Islamic State militants nearby, he said, using only his nickname for fear of reprisal for talking to a journalist without permission.It was unclear whether the turnout was dampened more by the continuing fighting or by the large numbers of people who have fled the country, or whether there was simply less enthusiasm, even among Assad loyalists. Some people may have been more comfortable staying home and choosing not to vote.Late in the day, it was announced that voting could continue until midnight to accommodate what state news media called large numbers of voters.On Wednesday afternoon in Damascus, two large trucks could be seen in Kafr Souseh square, where many security agencies have their headquarters. They were carrying sewage workers to vote en masse.\u201cI vote to say that the government is still strong and runs the country, not because I like one of the candidates,\u201d said Ammar, 30, an employee of a state-run company who admitted that he had voted three times. \u201cI love President Bashar al-Assad only and will vote to protect the Syrian state.\u201dReporting was contributed by an employee of The New York Times from Damascus, Maher Samaan from Paris, and Hwaida Saad from Masnaa, Lebanon.Advertisement"}

When formerly enslaved men got the right to vote in 1870, women demanding their own suffrage were told to wait; their turn would come. It took a half-century, and a heroic struggle, before they achieved the vote in 1920.The updated $10 bill, scheduled to enter circulation in 2020, was supposed to celebrate the centennial of that achievement. Now it will be more like a footnote. That is more than a broken promise; it\u2019s a blatant and insulting statement of women\u2019s second-class status.After the decision to change the bill was announced last June, newly minted Hamilton supporters emerged in force, insisting that they didn\u2019t object to having a woman on the currency but just didn\u2019t want to see their man replaced. Put a woman on the new $20, they argued \u2014 get rid of that bully Andrew Jackson!Fine. I\u2019ll be happy to see a woman on that bill, too, when it comes off the printing press \u2014 in 2030, if we\u2019re lucky.

All he ever wanted was to be \u201cin.\u201d And he found the perfect way \u2014 through his wife. He joined two of the most revered families of Dutch New York when he wed Elizabeth Schuyler, whose mother was a Van Rensselaer.But Hamilton\u2019s infidelity pales in comparison to his other great sin: leaving his wife and seven surviving children penniless. He knew what he was risking by going into that duel with Aaron Burr. He knew that if he died, he was leaving his family with nothing. He knew that his daughter Angelica had lost her mind as a result of her brother Philip\u2019s death in a duel, and that Elizabeth would have to care for her forever. Yet he dueled anyway, and was killed. This is the money manager people want to keep front and center as the champion of American finance?If any Hamilton should be on the $10, my vote is for Elizabeth.

{"Headline": "Segregation Issue Complicates de Blasio\u2019s Housing Push", "Date": "2016-04-14", "News": "Supported byRace/RelatedAs New York City tries to spur construction of tens of thousands of apartments to meet an accelerating need for below-market-rate housing, a deeper problem has largely gone unmentioned by municipal officials: the persistence of residential segregation in one of the world\u2019s most diverse cities.Nearly 50 years after the passage of the federal Fair Housing Act, segregated neighborhoods remain entrenched around the country, a result of decades of discrimination and a byproduct of powerful, present-day economic forces, like New York\u2019s punishing real estate market.Now, the unfinished business of eliminating such segregation has become a renewed focus of the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, which last year adopted a rule requiring local governments to set realistic goals to reduce barriers to choice in housing, and advance integration \u2014 or risk losing federal housing funds.New York is celebrated for its wealth of nationalities, ethnicities and languages. But the melting pot image belies the reality that much of the city remains divided along racial or ethnic lines. In dozens of neighborhoods, a single racial or ethnic group predominates, at rates of 70 percent to nearly 90 percent in areas like Washington Heights in Manhattan, Tottenville on Staten Island and East Flatbush in Brooklyn.The New York Times asked residents in community districts that were highly divided along racial and ethnic lines to describe what they liked and didn\u2019t like about their neighborhoods.With his pledge to build 80,000 affordable units over 10 years, Mayor Bill de Blasio has a chance to alter racial housing patterns, not just to reshape the market.But integrating neighborhoods is a complicated undertaking. In New York, it has put housing advocates at odds with civil rights defenders in a way that places pressure on Mr. de Blasio, a liberal Democrat who considers himself an ally of both.There are difficult trade-offs to grapple with. Redeveloping low-income areas can increase diversity by bringing in higher-income residents. But it can also end up pricing out existing residents. Doing the reverse \u2014 investing in affordable housing in more expensive areas \u2014 can draw in low-income residents. But government subsidies often do not go as far in such neighborhoods, with the potential result that fewer rental units are priced at affordable rates.Diversifying the demographic makeup of neighborhoods can also, in some cases, dilute the political clout of ethnic or racial groups.These tensions have been on display in the battles over the de Blasio administration\u2019s efforts to rezone lower-income neighborhoods to build both market-rate and below-market-rate units. Housing advocates have pushed for more city-subsidized apartments for the poorest of households to be set aside in the East New York section of Brooklyn, the first area targeted for redevelopment. Their fear: that the higher rents that often follow development will lead to a so-called whitening of a neighborhood that is mostly black and Latino.One way the city already tries to ensure that existing residents remain in areas being rezoned is through a \u201ccommunity preferences\u201d policy, which allots as many as half of new lower-cost units to applicants already living in the area where such units are being built.Mr. de Blasio, asked during a February meeting at The New York Times how much he prioritized integration as he pursued his housing goals, said he believed it was \u201ca really important area of public policy and one where we need more and better tools.\u201dThe city recently began tackling segregation in schools, another byproduct of housing segregation, through a pilot program meant to diversify student bodies.Vicki Been, commissioner of the city\u2019s Department of Housing Preservation and Development, said the administration\u2019s affordable housing strategy aimed to bring a range of household incomes to both \u201csought after\u201d neighborhoods and poorer ones.Ms. Been also cited the construction of mixed-income buildings, financed through a combination of city, state and federal money, as well as the opening up of more housing choices for recipients of Section 8, the federal rental-assistance program, as effective integration tools.\u201cWith economic diversity comes racial diversity,\u201d Ms. Been said.The cost of housing in the city poses an obstacle. Section 8 vouchers are meant to give renters a choice of neighborhoods to live in, but the voucher amounts are too low in most cases to pay for housing in anywhere other than lower-income areas. Similarly, affordable housing financed by the city is usually concentrated in parts of the city with higher-than-average poverty rates, where land is cheaper, Furman Center research shows.The first eight areas where the new policy applies are mostly minority neighborhoods with household incomes below the citywide median. Officials said they considered factors like which areas could accommodate growth, and had undervalued land.Though officials said the policy would eventually be applied to other neighborhoods, some critics say that the city should have included more affluent areas sooner as part of a broader fair-housing strategy.\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that some people are questioning why the first neighborhoods are low-income communities,\u201d said City Councilman Brad Lander, a Brooklyn Democrat and an ally of the mayor who says he wants more affordable housing in the Gowanus section in his district.There are worries about the opposite approach as well, with some affordable-housing advocates suggesting that investing in higher-income areas could lead to the neglect of poorer ones.\u201cThere\u2019s a significant amount of anxiety over the objections that seem to discourage investment in communities of poverty,\u201d Mathew M. Wambua, the housing commissioner under Mr. de Blasio\u2019s predecessor, Michael R. Bloomberg, said at a fair-housing panel last fall. \u201cThe fear is the idea of undermining investment in communities rich in culture, vibrancy and resilience.\u201dThe challenge, from the perspective of housing advocates, is how to protect low-income residents from displacement as neighborhoods improve and market-rent newcomers drive up housing costs.In 2014, community groups in Downtown Brooklyn, citing gentrification concerns, won an accelerated schedule for the Atlantic Yards megaproject, whose developers had initially pledged to create 2,250 affordable apartments by 2035. By then, the groups argued, the black population would have dropped to 15 percent from 40 percent, according to demographic projections, which showed the number of white people almost doubling over the same period. The groups said soaring rents would force most low-income tenants out of the area, denying them a shot at the new units.City officials say the key to holding displacement at bay while building mixed-income communities is to do more both to preserve existing rent-regulated units and to monitor harassment by landlords who illegally evict tenants to take advantage of rising rents in gentrifying areas.Some say it also helps to take a long view.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Zaha Hadid\u2019s First Posthumous Project Is Inaugurated in Salerno", "Date": "2016-04-26", "News": "Supported byOn the long approach from the sea, the flowing, horizontal silhouette of this all-concrete structure, bracketed fore and aft by leaning walls, stands out from the heavyset classicized buildings along the waterfront promenade. Thinking of that distant view across water, visualizing the possibilities, Ms. Hadid had scoped out the site from a police boat before finalizing the design that won a 2000 competition.In a country where regions and cities have developed strong identities over centuries, Vincenzo de Luca \u2014 until recently the mayor of Salerno and now the governor of the Campania region \u2014 was looking for a functional building with a strong and singular presence that would also express the city\u2019s individuality. As a matter of urban planning policy, beauty mattered.The city commissioned the terminal to help alleviate congestion on its roads and encourage a sustainable way to explore the region, port to port. The futuristic design has precedent in Italy: Since the 1920s, officials intent on industrializing the country have commissioned progressive buildings in Modernist styles, first for train stations, such as those in Florence, Naples and Rome, and then highway rest-stop structures.Officials describe the maritime terminal as a key to the city\u2019s environmental and financial planning, with aspirations for tourism. Once the harbor is deepened, the expectation is that cruise liners will join ferries and hydrofoils already plying the fabled Amalfi and the less traveled Cilento coasts.As seen from the sea and from the waterfront promenade of the crescent bay that curves into the distance, Ms. Hadid\u2019s rippling roof parallels the horizon line of the water and captures a sense of flow and movement. Both ends of the long building lean out, like prows, recalling ships and energizing the silhouette. At night the brilliantly lighted building glows like a lantern.Inside, the building is an intricate gavotte of interlocked functions and juxtaposed ramps and balconies.\u201cWe thought of the building as an oyster, with a hard shell top and bottom, and a softer, liquid, more organic interior,\u201d said Paola Cattarin, the project architect.Ms. Hadid\u2019s office has often designed museums and cultural centers, building types that allow wide design latitude. But a ship terminal functions more like an airport, with fixed requirements such as departure and arrival areas, as well as secondary routes for baggage, and administrative offices and building services.After showing their passports and tickets, departing travelers step onto gently sloping ramps that swoop through the cavernous entry hall, connecting the upper level to the dock level below. The paths are self-guiding, with slopes and sightlines cuing visitors, rather then relying on signage. Ramps and walls relate to each other, curves sweeping against curves in a spatially rich interplay entirely at home in a country that invented Baroque space.The architects took advantage of Salerno\u2019s dependable winds to design natural ventilation for the interior, which they warmed with blond woods.Then came the on-again-off-again construction process, which lasted over a dozen years. Ms. Cattarin attributed delays to contractor bankruptcies, extended bidding periods, funding delays, and a slow bureaucracy: the process gave renewed understanding to why Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day. (The timeline for Hadid\u2019s projects in China, even larger and more complex than Salerno\u2019s, is less than two years, the firm says.)\u201cToo many laws, too much bureaucracy,\u201d Mr. de Luca said. \u201cThe intervals were long here, and also financing arrived very slowly.\u201d The 50,000-square-foot building cost 15 million euros.The maritime terminal actually represents an older generation of work in the Hadid office, when the architects were still designing with physical models and hand drawings, though computers were first being introduced.Ms. Hadid was awarded the competition in an unusual week of successes, when she also won for a ski jump in Austria and a science museum in Germany, buildings that would help form the basis for winning the Pritzker Prize for architecture in 2004.\u201cIt was an intense moment for the office,\u201d Ms. Cattarin said. \u201cWe were still a small office of 15 or 20.\u201dMs. Hadid had spent more than a decade building very few projects, and the week represented a moment when her thesis investigations, research and visionary proposals were at last becoming real.Ms. Hadid\u2019s ambitious architecture spanned the globe. Here\u2019s a look at some of the highlights.The terminal, though unique in its form and abstraction in this predominantly traditional city, was designed contextually. \u201cWe studied how the water joined the landscape, and we responded to the cultural context,\u201d Ms. Cattarin said.The aquatic topography of the roof was designed as a shell structure, and engineered so that its creases, depressions and curves support the wide, column-free spans. The team of architects, which included Patrik Schumacher, who spoke for the office at Monday\u2019s ceremony in a torrential downpour, designed the interiors so that spaces would echo the way the old medieval city at the core of Salerno climbs up and down its hillside, with narrow lanes that open to piazzas and avenues near the water.\u201cWe wanted to create the effect of contraction and expansion,\u201d Ms. Cattarin said.The construction of the terminal was something of a slow-motion civic event. As it was built, citizens became curious, and for some the construction site became part of evening stroll. A crowd gathered before and after dinner to witness one all-night push to pour the concrete for the roof.In this heartland of classicism, settled by the ancient Greeks, this radically contemporary terminal could very well join the temples of Paestum and even the Roman ruins of Pompeii as one of the area\u2019s monuments.With the death of Ms. Hadid, the inauguration also became a chance for grateful citizens to say farewell to an architect who had given their city a monument of unexpected beauty. Posters went up around the city featuring a picture of Ms. Hadid, with lines that read: \u201cGoodbye Zaha Hadid, Genius and Modernity. Inspiration and Transformation, Light that takes shape. Salerno will proudly care for and cherish the Maritime Terminal.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "San Francisco Approves Fully Paid Parental Leave", "Date": "2016-04-05", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 San Francisco on Tuesday became the first city in the United States to approve six weeks of fully paid leave for new parents \u2014 mothers and fathers, including same-sex couples, who either bear or adopt a child.Before the vote, the supervisors amended the proposal to make employees eligible only when they have worked for a company 180 days. The ordinance goes into effect on Jan. 1, 2017, for companies with more than 50 employees, and a year later for those with 20 or more workers.The new law will make San Francisco\u2019s policy far broader than that of New York City, which has also expanded its parental leave policy. In December, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York ordered that 20,000 nonunionized workers be given six weeks of fully paid parental leave, but that amounts to a sliver of the total municipal work force of around 300,000.Except for a group of small-business owners, the ordinance here had wide support. The San Francisco Chamber of Commerce said that while it favored expanded parental leave benefits, there was a \u201cstrong belief among many business owners that once again, to the financial detriment of small businesses, a mandate is being adopted in San Francisco that would be better dealt with at the state or federal level.\u201d In a letter to the Board of Supervisors, the chamber declared itself \u201cneutral\u201d on the issue.Scott Wiener, the supervisor who introduced the measure, said that San Francisco lawmakers had chosen to take up the issue partly because there was little hope of change at the national level.\u201cWhether it\u2019s paid parental leave, infrastructure investment, minimum wage, paid sick leave or addressing carbon emissions, we know the states have to act,\u201d Mr. Wiener said in an interview before the vote.The ordinance requires a second vote by the supervisors next week and approval by Mayor Edwin M. Lee. Legislators described both as formalities given the unanimous vote on Tuesday.Only two states besides California \u2014 New Jersey and Rhode Island \u2014 mandate paid parental leave, and none at full pay. The funds for parental leave in all three come from employee-funded public insurance systems.Supporters of the measure rallied on the steps of City Hall on Tuesday.Julia Parish, 33, a lawyer with the Legal Aid Society who is eight and a half months pregnant, said the measure would be particularly helpful to lower-income residents who do not work for companies with generous benefits. \u201cWe are ahead of the curve in California, but globally, we are way behind,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s shameful.\u201dIndeed, by global standards, the San Francisco ordinance is a modest step. The United States is one of two countries out of 185 listed by the International Labor Organization that do not have a national law providing some form of paid parental leave. (The other is Papua New Guinea.)The parental leave measure is one of several pro-worker initiatives emerging from California. Gov. Jerry Brown signed a law Monday that would progressively raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2022. Separately, the leader of California\u2019s Senate is pushing to offer tax-free retirement savings plans for the 7.5 million workers in California who do not have employer-provided retirement plans.At a time of great divisions at the national level, amplified by the bitterness of the presidential election campaign, California\u2019s Democratic leaders say they see an opening to push hard on liberal issues inside the state.\u201cWith the presidential election in the background \u2014 with so much anger and anxiety \u2014 California is going in a vastly different direction,\u201d said the Senate president pro tempore, Kevin de Le\u00f3n, who wrote the retirement savings plan. \u201cWe are proving that despite the large legislative vacuum in Washington, D.C., that California can lead on its own.\u201dGavin Newsom, the state\u2019s lieutenant governor, said the country\u2019s divisions were making action by the states more urgent and necessary.\u201cThe nation is alive from the bottom up,\u201d Mr. Newsom said. \u201cFor all the disproportionate focus on Washington, D.C., there\u2019s a whole other America out there, and it should give pause to the pessimists.\u201dPro-labor battles have been hard fought in Washington. The federal parental leave law, known as the Family and Medical Leave Act, provides for 12 weeks of parental leave \u2014 unpaid.The law, vetoed or blocked for a decade, was passed in 1993 and signed by President Bill Clinton.Paid family leave, including parental leave, is scheduled to start in New York State in 2018 as part of a budget passed last week by the Legislature; in the first phase of the law, workers will get 50 percent of their wages during eight weeks of leave.In addition to parental leave, experts point to a growing number of states and municipalities that are passing laws governing sick leave and retirement plans.California\u2019s retirement savings plan addresses what experts say is the looming problem across the country of underfunded retirements. Under the program, called Secure Choice, a yet-to-be determined amount \u2014 around 3 to 5 percent \u2014 would be automatically deducted from workers\u2019 paychecks and placed in an investment fund that they can maintain throughout their careers.The fund would be overseen by portfolio managers chosen by the state. Employers will not add funds to the plan \u2014 the savings come entirely from employees.Employees can opt out of the savings plan.The program passed unanimously through a vetting committee led by the state\u2019s treasurer, but still needs to pass the full Legislature and be signed by the governor.Karen Friedman, the policy director of the Pension Rights Center, an advocacy group in Washington, said that while Secure Choice was a modest start to address the country\u2019s savings shortfall, it was also a \u201cblueprint\u201d for similar programs being proposed in about 25 other states.\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of proposals out there, but California became the state leading the effort,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a recognition that most people are retiring without adequate income.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a political branding opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile others fiddle and diddle, California moves.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Valeant Tumbles, So Does Bill Ackman\u2019s Hedge Fund Herd", "Date": "2016-04-27", "News": "Supported byThe billionaire investor William A. Ackman has become the unofficial leader of a thundering herd that has lost billions of dollars betting on Valeant Pharmaceuticals over the past year.Mr. Ackman\u2019s firm has lost billions of dollars on Valeant. Shares of the Canadian drug maker have plummeted 85 percent since he first pitched the company as one of his best investment ideas at a hedge fund charity event last year.Not coincidentally, big names like Paulson & Company, Viking Global Investors and Brahman Capital have also lost billions, collectively, by betting on Valeant \u2014 underscoring a growing phenomenon of hedge fund groupthink. It is a reflection of big-dollar investors chasing too few ideas and getting tripped up when things turn poorly for a company they have set big markers on.\u201cThe bottom line is, hedge fund herding is not going away anytime soon,\u201d said Andrew Karolyi, a professor of finance at Cornell University. \u201cIf anything, we are now seeing the early signs that this type of hedge fund herding is spilling over into herding of large institutional investors. To the extent that that spillover grows and expands, then we will be concerned.\u201dHedge funds piled into Valeant as the stock soared more than $200 a share last year, even as warning signs about the company\u2019s leadership and business practices began to appear. The stock is now trading around $36 a share, as Valeant prepares to install a new chief executive and races to meet a deadline to file a delayed financial report.Big hedge funds employ teams of analysts to conduct research on companies, and they also spend tens of millions of dollars on outside research. But managers are also influenced by the big bets of their counterparts: So-called best ideas get exchanged at charitable events and exclusive industry dinners attended by traders and managers.\u201cWhy do people believe it?\u201d asked David Maris, an analyst at Wells Fargo. \u201cThey follow Valeant because they want to follow it. They want to believe they have found a new way to make money in pharmaceuticals without investing in new drugs \u2014 it sounds like a magic money box.\u201dThe crowding of hedge funds into Valeant was not an isolated event.SunEdison, a renewable energy company, was once a hedge fund darling. Big investors included Omega Advisors, Glenview Capital Management and Greenlight Capital Management. David Einhorn, the founder of Greenlight and one of the industry\u2019s most closely followed investors, emerged as SunEdison\u2019s head cheerleader when he gave a presentation promoting it in October 2014 at a Manhattan charity event. He called his presentation: \u201cHere Comes the Sun-E,\u201d playing of SunEdison\u2019s stock ticker name.Mr. Einhorn, 47, whose fund at its peak owned 6.8 percent of the company\u2019s shares, remained bullish on SunEdison\u2019s prospects even as the stock, which was trading at about $31 a share last summer plunged during the remainder of the year. In early January, as SunEdison shares were trading at $3, Mr. Einhorn got a representative appointed to the company\u2019s board.Then on April 21, the company filed for bankruptcy. Shares now trade for around 24 cents.Calculating specific losses for a hedge fund is difficult without knowing the prices which a firm purchased its shares. But Valeant\u2019s and SunEdison\u2019s plunging share prices have caused considerable carnage.It is a time of turbulence for the hedge fund industry, where some of the biggest names have reported double-digit losses. Last year, firms fell deeply into the red after wide swings in certain so-called hedge fund hotel stocks, leading what Daniel S. Loeb of Third Point Management called a \u201chedge fund killing field\u201d in a recent investor letter.The total value of hedge fund positions in SunEdison, which once accounted for 66 percent of the company\u2019s shares, is now worth just $15 million after its bankruptcy filing, according to FactSet, the financial research firm. Before hedge funds began selling their SunEdison shares last year, the value of all of those firms\u2019 holdings was $3.5 billion.The losses are worse with Valeant. At the beginning of 2015, hedge funds owned about 23 percent of the company\u2019s shares. Today, the market value of the industry\u2019s holdings in Valeant have fallen by $7.3 billion even as hedge funds bought more, according to FactSet.Firms have until mid-May to disclose whether they sold or bought shares in the fourth quarter.That so many hedge funds remained bullish on Valeant despite months of turmoil \u2014 as questions were raised repeatedly about its accounting practices \u2014 reflects the difficulty managers sometimes have with changing course.\u201cWe all get lazy and when an idea seems to be working \u2014 inertia tends to take over and you stop paying attention,\u201d said James Chanos, the founder of Kynikos Associates and one of Wall Street\u2019s best-known bearish investors. \u201cThat\u2019s on full evidence with Valeant and SunEdison too,\u201d he added.Mr. Chanos\u2019s firm began researching Valeant in late 2013. The company was a classic corporate roll-up that was growing because of serial acquisitions, piling on the debt at the same time. His short thesis focused on the fact that Wall Street was giving the company too much credit for future growth that would continue only as long as Valeant could keep acquiring bigger companies.In February 2014, Mr. Chanos presented Valeant as a stock to short at his annual \u201cBears in Hibernation\u201d retreat in Miami, which some three dozen of his friends and like-minded bearish investors in the hedge fund industry routinely attend.Mr. Ackman reached out to Mr. Chanos a month later to learn about his short bet and Mr. Chanos offered to share his research. Mr. Ackman appeared not to be persuaded and by February of the next year, he began to build what is today a 9 percent stake in Valeant.Now, as a recently appointed member of Valeant\u2019s board, Mr. Ackman is not only one of the biggest investors in the company, but has also positioned himself as an architect of its potential comeback as well. His most recent investor letter on April 26, emphasizes his role in stepping in to stabilize the company earlier this year, gaining two seats on the board.But much work remains. Valeant still has a debt pile of $31 billion to manage. It continues to wrestle with the fallout from a now shuttered mail-order drug distribution company, Philidor Rx Services, which led to an internal review of its accounting for revenue from that channel. It may have to restate earlier earnings.Mr. Ackman, in his opening statement on Wednesday to the Senate Special Committee on Aging, tried to strike a conciliatory tone when it came to the uproar over Valeant\u2019s history of increasing prices on drugs it acquired through acquisitions. He said Valeant will institute a process to ensure it considers \u201call appropriate factors and patient access in particular, when setting prices for its drugs.\u201dScolded by one senator for not looking closely enough into Valeant\u2019s drug pricing, a somewhat flustered Mr. Ackman said, \u201cI regret that we didn\u2019t do more due diligence.\u201dFor Mr. Einhorn and SunEdison, the path forward is more uncertain. Normally, equity holders get little to nothing in a bankruptcy reorganization. Mr. Einhorn\u2019s Greenlight firm cut its stake in the company nearly in half a few days before the bankruptcy filing, but by then, the damage was done.Mr. Einhorn has not said anything since the bankruptcy filing and has said little to his investors this year about his bet on SunEdison.But in a letter to investors in January, Mr. Einhorn quoted David Bowie, in what now seems like a prescient statement, \u201cI don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going from here, but I promise it won\u2019t be boring.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Greece Pushes for Eurozone Summit Meeting to Unblock Debt Talks", "Date": "2016-04-27", "News": "Supported byBRUSSELS \u2014 Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras of Greece asked on Wednesday for a summit meeting of eurozone leaders that would allow him to make his case for easier terms on sorely needed aid to help his country avoid bankruptcy.Without new rescue money by July, Greece could default on its debts and throw the 19-member eurozone into another period of chaos. There could also be a domestic upheaval in Greece similar to last summer, when the country had a referendum on the terms accompanying its third bailout, followed by snap general elections.Mr. Tsipras\u2019s latest plea is similar to one he used a year ago, when he won plaudits at home for negotiating one-on-one with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.Olga Gerovasili, a government spokeswoman, said that Mr. Tsipras spoke on Wednesday with Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, which represents the European Union\u2019s 28 national leaders, and asked him to hold a special summit meeting on Greece involving eurozone leaders if a meeting of eurozone finance ministers was not held.A government official, who spoke on the customary condition of anonymity, told reporters that Mr. Tsipras wanted to ensure that the terms of the bailout of 86 billion euros, or about $97 billion, were being maintained. Crucially for Greece, those terms included plans for some easing of repayments of its colossal debt, which is equivalent to about 177 percent of its gross domestic product.European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.He added that the region needed to avoid a \u201csituation of renewed uncertainty for Greece.\u201dEurozone finance ministers had been tentatively scheduled to meet on Thursday to decide whether new measures passed by Greece were sufficient to obtain funds that would allow it to make a repayment of \u20ac2.3 billion by July 20 on bonds held by the European Central Bank. But plans for that meeting were scrapped because of a lack of progress in talks between Greek officials and lenders.A deal is also needed at this point to allow the International Monetary Fund to make a financial contribution to the bailout and for the lenders \u2014 mainly the European Central Bank, as well as countries in the eurozone like Germany \u2014 to start negotiations on ways to ease Greece\u2019s debt burden.The I.M.F. is in an awkward position in the debt talks. It wants lenders like Germany to ease Greece\u2019s repayment burden as a condition for helping to fund the bailout, a request that Berlin has said may not be necessary. The I.M.F.\u2019s goal is to make the prospect of Greece paying back its loans more realistic, so it has also been pushing for tough austerity measures and for assurances that Athens will carry out changes.Even so, Greece does have some leverage as an important player in Europe\u2019s migration crisis, which has been concentrated in the Aegean Sea between Turkey and Greece.Turkey and the European Union have reached a deal to return most of the migrants who cross the Aegean Sea, and Greek participation is crucial for that arrangement to continue.Mr. Tsipras is also reluctant to cave in to lenders\u2019 demands at a time of opposition to further austerity from a radical faction inside his Syriza party. The country has also been roiled by rolling strikes to protest threats to pensions. The faction within Syriza says it would prefer to \u201cfall heroically\u201d than yield to foreign demands for more belt-tightening.There were signs of progress at a meeting last week in Amsterdam, where the eurozone and the I.M.F. agreed to hold Greece to a supplementary set of reforms in case the country deviates from its current fiscal targets.But Greece has refused to put those measures into law, saying they go beyond the July agreement and are against domestic law. It offered instead to set up a mechanism that would automatically cut state spending if targets were not met.James Kanter reported from Brussels, and Niki Kitsantonis from Athens.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Husband\u2019s Transgender Secret Takes Its Toll", "Date": "2016-03-31", "News": "Supported byUnhitchedIn Unhitched, longtime couples tell the stories of their relationships, from romance to vows to divorce to life afterward.The marriage of Katrina Lamb, who was then Scott Lamb, and Wendie Lubic had highs and lows but suffered from a deeply held secret: Katrina, born male, always knew she was transgender but it took many years and three marriages for her to live truthfully. Katrina, 53, and Wendie, 54, were 24 when they married.Where did they grow up?Wendie in Washington in a Reform Jewish household with parents who were professionals and traveled widely for work. Katrina in happy homes in Thornwood and Katonah, N.Y., then in Australia from age 12 to 18; her father was in finance, her mother is an artist and active in her community: \u201cWe went to my dad for permission, we went to my mother for comfort,\u201d Katrina said. She knew she was \u201cin the wrong body\u201d from age 6, but also knew, even at that age, that that would never be revealed.How did they meet?In 1985 at a Halloween party in New York City. Wendie, then a journalist, was working for Newsweek. Katrina, then still Scott, was working for Morgan Stanley. They felt immediately connected and shared a sense of humor. Wendie could quote Monty Python, which made Katrina announce \u201cthis was the woman I am going to marry.\u201dWendie describes the connection as beshert, the Yiddish word for destined, or soul mates. Katrina, then Christian, converted to Judaism during their marriage.Why did they marry?Several months after they began dating, Katrina was transferred to Japan, which prompted a proposal. \u201cI was in love, but also terrified,\u201d said Katrina, who added that it felt somewhat deceitful to propose marriage. \u201cI knew I was not meant to be a boy, but I loved Wendie and consciously picked a conventional life.\u201d Katrina had known since puberty that she was attracted only to women. \u201cI felt as though I had to live up to other people\u2019s expectations,\u201d said Katrina, who said that keeping her secret despite marriage was a deep conflict for her.Wendie thought they were perfectly suited to each other. \u201cEverything lined up,\u201d she said.Where did they live after marrying?They first lived in Tokyo for Katrina\u2019s work. They later moved to Cambridge, Mass., so Katrina could attend Harvard Business School, and then to New York and eventually back to Japan. By their second stint in Tokyo in 1991, they had two daughters.How were the early years?Both say happy and exciting. \u201cWe really got each other,\u201d Katrina said. They had a fulfilling intimate life, they loved their girls and they had a group of international friends.But the secret was troubling to Katrina; she had thought that if she had what she called a \u201cnormal\u201d life, with a marriage, children and a prestigious job, her gender issues would resolve. They didn\u2019t. She kept burying that feeling.First signs of trouble?In 1992, Katrina, then still Scott, confessed to an affair. Although Wendie was surprised, she also said it seemed to be common for businessmen in Japan.\u201cI wasn\u2019t happy with myself, and began to despise myself,\u201d Katrina said. \u201cThe affair was self-sabotage.\u201dDid they try to work on things with therapy?Yes, they found an English-speaking counselor. There were promises that the affair would stop, but soon Wendie discovered another.Who asked for the split?Wendie. In 1993, they left Japan and separated. Wendie returned to Washington. They reconciled briefly later that year, but it didn\u2019t last. Katrina, still Scott, took jobs in Russia and Indonesia and was a committed parent, seeing the family often and staying in constant touch. Katrina provided financial support, including buying the family a home.The final breakup?They were divorced in 1996 in Washington. \u201cWhatever anger we felt toward each other, we agreed to keep between us and not entangle the girls,\u201d Wendie said. The divorce was cheap and fast. Wendie still felt confused about the breakup, though. \u201cI never understood exactly what Katrina was unhappy about in our relationship,\u201d she said.How did they move on?Wendie went back to school and trained in a new profession. The children were in preschool. \u201cKatrina always had my back and was generous with time and money,\u201d Wendie said. Katrina remarried twice after Wendie, continuing to hold her secret.It was in 2002, while working in Russia, that Katrina came out to a colleague about being transgender. She read \u201cShe\u2019s Not There: A Life in Two Genders,\u201d by Jennifer Finney Boylan, which she said showed her \u201ca person with the same condition as I had who was normal.\u201d She knew she could survive the decision to live as a woman. She began hormone therapy and completed her transition, including surgery, in 2006 in Washington.Initially, Wendie was angry. She didn\u2019t want their daughters, then 13 and 14, to \u201cend up in therapy their whole lives.\u201dKatrina said that \u201cWendie\u2019s anger was justified, but there was nothing I could do about it,\u201d adding that \u201cI couldn\u2019t go back.\u201d Katrina\u2019s parents and siblings were supportive from the time they learned the truth.\u201cKatrina coming out as transgender made everything clearer,\u201d Wendie said. \u201cI had never felt unloved.\u201d One of their daughters wrote her college admission essay on her father\u2019s transition to being female.Did they feel stigmatized?As a divorced woman, Wendie did not, though she was sometimes shocked at the reactions to Katrina\u2019s being transgender. Katrina felt a stigma in some circles. When she dated a lesbian, she didn\u2019t feel welcome in certain parts of the lesbian community.How did they fare financially?Katrina provided well for the family but said she was better off in her career as a male. \u201cEven though I had a Harvard business degree, the salaries offered to me as a woman were much less than those offered to me as a man,\u201d she said.How did their children react?The transgender issue was challenging for a while; they talked about \u201cdropping the T-bomb\u201d with their friends. \u201cBack then, it killed conversation, but transgender awareness has dramatically improved in the last 10 years,\u201d said Wendie, who also noted that when Katrina first transitioned, she dressed very feminine and young. \u201cI think she was going through an adolescence,\u201d Wendie said. \u201cShe was much more feminine than I am.\u201d\u201cTrue, I was like a teenager again,\u201d Katrina said.Should they have divorced sooner?Wendie says maybe they should have hung in a bit longer. She also wishes she could have had the option to stay married to Katrina through the transition. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it would have worked, but my love for her was a constant,\u201d she said.\u201cI don\u2019t regret marrying and I adore our children,\u201d Katrina said. \u201cBut I shouldn\u2019t have married anyone until I dealt with my gender issues. I downplayed the act of deceiving those I loved, but that\u2019s what eroded me over the years. Deceit morphs into self-loathing, and you start to hate yourself, and that\u2019s not good for any relationship.\u201dIs their new life better?They all live in the Washington area. Wendie is happily married, and loves having Katrina as a close friend and co-parent.\u201cI love my life and could not say that before,\u201d Katrina said. \u201cIntellectually, I still don\u2019t understand how transgender works. There\u2019s lots of theories. Life is not always perfect but I\u2019m happy.\u201d Katrina is now single.Would they have done anything differently?\u201cI wish Katrina had been confident enough or brave enough to have told me sooner,\u201d Wendie said. \u201cI also wonder if we could have stayed together.\u201dKatrina said, \u201cI pushed everyone away because I didn\u2019t realize staying together was a possibility.\u201d And she has some regrets about that. \u201cIt would have been more productive for me to try to fix the life I had, rather than sabotage it for something else.\u201dLooking back, what advice would they offer?\u201cWith a reservoir of kindness, you can get through almost anything,\u201d Wendie said. \u201cThe world is a surprising place.\u201d\u201cBe tolerant, forgiving and true to yourself,\u201d Katrina said. \u201cWe are in a window of acceptance of transgender rights currently, and I hope that lasts. Find the courage to live your honest life.\u201dHave their personalities changed? \u201cKatrina is the same person I married as Scott almost 30 years ago but with less insecurity and less angst,\u201d Wendie said. \u201cWe are at core the very same people we have always been, and that\u2019s why we have the same loving relationship we always had.\u201dKatrina said: \u201cAs a child, I was warm and intuitive, but my defenses killed that child off. Now without barriers, I am much more open.\u201dBoth say Wendie is very much the same person she always has been.What is life like now?Katrina\u2019s daughter from her third marriage is coming from Russia to live with her. For the first time she will be a \u201csingle mom,\u201d she said. Wendie and Katrina\u2019s daughters live in New York City, and they all get together for holidays.\u201cThe kids don\u2019t bat an eyelash about this anymore,\u201d Wendie said. \u201cOur kids are accepting and nonjudgmental of all people.\u201dAdvice for others divorcing?\u201cOur story seems weird and dysfunctional, but we could never make in on reality TV because there\u2019s been very little drama,\u201d Katrina said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been mad and made mistakes, but we are very functional, happy people.\u201d As much as it seems that life is spiraling out of control, there is always a way to come back and make it work, she added.\u201cSometimes divorce is not personal,\u201d Wendie said.THE DETAILSWith Hindsight in the Rearview MirrorAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bernie Sanders, Shifting Tone, Takes On Democratic Party", "Date": "2016-04-28", "News": "Senator Bernie Sanders spent Thursday afternoon laying out in more detail than usual his views for shaping the Democratic Party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s agenda and the need for elected officials to focus on achieving progressive political goals.At a rally Thursday in Springfield, Ore., Mr. Sanders spoke at length about how Democrats had not spent enough time trying to help working-class people obtain adequate health care and higher wages.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Democratic Party has to reach a fundamental conclusion: Are we on the side of working people or big-money interests?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders asked the crowd. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo we stand with the elderly, the children, the sick and the poor? Or do we stand with Wall Street speculators and the drug companies and the insurance companies? Now our job is not just to revitalize the Democratic Party, not only to open the doors to young people and working people\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0our job is to revitalize American democracy.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Sanders criticized Democratic leaders on many of the core issues of his campaign. He questioned whether leaders were thinking about the concerns of voters rather than the economic fortunes of large industries. He also said the party needed to focus on a \u00e2\u0080\u009c50-state strategy\u00e2\u0080\u009d to win local elections and bring in new members.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe problem we are having now is not, in my view, that the Republicans are winning elections,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe problem is that the Democrats are losing elections. In November of 2014, the midterm elections, 63 percent of the American people did not vote; 80 percent of young people and low-income people did not vote.

{"Headline": "Why Mayor de Blasio Is Facing So Many Investigations", "Date": "2016-04-28", "News": "Supported bySince the Office of the Mayor of New York was established in 1665, many of the 109 men who have served in that post have attracted their share of scrutiny from commissions, constables and prosecutors.But historians have been hard-pressed to find a mayor who, along with his administration and inner circle, was ever the subject of as many simultaneous investigations \u2014 conducted by as many different agencies \u2014 as Mayor Bill de Blasio now faces.In recent weeks, no fewer than five separate inquiries \u2014 involving at least six different federal, state and local law enforcement and regulatory agencies \u2014 have come to light. Four of these investigations are focused on possible violations of criminal law.At the heart of each of the five inquiries is money \u2014 in most cases, fund-raising linked to the mayor, his election campaign or a nonprofit group connected with him.Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat elected in 2013, has made no secret of his attempts to raise significant sums to bolster his agenda through that group, the Campaign for One New York, and through an effort in 2014 to wrest control of the State Senate from the Republicans by supporting several Democratic candidates. Donors to the mayor\u2019s political endeavors include major unions and real estate developers, and many of them have business before the city.Two of the main backers of that effort, Steven Nislick and Wendy Neu, have contributed to Mr. de Blasio\u2019s nonprofit. Ms. Neu has given at least $75,000 and Mr. Nislick $50,000.In that case, investigators are examining whether donations to the candidates were funneled through county party committees to evade contribution limits, a violation of state law and a possible felony.But the biggest scandal thus far has centered on gifts and trips that senior police officials may have received from two men who raised money for the mayor: Jona S. Rechnitz, a real estate developer, and Jeremiah Reichberg, a businessman and police enthusiast in Borough Park, Brooklyn, who hosted a fund-raiser at his home for Mr. de Blasio in 2014.The possible crime that is being investigated by Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, is whether political contributions by those two men were given in exchange for some unknown municipal benefit. So far, the authorities have not signaled what favorable city action, if any, was secured by the donations.Both arrests were linked to the federal inquiry.Mr. de Blasio\u2019s efforts to get Democrats elected to the State Senate also backfired. Republicans resented his effort to oust them, and it hurt his ability to promote his programs in the Legislature \u2014 notably last summer when he was given only a one-year extension to mayoral control of city schools.With Nyclass, investigators are looking for any favorable municipal treatment granted in exchange for the spending. The principals of Nyclass, beyond being animal-rights activists, also have ties to real estate: Ms. Neu is the chairwoman and chief executive of a real estate and electronics recycling company, Hugo Neu; Mr. Nislick, a parking-garage magnate, became the chief financial officer of Ms. Neu\u2019s company in 2014.Investigators are looking at whether the for-profit nursing home company may have misled city and state agencies; they are also examining the role of the city\u2019s top lobbyist, James F. Capalino, in advocating the deed removal in 2014 on behalf of the original nonprofit owner. He later represented the ultimate purchaser of the property, on other matters.Mr. de Blasio has vigorously defended himself, his administration and his fund-raising apparatus, saying \u201cunequivocally\u201d that he had not violated any campaign finance laws during the 2014 Senate races. He has also denied any criminal conduct related to Mr. Rechnitz and Mr. Reichberg or to fund-raising more broadly.\u201cI hold myself and my administration to the highest standard of integrity,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said.The mayor has also rejected suggestions that his unwavering pledge to remove carriage horses from city streets was being driven by Nyclass.Even if no criminal charges emerge against the mayor or any of his top aides, he has been forced back on his heels at a time when he would rather press forward with his agenda and his bid for a second term.Advertisement"}

The mayor appointed Mr. Peters to lead the Investigations Department in January 2014.The statement did not mention either what the potential conflict might be, or Mr. Peters\u2019s role in the campaign. It referred to the fund-raising investigation without mentioning the mayor, citing \u201callegations related to certain campaign donors.\u201dThe inquiry, which is being conducted by federal prosecutors in Manhattan and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, along with the Investigation Department, is focused on two businessmen who served as fund-raisers for Mr. de Blasio. One of the men, Jona Rechnitz, bundled over $40,000 in donations for Mr. de Blasio while Mr. Peters was campaign treasurer. Around the same time, Mr. Rechnitz and his wife each gave the campaign $4,950, the maximum amount allowed.As commissioner, Mr. Peters oversees criminal and administrative inquiries into corruption, fraud, waste and abuse throughout city government.Asked why Mr. Peters had changed his position, a spokeswoman for the Investigation Department, Diane Struzzi, said the agency would not comment beyond the statement. Karen Hinton, a spokeswoman for the mayor, declined to comment.That statement said, \u201cThe allegations of wrongdoing regarding campaign finance postdate Commissioner Peters\u2019s involvement with the campaign.\u201dIt pointed to the timing of the possible wrongdoing under scrutiny, suggesting there was no appearance of a conflict of interest in Mr. Peters\u2019s role. But he was the campaign treasurer when the funds bundled by Mr. Rechnitz and those from him and his wife were donated.The Investigation Department statement on Wednesday had also suggested he was playing an important role in the federal inquiry, noting that his recusal \u201cwould only serve to impede D.O.I.\u2019s active investigation of this matter.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Private Equity Alum\u2019s Guide to Better Payday Lenders", "Date": "2016-04-29", "News": "Supported byYour MoneyYale. Morgan Stanley. Private equity.So perhaps he was the most likely person to find and then shame the many state pension funds and university endowments that invest, through private equity, in the payday lending industry. It is an industry that has millions of struggling Americans paying sky-high interest rates for what are supposed to be small loans.Mr. Zhang said he hoped to put the company\u2019s anti-payday-lending efforts in top search engine spots, too, though he landed at NerdWallet almost entirely by chance. His parents, both chemists, brought him to the United States from China when he 2 years old, after a professor at Northwestern University invited them to work and study there.The family eventually moved to Connecticut, where they entered the middle class and then the upper middle class. Mr. Zhang said his father had known as a boy what it meant to go hungry, but his parents\u2019 frugality kept him from ever having to go without. Still, he worked as a babysitter and a busboy, while still achieving enough in the classroom to earn acceptance to Yale.After college, Mr. Zhang spent two years at Morgan Stanley on a team that analyzed the firm\u2019s own strategy and transactions. He followed that up with two years in private equity, where firms use money from high-net-worth individuals and others to invest in companies. Eventually, it would try to sell those companies at a profit and put money back in the pockets of the now higher-net-worth individuals.In early 2015, he got a LinkedIn message from a recruiter at NerdWallet, the first time he\u2019d heard of the company. But when he learned more about it, the move made perfect sense to him. \u201cI spent two years helping the bank make more money and two years helping high-net-worth people make more,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the foreseeable future, I could help everyday consumers think smarter about their money.\u201dHe was hired to help think through the company\u2019s approach to student and personal loans. The site already had some information about the perils of payday loans. A representative from the N.A.A.C.P. in Alabama had noted NerdWallet\u2019s interest in the topic and invited Mr. Zhang to speak at a conference.Speaking there and meeting people who were up to their ears in such loans radicalized him. It also got him thinking. Somebody had to be investing money in these lenders, given how large they had become. But who were they? \u201cI had lived in that world and was familiar with how deals get done,\u201d he said. \u201cSome insecure overachiever tries to find a deal, writes a memo, builds a model, and then a vice president or partner goes and pitches it.\u201dWhile the investments themselves didn\u2019t violate any rules, Mr. Zhang said he didn\u2019t think the financial aid recipients who benefit from endowment earnings and retired state workers would feel good about it. So he and his colleagues passed their findings on to various media organizations.A small, early experiment intended to draw borrowers to the site drew hundreds of clicks from Google each day from people looking for cheap payday loans. Lenders approached NerdWallet with an offer to pay it $60 in commission on a $200 loan, knowing that many borrowers end up repeatedly rolling their loans over into new loans and paying effective annual interest rates well into the three figures.\u201cI asked them whether they would take the $60 and give that discount to the borrower, but they wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Zhang said. \u201cTheir business model is based on repeat customers, so if someone repays their loan, they don\u2019t make money.\u201dEventually, NerdWallet settled on a pro bono effort whereby it would earn no commission and send consumers only to nonprofit lenders with lower interest rates or to governmental organizations that offer short-term assistance. It began on Friday, with links to 44 entities in California and Texas. The company plans to add more over time.While NerdWallet will make no money in the short term from its payday lending redirection, it is well aware that people in financial trouble now could be customers next year. \u201cIf we do this well, we can rehabilitate people in a tough spot,\u201d Mr. Zhang said. \u201cIn six months, when she needs a credit card or wants to start investing, she\u2019ll come back. That\u2019s the best type of bet that we can make.\u201dAbout those credit cards: There\u2019s something pretty rich about a company like NerdWallet, which earns commissions from credit card issuers that charge double-digit interest rates, channeling those commissions toward keeping other customers away from the triple-digit effective interest rates that the payday lenders charge. But hey, at least NerdWallet isn\u2019t using that money to push more credit cards.Mr. Zhang understands how this looks. \u201cWe wrestle with it every day,\u201d he said. To him, the benefits of credit cards outweigh the problems they cause for the many millions of people who use them without getting into years of debt.That\u2019s not something, however, that he can say about lending operations that target people who are down on their luck. \u201cThere is no instance,\u201d he said, \u201cwhere I\u2019d ever encourage people to get a payday loan.\u201dTwitter: @ronlieberAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Wall St. Regulators Propose Stricter Pay Rules for Bankers", "Date": "2016-04-21", "News": "Supported byThe new limits on banker bonuses would make the highest-paid employees at the biggest banks wait at least four years to receive parts of their annual pay. If the proposals are completed in the coming months, banks would also have to reclaim bonuses from bankers who take risks that lead to big financial losses.The regulators are responding to an uproar of criticism over Wall Street\u2019s pay practices after the biggest American banks had to take government bailout money during the 2008 financial crisis. That public anger has been rekindled during the 2016 presidential campaign season, putting pressure on regulators to tighten their oversight of Wall Street.The new rules on executive pay grew out of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul, but it has taken years to put them into practice, even though President Obama has pushed regulators to complete them. The administration is running out of time to get rules approved before a new president is elected.Rick Metsger, the vice chairman at the National Credit Union Administration \u2014 one of six agencies responsible for drafting the rules \u2014 said on Thursday that politicians and the public \u201cwant senior executives at large financial institutions held accountable if their desire for personal enrichment leads to decision-making that results in material losses.\u201dThe structure of executive pay packages before the financial crisis was blamed for encouraging bankers to take unnecessary risks. In some cases, pay was set up in ways that motivated bankers to seek short-term gains even if their actions led to losses over the longer term.The new rules will force many banks to withhold pay for longer than they have in the past, to ensure that top employees can be held accountable for the longer-term consequences of their risk-taking.The proposals leave many financial firms, including large asset managers and hedge funds, shielded from the new restrictions because of the way the regulators have defined which institutions are subject to them. Young Wall Street workers, and potential recruits who might once have aspired to jobs in the industry, are already decamping for less regulated corners of finance and corporate America, including Silicon Valley.For those institutions subject to the rules, the new restrictions are broadly in line with changes that many banks have already been making since the financial crisis.For instance, it is already an industry standard to wait three years to release stock-based bonuses. The new rules aim to push that to four years.There has been less consistency in how banks have approached seizing pay from employees if their actions lead to losses. The new proposal makes bankers\u2019 pay vulnerable to so-called clawbacks for seven years after the pay is received, if they are found to have engaged in misconduct or taken actions that led to big losses.Steven Eckhaus, an expert on executive compensation at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, said he did not see the new rules \u201chaving a big impact except around the margins.\u201dHere are 200 of the highest-paid chief executives in American business.\u201cThis largely codifies the practices that have evolved over the last eight years,\u201d he said.The regulators were supposed to propose the new rules within 90 days of Dodd-Frank\u2019s passage. Instead, the regulatory agencies delivered a first draft of the rules in 2011, but that draft was widely panned as being too weak.In the previous draft, the largest banks had to hold back at least 50 percent of all incentive-based pay for three years. Under the new proposals, the same banks will have to withhold 60 percent of that pay for four years.The new draft also applies the limits to a broader set of \u201cmaterial risk-takers\u201d at big banks, not just top executives.Marcus Stanley, the policy director at the advocacy organization Americans for Financial Reform, said the new version was stronger than the 2011 proposal, but did not push the banks to go far enough beyond already accepted practices.He said, for instance, that he had hoped that banks would have to hold back pay for more than four years because big losses on bank investments can often take longer than that to materialize.In Britain, by contrast, banks are now forced to hold back some pay for at least seven years. European countries have generally imposed stronger restrictions on executive compensation since the financial crisis, including some hard caps on salary and bonuses.The new American rules would apply only to incentive-based compensation \u2014 generally bonuses \u2014 which varies according to the performance of the bank and the individual executive.Even without the rules, banks have faced steady pressure from regulators and shareholders since the financial crisis to change the way they pay their employees and tie more compensation to a firm\u2019s long-term, rather than short-term, success.JPMorgan Chase, for instance, recently announced that it was altering the pay package of its chief executive, Jamie Dimon, so that he is compensated primarily with stock that he will receive only if the firm achieves certain levels of future profitability. Mr. Dimon will get the stock after five years, which is longer than the new rules propose.Banks and other financial institutions have generally been cutting pay in recent years because of their lagging performance, and other parts of the Dodd-Frank legislation have limited their ability to take big risks and earn the big profits that were common before the financial crisis.This week, Goldman Sachs said that the pool of money it had put aside so far this year for employee compensation is 40 percent smaller than it was at the same time last year.The new rules were debated and described for the first time at a meeting on Thursday of the National Credit Union Administration, the first of the six agencies to take up the proposal.The public will have until July to comment on the new rules, and it will likely be months after that before they go into effect.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sallie Mae Now Offers Education Loans to Parents, Too", "Date": "2016-04-29", "News": "Supported byYour Money AdviserSALLIE MAE this week became the latest lender to make private loans available to parents who want to help pay for their child\u2019s higher education.Most student loans are made by the federal government. But because the government limits the amount that students can borrow, parents of students who fall short may turn to the federal Plus program or to private lenders. The proportion of students graduating with the help of parent loans has steadily increased over the last decade, according to an analysis by Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of the college selection website Cappex.com.Given the financial burden of college, parents are looking for options. \u201cMost families see paying for college as a shared responsibility,\u201d said Charles Rocha, executive vice president and chief marketing officer at Sallie Mae, adding that the company\u2019s research found that many parents wanted a \u201ccompetitive alternative\u201d to the Plus loan.The rate for federal Plus loans is currently 6.84 percent. (Federal loans are offered at fixed rates only.) Sallie Mae said its fixed-rate parent loans were 5.74 to 12.87 percent, depending on the applicant\u2019s credit rating.Mr. Rocha also said the parent loan charged no upfront fee, while the federal government currently charges 4.272 percent for Plus loans.A guide to student loans at various universities, and what it takes after graduation to repay that debt.Unlike the federal government, Sallie Mae also offers variable-rate parent loans, with rates currently from 4 to 10.37 percent. With variable rate loans, monthly payments increase as rates rise. Mr. Rocha said he expected the variable option to be popular, since a majority of borrowers in its undergraduate private loan program choose it.Student aid experts cautioned that probably only those with excellent credit could qualify for Sallie Mae\u2019s best rates. Mr. Rocha said he could not specify how many borrowers might qualify for the lowest rates, but, \u201cWe generally expect applicants to fall across the range of rates.\u201dPauline Abernathy, vice president of the Institute for College Access and Success, an advocacy group, said in an email that private parent loans might cost less than federal parent Plus loans for parents with good credit. But she said, there are potential drawbacks borrowers should weigh carefully. Private loans, for instance, will not guarantee some of the same protections and options as federal Plus loans, she said, like the ability to discharge the debt because of a school\u2019s closing, loan deferments for economic hardships, and potential access to a repayment option that can tie payments to the borrower\u2019s income.Also, Ms. Abernathy noted, if a parent of an undergraduate student applied for a Plus loan and was denied, the student could borrow more money beyond the usual federal loan limits. So, she said, \u201cthere are real reasons to apply for parent Plus loans before considering a private parent loan.\u201dHere are some questions and answers about parent loans:Parents of undergraduate or graduate students, as well as other \u201ccreditworthy\u201d adults, like grandparents, aunts and uncles, and guardians who want to help finance the student\u2019s education, can apply for the loan, Mr. Rocha said.Rates are determined each spring under a formula set by Congress in 2013, and take effect July 1 for the following 12 months. (While rates for new loans may change annually, once a loan is issued, its rate remains the same for the life of the loan.)Advertisement"}

They munched the 30 pounds or so of hacked-up sugar cane and sorghum stalks they are allotted and lapped up all the water they wanted, a precious gift in this drought-stricken part of the country.After a third consecutive deficient monsoon season, the government of the Beed district has established as a temporary measure 264 of these camps \u2014 long a fixture of drought relief efforts in Maharashtra State \u2014 after surveys predicted a shortage of fodder for the animals. But the camps, set up to handle thousands of cattle, have run into an unanticipated problem: The owners of the livestock, who were supposed to drop them off, have instead moved in \u2014 cooking utensils, spare cots, water drums and all.The hundreds of farmers packed into the camp do not always enjoy the same comforts as their cattle, which are considered sacred in Hinduism. Slaughtering cows is outlawed in most states, and preserving them is considered essential to avoiding a large-scale catastrophe.The farmers are forced to fend for themselves, cooking their own meals and living in tents surrounded by mounds of fodder, the ground nearby covered with fresh droppings.

The basic objective will be disturbed.\u201dLast year in Beed, 45 waterless days stretched out grimly in the middle of what was supposed to be its prime rainy season, as drought was widespread in India. In Marathwada, a region in central Maharashtra State that includes Beed and seven other districts, rainfall was 40 percent below the norm.Wells and hand pumps have run dry, and rumors of mass migrations swirl. Politicians clash over how to address the crisis, and experts worry that the emergency relief, including the cattle camps and the tankers that deliver drinking water to villages, will never stem its root causes.Ajay Dandekar, a professor at Shiv Nadar University near New Delhi who has studied the drought, said the conditions in Marathwada had resulted from dual calamities: a chronically arid landscape ravaged further by rising temperatures and El Ni\u00f1o, as well as the diversion of water to western Maharashtra, where most of its industry and thirsty sugar cane crops lie.\u201cThe situation is very grave \u2014 it\u2019s hopeless,\u201d he said of the arid countryside.Ms. Garje felt the gravity of the situation last winter in Khilad. The cotton and sorghum monsoon crops had failed, and the village well was nearly dry. Tankers brought drinking water, but she worried about her three cattle, three buffalo and an ox that the family had bought, one by one, beginning 25 years ago when crop yields were bountiful.\u201cI saw the cattle of other villages dying,\u201d she said.So at one January dawn, she and her husband set out for the cattle camp, nearly two miles away, walking across a bridge over a rocky ravine that was once a river, past the sorghum and cotton fields that had yielded so little last year. They foraged for wood to build their tents, and took dried cow dung from the neighbors for their roofs.She now cooks vegetables over an open fire, and returns home twice a month to check in on her son who looks over their fields. But she does not contemplate going back for good.\u201cI love my cattle more than my children,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to stay with them. The life of a farmer all depends on cattle.\u201dIt is a sentiment echoed by many residents of the camp, mostly men who have shifted with their animals, and are visited occasionally by their small children and wives.Babasaheb Garje, 30, also of Khilad but no immediate relation to Ms. Garje, said that at the camp, at least, there was drinking water. His wife comes in the morning, helping him feed their cows and bringing food from home, then leaves in the evening.\u201cAfter she goes, I sit and think what will happen to the animals,\u201d he said. \u201cI think about the rainfall, and whether it will come this year.\u201dNot all cattle camps are bare-bones: A sprawling establishment in the Beed district village of Palwan supplies meals for the farmers staying there and is trying to address one symptom of their distress \u2014 their inability to pay for their children\u2019s weddings. The camp organizers are planning a joint marriage ceremony this month for 50 couples of drought-affected farmers, including 14 couples whose families stay in the camp.The program is being financed by the nongovernmental organization that runs the camp. Rajendra Maske, its secretary, is also a member of the Shiv Sangram Party, which stood for state elections with Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party. Camp residents say the government has awarded the contracts for many of the camps to NGOs run by political workers.In a starched cotton shirt and crisp trousers, Mr. Maske surveyed the camp with evident satisfaction. He said he hoped the chief minister of Maharashtra would come for the marriage ceremony, and that at $30,000 for the whole affair the NGO was sparing no expense.\u201cPeople have an emotional connection to the camp,\u201d Mr. Maske said.In February, with some postmonsoon crops showing promise, Mr. Ram, the Beed administrative official, recommended closing the camps \u201cfor a month or two.\u201d The government agreed, but the outcry from farmers and politicians was swift, and officials relented.Sanjay Malani, the executive editor of a small daily newspaper in Beed, said that the government was caving to political pressure, and that the camps were being used as vote banks for political parties.\u201cIt\u2019s a moneymaking and image-making business,\u201d Mr. Malani said.The relative lavishness of the Palwan camp is atypical, however. The Khalid camp, which is run by the NGO of Vijay Golhar, a Bharatiya Janata Party member and a former member of the district assembly, appeared more austere.\u201cMy father has always been working for the betterment and development of the farmers,\u201d said his daughter, Ratnaprabha Golhar. She said that the NGO was providing for all the farmers\u2019 needs, and that any critique of the camp might have come from \u201csome opposition.\u201dBut Suresh Wanve, 34, who tends 20 cows and buffalo with his brother at the camp in Khilad, said he would prefer that farmers receive the money the government is spending on the animals\u2019 fodder in cash, so they could buy fodder themselves and stay in their homes.\u201cWe know all these things,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we don\u2019t have any other options.\u201dSuhasini Raj contributed reporting from New Delhi.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "One Love, Two Steps", "Date": "2016-04-22", "News": "Supported byVows9 PhotosLife on the campaign trail for support staff often involves long days that lead to lonely nights in scantly furnished short-term rentals, with no real-life social network to engage in outside of colleagues.Stephanie Schweitzer, a political operative, had fallen victim to this routine when she relocated in January 2014 from New York to Austin, Tex., to work as deputy regional finance director on the gubernatorial run of Wendy Davis, a Texas senator known for her 11-hour filibuster against Senate Bill 5, an anti-abortion measure. Ms. Schweitzer, who said she had settled into a \u201cpretty pathetic\u201d apartment with only a bed, found herself feeling \u201ca bit ungrounded and foreign.\u201dRefusing to accept the fate of her peripatetic career, Ms. Schweitzer, now 36, recalled how she joined a group called Liberal Ladies Who Lunch, through which she was introduced to another single woman around her age. When she mentioned to her new friend that she wanted to try two-stepping even though she didn\u2019t yet own cowboy boots, her friend suggested that together they check out the Love Leighs, a roots band with two ukuleles, who were playing the White Horse, a honky-tonk on Austin\u2019s east side. The friend\u2019s interest in going waned as the time came closer because she was nursing a hangover, but Ms. Schweitzer insisted.\u201cI didn\u2019t want to show up alone, because I was sick of just showing up places and not knowing people and feeling awkward and then being like, forget it, I\u2019m leaving,\u201d Ms. Schweitzer said.There at the White Horse, known as the Horse, she met Juan Pablo Garza, or JP, who grew up on the Texas-Mexico border and for whom cowboy boots were a staple. He gave her every reason to stay.The route into politics taken by Ms. Schweitzer, a Wisconsin native with Sheboygan County dairy farmers on both sides of the family, was a byproduct of an acting career gone awry. In 2002, after graduating with a musical theater degree from Syracuse University, she moved to New York to pursue her dreams of becoming an actor, but ended up as a guide from 2004 to 2013 for On Location Tours. She regularly hosted a \u201cSex and the City\u201d Hotspots Tour, with destinations including the stoop of the Perry Street brownstone where the fictional Carrie Bradshaw lived and where tourists would constantly stop for selfies.\u201cI think I was that girl that, like, wanted to be Carrie,\u201d Ms. Schweitzer said.With Rick Perry heading for the exits as governor of Texas, a colleague pitched her on considering a move to the Lone Star State, where a shake-up in the political landscape seemed to be brewing.The potential for change increased significantly when shortly after Ms. Schweitzer\u2019s friend had floated the idea, Wendy Davis announced she was running for governor on the heels of her much-publicized filibuster in pink Mizuno running shoes.\u201cThis was really interesting to me because not only was it like this woman that was super inspiring and an issue I cared deeply about,\u201d Ms. Schweitzer said, \u201cbut it wasn\u2019t just about that cycle. There was something longer at stake. And I just got this bee in my bonnet that I was going to work for Wendy Davis.\u201dMr. Garza has never fully let go of his boyhood dream of playing Major League Baseball. He learned the game as a child in the South Texas border city of Laredo and eventually worked his way up to join the Cosme Ordo\u00f1ez team, an all-star squad of high school kids who would pile in Mr. Garza\u2019s Toyota pickup truck and cross over the border to play men in their mid-20s who were vying for spots on Mexican professional teams. As reality began to set in that his shot with the majors had eluded him, Mr. Garza pursued a nursing degree from Laredo Community College. He ultimately chose to focus on dialysis because it gave him Sundays off to play in recreational adult baseball leagues.\u201cI\u2019ve been doing what I\u2019ve been doing since I was 8 years old,\u201d Mr. Garza, now 47, said. \u201cPlay baseball and be responsible for what I\u2019ve got to get done. I don\u2019t try to do too much because I might take away from playing on Sundays \u2014 that\u2019s my outlet.\u201dHe also got married and divorced, prompting the reignition of his passion for dancing \u2014 something that was first stoked when as a child he would go with his family on Friday nights to dance cumbias and waltzes to the live bands playing at the local hall in Laredo.\u201cAfter the divorce I was feeling like I\u2019d never find love again,\u201d Mr. Garza said. \u201cI had my opportunities, but it just didn\u2019t click. Not meant to happen then. For a while I would play the \u2018because I love, I\u2019ll let you go if you want to go\u2019 game. \u2018It is what it is\u2019 game. \u2018I love you, but I\u2019m not in love with you\u2019 game. I guess this is how I would gauge their love for me or mine for them.\u201dBy the time he and Ms. Schweitzer met at the White Horse, Mr. Garza had adopted a regular Sunday routine of playing nine innings with his team, the Austin Arch Angels, and then go dancing at the Horse, where he\u2019d become one of the regulars. \u201cI hosed off, kept my cup-holder shorts on, changed into jeans and a clean shirt,\u201d he said.She, too, had a love of dance that stretched back to her childhood. \u201cWhen I was younger, my dad and I used to have these nights where he would get out all of his old 45s and we would dance until we were out of breath,\u201d Ms. Schweitzer said. \u201cHe used to pick me up in his arms during the theme from Zeffirelli\u2019s \u2018Romeo & Juliet.\u2019 I\u2019ll never forget those memories.\u201d\u201cYou become one when you\u2019re on the floor,\u201d Mr. Garza said. \u201cYou want to go this way, she follows you. She knows. She anticipates where you\u2019re going to go. It\u2019s a pretty feeling \u2014 a feeling with no words. It\u2019s just all touch. Listen. Sense. The nature of things.\u201dBefore that night at the Horse was over, Mr. Garza dangled before Ms. Schweitzer the possibility of more swings around the dance floor. He didn\u2019t quite ask her on a date but he casually mentioned that he would be at the Horse the next Friday for the Cajun band Gumbo Ce Soir. This time she arrived alone. Mr. Garza quickly spotted her and pulled her out onto the floor. The next day they had a rendezvous at the Continental Club, for Redd Volkaert, who used to play in Merle Haggard\u2019s band, and then later that Saturday night they hit G\u00fceros and the Rattle Inn.That was the night she started feeling something for him. As they got back to their respective cars, she asked him about the next spot. He suggested still more dancing that Sunday at the Oasis on Lake Travis, and also that he pick her up this time. When he dropped her off at her apartment at the end of the night, they had their first kiss.More whirlwind weekends were to follow for the tireless couple. By June, it was Mr. Garza\u2019s turn to signal his seriousness to her \u2014 but he did it in a most curious way. He asked Ms. Schweitzer if Sadie, her cat, might consider moving in with him. The message confused Ms. Schweitzer at first but then she realized Mr. Garza\u2019s coy humor.One morning in October, Mr. Garza and Ms. Schweitzer were lying in bed. He began reading lyrics to the song \u201cIf I Were a Carpenter,\u201d the Tim Hardin folk tune later popularized by Johnny and June Carter Cash.If I were a carpenterAnd you were a ladyWould you marry me anyway?Would you have my baby?But when Senator Davis\u2019s bid for governor fell short, Ms. Schweitzer was suddenly faced with leaving Austin for Louisville, Ky., where Jack Conway, who was running for attorney general in Kentucky, wanted her on his campaign\u2019s finance staff.\u201cI wasn\u2019t really interested in the job, but professionally this is what I had been working for,\u201d said Ms. Schweitzer, who flew to Louisville for a two-day interview. When she landed the job, she said it was like a punch to the gut. They wanted her to start right away, but she and Mr. Garza had a trip to New York planned. This bought her \u2014 and him \u2014 a week to deliberate.\u201cHe could have possibly tried to get a traveling assignment there,\u201d Ms. Schweitzer said. \u201cBut it just didn\u2019t seem fair to ask him to uproot his life so that I could launch back into a crazy schedule, working long hours, traveling all the time and living in a tiny, temporary apartment.\u201dSo she did, and backed out of the Kentucky job. Before long she found a job with the Texas Civil Rights Project, where she is now the fund-raising director.She and Mr. Garza were married April 2 at the Red Corral Ranch, in the Hill Country near Wimberley, Tex., where cellphone service is nonexistent and a collection of peacocks intermittently squawked, providing comic relief.During the ceremony, held outside on a peerless Saturday afternoon under oak trees dotted with dream catchers, and with about 150 guests looking on, the couple performed an earth, air, fire, water processional during which they combined soils from Ms. Schweitzer\u2019s two family farms and Mr. Garza\u2019s Little League baseball field.Bill Ogilvie, a dancing acquaintance who is also a Universal Life minister, talked about openness and humility as virtues that bring dancing partners together. After the ceremony, Mr. Ogilvie revealed, \u201cJP was a ladies\u2019 man until he met Stephanie. He used to have four or five women lined up to dance with him.\u201dThe reception was a re-creation of the night they first met: Guests danced to live music by the Love Leighs and Soul Supporters and ate from a wedding cake depicting the White Horse\u2019s red-and-black-tiled dance floor.The bridesmaids, almost exclusively New Yorkers, expressed amazement over Ms. Schweitzer. One said, \u201cShe said she\u2019d never live more than five blocks from Bergdorf\u2019s.\u201d Another said, \u201cPrada, Escada, Miu Miu \u2014 she had it all.\u201dWhen it was time for Ms. Schweitzer\u2019s maid of honor, Staci Jacobs, to give a toast, she brought it all back to \u201cSex and the City.\u201d After all, Ms. Schweitzer still has a place on the Upper West Side and Mr. Garza seems to increasingly like visiting the city. Quoting Carrie Bradshaw, Ms. Jacobs said, \u201cI am someone who is looking for love. Real love. Ridiculous, inconvenient, consuming, can\u2019t-live-without-each-other love.\u201d And then she said, \u201cAnd it\u2019s here in this city, on this ranch, in this room.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The move caught many by surprise as Europe faces growing pressure from Islamist terrorism and as the chancellor looks ahead to a general election next year.Peter Altmaier, Ms. Merkel\u2019s chief of staff, said the decision to replace the spy chief, Gerhard Schindler, was a response to the challenges the intelligence agency faced, including new security threats and reforms being considered by a parliamentary oversight committee.It also came to light last year that German agents had spied on domestic and European companies, further fueling outrage among Germans.Germany and the United States have clashed repeatedly over spying, but Mr. Schindler had managed to weather the uproar set off by each revelation.Wednesday\u2019s announcement thus came as a surprise to many, even within Ms. Merkel\u2019s party.\u201cI am shocked,\u201d Stephan Mayer, a member of the chancellor\u2019s Christian Democrats, told ARD, a public broadcaster.Ms. Merkel has sought to mend her country\u2019s differences with Washington over intelligence gathering, but many Germans still believe that she has not done enough.

{"Headline": "Volodymyr Groysman Approved as New Prime Minister by Ukraine\u2019s Parliament", "Date": "2016-04-14", "News": "Supported byMOSCOW \u2014 In Ukraine\u2019s most sweeping political reshuffle since its revolution two years ago, Parliament voted Thursday to seat a close ally of the president as prime minister and handed critical ministerial posts to presidential staff members.The previous government was swept into power in 2014 on a wave of popular anger at the authoritarian, corrupt and Russian-aligned presidency of Viktor F. Yanukovych. But infighting soon broke out among the victors, paralyzing the government and stalling International Monetary Fund aid for an economy on life support.Western countries \u2014 including the United States, which has increased military deployments in Eastern Europe along the western borders of Russia \u2014 have much at stake in Ukraine and are eager to prop up the country as a bulwark against Russian expansion. But the sharp-elbowed political fighting in Kiev and the failure to address deep-seated corruption that reaches the highest levels of the government are undermining those efforts.The initial signs for Mr. Groysman\u2019s government were not promising, as some pro-European lawmakers complained that it was concentrating evermore control in Ukraine\u2019s business and political clans, which in the past has been an invitation to large-scale corruption.\u201cWe are afraid there will be a monopolization of power,\u201d Alex Ryabchyn, a member of Parliament in the Fatherland party of a former prime minister, Yulia V. Tymoshenko, said in a telephone interview. The Fatherland party did not back Mr. Groysman for premier.With the vote, three of the five parties that favor closer ties with Europe are now in open opposition to Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s government; two other pro-European parties backed the candidacy.Oleksandr Danylyuk, the deputy head of Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s administration, was named minister of finance, replacing the American-born finance minister, Natalia Yaresko, who oversaw the bailout negotiations with the International Monetary Fund and foreign creditors.Parliament elected as its new speaker Andriy Parubiy, an organizer of antigovernment street fighters during the 2014 uprising and a highly polarizing figure in Ukraine\u2019s east-west divide.Mr. Groysman, who at 38 will become Ukraine\u2019s youngest prime minister ever, is widely seen as beholden to Mr. Poroshenko. Before moving to Kiev after the 2014 revolution and winning a seat in Parliament as a member of Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s party, he had served as mayor of Vinnytsya, a city intertwined in the business empire of Mr. Poroshenko, a confectionary magnate. A charity fund of Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s business, for example, cooperated with the city government in 2011 to build a new fountain there.The vote for Mr. Groysman was 257 to 50, a wide victory that could help him navigate Ukraine\u2019s complex political waters with more success than his predecessor. But analysts say they doubt he has the political backing, even from the two parties that openly support him, to carry out a badly needed economic overhaul and a peace agreement with Russia and Russian-backed militants in eastern Ukraine, as demanded by the country\u2019s Western allies.The peace agreement, known as Minsk II, is being held up by a small but important party that is dead set against changing the Constitution to grant the separatist areas of eastern Ukraine the degree of autonomy called for in the accord.Opponents of Mr. Groysman, who served previously as speaker of Parliament, greeted his election with shouts of \u201cShame! Shame!\u201d He seemed to take that in stride, saying in his acceptance speech, \u201cAll these discussions in this hall will go down in history as just words.\u201d He added, \u201cThe shame is on those who in 24 years haven\u2019t given the people a good life.\u201dMr. Groysman said tackling corruption, opposing populism and improving state management would take priority in his government, despite the simmering conflict in the country\u2019s east.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Crusader in the Coal Mine, Taking On President Obama", "Date": "2016-04-30", "News": "The energy tycoon Robert Murray has fought the president all the way to the Supreme Court with a message: To keep America strong, keep mining coal.Supported byST. CLAIRSVILLE, Ohio \u2014 The rolling hills of eastern Ohio show few signs of the frenzied activity unfolding hundreds of feet underground. Inside the Powhatan No. 6 mine, a machine the size of a city bus is slowly slicing the earth, scraping out coal and sending it on a 40-minute ride to the surface.\u201cIt will see the light of day for the first time in 200 million years,\u201d says Robert E. Murray, the 76-year-old chairman of the Murray Energy Corporation, rolling toward the coalface, where the coal is cut out of the rock, in an electric cart.The digging occurs at the distant end of a forbidding maze of tunnels stretching more than 16 miles into the earth. The walls are coated with \u201crock dust,\u201d or pulverized limestone, which acts as a fire retardant and gives the place a chalky, ethereal appearance. It is mostly silent but for the occasional whoosh of air venting from above.This is a special place for Mr. Murray, who likes to tell the story of how he sold his children\u2019s toys and mortgaged his home to acquire this mine \u2014 his first \u2014 nearly 30 years ago. He went on to build the nation\u2019s largest independent coal producer by pioneering efficient new technologies like longwall mining, where the cavern ultimately collapses in on itself after yielding considerably more coal than traditional underground mining methods.The expansion of its mining business at a time of deep industry disillusionment, coupled with an activist agenda, has made Murray Energy one of the leading forces combating environmental regulations. And it has made Mr. Murray a galvanizing champion of a once dominant industry fallen on hard times.For him, any attempt to regulate pollution from power plants is a plot not only to destroy coal producers in the United States but also to take control of the nation\u2019s electrical supply. He blames regulators in Washington intent on accumulating power and handpicking winners and losers. \u201cWhat it is is a political power grab of America\u2019s power grid to change our country in a diabolical, if not evil, way,\u201d he says. \u201cThank you, Obama!\u201dAs the nation struggles to come to terms with greenhouse gas emissions, climate change and mining\u2019s environmental toll, Mr. Murray stands at the center of the economic, social and political debate. His life goal is to see that coal production in America remains vibrant \u2014 even as his critics say he is waging a doomed, rear-guard battle against inevitability.Electricity from fossil fuels, including coal, remains the single biggest contributor to global carbon emissions, which scientists blame for rising temperatures.The business faces challenges from not only toughening environmental standards but also cheap natural gas resulting from the practice of hydraulic fracturing, or \u201cfracking\u201d \u2014 breaking up the bedrock to extract more oil and gas. This year, for the first time, natural gas is expected to pass coal as the main source of fuel for power plants.If Mr. Murray helped remake the modern American coal industry, then coal made the man. He started mining at age 16, a few years after a mining accident left his father paralyzed. His own neck has been broken three times. Over the years, his technological expertise has helped keep mines working that might otherwise have been shuttered long ago.On this day, Mr. Murray descended into the Powhatan No. 6 mine for what would probably be his last visit. The mine will close in November when it comes to the end of its productive life after nearly a half-century in operation. Most of the 431 miners are likely to be laid off.\u201cThis is a human issue for me,\u201d Mr. Murray says. \u201cIt kills me. Lives are being destroyed deliberately by some and by the ignorance of most.\u201dMoving deeper into the mine, he passes a pair of men drilling into the ceiling. \u201cWe appreciate your work,\u201d he tells them.Despite the obstacles, Mr. Murray is doubling down. In 2013, his company acquired the coal business of Consol Energy for $3 billion, nearly doubling its mines with the addition of five more. Last year, it bought a stake in Foresight Energy in a $1.37 billion transaction. Murray Energy now has the capacity to produce about 10 percent of the nation\u2019s coal.\u201cThe coal industry is being destroyed,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s scary to me because electricity is a staple of life \u2014 like potatoes were to the Irish. And Obama has largely destroyed reliable, low-cost, affordable electricity in America.\u201dThe day was taking its toll on Mr. Murray, who had been up since 5 a.m. and had flown by helicopter to a meeting in Akron with one of his biggest customers, the FirstEnergy Corporation. That meeting, which lasted six and a half hours, had not gone well. The sides could not agree on a new price for coal, with the power utility demanding more concessions from its supplier.The walls of Murray Energy\u2019s corporate offices are lined with mementos and pictures, and his own office is decked with small military plane models. Nearby stands a recent Christmas gift from a customer: a life-size statue of Mr. Murray, wearing a Scottish kilt in the Clan Murray tartan.Coal mining runs in the family. Mr. Murray is a fourth-generation miner, and his three sons all work for the company. His father was paralyzed from the neck down after falling in a stairway in 1948, when Mr. Murray was 9 years old.Those were tough days, he says, chicken dinner once a week. \u201cWe never bought fish,\u201d he says. \u201cToo expensive.\u201dHe spent 16 years working underground, earning a degree in mining engineering along the way, and rising through the ranks of the North American Coal Corporation. He helped develop new mines in Ohio and North Dakota, among other places, and broke his neck in mining accidents in 1963 and 1969 (and in a car accident in 1987). By 1983, had become the company\u2019s chief executive.He was fired in 1987 over a disagreement with the board on dissolving and reincorporating the company in Delaware. Mr. Murray says the move was designed to shed employee benefits, and he refused to go along.Within a year, with the backing of a local utility, the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company, now called the FirstEnergy Corporation, he secured financing to buy the Powhatan No. 6 mine. He knew it was not being used to its full potential. And he had some ideas for fixing that.One of the biggest expenses in mining, aside from getting the coal out of the ground, is transportation. Here, Mr. Murray took a novel approach.On a map, he drew circles around power plants located near rivers \u2014 cheap transportation \u2014 then went shopping for mines nearby. Despite new environmental regulations on the horizon, he knew that even low-quality, high-sulfur coal could still be mined, provided that plants were equipped with scrubbers. He snapped up mines for a song.Then, his masterstroke: longwall mining, which he helped perfect.In traditional mining, individual \u201crooms\u201d are cut into a coal seam and then supported by pillars to prevent a collapse. The result is that a lot of coal is left behind in the walls between the various rooms.Longwall mining, on the other hand, extracts almost every last bit of coal.It works like this: First, miners cut two parallel tunnels, often miles long, along either edge of the coal seam. After that, the longwall machine \u2014 a $350 million articulated piece of equipment equipped with a giant power drill \u2014 simply moves back and forth between the two tunnels, cutting off the coal face in three-foot slivers, like a giant salami slicer.As the machine completes a pass, the excavated parts of the mine collapse. It\u2019s more efficient and, Mr. Murray argues, safer.The longwall machine can produce about 25,000 tons daily, a significant improvement on traditional underground methods, which typically produce up to 2,000 tons of coal a day in a section. Today, Murray operates 17 of the 40 longwall mines in the nation.\u201cHe\u2019s been pretty darn successful at it,\u201d says Bob Hodge, a coal expert at IHS Energy, a consulting firm. \u201cAnd he answers only to Bob Murray.\u201dOne reason is fracking, which has pushed down gas prices. The other major coal killer is the adoption by the Obama administration of more stringent standards to regulate carbon emissions and other pollutants that contribute to climate change or are harmful to human health.These regulations have prompted utilities in recent years to shut more than 400 coal-fired plants that could not comply with the new rules or would be too costly to upgrade with pollution controls. Coal plants retired last year equaled the entire coal capacity of Britain, according to the Sierra Club.The impact on mining has been swift. Coal production in the United States peaked in 2008 at 1.17 billion tons. It has since fallen 24 percent to its lowest level in 30 years.More than 40 producers have filed for bankruptcy protection in recent years, including some of the biggest. \u201cThe situation for coal in the United States is about as bad as it has ever been in modern history, and maybe even beyond that,\u201d says Mark Levin, an analyst with BB&T Capital Markets. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re done.\u201dThis is taking a toll on mine workers, whose numbers have shrunk by 19 percent in the last three years, to about 75,000. A typical miner earns $83,700 a year, according to the National Mining Association. For a laid-off worker with only a high school diploma, if that, that kind of pay is nearly impossible to find.\u201cWe\u2019re getting shelled,\u201d says Ryan Murray, the youngest of Mr. Murray\u2019s three sons and the company\u2019s director of operations. \u201cWe have to fight back out of necessity.\u201dThe company has opposed the Obama administration over a variety of new regulationsOne, known as the Stream Protection Rule, was proposed to limit surface mining near waterways. Mr. Murray argues that it would effectively condemn longwall operations as well by prohibiting underground mining under vast tracts of land. The company filed 14,000 pages of comments opposing the rule, which is still under consideration.But the celebration was short-lived for coal producers. While the case was wending through the courts, utilities did not wait for a legal resolution. Those most affected shut plants that wouldn\u2019t meet the regulations.A bigger battle still is taking place over the Clean Power Plan, a cornerstone of the Obama administration\u2019s international commitment to cut carbon emissions. The plan would, by the year 2030, reduce carbon emission from power plants by 32 percent from 2005 levels. It was a major part of the administration\u2019s pledge to reduce carbon emissions made at the international Paris Climate Conference, in December.The power plant rule leaves it up to each state to find ways to reduce emissions by shifting away from coal to cleaner energy sources, including renewable energy and natural gas. Murray filed an early challenge to the draft rules, and 29 mostly Republican-led states and other coal producers eventually joined.Their challenge argues that the E.P.A. does not have the power under the Clean Air Act to regulate carbon emissions and that the rules violate state sovereignty and state power to regulate local utilities.In February, the Supreme Court temporarily blocked the administration\u2019s initiative, dealing an early blow to the policy, though it did not rule on the merits of the case. Also, the ruling was issued by a court divided along ideological lines.The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is expected to hear oral arguments on the legality of the regulation in June. Ultimately, both sides are expected to appeal to the Supreme Court if they lose. This time, the parties could face a court evenly split between its left-leaning and right-leaning factions since the death of the conservative justice Antonin Scalia.The day after his coal-mine visit, Mr. Murray delivered a lecture at West Liberty University, a small public college in nearby West Virginia. There, about 150 students packed a hall to earn extra credit for their business class.Mr. Murray came with a five-page speech titled \u201cThe Ongoing Destruction of a Major American Industry,\u201d which, among other things, described the \u201cregal, outlaw Obama administration.\u201d But once he reached the lectern, the speech was forgotten. Instead, Mr. Murray spoke extemporaneously.He warned the students about government bureaucrats (\u201cThey are rejects compared with people in the private sector\u201d); about Bernie Sanders (\u201cThe problem with socialists is that they eventually run out of other people\u2019s money,\u201d paraphrasing Margaret Thatcher); about the leading Republican presidential candidate (\u201cI\u2019m not sure about Donald Trump\u201d); and about Ivy League schools (\u201cThese schools are lousy\u201d).He announced that he was organizing a fund-raiser for Ted Cruz, though he pointed out that he was not endorsing him.\u201cThis global warming hoax,\u201d Mr. Murray told the students, \u201cit\u2019s a movement that is destroying America.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It comes after a number of bankruptcy filings over the last two years by other coal companies, including industry giants like Arch Coal, Patriot Coal, Walter Energy and Alpha Natural Resources.\u201cThis was a difficult decision, but it is the right path forward for Peabody,\u201d Glenn Kellow, the company\u2019s president and chief executive, said in a statement. \u201cThis process enables us to strengthen liquidity and reduce debt, build upon the significant operational achievements we\u2019ve made in recent years, and lay the foundation for long-term stability and success in the future.\u201dThe collapse in natural gas prices over the last three years and new environmental regulations by the Obama administration have led to a rapid decline of the industry, especially in the Appalachia region, where mines are deep and expensive to operate. Domestic production last year slumped to a three-decade low.Coal was once the provider of roughly half of the nation\u2019s power, but it was surpassed by natural gas as the No. 1 source of electricity for the first time a year ago.But many analysts say the bankruptcy filings do not mean the coal industry will disappear. Under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection laws, the companies have been exchanging debt to lenders for equity in the company, known in financial parlance as a debt-for-equity swap.Most energy experts say coal will probably provide as much as a third of the nation\u2019s power for years to come. They point out that several European and Asian countries continue to rely on coal for electricity, even as they try to turn more to renewable power sources like wind and solar.Peabody still produces coal for customers in 25 countries on six continents.\u201cIt\u2019s a very mixed picture,\u201d said Daniel Yergin, the energy historian and vice chairman of IHS, the energy consulting firm. \u201cCoal plants in the U.S. will continue to retire, but coal will continue to be part of electricity generation in the United States.\u201dHe added, \u201cChina\u2019s plans, even with its renewables push, still show a rise in coal consumption.\u201dBut expectations for growing Asian economies proved to be unrealistic. Growth in steel production in China was disappointing as the country began to shift its economy from exports toward more domestic consumption. At the same time, India is expanding its railroad system to connect its own coal fields to domestic industry.Now, with the industry in near free fall, many banks are pulling away from financing coal projects. Utilities are closing aging coal-fired power plants rather than upgrade them to meet new environmental standards, in large part because the glut of natural gas has offered a cheaper alternative.While filing for protection for its American assets in Federal Bankruptcy Court in the Eastern District of Missouri, Peabody disclosed that it has had problems selling holdings in Colorado and New Mexico. Peabody\u2019s last best hope to avert bankruptcy was its attempt to sell three mines to Bowie Resource Partners, but that company has had trouble raising the full $650 million in debt to acquire them.Not surprisingly, environmentalists who have been leading an effort to persuade investors and banks to divest from coal cheered the new bankruptcy.Peabody is cutting its payroll and otherwise curbing costs. Late last month, it cut 235 hourly and salaried employees from its North Antelope Rochelle mine in the Powder River Basin, roughly 15 percent of the mine\u2019s work force.Shares of the company have sold for around $2 in recent days after plunging in value by 99 percent since its high in 2008 just before the financial crisis.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Senate Takes Steps to Tighten Airport Security", "Date": "2016-04-07", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate passed several provisions to bolster security throughout the nation\u2019s transportation system Thursday, the first legislative response to the attacks on the airport and train station in Belgium last month.The measures, which are expected to pass as early as next week, are attached to a large-scale bill to reauthorize funding for the Federal Aviation Administration.The measures strengthen airport employee vetting, increase the use of teams that conduct covert operations to test security systems and could double the number of visible special security teams that are used to deter threats.They also enhance security around airport perimeters, fund law enforcement training for dealing with active shooters and require the Transportation Security Administration to review potential insider threats posed by employees. Some experts believe a recent attack on a Russian flight leaving Egypt had help from an aviation worker.The government would also expand the T.S.A. PreCheck program, which lawmaker said would both decrease wait times for passengers and give agents better opportunities to screen other passengers.Added to the broader bipartisan bill, which gives the Federal Aviation Administration new mandates to increase cybersecurity protections and a review of cockpit barriers, the overall bill broadly addresses the fears \u2014 if not the vast majority of infuriating inconveniences \u2014 of the American flying public.\u201cEvents around the world and security lapses at U.S. airports necessitate new protections for the traveling public,\u201d said Senator John Thune, a South Dakota Republican and the chairman of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. \u201cKeeping Americans safe from future attacks is a top priority in this Senate.\u201dThe bombings at the Brussels airport and at a subway station last month killed scores of travelers and injured hundreds of others, inciting nations around the world to enhance security measures at travel hubs.\u201cThe security of passengers and crew remains our highest priority,\u201d said Vaughn Jennings, a managing director at Airline for America, a trade organization representing airline companies. \u201cWe are in the safest period in aviation history due to the ongoing and strong collaboration among the airlines, airports, labor, manufacturers and government.\u201dThe Senate reauthorization bill, which would finance the F.A.A. through September 2017, also contains a number of provisions to help consumers, though far fewer than Democrats and consumer groups craved.For instance, the bill requires airlines to provide families with information about the availability of seats together at the time of booking, create a standard method for disclosing its fees on baggage and seat selection and to return baggage fees when luggage is lost or delayed.There is also a provision that would require an airline to make an automatic refund to passengers who did not receive benefits they paid for, like a preferred seat or early boarding. Passengers would also have a right to a review of whether airlines fairly attribute delays or cancellations to weather when there may be other factors involved.But a measure desperately sought by travelers\u2019 groups \u2014 one that would have forced airlines to stop the legroom shrink in seats and advertise current legroom on their websites \u2014 went down, even after its author, Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, gave an impassioned speech in its favor on the Senate floor and lobbied tall senators to support it.\u201cMoms with kids have a lot of trouble in these very narrow seats,\u201d he said, also mentioning the middle seat dilemma of being wedged between two large people. The industry opposed it, as did tall Republicans, and so the measure failed, 42 to 54.\u201cI don\u2019t think that we ought to be regulating people,\u201d said Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama, who stands over six feet tall and was the subject of Mr. Schumer\u2019s pleas. Though he added wistfully, \u201cI like how it would benefit me.\u201dThe bill also maintains special funding for airports in rural areas, known as the Essential Air Service Program and the Small Community Air Service Development Program, which some conservative senators have railed against as a needless giveaway.One House measure never made it to the floor after leaders scrapped it because it included a provision to privatize the nation\u2019s air traffic control system. \u201cThere is no basis for the chatter coming from some in the House that hearts and minds are going to be changed down here on air traffic control privatization,\u201d said Senator Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat. \u201cNot gonna happen.\u201dShould the Senate bill pass this month, the House will have to decide whether to simply take it up, pass it and send it to Mr. Obama to sign or try and create its own version.\u201cThe F.A.A. reauthorization act has been a bipartisan effort from the very start,\u201d said Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, who has been eager to get bipartisan bills passed on the floor this spring.Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, agreed but used the bill\u2019s momentum to draw contrasts between the parties.

{"Headline": "Lower Growth Expectations Cloud World Finance Leaders\u2019 Forum", "Date": "2016-04-12", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The world\u2019s finance ministers opened their annual spring meeting here on Tuesday facing dampened expectations for global growth and warnings about financial risks and political movements toward nationalism and protectionism \u2014 in the United States and abroad.As the six-day gathering of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank began, the fund\u2019s global growth forecast for 2016 was more disappointing than worrisome: a modest 3.2 percent expansion much like last year, but 0.2 percentage points lower than projected in January.The report of the 188-country I.M.F. on the sluggish recovery from the 2008 recession did forecast a stronger recovery in 2017, but officials emphasized that global risks could thwart that. Among them were noneconomic risks, including terrorist attacks, waves of refugees and rising nationalism, as well as the impact of economic inequality.\u201cIn many countries, the lack of wage growth and greater inequality have created widespread senses that economic growth has mainly been to the benefit of economic elites,\u201d Maurice Obstfeld, economic counselor to the I.M.F., told reporters in outlining the latest World Economic Outlook.\u201cLower growth reinforces this trend turn toward inward-looking, nationalistic attitudes,\u201d he added, before echoing a remark by Christine Lagarde, the I.M.F.\u2019s managing director, in a speech last week in Frankfurt previewing the meeting, \u201cWe are on alert, not alarm.\u201dThe strength of the United States economy, the world\u2019s largest, is the bright spot, said the I.M.F. and the American contingent, led by Jacob J. Lew, the Treasury secretary. But the I.M.F. downgraded its forecast of American growth this year by 0.2 percentage points, to 2.4 percent from 2.6 percent.Even that growth is vulnerable to headwinds from elsewhere \u2014 a slowdown in China, downturns in Brazil and Russia, tightening in other emerging economies, a fraying European Union threatened by the refugee crisis and potential departure of Britain, and the effect, especially in the Middle East and Africa, of low prices for oil and other commodities.The I.M.F. now projects Brazil\u2019s economy to shrink 3.8 percent. Its estimates for Japanese growth were cut in half, to 0.5 percent.Mr. Obstfeld cited two factors impeding growth in the United States: the decline of energy investment and a strong dollar that, despite recent weakening, has hurt manufacturers and other exporters, raising the cost of their goods relative to competitors\u2019.\u201cPerhaps what is more surprising is how robust the performance of the economy has been given these two major headwinds,\u201d he said.The assemblage of the I.M.F. and World Bank, two of the foremost international organizations created after World War II, is occurring as those economic, trade and security forums have been assailed in the American presidential contest, chiefly by Donald J. Trump, the Republican front-runner, who repeatedly contends Americans are being \u201cripped off,\u201d and to a lesser extent by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in the Democratic nominating race.Against that backdrop, Mr. Lew began this week with a public-relations counteroffensive. In a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations, an essay in its Foreign Affairs magazine, and in interviews, he underscored the importance of the United States\u2019 continued leadership in institutions like the I.M.F. to advance its economic and national security interests and those of its allies.\u201cInternational economic cooperation has delivered benefits to the United States and other countries that would have been impossible to attain otherwise,\u201d Mr. Lew wrote. \u201cA major reason that the global financial crisis that began in late 2007 never turned into a second Great Depression is that the United States and other countries coordinated their efforts through the I.M.F. and the G-20,\u201d the group of top industrial nations, avoiding protectionism and starting simultaneous economic stimulus programs.For signs that the United States would continue to lead, Mr. Lew cited the Obama administration\u2019s success in the last year in winning the approval of the Republican-led Congress for legislation empowering the president to negotiate free-trade agreements, specifically the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership deal; reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank; tightening trade and customs enforcement; and, not least, ratifying an overhaul of the I.M.F. that doubled its resources and increased the influence of emerging powers like China and India.Yet that I.M.F. measure took five years to get through Congress, as Mr. Lew acknowledged, while the other bills also were tough to pass.\u201cMaking the case for sustained U.S. leadership is not always easy,\u201d Mr. Lew wrote. \u201cUnilateralism or isolationism often make for better sound bites.\u201dSimilarly, Ms. Lagarde, in her address last week, alluded to the appeal of populist critiques of internationalism.\u201cIt is no wonder that perceptions abound that the cards are stacked against the common man, and woman, in favor of elites,\u201d she said, also not naming politicians. \u201cThese frustrations are leading people to question established institutions and international norms. To some, the answer is to look inward, to somehow unwind these linkages, to close borders and retreat into protectionism.\u201d\u201cAs history has told us, time and again, this would be a tragic course,\u201d she added.Ms. Lagarde called on the United States to increase its work force by raising the federal minimum wage, strengthening \u201cfamily friendly\u201d benefits and expanding the earned-income tax credit for low-wage workers.Mr. Lew advised the I.M.F. to do more to call out countries that manipulate currency to underprice exports, run up trade surpluses and keep their finances opaque.Because of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about the start of meetings between the International Monetary Fund and World Bank misstated the percent to which the I.M.F. downgraded its forecast of American growth this year. It was downgraded to 2.4 percent from 2.6 percent \u2014 not to 1.9 percent from 2.1 percent.Advertisement"}

After a string of dismal to lackluster years, the job outlook brightened considerably for the class of 2015. And despite uncertainty about the strength of the economy, recruiters, on-campus career specialists and economists remain generally upbeat about prospects for this year\u2019s graduates.Of course, applicants\u2019 experiences will vary, perhaps significantly, depending on their field of study and position sought.In contrast, anthropology, geography and mass media majors faced jobless rates upward of 8 percent. Liberal arts majors, whose studies emphasize critical thinking, communication and creativity, were nestled in between, at 5.8 percent.\u201cThe occupation-specific majors tend to do much better,\u201d said Jaison Abel, head of regional analysis at the New York Fed who conducted the analysis with Richard Deitz, senior economist there. \u201cEven within business, the more specific majors \u2014 accounting or finance \u2014 tend to do much better than those with a general major.\u201dJob conditions appear grimmer when viewed through the lens of another metric: the share of recent graduates (age 22 to 27 with bachelor\u2019s degree or higher) working in jobs that do not require degrees. That number hovered at 44 percent at the end of September, high by historical standards, according to the analysis. The low was about 38 percent in 2000.But this phenomenon, called underemployment, may not be unusual. The two economists point out that, through good and poor economic times, roughly one-third of all graduates occupy jobs that don\u2019t require a bachelor\u2019s degree. And even during the depths of the recession, new graduates had an advantage: Most weren\u2019t cashiers and baristas. They held higher-paying positions in areas like office and administrative support.What we\u2019re seeing, Dr. Abel said, are \u201cfairly typical trends of transitioning from college to the job market,\u201d and many who start careers in a low-skilled service job transition to a better job after gaining experience in the labor market.Paychecks have also edged higher. The median wage for recent graduates with only a bachelor\u2019s degree was $43,000 in 2015, up from $40,000 in 2014, according to the New York Fed report. (Individuals with only a high-school diploma had a median wage of $25,000 in 2015.)Meanwhile, the mood on campuses is encouraging. At Wake Forest University in North Carolina, the number of employers participating in on-campus recruiting events is holding steady with 2015, when attendees rose 33 percent compared to 2014.And at Rutgers University in New Jersey, nearly 300 employers attended its February career fair, about as many as its venues can handle. \u201cIf these 290 employers weren\u2019t in a hiring posture,\u201d said Rick Hearin, executive director of career services at Rutgers, \u201cthey wouldn\u2019t invest their time and money to come to New Brunswick to recruit our students.\u201dTara Siegel Bernard is a personal finance reporter for The Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Aid Groups Aim to Put Mental Health on World Agenda", "Date": "2016-04-12", "News": "Supported byGood mental health care is scarce in many parts of the United States, but it is nonexistent in most of the world. In developing countries, the ratio of mental health professionals to citizens is about one in a million \u2014 and that vast majority of people with treatable conditions like anxiety and depression are left to their own devices, or to the ministrations of local folk healers.This week, the World Bank and the World Health Organization are convening hundreds of doctors, aid groups and government officials to start an ambitious effort to move mental health to the forefront of the international development agenda.The conference in Washington coincides with the publication on Tuesday of the first global estimate of potential returns on investing in treatment programs for depression and anxiety, the most common mental disorders, which are now epidemic in conflict zones and refugee communities.\u201cAbout 30 percent of total disability costs are due to mental health disorders \u2014 this is huge number,\u201d said Dr. Shekhar Saxena, director of the mental health and substance abuse department at the World Health Organization and one of the study\u2019s co-authors.An expert not involved in the research said the analysis used state-of-the-art methods and was persuasive, given how little is known about interventions in developing countries in particular.Dr. Johansson added, however, that because there were \u201cfew health economic evaluations of this kind available,\u201d it was difficult to compare the expected returns on investment in other types of prevention and treatment programs.Mental health has traditionally languished near the bottom of the international health agenda, as well as nations\u2019 health spending. But international aid groups have sponsored dozens of interventions for anxiety and depression in developing countries: for example, training mental health workers in Liberia in the wake of the Ebola outbreak and the civil war there; and setting up screening and treatment services for women in Rwanda victimized by sexual or gender-based abuse.In the analysis, the research team used a standardized tool called OneHealth to calculate treatment costs and outcomes in the 36 countries from 2016 to 2030.Assuming a 5 percent improvement in health and restored productivity, the research team calculated that an investment of $147 billion in treatment for these common mood disorders would result in some $400 billion in returns, said Dan Chisholm a health economist at W.H.O. and another co-author of the study.Advertisement"}

Despite its genre, she said, the new movie is actually very personal.\u201cIt\u2019s not personal in terms of plot,\u201d she explained, \u201cbut the tone is personal: the gait of the film, the way it walks through the world.

A kind of goofiness that goes with a certain kind of intelligence \u2014 I guess you could call it stupidity \u2014 is definitely one of my traits.\u201dThe movie was partly inspired by her move, five years ago, back to New York from Ireland, where she had been living with her husband, the actor Daniel Day-Lewis, and their children. \u201cI fell in love with the city all over again \u2014 just being here,\u201d she said, \u201cand I wanted to make something that reflected that excitement.\u201dThe movie\u2019s premise \u2014 a young woman who wants to arrange her own pregnancy with minimal male involvement \u2014 came from an as yet unpublished book by her friend Karen Rinaldi, a novelist and book editor, that touched on some issues she had already been thinking about. \u201cLife is very complicated now,\u201d she said. \u201cThe rule book has been thrown out the window.

They were continuous loops and depicted things like a double-headed construction crane dunking two naked women into tubs of milk.The notion that you could make movies with sound and that people could watch in a theater came to her later, and her earliest efforts were financed in part with money she made during a brief acting career. It started as a lark, she explained, when she tried out for the Mike Nichols movie \u201cRegarding Henry\u201d (1991) and wound up getting a part. \u201cI ended up having this strange trajectory of a five-year acting career where I worked with all these wonderful directors and really learned my trade from them,\u201d she said. \u201cMike Nichols and Carroll Ballard and Paul Mazursky and Peter Brook and Al Pakula: I worked with giants on some of their worst films.\u201d She laughed. \u201cBut I learned a huge amount.\u201dEven with her connections, though, breaking into movies \u2014 real movies, with beginnings, middles and ends \u2014 was a struggle. \u201cI got no support,\u201d she said of her experience with agents and studio executives. \u201cA young woman comes along and says I\u2019d like to be a director, and they hear a sort of squeaking: eeeh, eeeh, eeeh.\u201d But she added: \u201cThe kinds of movies I was making, quite frankly, whether I was male or female, it would have been hard. I wasn\u2019t trying to cater to an audience. I was making films with the spirit of a poet. I was making what I wanted to make in a spirit of just na\u00efvet\u00e9 and bloody-mindedness.\u201dRachel Horovitz, who produced \u201cMaggie\u2019s Plan,\u201d said recently that she and Ms. Miller developed the script together and that as far as she knew this was the first time Ms. Miller had worked this way. \u201cI remember when we first sat down in 2012,\u201d she recalled, \u201cand I said I wanted to make a Rebecca Miller film for a wider audience. I knew she had it in her \u2014 her eye, her comedic style of writing.\u201d\u201cRebecca is at once incredibly flexible and very decisive \u2014 a rare combination,\u201d Ms. Moore said. \u201cShe\u2019ll let you play around and try things, but she\u2019s also very confident and sure of what she wants.\u201dMs. Miller said that in her final draft she will often alter a screenplay to suit the actors. \u201cTo a degree, I like actors to be advocates for their characters. I actually altered the ending slightly because of something Ethan said. It\u2019s not so much that they have writing solutions, but they often have questions that lead to writing solutions.\u201dMs. Gerwig said: \u201cSometimes working on a project you experience a kind of mind-meld, saying the same thing at the exact same time. I had that with Rebecca. She also has a real point of view, which is something I always look for \u2014 something that only that person can express. Rebecca has that in spades.\u201dMs. Miller, who got into novel writing in part because of her frustration at not being able to make the films she wanted, finished one, \u201cJacob\u2019s Folly\u201d (published in 2013), just before beginning to think about \u201cMaggie\u2019s Plan,\u201d and said the experience had left her spent. By contrast, the movie felt liberating \u2014 a sort of screwball move on her own part.\u201cNot that it\u2019s easy to write a screenplay,\u201d she said. \u201cBut a screenplay is a blueprint, signs for an actor you\u2019re going to work with. In a novel every sentence is only that, a sentence. You have to be very complete of mind. If I was only a novelist and went from one novel to another, I think I\u2019d be crazy. I\u2019m not kidding. Films have their own insanity, but it\u2019s a different kind of insanity, and the fact that you share it with other people makes it bearable.\u201dTwo picture captions last Sunday with an article about the film director Rebecca Miller, using information from a publicist, carried credits that misspelled the photographer\u2019s given name.

Before each performance, the show\u2019s \u201cpie consultant,\u201d Stacy Donnelly, delivers an uncooked nine-inch double-crust apple pie; 20 minutes before the doors open, a theater staffer puts it in the oven, allowing it to cook slowly through the show. The odor wafts into the back of the orchestra whenever the doors are ajar, particularly just before the first act and during intermission; its intensity varies based on the air flow.But finding the right pie to scent the theater turned out to be tricky.Ultimately, Ms. Donnelly wound up cutting out lemon juice, a standard ingredient, which she deduced was sealing in apple juices that she needed to leak out, and spiking the pies with high doses of cinnamon and nutmeg, which are especially fragrant. The pies, made with Granny Smith apples, are cooked at about 325 to 350 degrees so they can continue to bake for about 90 minutes without burning.\u201cIt\u2019s not meant to be consumed,\u201d Ms. Donnelly said. \u201cBut the poor crew wants to eat it every time \u2014 they say, \u2018It doesn\u2019t taste right, but we can\u2019t stop.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

Stern to convert the building, a 37-story office tower between 55th and 56th Streets that was most recently inhabited by Sony, to apartments. An international hotel group said it would build a five-star hotel on eight floors, and Mr. Chetrit filed plans to create a triplex penthouse with a marble staircase and a record $150 million price tag.Now, in the latest example of the slowdown at real estate\u2019s highest end, Mr. Chetrit signed a deal this week to sell the tower for $1.4 billion to the Olayan Group, which is controlled by a Saudi family, and Chelsfield, which manages its properties. The companies said the building would become, yes, an office building.Mr. Chetrit and his partner, David Bistricer, were under pressure to pay off short-term loans on the property totaling $925 million. They also had trouble obtaining a construction loan as lenders became wary of projects promising oversize prices and profits.Mr. Bistricer said he and Mr. Chetrit were prohibited from talking about the deal until the sale closed at the end of May.\u201cIt was providential,\u201d said Nancy Packes, a consultant for luxury residential projects, that Mr. Chetrit was able to find a cash-rich buyer for the building. Over the past three years, she said, the market for billionaire apartment buyers has gone from \u201cmush to ice.\u201d\u201cEven breaking even is a win,\u201d added Ms. Packes, who was not working on the 550 Madison project.It was unclear how much money the partners made. Estimated interest payments for the building totaled $180 million over three years, and property taxes for that period came to nearly $45 million, according to public records. Some of those costs were covered by the rent Sony paid to continue to occupy the building. The company recently moved.The partners also presumably had to pay millions of dollars for lawyers, architectural plans and the marketing firm for the project.But in 2013, when Sony put the office tower on the auction block, the residential market was white hot. Mr. Chetrit outbid commercial developers with a $1.1 billion offer. Sony leased the space for another three years as it looked for a new home, while Mr. Chetrit and Mr. Bistricer began making their plans.Mr. Chetrit is not the only developer who has been affected by the recent disappearance of buyers willing to pay $100 million for an apartment.This year, there were about three dozen buildings in Manhattan offering apartments priced around $5,000 a square foot. But sales have slowed drastically, even at One57 and 432 Park, two of the most luxurious new buildings that sit along a stretch of 57th Street known as Billionaires\u2019 Row.One developer has scrapped plans to build a superluxury tower on the site of the Park Lane Hotel on Central Park South. Another developer who wanted to build a high-end tower near Sutton Place is in bankruptcy court. And now Mr. Chetrit\u2019s plans have fizzled.\u201cThe appetite of that group of investors has dimmed,\u201d Ms. Packes said.Still, there are three superluxury towers under construction on 57th Street alone.And New York is still regarded as a relatively safe haven for the world\u2019s superrich. But the richest apartment hunters have largely retreated from buying very expensive apartments as investments, brokers said, because of the collapse of oil prices, weaknesses in the Chinese and Russian economies, and crises in Africa and the Middle East.But Mr. Bistricer, while not addressing 550 Madison directly, said the situation was not so dire. Contrary to most developers and real estate executives, there is \u201cno shortage of money for big projects,\u201d he said. \u201cYou put together the right sponsors, the right banks, you\u2019ll find financing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Haider al-Abadi\u2019s Dangerous Gamble", "Date": "2016-04-12", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 Iraq is facing major financial pressure, and the war against the Islamic State grinds on. The last thing the country needs is a major political crisis. But that\u2019s exactly what appears to be in the works \u2014 unless the United States and Iran work together to help the prime minister avoid it.The latest troubles began on March 31, when Haider al-Abadi, Iraq\u2019s prime minister, presented a new cabinet to the country\u2019s Parliament. That is within his right, of course, but he did so without agreement from the political parties that dominate the assembly. Most of Mr. Abadi\u2019s nominees are reformist technocrats, people with integrity and excellent credentials \u2014 but they do not represent Iraq\u2019s major parties, nor do they have their support.Mr. Abadi made his move under significant pressure. There has been widespread dissatisfaction with the government\u2019s inability to address economic and governance problems. For months, activists and Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the spiritual leader of Iraq\u2019s Shiites, have been calling for a range of reforms, including shrinking the size of government, improving services, cutting wasteful spending and fighting corruption.In announcing his new cabinet, Mr. Abadi sought to outmaneuver Iraq\u2019s political leaders, probably because he believed that if he put forward a qualified and respected team, positive public reaction and support from Ayatollah Sistani would force others to acquiesce.It hasn\u2019t quite worked that way. Several other political players with strong followings in the Parliament \u2014 including influential Kurds, Shiites and Sunnis \u2014 are opposed. Ammar al-Hakim, the leader of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq, a powerful Shiite party, suggested that if the cabinet was unaffiliated with any political party, the prime minister should be, too \u2014 meaning Mr. Abadi, who belongs to the Dawa Party, should resign. A Kurdish geologist who was nominated for the position of oil minister quickly withdrew his name because, he said, it had not been put forward by any of the Kurdish parties. A respected Shiite technocrat who was nominated for the finance and planning portfolios has withdrawn his candidacy, too.The positions of two internal and two external parties will be crucial in deciding what comes next.Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, the former prime minister, still retains power in Iraqi politics and could spoil the cabinet process. But some diplomats and politicians close to the scene believe that even if he was displeased with some of the names put forward, he was generally happy with the proposed cabinet because it keeps the prime minister\u2019s office in the hands of his party and excludes those who he believes were responsible for planning his ouster in August 2014. Ayatollah Sistani will be the other key player. His endorsement for a reformist cabinet would carry a great deal of weight, and his opposition would be a death blow.The Iranians, who usually act as brokers between Shiite groups, have generally been skeptical of Mr. Abadi, whom they regard as too close to the United States. However, Iran has recently opposed unseating the prime minister, perhaps fearing that prolonged negotiations over his succession could drive Shiite parties further apart and divert diplomatic and security resources away from the fight against the Islamic State. Iran might also realize that lasting success against the jihadist group requires addressing Iraqi Sunnis\u2019 concerns rather than encouraging sectarianism.The United States has also played an influential role in facilitating agreements among Iraqis in recent years. The United States has had a good working relationship with Mr. Abadi, as Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s visit to Baghdad last week affirmed. But officials in Washington are, like their Iranian counterparts, concerned that a political crisis in Baghdad could delay the campaign to retake Mosul from the Islamic State. The political crisis could also derail efforts by the Iraqis to deal with their financial problems.The ideal outcome would be the quick selection of a full cabinet that is independent of the political parties. This is politically unachievable right now. In the meantime, the United States and Iran can help Iraq avert a crisis by encouraging Iraqi leaders to give Mr. Abadi some \u2014 but not all \u2014 of the government changes he seeks. The rest would have to be traded for the crucial buy-in of the political parties. One way to do this would be an agreement to have Mr. Abadi nominate half of the candidates for the 14 portfolios he intends to change, and allowing the major parties to nominate the other half. Such a development would still represent progress on reform.Both Washington and Tehran should be interested in an immediate resolution of the political crisis in Baghdad and they will probably have to work in parallel for a quick compromise between the political parties and the prime minister. Washington and Tehran will also need to coordinate with each other and engage with Iraqi leaders to ensure that Mr. Abadi\u2019s gamble does not become a major crisis.Zalmay Khalilzad was the American ambassador to Iraq from 2005-07.

You Don\u2019t Have to Go to Panama", "Date": "2016-04-07", "News": "Supported byFor wealthy Americans looking to veil their assets and shield some of their income from taxation, there is no need to go to Panama or any other offshore tax haven. It\u2019s easy to establish a shell corporation right here at home.In some places, it can be more difficult to get a fishing license than to register a shell company. And it doesn\u2019t cost much more.That in no way means that Americans citizens are refraining from such practices, experts emphasized.But Mr. Zucman, who estimates that about 8 percent of the world\u2019s financial wealth \u2014 more than $7.6 trillion \u2014 is hidden in offshore accounts, said another reason was that it is so simple to create anonymous shell companies within the United States.Wealthy individuals and businesses that want to mask their ownership can conveniently do so in the United States, and then stash those assets abroad.Yet while the United States demands that financial institutions in other countries share information about Americans with accounts overseas, its reciprocation efforts fall short, critics say.\u201cYou see a ton of wealth in tax havens in Switzerland and the Cayman Islands that is owned by shell companies that are incorporated in Panama or in Delaware,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bulk of this wealth does not seem to be duly declared on tax returns.\u201dDelaware allows companies to shift royalties and similar revenues where they actually do business to holding companies in Delaware, where they are not taxed.\u201cYou can create anonymous companies anywhere in the United States,\u201d Ms. Lowe said. \u201cThe reason people know about Delaware, Nevada and Wyoming is because these states market themselves internationally.\u201dIn annual reports, Delaware\u2019s secretary of state has boasted of marketing efforts that have \u201chelped the state reach thousands of legal professionals in dozens of countries across the globe\u201d and visits by delegations to Brazil, Israel, Canada and Spain \u201cto tell the Delaware story.\u201d The resulting incorporation fees make up a hefty portion of state revenue.Although individuals and businesses can have legitimate reasons to want to screen their holdings \u2014 for privacy or to prevent competitors from discovering investment plans \u2014 several experts said cloaking wrongdoing was a more common purpose.Aside from avoiding taxes, shell companies are routinely used by terrorist organizations to hide assets, by political donors to sidestep campaign finance laws and by criminals to launder money, Mr. Gardner said.But the new rules would not affect state law.John A. Cassara, a former special agent for the Treasury Department, said that American and foreign law enforcement officials conducting investigations were regularly stymied by state secrecy laws surrounding shell corporations.\u201cIf somebody is conducting an investigation and it comes back to a Delaware company and you want to find who or what is behind that company, you basically strike out,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s the F.B.I., at the federal level, state or local. Even the Department of Justice can\u2019t get the information. There is nothing you can do.\u201dHe recalled a case where investigators ended up abandoning their inquiry of a Nevada-based corporation that had received more than 3,700 suspicious wire transfers totaling $81 million over two years.\u201cWhy incorporate in Nevada?\u201d the state\u2019s website advertised in 2007. \u201cMinimal reporting and disclosing requirements. Stockholders are not public record.\u201dMossack Fonseca, the Panama law firm, set up offices in Nevada and Wyoming.After revelations came to light about Americans using Swiss bank accounts to evade taxes, the United States in 2010 passed the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, which requires financial firms in other countries to disclose details about American clients with offshore accounts.Yet the United States is one of the few countries that has refused to sign new international standards for exchanging similar financial information with other countries.Another country that has failed to sign the standards? Panama.Mr. Kleinbard and Ms. Lowe of Global Financial Integrity said that American banks are awash in money from foreign investors using shell corporations to conceal money from their own governments and law enforcement.\u201cWhere is that money going?\u201d Ms. Lowe asked. \u201cNot to Delaware, Nevada and Wyoming, but New York, Miami and Los Angeles banks.\u201dFollow Patricia Cohen on Twitter:@PatcohenNYTAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders Spar Over Fossil Fuel Donations", "Date": "2016-04-01", "News": "A day after Mrs. Clinton grew enraged, telling a young climate change activist after a rally in Purchase, N.Y., that she was \u00e2\u0080\u009csick of the Sanders campaign lying\u00e2\u0080\u009d about her accepting political donations from the fossil fuel industry, Mr. Sanders doubled down on the accusation, saying on ABC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood Morning America\u00e2\u0080\u009d on Friday that Mrs. Clinton had \u00e2\u0080\u009ctaken significant money from the fossil fuel industry.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe encounter on Thursday was not the first time Mrs. Clinton has been confronted by activists affiliated with Greenpeace, but it came as the two Democrats fight to win liberal support as the race turns toward New York\u00e2\u0080\u0099s April 19 primary.Polls show that Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s significant lead in New York, her adopted home state, has narrowed in recent weeks, as Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s promise to take on Wall Street and special interests has resonated with liberals in New York City and in economically hard-hit areas upstate.On Friday, she held a round-table discussion at the Institute of Technology at Syracuse Central high school, during which she unveiled a $10 billion proposal to bolster jobs in manufacturing. The event was the beginning of a concerted effort by Mrs. Clinton to win back the voters upstate who twice elected her a New York senator.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe fundamentally believe her work in upstate New York really represents a blueprint or road map for people to follow in looking at what she will do as president in terms of creating good-paying jobs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policy director, Jake Sullivan, told reporters.But the environment, in particular the candidates\u00e2\u0080\u0099 positions on hydraulic fracturing, is also a driving issue for Democratic voters in New York, one that was thrust to the forefront this week.The back and forth began on Thursday when the Greenpeace USA activist asked Mrs. Clinton to pledge to reject fossil fuel contributions. Mrs. Clinton tersely responded, saying: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am so sick \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I am so sick of the Sanders campaign lying about me. I am sick of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009dLater, her campaign addressed the issue.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe simple truth is that this campaign has not taken a dollar from oil and gas industry PACs or corporations,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nick Merrill, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign, said in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe simple fact is that the Sanders campaign is misleading voters with their attacks. The money in question is from individuals who work for these companies.\u00e2\u0080\u009dOn Friday, Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign went a step further, enlisting New York City\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mayor, Bill de Blasio, to defend the former secretary of state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s record on climate change. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAny suggestion that she is in anyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pocket on the issue of climate change, or on any other issue, is flat-out false and inappropriate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. de Blasio said on a conference call with reporters, calling fighting climate change a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccentral force\u00e2\u0080\u009d throughout Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s career.According to the Center for Responsive Politics, of the $157.8 million the Clinton campaign has raised over all, $307,561 has come from individuals who work in the oil and gas industries. The Sanders campaign has raised more than $50,000 from individuals who work in the oil and gas industries.Jeff Weaver, Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign manager, said in a statement that it was \u00e2\u0080\u009cdisappointing\u00e2\u0080\u009d that Mrs. Clinton has accused Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s staff of lying on the issue of fossil fuel industry donations. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFifty-seven lobbyists from the industry have personally given to her campaign and 11 of those lobbyists have bundled more than $1 million to help put her in the White House,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you include money given to super PACs backing Clinton, the fossil fuel industry has given more than $4.5 million in support of Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bid,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Weaver said.Justin Barasky, a spokesman for Priorities USA Action, the \u00e2\u0080\u009csuper PAC\u00e2\u0080\u009d backing Mrs. Clinton, said in an email, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy the Sanders campaign\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own metric they have taken fossil fuel money but instead of attacking other Democrats we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re focused on stopping Donald Trump and Ted Cruz from becoming president.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMrs. Clinton has faced scrutiny for her positions on climate change in the past, and was under intense pressure last summer before she staked out a position against the Keystone XL Pipeline. Pressed on the issue at an event in New Hampshire, Mrs. Clinton said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf it is undecided when I become president, I will answer your question.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn September, Mrs. Clinton said she opposed building the pipeline, which divided two Democratic constituencies, organized labor and environmentalists, and which Mr. Sanders has opposed. Mrs. Clinton called the project \u00e2\u0080\u009ca distraction from the important work we have to do to combat climate change.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "What Iran Needs to Fix", "Date": "2016-04-18", "News": "Supported byEditorialSince concluding the nuclear deal with the United States and other major powers last July, Iran has yet to realize the expected economic benefits. The Iranians are frustrated, but to a large extent have themselves to blame.The agreement promised an end to sanctions imposed by the United Nations and the European Union in return for a freeze on Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Iran has fulfilled its part; so have the major powers, and businesses are flocking to Iran in search of deals. Technically, Iran is free to export crude oil and access about $50 billion in foreign exchange reserves in foreign banks.One impediment is that most American sanctions remain in place because of Iran\u2019s involvement in terrorism and human rights abuses and its testing of ballistic missiles. Iran knew that lifting all American sanctions was never part of the nuclear deal. This means American companies are still banned from doing business in Iran, except for trade in civil aviation, carpets and agricultural products. Also, Iran is still barred from using the American financial system, and its dollars, through which most international business is conducted. Many foreign banks who are free to engage with Iran hesitate to do so, fearing they will run afoul of American sanctions.The Treasury Department, concerned that Iran has not benefited enough from sanctions relief, is working to clarify the conditions for doing business with Tehran. There are no restrictions on foreign banks that want to do deals with Iran in euros or other non-dollar currencies. Foreign banks can also do trades in dollars if they can cover the transaction with the dollars they have on hand. In practice, that means smaller deals, because for larger ones, like oil contracts, they would have to access the American financial system, which is off limits.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Construction Firm Accused in India Overpass Collapse", "Date": "2016-04-01", "News": "Supported byKOLKATA, India \u2014 The police in Kolkata on Friday filed a criminal complaint of culpable homicide and criminal breach of trust against the company that was building an elevated highway that collapsed on Thursday, and then detained eight of the company\u2019s executives.As rescue workers continued to look through the rubble and cut into trapped vehicles with blowtorches and other equipment, the company, IVRCL, came under intense scrutiny, with reports that it had run into problems with at least two states and a publicly owned company under the Indian Ministry of Railways.At least 23 people were killed in the accident in the crowded Ganesh Talkies area of Kolkata, formerly Calcutta, and 85 people were injured, the police said. Five hundred people in various rescue capacities were working at the site Friday night, said a Kolkata police sergeant, S. Satgava, adding, \u201cWe cannot tell how many more are trapped.\u201d One person was rescued Friday evening, he said.Early on Saturday morning, rescuers removed what they said was the last body from the rubble.Television footage from the scene of the collapse showed cranes lifting steel plates, bulldozers clearing concrete rubble and workers cutting metal slabs into smaller pieces to lift them out of the wreckage. Part of the highway was twisted and hanging down, said Sandeep Channan, an official with the National Disaster Response Force, and engineers were working to stabilize it.One local man observing the scene wondered out loud how residents could feel safe living under the structure if the project resumed after this accident.IVRCL is a major construction company carrying out irrigation, road, mining and power projects across India, as well as in Sri Lanka, the Middle East and Africa. At a news conference on Friday in Hyderabad, where the company is based, officials said they were shocked by the episode but refused to comment on the police complaint, saying they had not seen it.K. Panduranga Rao, the group head of human resources and administration at IVRCL, said in a telephone interview that he was not the appropriate person to comment on punitive actions taken against his company, but also refused to refer questions to anyone else.There were numerous questions about the company, and no shortage of critics. Derek O\u2019Brien, a spokesman for the state of West Bengal, which includes Kolkata, said the company had been barred from doing business in the state of Uttar Pradesh. He said the police had detained six company officials in Kolkata and two in Hyderabad for questioning.\u201cThe company has a bad reputation,\u201d he told the news agency ANI. \u201cThe law will take its own course. No one will be spared.\u201dSatish Agnihotri, the chairman and managing director of Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd., the publicly owned company under the Railways Ministry, called IVRCL \u201ca major defaulter.\u201d In a telephone interview, he said his company had terminated its contracts with IVRCL over the past three years because of poor performance.\u201cThey were working with us, with our company, and because of their lack of performance, or because of their poor performance, we terminated their contracts,\u201d he said.IVRCL will be forbidden to bid on any further contracts for two years after the last termination, he added. Mr. Agnihotri said his company had also cashed in performance guarantees for several of IVRCL\u2019s projects, although he could not recall the penalty amounts.Chandreshwar Prasad Singh, the minister of urban development, housing and transportation in the state of Jharkhand, said in an interview that his state had blacklisted IVRCL in February because of delays in finishing projects that included laying pipelines for drinking water and putting up electrical wires in eight rural districts.\u201cSuch companies need to know that it is a question both of quality and quantity,\u201d said Mr. Singh, who in February took to the floor of the State Assembly to accuse the company of cheating the government. They need to know that projects \u201cmust be finished in a time-bound manner,\u201d he added. \u201cIVRCL failed on all accounts.\u201d\u201cWhat happens, or should happen with blacklisting, is that other states sit up and take note of the company\u2019s image and do not award any future projects as well,\u201d Mr. Singh said.But that seems not to have happened, probably because government contracts are awarded to the lowest bidder once basic technical criteria have been met, finance experts said.They said that the infrastructure industry in India was under stress, and that among its biggest weakness was in the management of complex construction projects, like the elevated highway that collapsed in Kolkata.West Bengal\u2019s chief minister, Mamata Banerjee, told The Press Trust of India, a news agency, that IVRCL had been awarded the contract for the highway in 2009, under a previous administration.Bureaucratic and other delays hampered the project from the start. The company said on its website that the project was among its toughest, cutting through a crowded neighborhood and requiring heavy machinery. Construction time was limited to six hours a day.The company had been struggling with debt. After a restructuring plan fell apart early this year, banks that were its largest debtors converted their debt into equity, taking control of the company, The Press Trust of India reported.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article and its headline referred incorrectly to the action taken by the Kolkata police against the company that was building an elevated highway that collapsed. They filed a criminal complaint of culpable homicide and breach of trust; they did not formally charge the company.An article on April 2 about the filing of a criminal complaint of culpable homicide by the police in Kolkata, India, against IVRCL, the company building an elevated highway that collapsed, killing at least 23, misspelled, at one point and in some editions, the surname of the chairman of a rail company who called IVRCL a \u201cmajor defaulter.\u201d As the article correctly noted elsewhere, he is Satish Agnihotri, not Aghnihotri.Hari Kumar reported from Kolkata, and Geeta Anand and Nida Najar from New Delhi.

{"Headline": "Hillary and Bernie Meet New York", "Date": "2016-04-08", "News": "Supported byDemocratic presidential campaign news: Hillary Clinton just visited the Buffalo Transportation Pierce Arrow Museum. Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders announced he is going to the Vatican, where he hopes to meet with the pope.Have you noticed how Senator Sanders, former mayor of Burlington, Vt., is the glamour candidate while Clinton, former first lady, senator from New York and secretary of state, seems to follow an itinerary fit for a county commissioner? Welcome to the New York primary.Yes! It\u2019s New York\u2019s turn! Everyone here is very excited \u2014 it\u2019s been a quarter century since anybody paid attention to us during a big election year. Even then it was only for about two minutes, when we had a minor role in ending the presidential prospects of Jerry Brown. But on April 19, New York voters will crown, um \u2014 the candidates who get to go on to Pennsylvania.Actually, it\u2019s a bigger deal than that. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have to win their home state. If John Kasich can do it, it\u2019s the least you can expect.When Clinton moved to New York in 1999 and announced she was running for the Senate, it sounded thrilling. While we like to pretend New York politics is exciting, it\u2019s mainly just one indictment after another. But a first lady who was a central figure in the most famous sex scandal in American history, running for the Senate in a place where she had never lived? Wow.Some people \u2014 O.K., many people \u2014 were suspicious of the most famous woman in the world parachuting in to claim the best political job in the state. But Clinton wore everyone down by having the humility to be stupendously boring. She invented her \u201clistening tour\u201d self, marching through upstate New York, having intense conversations with dairy farmers or small-business people about Internet access and rural redevelopment until the cows literally came home.It seemed to cast a spell on her opponents. Mayor Rudy Giuliani revealed he had prostate cancer, then told reporters he was leaving his wife without giving her a heads-up, and acknowledged he had a \u201cgood friend\u201d who would later become his third spouse. Meanwhile, Clinton announced she had visited all 62 New York counties.Giuliani dropped out of the race and was replaced by a Long Island congressman, Rick Lazio, a good-natured moderate. By the fall, Lazio had turned into a political disaster, stomping across the stage at the senatorial debate, thrusting a campaign finance pledge under Clinton\u2019s face and bellowing \u201cSign it! Right now!\u201dPerhaps there\u2019s something about Clinton that makes her opponents go crazy. It obviously didn\u2019t happen with Barack Obama, but then exceptions make the rule.Lately, Bernie Sanders seems to have been acting a little \u2026 off. There was the terrible interview with The Daily News. (\u201cI don\u2019t know \u2026 It\u2019s something I have not studied \u2026 I haven\u2019t thought about it a whole lot.\u201d) Then there was the strange series of claims that Clinton is not qualified to be president, the most improbable description he could pick short of \u201clazy.\u201dThat Senate race defined Clinton as a candidate \u2014 someone who balanced her stupendous fame and celebrity with down-home, low-key campaigning. The \u201cListening Tour\u201d was so stuffed with worthy, headline-free discussions that members of her press corps developed twitches, drinking problems or a sudden yearning to be transferred to the culture desk. But voters loved it.Then in 2008, after a terrible start, presidential candidate Clinton started listening again, with many variations on the Zanesville Economic Summit. She won the Ohio primary and came very close to beating Obama.This time around, she launched off in a van that was unfortunately named \u201cScooby,\u201d meeting at an Iowa auto mechanics classroom, then holding a small-business round table at a family-owned fruit company. The biggest drama came in Maumee, Ohio, when she visited a Chipotle and failed to leave money in the tip jar.What can we learn from all this? First, that Clinton will come out of this year\u2019s campaign better informed about the concerns of everyday Americans than she was when she went in. Her events may be sloggy and staged, but nearly every day she gets some little insight into the woes of preschool teachers, peach farmers with irrigation problems or parents of children with autism.Second, she isn\u2019t exactly causing hearts to flutter in the process.We\u2019ll find out soon who her former constituents prefer. Whichever way it goes, you can blame it on Buffalo.Advertisement"}

In the ad, Detective John Baeza, who has retired from the New York Police Department, described working on the case of the so-called East Side Rapist, who targeted numerous women during the late 1990s. In the ad, Mr. Baeza said that he had wanted to send fliers, costing between $10,000 and $40,000, but the city didn\u2019t have the money to pay for them. Mr. Trump did, he says in the spot, as text reiterates that point on the screen. \u201cDonald Trump was definitely a leader who stepped up for the cops, the detectives and the women in the case,\u201d Mr. Baeza said in the ad, which was produced by the group\u2019s main strategist, Jesse Benton. It was not immediately clear how the group came to find Mr. Baeza; Mr. Trump\u2019s involvement in the mailers was not discussed publicly in news accounts at the time. But Mr. Baeza was the head of security for Senator Rand Paul\u2019s presidential campaign. Mr. Benton, who has close ties to the Paul family, worked on a super PAC supporting that campaign before it ended, and he and other former Paul acolytes shifted support to Mr. Trump.The ad appears to try to soften Mr. Trump\u2019s image with women, at a time when his unfavorable ratings are quite high.

For instance, he wants the country, which was hit by two atomic bombs in World War II, to acquire nuclear weapons, an idea that is deeply unpopular and has been rejected by successive Japanese governments, including Mr. Abe\u2019s.\u201cThe importance of a very hawkish person like Tamogami is that he makes Abe look more balanced,\u201d said Masatoshi Honda, a professor at Kinjo Gakuin University. \u201cWithout him around, Abe looks like the most right-wing guy out there.\u201dEven his more mundane Twitter posts veer into nationalism. One on cherry blossoms this month ended, \u201cBanzai to our wonderful motherland, Japan.\u201dMr. Tamogami has given conflicting accounts of the accusations that he violated election laws, but he has mostly blamed his finance director, Nobuteru Shimamoto. Mr. Tamogami told an interviewer from NHK, Japan\u2019s national broadcaster, that he initially approved small disbursements of money to campaign workers that were proposed by Mr. Shimamoto, but then changed his mind.\u201cIt is not something that I directly ordered, but it is a result of my ignorance and lack of oversight,\u201d he wrote on Twitter on April 6.\u201cIt appears that Tamogami will be arrested today,\u201d he wrote on Thursday, immediately before he was taken into custody, referring to himself in the third person.\u201cIt is unreasonable, but I can\u2019t resist the power of the state.

If the regime wants to boost its religious credentials, it could reverse course and unleash the religious police on society. It\u2019s a lever that can be turned on or turned off.\u201dThe religious police, founded in 1940, are formally called the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice. Even before the social media videos, the police had been criticized for excesses.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Senate Votes to Ban Imports of Syrian Art and Antiquities", "Date": "2016-04-13", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate voted on Wednesday to ban the import of virtually all ancient art and artifacts from Syria to discourage the looting and trafficking of illicit objects by the Islamic State and other armed groups.The Senate voted by unanimous consent, reflecting broad bipartisan support, but it did so after months of delay and debate over the legislation, which the House of Representatives passed last year. The bill\u2019s provisions would fulfill commitments the United States supported at the United Nations Security Council more than a year ago to try to choke off the trade of so-called blood antiquities that the Islamic State, the Nusra Front, Al Qaeda and other groups use to help finance their military operations in Syria and Iraq.The Senate\u2019s action, which closed a loophole in American law, came on the day that a task force of prominent advocacy organizations, museums and universities called on the Obama administration to take far more aggressive steps \u2014 including military operations \u2014 to halt the destruction and looting of cultural sites in Iraq and Syria.\u201cThe U.S. response to cultural racketeering is currently decentralized and implemented on an ad hoc basis, with several agencies involved but no single agency coordinating the efforts,\u201d the report said.It went on to lament the slowness of enacting provisions that the United Nations Security Council had called for in February 2015. \u201cThe lack of action has kept the United States market open to the import of Syrian antiquities, making it a potential source of funding for extremist organizations,\u201d the report said.As it expanded across Iraq and Syria, the Islamic State destroyed many archaeological sites, looting them for profit and damaging some for propaganda.The United States, as the task force\u2019s report noted, accounts for 43 percent of the global art market, making it a potential leader in demand for illicit imports.The White House did not respond to the task force\u2019s specific recommendations, but a spokesman, Peter Boogaard, issued a statement welcoming the Congressional action and pledging to \u201cenhance our ability to identify and prosecute those who unlawfully acquire or sell precious historical artifacts.\u201dThe legislation should soon move to the White House for a signature. It broadly mirrors a law adopted after the American invasion of Iraq in 2003 that banned imports of culturally or historical significant objects from that country.While American law prohibits the import of stolen or looted objects, it does not specifically ban the trade in ancient art or artifacts, including from Syria, that were obtained before 1970, when an international convention against the trade of culturally significant objects took effect.The legislation includes an exemption that would allow some objects to enter the United States temporarily for safekeeping in instances where they might otherwise be destroyed.The task force\u2019s report called on museums, dealers and auction houses to be more transparent about the provenance of objects they buy or sell, including making public any records of previous ownership. It also said the I.R.S. should require the same before allowing collectors to take tax deductions for items donated to museums.Deborah M. Lehr, the founder of the Antiquities Coalition and one of the leaders of the task force, said that for all the genuine statements of concern about the looting \u2014 and the specter of its proceeds supporting the Islamic State\u2019s nihilistic rule \u2014 the United States had not done enough to fight the trafficking.\u201cI think a lot of individuals are very committed to this,\u201d she said, \u201cbut as a coordinated effort across the government, it just hasn\u2019t reached that level yet.\u201dDavid Herszenhorn contributed reportingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mikhail Lesin\u2019s Strange Death in U.S. Follows a Fall From Russia\u2019s Elite", "Date": "2016-04-02", "News": "Supported byThe trappings of a comfortable exile were already in place. He had created a corporation in Los Angeles to buy expensive homes. His son and daughter had lived there. Mr. Lesin, 57, traveled regularly to the United States with a new girlfriend, who gave birth in September.\u201cHe finished his business in Russia, if you will, and was looking for another life,\u201d said Sergei V. Aleksashenko, a former deputy of Russia\u2019s central bank who moved to the United States after taking part in protests against Mr. Putin.Instead, the new life abruptly came to an end.On the morning of Nov. 5, Mr. Lesin was found dead inside a hotel room in Washington, where he had been invited to attend a fund-raising dinner for the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in the city\u2019s West End two nights before.That has fueled speculation that Mr. Lesin might have been murdered, presumably by a financial or political rival. Not only that, but it has also given rise to more outlandish theories about what he was doing in the capital of a country that the news media \u2014 the one he did more than most to build \u2014 regularly vilifies as a decadent, hostile enemy of Russia.What is not in question is that Mr. Lesin\u2019s fall in Russia came swiftly, unexpectedly and with little official explanation.He seemed poised to join a new wave of economic or political exiles that has flowed from Russia as Mr. Putin\u2019s attitude and policies toward the West have sharpened significantly.\u201cObviously, he was running away,\u201d said Yevgenia Albats, a prominent journalist and commentator whose reporting provoked Mr. Lesin\u2019s ire.What made Mr. Lesin\u2019s death so notable was the influential role he played during Mr. Putin\u2019s ascent to power.An engineer by training, he had founded an advertising company in the 1990s that became one of the country\u2019s most important. His expertise landed him jobs with the official Russian news agency, RIA Novosti, then the All-Russian State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company, where he was accused of using his position to funnel contracts to his former advertising company, Video International.In 1999, he became the minister of the press during the twilight of Boris N. Yeltsin\u2019s presidency, having been instrumental in Mr. Yeltsin\u2019s re-election three years earlier. Although not initially part of Mr. Putin\u2019s closest circle of advisers, he remained minister during Mr. Putin\u2019s first term as president and was instrumental in his efforts to wrest control over national television networks from the tycoons who ran them.In Mr. Putin\u2019s second term, Mr. Lesin served as a senior presidential adviser in the Kremlin, and, most significant, started Russia Today, the nation\u2019s first 24-hour all-news television network broadcasting in English (and later other languages). Known today simply as RT, the network has become a potent weapon in the information war the Kremlin believes it is fighting against the West.He returned, though, after Mr. Putin assumed the presidency for a third term. In October 2013, he took over Gazprom Media, the subsidiary of the energy giant that through a complicated ownership structure is controlled by one of Mr. Putin\u2019s confidants, Yuri V. Kovalchuk, the main shareholder of Bank Rossiya. Mr. Kovalchuk and Bank Rossiya each face sanctions by the United States for their ties to Mr. Putin.Within two months, Mr. Lesin oversaw the acquisition of Prof-Media, a subsidiary of one of Russia\u2019s richest industrialist, Vladimir O. Potanin. Prof-Media owned television networks like MTV Russia, as well as radio stations and magazines. The deal, reported to be worth $600 million at the time, was seen as the Kremlin\u2019s effort to bring even more independent media outlets under state political and financial control.Mr. Lesin did clash with the remaining vestiges of independent news media. Aleksei A. Venediktov, the editor of the radio station Ekho Moskvy, which is partly owned by Gazprom Media but ostensibly independent, said Mr. Lesin had invited him to dinner at one of Moscow\u2019s fanciest restaurants and pressed him to dismiss several journalists who appeared on the air or on the station\u2019s website, including Ms. Latynina.Mr. Venediktov successfully resisted. Many attributed his departure from Gazprom Media to the fight with Ekho Moskvy, but Mr. Venediktov said he believed that Mr. Lesin\u2019s abrasive character and his handling of the acquisition of Prof-Media had brought him into conflict with Mr. Kovalchuk.\u201cLesin made enemies of all the heads of the federal TV channels, all the heads of advertising agencies and all media owners with his policies,\u201d Mr. Venediktov wrote in an email.Mr. Lesin\u2019s return to an influential position atop Gazprom Media renewed attention on his own wealth.Three years earlier, Mr. Lesin had incorporated a company in California, called Dastel, primarily to buy real estate. According to a deposition in a lawsuit involving his son, given by the corporation\u2019s only officer, Ilya Tsipis, \u201cvarious members of the extended Lesin family\u201d lived in the properties the company bought. A second company, HFC Management, was incorporated the same year in the name of his daughter, Ekaterina, and another, called Dastel Holdings, was formed in 2013.The three companies bought two homes in Beverly Hills, at a cost of $13.8 million and $5.6 million, and another in Brentwood for $9 million.Mr. Lesin\u2019s son, Anton, began to make his mark in Hollywood not long after. The son, who Anglicized his name to Lessine, and a partner, Sasha Shapiro, formed a film-financing company called Media Content Capital. And in 2012, they acquired a controlling stake in QED International, a film production and distribution company founded in 2002 by Bill Block, for $25 million. The company has since produced a series of major movies such as \u201cFading Gigolo,\u201d with John Turturro and Woody Allen; \u201cFury,\u201d with Brad Pitt; and, most recently, \u201cDirty Grandpa\u201d with Robert De Niro and Zac Efron.The revelations about Mr. Lesin\u2019s investments in Los Angeles came at a time of heightened animosity toward the West as a result of the war in Ukraine. With senior Russian officials and businessmen facing sanctions by the United States and Europe, Mr. Putin intensified his warnings that businessmen should keep or return their fortunes to Russia.Mr. Navalny\u2019s disclosures also had an impact in Washington. Vladimir V. Kara-Murza, a prominent journalist and opposition activist in Russia, said he passed on documents about Mr. Lesin\u2019s properties to members of Congress as part of a campaign to persuade the United States to impose sanctions against more officials.Senator Roger Wicker, Republican of Mississippi, publicly called on the Justice Department to investigate what he said was suspicion of wrongdoing under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and questioned Mr. Lesin\u2019s ties to Mr. Kovalchuk, whom the Department of Treasury identified as \u201cthe personal banker for senior officials,\u201d including Mr. Putin.More than four months later, an assistant attorney general, Peter J. Kadzik, replied that the matter had been referred to the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division and the F.B.I. Then nothing happened.A law enforcement official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said the referral was a formality, suggesting that no investigation followed.\u201cThere is no question that the U.S. has become a relatively comfortable haven for questionable fortunes,\u201d she said.Within days, Mr. Lesin departed Gazprom Media, citing personal reasons.In 2015, he retreated from public view. He regularly traveled to the United States on a tourist visa, visiting four times in the first 10 months of the year, usually to Los Angeles, according to a record of his travel disclosed by Mr. Navalny and confirmed by the United States Customs and Border Protection service. Mr. Lesin arrived one last time in Los Angeles on Oct. 21, only two weeks before his death.Mr. Lesin, previously twice married, began a new relationship with a woman, Viktoria Rakhimbayeva, a model from Siberia, Mr. Aven said. \u201cHe really was in love,\u201d he said. On Sept. 25, she gave birth to a daughter, Mr. Venediktov told his radio audience on Ekho Moskvy after Mr. Lesin\u2019s death.\u201cWhen I learned of his death, my first thought was about the baby, actually,\u201d Mr. Venediktov said. \u201cThis is a question of sympathy because, well, he\u2019s dead and gone, but the girl with the baby \u2014 how is she?\u201dEven though he dropped from public view, his troubles at Gazprom Media followed him to the United States and were raised in 2015 in a lawsuit involving his son\u2019s production company.In late 2014, Mr. Block reached an agreement to depart QED International, leaving the entire company to Mr. Lessine and Mr. Shapiro. Last April, they sued Mr. Block for trademark infringement and unfair competition, accusing him of undercutting the company.The lawsuit was settled \u2014 with no terms disclosed \u2014 on the day Mr. Lesin\u2019s body was found.Mr. Vasilyev, as well as Mr. Aven and others who knew him, said Mr. Lesin was known as a heavy drinker who would sometimes behave recklessly when intoxicated.\u201cThe only thing I can tell you is that when Misha has failures,\u201d Mr. Vasilyev said, referring to Mr. Lesin familiarly by the diminutive form of Mikhail, \u201cthere were instances where he fell and caused involuntary injury to himself, including quite heavily.\u201dThe autopsy did not name the cause of the blunt trauma, leaving an open question whether it was a beating, a fall or a vehicle accident.According to Mr. Vasilyev\u2019s account, which he said was based on information from the Foreign Ministry, Mr. Lesin went to a liquor store on the morning of Nov. 3 \u2014 the day of the dinner he was to attend \u2014 and returned with alcohol to the hotel where he was staying, the Dupont Circle Hotel. It was that day when, Mr. Aven said, he called and sent a text message, but received no response.Mr. Lesin was visited in his room on the night of Nov. 4 by a security guard who, finding him drunk, tried to help him into bed, Mr. Vasilyev said, but Mr. Lesin resisted. The next morning he was found dead in his room by a cleaner.\u201cHow it is possible he did not call a doctor, the police, anyone?\u201d Mr. Vasilyev said of the security guard. \u201cI do not understand.\u201dA sales representative at the hotel said no one there would comment on his death. The medical examiner tested for alcohol in his blood, as a matter of routine. A spokeswoman would not discuss the details of those tests, citing privacy, but alcohol was not listed as a contributing factor in his death, only the trauma.The police here continue to treat Mr. Lesin\u2019s as a natural death, though the criminal division is in charge of the investigation. Neither the F.B.I. nor the Justice Department has taken a role in the investigation, according to officials from both agencies, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an unresolved case, suggesting that it was being investigated as an untimely death but not a federal crime.One of the officials said a security video showed Mr. Lesin returning to his hotel in a disheveled state, suggesting he had been in an accident or altercation the night of Nov. 4. In addition to the blunt trauma to the head, Mr. Lesin\u2019s body had bruises on the neck, torso, arms and legs, but the cause of those was not clear.The handling of the inquiry has raised questions in Russia. The medical examiner\u2019s office completes most autopsies within 90 days, but Mr. Lesin\u2019s took longer, as officials carried out a rigorous series of toxicological tests for poisons to be certain to rule out that sort of foul play. (The joint statement by the office and the Metropolitan Police also misstated Mr. Lesin\u2019s age, which was 57, not 59.)In March, Russia\u2019s prosecutor general asked the Justice Department for more information about the case, according to an embassy spokesman, Yuri Y. Melnik, but according to him and a spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry, neither the police nor federal officials have provided answers.In the febrile, largely virtual world where opposition to Mr. Putin thrives, Mr. Lesin\u2019s mere presence in the United States has provoked conspiracy theories. One version held by Mr. Putin\u2019s critics claimed he was silenced before he could cooperate with federal authorities investigating corruption.Another theory suggested, fantastically, that he might not be dead at all but in witness protection. Officials here dismiss these as ludicrous. (A final notation of his departure in December was a clerical record closing out his travel record, a spokesman for the customs service said, not evidence he had departed the country, as was reported widely in Russia.)The uncertainties are partly why theories about Mr. Lesin\u2019s death have not fully subsided.Many still suspect a crime, carried out by enemies in Moscow, but Mr. Aven scoffed at that, saying they had met in Moscow only weeks before they were to meet in Washington. \u201cIf anything was done to him,\u201d he said, \u201cwhy would anybody do it here?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Union Seeks Higher Tariffs on U.S. Imports of Raw Aluminum", "Date": "2016-04-18", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 An American labor union is pushing the United States to impose broad, steep tariffs on aluminum imports using a little-used but wide-ranging trade law that has riled the country\u2019s trading partners in the past.The union blames China\u2019s rising exports, though if successful its effort would also affect American imports from Canada and many other countries.But Section 201 cases are also harder to win. They require proof that a domestic industry has been \u201cseriously injured\u201d by imports, a harder test than the mere proof of \u201cinjury\u201d from imports that is required for other trade cases.The union also argues that aluminum is important to national defense because it is widely used in military equipment.Presidents have almost always followed the commission\u2019s advice, although President Carter turned down a recommendation for tariffs on stainless steel flatware in 1978 and President George H.W. Bush rejected a recommendation for tariffs on extruded rubber threads in 1992. The Office of the United States Trade Representative declined to comment on the union\u2019s contentions.China, which already produces more than half the world\u2019s aluminum, is expanding capacity even as its economy decelerates. The result has been a surge in exports and falling prices for aluminum.Chinese exports of aluminum jumped more than 27 percent in the past two years, Chinese customs figures show.A spokesman for the government-affiliated China Aluminum Association, who gave his family name as Zeng, said aluminum\u2019s increasing use in high-speed railway equipment, aerospace and electronics justified China\u2019s expanding production capacity and rising exports.Smelters in Canada and elsewhere, having been displaced in their traditional international markets, have stepped up shipments of raw aluminum to the United States. American imports of raw aluminum from Canada, the biggest supplier, jumped 10 percent by tonnage last year, United States customs data shows.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Book Reviews: Behind a Powerful Portfolio, a Successful Career", "Date": "2016-04-09", "News": "Supported byOff the ShelfPersonal finance advice is often so focused on making sure our assets are properly diversified, taking every deduction we are entitled to and keeping investment costs low that it is easy to forget one important fact: When it comes to securing your financial future, the better you manage your career, the more money you are likely to have.Two new books about handling your family\u2019s finances stress that idea: The more money you make, the more you can save. Since raises are typically a percentage of what you currently earn, the higher the base, the greater the increase. Contributions that your employer makes to your retirement account are usually based on how much you put in. The higher your salary, the more you can invest. Your Social Security benefits are based on your earnings.For example, while she is all in favor of saving money on purchases, Ms. Palmer adds: \u201cThere\u2019s a dark side to penny-pinching. It keeps us focused on small, short-term savings instead of working on the far more significant strategies that can really build our family\u2019s wealth. We get a rush from saving $5 at checkout, while leaving $500 on the table because we didn\u2019t sign up for a flex-spending account at work to pay for child care expenses.\u201dHer general points \u2014 for example, that the spending and saving habits we develop in our 20s have a significant impact on our financial future \u2014 are solid. And she is occasionally very witty. \u201cI sometimes spend my lunch break texting with my younger sister, urging her to skip the $50 massage and instead learn to relax in less expensive ways after a bad day, in between offering her dating advice and career guidance. I am a full-service sister.\u201dStill, it would have been better if she had provided even more specific advice.Mr. McCormick, a managing partner of the private equity firm HCI Equity Partners, which invests in companies that generate about $20 million to $200 million in revenue, specifies his focus in his book\u2019s subtitle: \u201cUsing Business Principles to Maximize Your Family\u2019s Wealth.\u201dWhere Ms. Palmer is supportive, Mr. McCormick is hard-nosed, perhaps fitting for a graduate of both West Point and Harvard Business School.In talking about his recommendations, Mr. McCormick assumes \u201cyou have the discipline and intellectual honesty to act rationally.\u201d He adds, by way of example: \u201cMany advisers suggest you pay off your mortgage as quickly as possible. On the contrary, I recommend you pay off real estate debt last, even after making other investments, given the relatively low after-tax cost of this debt. But this assumes you actually save and reinvest this increased cash flow and don\u2019t blow it on a new flat screen or vacation.\u201dIf you own a home, having additional real estate investments, like shares of a real estate investment trust, or REIT, is not a good idea, he adds. But, he says, you probably want to own more international stocks.\u201cToday U.S. equities represent about half the global economy, a percentage that has been consistently decreasing. Basing your equity allocations on relative global market capitalization values will ensure your allocations change with the changing dynamics\u201d of the global economy.Conversely, he believes, you may have too much money in fixed-income investments. His recommendation, which strikes me as aggressive, is if you are three or more years away from retirement, you need to have only 36 months of total living expenses in bonds, Treasuries and money market funds. \u201cSo long as you are more than three years from retirement, there is no need for more fixed income exposure.\u201d Everything else, he says, should be in stocks.And those stocks should be in index funds. Active investing \u201cis analogous to the joke about how good the technology is on new airplanes these days,\u201d he writes. \u201cInstead of two pilots, these new airplanes require one pilot and one dog. The dog\u2019s job is to bite the pilot if he tries to touch the controls. Many of us would be better off if we had a dog around to bite us when we are tempted to \u2018actively manage\u2019 our investments.\u201dBut for all that investing advice, Mr. McCormick devotes the first 50 pages of his book to the need to \u201cmaximize the value of your single biggest asset \u2014 your labor,\u201d making points such as, \u201cInvestments in education are one of the surest ways to financial security and wealth creation.\u201dArmed with that education, he adds, you want to \u201cmake career choices that extend your possibilities.\u201d You want to gain skills in fields like finance or marketing that are transferable to other industries as opposed to learning everything about one industry that could end up being disrupted out of existence.The proven principles of personal investing are important. But if you want to have a secure financial future, it will certainly help if you manage your career well. Neither Mr. McCormick nor Ms. Palmer advises that you choose a career based solely on what it pays, but it is certainly one factor to keep in mind.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Focus on Chief Justice as Supreme Court Hears Immigration Challenge", "Date": "2016-04-17", "News": "Supported byThe case, to be argued on Monday at the Supreme Court, presents fundamental questions about executive power against the backdrop of a wrenching national debate over Mr. Obama\u2019s plan to spare millions of immigrants from deportation. But Chief Justice Roberts\u2019s record suggests that he may avoid taking a position on such a divisive and partisan issue, focusing instead on the more technical question of whether the states challenging the Obama administration\u2019s immigration plan have suffered the sort of direct and concrete injury that gives them standing to sue.That jurisprudential off-ramp would avoid a deadlock or a grand pronouncement from a short-handed court on a politically charged issue in a presidential election year. And that may prove attractive to a chief justice who has said he does not want the Supreme Court to be viewed as a forum where \u201cpartisan matters would be worked out.\u201d\u201cThe chief justice, who has spoken recently about how the confirmation process might affect the court\u2019s stature, may be especially troubled by a 4-4 split in this case,\u201d Professor Strauss said. A ruling based on standing, he said, \u201cwould wipe the slate clean, so the program could be considered in the future by a full Supreme Court.\u201dMr. Obama\u2019s plan would allow more than four million unauthorized immigrants who are parents of citizens or lawful permanent residents to apply for a program shielding them from deportation and allowing them to work legally. In the short term, a ruling to dismiss the case on standing grounds would at least temporarily save the plan.A tie vote, on the other hand, would leave in place an injunction blocking the plan and probably deny Mr. Obama any chance of resurrecting it.The case, United States v. Texas, No. 15-674, was brought by Texas and 25 other states, which say the plan went beyond what Congress had authorized. Lower courts have sided with Texas.The trial judge ruled that the Obama administration should have given notice of the plan and sought public comments on its new program. The appeals court affirmed that ruling and added a broader one: The program, it said, also exceeded Mr. Obama\u2019s statutory authority.The Supreme Court asked the parties to address the even broader question of whether Mr. Obama had violated his constitutional obligations to enforce the nation\u2019s laws. But the court must first address whether Texas has suffered the sort of direct and concrete injury that gave it standing to sue in the first place.Ken Paxton, the attorney general of Texas, said his state had brought the case to settle fundamental questions about presidential power.The empty seat left by Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death leaves the court with two basic options for cases left on the docket this term if the justices are deadlocked at 4 to 4.\u201cOur goal really was pretty basic: defend the Constitution and stop President Obama\u2019s lawlessness,\u201d he said.A ruling based on standing would sidestep all of those issues. Even lawyers who believe that Texas has demonstrated that it has standing say they are not sure how the chief justice will vote.\u201cWays of disposing of cases without addressing the merits do become more attractive on an eight-member court,\u201d he said.Texas says it has standing to sue based on the budget shortfalls it would sustain if many unauthorized immigrants applied for driver\u2019s licenses. The state sets fees for driver\u2019s licenses below what they cost and ties eligibility for them to federal determinations about who is lawfully present in the country.\u201cOur standing argument is based on the cost of driver\u2019s licenses, which is obviously not part of our budget at this point,\u201d said Mr. Paxton. \u201cThe Legislature meets only every other year, and they put together a budget and all of the driver\u2019s licenses come out of the budget, and there\u2019s no money for it. So our standing is based on that cost.\u201dThe \u201ctrue goal for this litigation may be more symbolic than anything else,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe constitutional role of the courts, however, is to decide concrete cases \u2014 not to serve as a convenient forum for policy debates.\u201d\u201cIt restricts the right of conservative public interest groups to challenge liberal agency action or inaction,\u201d he wrote, \u201cjust as it restricts the right of liberal public interest groups to challenge conservative agency action or inaction.\u201dMr. Dellinger said a rigorous approach to standing was consistent with Chief Justice Roberts\u2019s statement at his confirmation hearings that judges should aspire to be umpires, whose only job is to call balls and strikes.\u201cBefore any judge begins calling balls and strikes,\u201d Mr. Dellinger said, \u201che must first make sure the batter at the plate is an actual player and not just a fan who ran on the field.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In New York, Gov.

Instead of displaying blue liquids squirting out of pipettes and women in white dresses frolicking on the beach, they are showing real women doing real activities, like working at a computer.\u201cThere\u2019s a sense that this really goes to the heart of women\u2019s opportunity to participate fully in school, in the economy, in society, and we need to do something about it,\u201d said Jennifer Weiss-Wolf, a vice president at the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University Law School.\u201cMenstrual products are expensive, and it\u2019s absolutely debilitating if you don\u2019t have access to them,\u201d she said.Businesses and politicians are taking their cue from a growing effort to talk more openly about periods, with much of it happening online.\u201cThere was a reframe,\u201d she added, \u201cwhich was: \u2018Hey, that insult doesn\u2019t stick because there\u2019s nothing shameful about periods. And by the way, let\u2019s fix that.\u2019\u201dSince the start of the 2016 state legislative calendar, bills to exempt tampons and pads from sales tax have been introduced or resurrected in California, Connecticut, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, Rhode Island, Virginia, the District of Columbia and Wisconsin, and have passed in Mississippi and New York, largely with bipartisan support. Similar legislation is being discussed in committees in South Carolina and Tennessee. Last month, Chicago passed an ordinance to eliminate the city\u2019s portion of the tax. In Utah, an all-male committee of lawmakers shut down a proposal to get rid of the state\u2019s tampon tax.If the suit is successful, women in New York could receive rebates for the last two years of taxes paid on menstrual products, an amount that most likely adds up to about $28 million over all, according to the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers. The women would continue to push for the refunds even after Governor Cuomo repealed the tax, they said.\u201cTampons and sanitary pads are a necessity for women, not a luxury,\u201d said Zoe Salzman, a lawyer for the women. \u201cThere is no way these products would be taxed if men had to use them.\u201dJames Gazzale, a spokesman for the New York State Taxation and Finance Department, said he could not comment on continuing litigation.\u201cIn terms of growth, you\u2019re basically just looking at population growth,\u201d said Jabel Parayil, an analyst at Euromonitor. \u201cThese manufacturers are trying to drive added value through advertising rather than true technological value. The new trends are really coming from the smaller companies.\u201dMiki Agrawal, a co-founder of Thinx, said conventional period products and marketing \u201cmake women uncomfortable, not sexy, not like themselves and not in their full power.\u201cIt\u2019s awful.\u201dThe flurry of start-up activity has come as fresh competition for the big-name pad and tampon makers. Kanchan Patkar, brand director for Kimberly-Clark\u2019s Kotex brand, which logged global sales of more than $1 billion last year, said the traditional brands had not ignored feminine care.In an interview, Ms. Patkar listed a string of Kotex innovations over the years: panty liners for light days, compact tampon applicators, 3-D modeling of pads for a better fit and ultrathin pads that she says have reduced the bulkiness of period pads by 67 percent.Ms. Patkar says that Kotex also overhauled how it talks about periods. Its U by Kotex tampons and liners have abandoned their medicinal pale packaging for bold colors and designs.And the brand has moved away from what Ms. Patkar said was frivolous advertising of women with periods frolicking in white dresses. Some of its most recent ads feature women in a college dorm room, at a computer and Skyping with friends.\u201cWe decided to call out the truth,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have cramps. You have bloating. You don\u2019t feel like jumping around in a field or doing extreme sports. And that\u2019s O.K.\u201dStill, as some of the start-ups have found, the topic is still not always easy to discuss.When Alexandra Friedman and Jordana Kier pitched their idea for a tampon delivery service to a potential investor last year, they found him wary of discussing the intimate product. So Ms. Friedman grabbed his glass of water, dunked one of her prototype tampons in it and forced him to look.\u201cI told him: \u2018This is what it\u2019s doing in a woman\u2019s body. It\u2019s absorbing liquid, and it\u2019s becoming bigger,\u2019\u201d Ms. Friedman said. \u201cThen we left it in the middle of the table, and we finished eating.\u201dA picture caption on Friday with an article about start-ups that offer improved menstrual products described the material of the Lola tampon incorrectly. It is made of 100 percent cotton, but not organic cotton.An article on Friday about start-ups offering improved menstrual products omitted two people who helped found Thinx, an underwear company. Besides Miki Agrawal, the founders include Radha Agrawal and Antonia Saint Dunbar.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Behind Fake Degrees From Pakistan, a Maze of Deceit and a Case in Peril", "Date": "2016-04-10", "News": "Supported byFourteen Axact employees, including the chief executive, await trial on charges of fraud, extortion and money laundering. Bank accounts in Pakistan and the United States have been frozen. Investigators have uncovered a tangled web of corporate entities \u2014 dozens of shell companies and associates, from Caribbean tax havens to others in Delaware, Dubai and Singapore \u2014 used to funnel illicit earnings back to Pakistan.New details suggest that Axact\u2019s fraud empire, already considered one of the biggest Internet scams on record, is bigger than initially imagined. Over the past decade, Axact took money from at least 215,000 people in 197 countries \u2014 one-third of them from the United States. Sales agents wielded threats and false promises and impersonated government officials, earning the company at least $89 million in its final year of operation.The case against Axact, which at first seemed a rare instance in which tycoons with powerful connections were being held to criminal account, has increasingly appeared in recent months to be in jeopardy.The leading prosecutor quit with little explanation, hinting that he had come under political pressure to soft-pedal the case. A trial date for the company\u2019s executives has not been set, and several judges have dropped out of the case. Some media analysts, noting that Axact\u2019s jailed chief executive, Shoaib Ahmed Shaikh, has publicly boasted of his work for the Pakistani military, speculate that his powerful connections may yet work in his favor.\u201cThere\u2019s been a huge amount of speculation and analysis and deep-throated conspiracy theories,\u201d said Hasan Zaidi, a filmmaker and media analyst based in Karachi.\u201cInitially, there was a lot of surprise that Axact\u2019s operations were being tackled so quickly, particularly given the view that it was being backed by the boys,\u201d he added, using a common euphemism for the military\u2019s Inter-Services Intelligence spy agency. \u201cBut now the interest has died down, and I don\u2019t think it will ever be solved \u2014 even through a court case.\u201dAxact had been in business for nearly 10 years at the time of the arrests in May, and the company and its founder appeared ever more eager to step into the public spotlight, seemingly unconcerned about the risk. Most prominently, Axact was preparing to introduce Bol, a television network with 2,200 employees that had started test transmissions in the days before the police raids.Comparing himself to Microsoft\u2019s Bill Gates, Mr. Shaikh had touted Axact as Pakistan\u2019s leading software exporter. He laid out an ambitious plan to provide education for millions of Pakistani children, and he wreathed himself in patriotism: In the corner of his office, near a passage leading to a bedroom and a private swimming pool, the eagle-crested Axact company flag stood alongside a furled Pakistani standard.Once the police investigation began, Mr. Shaikh instructed subordinates to burn company documents at a vacant lot and to destroy computer drives, some of which were later cast into the sea, another executive testified to the police.But Mr. Shaikh could not prevent the seizure of a vast trove of data, some recovered from computer disks as they were being deleted, that led investigators to conclude that Axact\u2019s main business was providing fake degrees.The police found more than one million blank educational certificates and evidence of 300 fictitious educational websites, many with American-sounding names like Columbiana and Brooklyn Park, that sold fake degrees to hundreds of thousands of people around the world. Some knowingly bought effortless degrees to pad r\u00e9sum\u00e9s or to help in immigration, and a handful have been publicly embarrassed.Many other customers, investigators quickly realized, had fallen victim to an elaborate and aggressive fraud, going to Axact-run websites for a legitimate online education only to be intimidated into making ever larger payments.Hundreds of hours of taped phone conversations, extracted from Axact servers and cited by prosecutors, showed sales agents impersonating American lawyers or State Department officials in an effort to collect more money from customers, mostly in the Middle East.In one recording from 2014, Riaz Ahmed Shaikh, a Pakistani living in Abu Dhabi, pleaded for respite from \u201cJacob\u201d \u2014 a man who he believed was calling from the legal office of a university in California but was in fact an Axact sales agent in Karachi, according to police records.\u201cPlease, please, Mr. Jacob,\u201d said Mr. Shaikh, who said he had already paid $150,000 to Axact. \u201cI have sold all of my assets to pay this last amount. I am not eating well. I am not sleeping well.\u201d\u201cLook, you\u2019re not paying that much,\u201d the sales agent cajoled, before holding out a threat of possible police action. \u201cJust another $10,000.\u201dAxact executives took extraordinary measures to disguise their links to fraud. In a lawsuit in the United States, in which former customers of the online Belford High School were seeking damages, Axact officials persuaded an attendant in the company\u2019s cafeteria to pose as the founder of the school, a police report said.The worker, Salem Kureshi, conducted a webcam video deposition in 2011 for the American court. In it, he merely moved his lips while, off camera, an Axact official voiced a set of evasive answers for the American lawyers, Mr. Kureshi told the police.After the police raided Axact last year, Mr. Kureshi added, executives paid him $250 to go into hiding in his hometown, 700 miles from Karachi.In Pakistan, the plight of Axact\u2019s victims has been largely overshadowed by the media furor surrounding the Bol network, which had hired some of the country\u2019s most prominent journalists before it closed. With their salaries suddenly cut off, many employees took to the streets to protest, saying Axact was the victim of a conspiracy by rival news organizations.Shoaib Ahmed Shaikh insists that he earned his wealth through legitimate software exports. He has hired Shaukat Hayat, a lawyer whose client list includes Pervez Musharraf, the former Pakistan president, to defend him.In a telephone interview, Mr. Hayat said the case against Mr. Shaikh and his fellow executives had been cooked up by the news media. \u201cThey have not committed any illegal action,\u201d he said.Mr. Shaikh also faces scrutiny from American investigators. In a letter to the Pakistani authorities in February, United States officials said the F.B.I. had identified Axact as a \u201cdiploma mill\u201d that operated a \u201cworldwide web of shell companies and associates.\u201d Three of the main shell companies, registered in Delaware, were found to have been owned by Mr. Shaikh or his associates, the letter said.Other company documents point to shell holdings in the British Virgin Islands, Cyprus, Dubai and Panama. In several instances, Mr. Shaikh appears to have used a pseudonym, Ryan Jones, to sign company documents. He became a citizen of St. Kitts and Nevis, a small Caribbean island that sells passports to rich investors.In the Belford case, lawyers have obtained a court order freezing three American bank accounts containing $675,000. In a sworn statement, Mr. Shaikh admitted ownership of some of those accounts.His sister, Uzma Shaheen, who lives in Chicago, has been called to testify. Documents filed in court show that Ms. Shaheen transferred more than $37 million from American bank accounts to Axact in Pakistan in recent years.Still, much of Axact\u2019s global network remains undisrupted. It controls 32 other bank accounts \u2014 in the United States, Ireland, Dubai, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Belize, and Singapore \u2014 that are thought to contain millions of dollars, according to prosecution documents.And in Pakistan, the case has run into quicksand. Two judges have recused themselves without explanation; so has Zahid Jamil, an ambitious prosecutor who built much of the case against Axact but quit abruptly in February, citing unspecified circumstances \u201cthat make it impossible for me to proceed further.\u201dContacted by phone, Mr. Jamil declined to comment.Nighat Dad of the Digital Rights Foundation, an Internet advocacy group in Pakistan, said the Axact case showed that good laws also needed political will if they were to succeed.\u201cIf the evidence is so clear, and there is so much of it, then why is the case against Axact taking so long?\u201d she asked. \u201cSomething must be happening behind closed doors.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Regulators Warn 5 Top Banks They Are Still Too Big to Fail", "Date": "2016-04-13", "News": "Supported byThe nation\u2019s top bank regulators have added an unexpected voice to the growing chorus of critics worried that the biggest American banks, nearly eight years after the financial crisis, are still too big to fail.The Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said on Wednesday that five of the nation\u2019s eight largest banks \u2014 including JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America \u2014 did not have \u201ccredible\u201d plans for how they would wind themselves down in a crisis without sowing panic.That suggests that if there were another crisis today, the government would need to prop up the largest banks if it wanted to avoid financial chaos.The announcement coincides with a presidential campaign that at times has been dominated by a debate over what danger the big banks still pose to the nation\u2019s economic security. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has called for the biggest banks to be broken up, a stand that his opponent, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, Hillary Clinton, has criticized.But Mr. Sanders\u2019 position has drawn sympathy from some on the other side of the political spectrum, including the new president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Neel Kashkari, who was a Treasury official during the financial crisis.In long letters sent to the banks this week, the two regulatory agencies pointed to the dangers created by the global reach and complexity of the largest banks, which are bigger now than they were before the 2008 crisis.The current arrangement could \u201cpose serious adverse effects to the financial stability of the United States,\u201d the regulators said in their letter to JPMorgan.The regulators this week did not come close to calling for a breakup, yet they did in effect provide backing for Mr. Sanders\u2019s premise that not enough has been done to safeguard the financial system.\u201cThe goal to end too big to fail and protect the American taxpayer by ending bailouts remains just that: only a goal,\u201d Thomas M. Hoenig, the vice chairman of the F.D.I.C., said in a statement.The regulators were responding to the so-called living wills that banks must submit to regulators on a regular basis to explain how the banks plan to enter bankruptcy in an orderly fashion in case of a crisis. The living wills are a requirement of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul, intended to help make large financial institutions less of a threat to the wider economy.The Fed and the F.D.I.C., which jointly oversee the largest banks, agreed that the plans put forward by five of the big banks, JPMorgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, State Street and Bank of New York Mellon, were \u201cnot credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\u201dOnly one of the biggest banks, Citigroup, was given a passing grade by both agencies, though it too was told that its plans needed improvements. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley received passing grades from only one of the two agencies.Barney Frank, the former Massachusetts congressman who was one of the architects of the Dodd-Frank law, said on Wednesday that the rejection of the living wills indicated that the regulators believed they still have more to do to tackle the too-big-to-fail issue. But he added that the regulators were showing resolve.\u201cIt sends a message,\u201d Mr. Frank said in an interview. \u201cIt signals that they are serious.\u201dIn recent weeks, Mr. Frank has criticized the financial overhaul proposals by Mr. Sanders. Mr. Frank contends that some of the plans to break up the banks are simplistic because they take a one-size-fits-all approach. In contrast, he said, measures like the living wills allow regulators to press for banks to shrink, based on specific conditions at those firms.The five banks that received rejections have until Oct. 1 to fix their plans.After those adjustments, if the Fed and the F.D.I.C. are still dissatisfied with the living wills, they may impose restrictions on the banks\u2019 activities or require the banks to raise their capital levels, which in practice means using less borrowed money to finance their business.And if, after two years, the regulators still find the plans deficient, they may require the banks to sell assets and businesses, with the aim of making them less complex and simpler to unwind in a bankruptcy.\u201cObviously we were disappointed,\u201d Marianne Lake, chief financial officer of JPMorgan, said on Wednesday morning.The letter also said that JPMorgan did not have a good plan to wind down its outstanding derivative contracts if other banks stopped trading with it.It is shaping up to be another grim year for the nation\u2019s biggest banks. They were hit hard by a bad environment for trading and deal-making.Ms. Lake said \u201cthere\u2019s going to be significant work to meet the expectations of regulators.\u201d But she also expressed confidence that the bank could do so without significantly changing how it does business.Investors appeared to agree that the verdicts from regulators did not endanger the banks\u2019 current business models. Shares of all of the big banks rose on Wednesday.The agencies criticized Wells Fargo\u2019s governance and legal structure, and faulted it for \u201cmaterial errors,\u201d which, the regulators said, raised questions about whether the bank has a \u201crobust process to ensure quality control and accuracy.\u201dIn a statement, Wells Fargo said it was disappointed and added, \u201cWe understand the importance of these findings, and we will address them as we update our plan.\u201dThe banking industry has complained that the process of submitting living wills is complex and hard to complete and it has suggested changes.\u201cA useful process reform might be to do living wills every two or three years, instead of annually,\u201d said Tony Fratto, a partner at Hamilton Place Strategies, a public relations firm that works with the banks. \u201cThe time required for banks to produce them and regulators to react to them is clearly too tight.\u201dBut Martin J. Gruenberg, the chairman of the F.D.I.C., said on Wednesday that regulators were \u201ccommitted to carrying out the statutory mandate that systemically important financial institutions demonstrate a clear path to an orderly failure under bankruptcy at no cost to taxpayers.\u201d\u201cToday\u2019s action is a significant step toward achieving that goal,\u201d he added.Advertisement"}

Trump says the abstruse Republican delegate system distorts the will of the people.Senator Ted Cruz says the party\u2019s nominating rules have been in place from the beginning.Mr. Cruz is right, and he may be losing the public argument anyway.With polls showing a strong preference for nominating the candidate with the most popular votes \u2014 even if he fails to secure a majority of delegates before the convention in July \u2014 Mr. Cruz has brushed up this week against an uncomfortable reality: His only road to victory is a messy one.As he slogs through a merciless stretch of the primary calendar, straining to pick off delegates from Northeastern voters who seem disinclined to embrace his hard-line conservatism, Mr. Cruz, of Texas, has appeared increasingly frustrated amid questions about his path.He has lashed out at Sean Hannity of Fox News, a onetime friend in conservative news media whom Cruz allies have accused of cozying up to Mr. Trump.\u201cI cannot help that the Donald Trump campaign does not seem capable of running a lemonade stand,\u201d Mr. Cruz said in a radio interview Tuesday, after telling an angered Mr. Hannity that his questions about the delegate system were a concern only to \u201chard-core Donald Trump supporters.\u201dMr. Cruz has struggled to formulate a concise argument rebutting Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that the top vote-getter deserves the nomination, alternately citing the number of former Republican presidential hopefuls now supporting him, general election polls and Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201chard ceiling\u201d of support.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.\u201cWe want to win, Republicans want to win,\u201d he said, before turning to a new talking point: Even Abraham Lincoln, the greatest Republican of them all, lagged in delegates at the outset of the party\u2019s 1860 convention.Mr. Cruz and his aides have also chafed recently at what they view as insufficient news media attention to his success in state delegate elections \u2014 feats of organizational strength that have heightened his chances of beating Mr. Trump at a contested convention. (If no candidate wins 1,237 delegates on the first convention ballot, which largely reflects the primary and caucus votes, many delegates will be unbound and able to switch on subsequent ballots.)At a rally in Maryland on Thursday, Mr. Cruz knocked the \u201cbreathless coverage\u201d of Mr. Trump\u2019s blowout victory in New York.\u201cGoodness gracious!\u201d he said, impersonating television networks. \u201cDonald Trump won his home state!\u201dFor the most part, the Cruz campaign has dismissed concerns about the public\u2019s perception of the nominating process, with aides questioning whether the wording of the NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey truly captured voter sentiment.Bob Vander Plaats, an Iowa religious leader and a national chairman for Mr. Cruz, said Mr. Trump\u2019s complaints had heightened doubts about his managerial acumen.\u201cThey\u2019re just completely irrelevant. They\u2019re a waste of time and money,\u201d Mr. Vander Plaats said of the polls. \u201cIt is not being stolen. Every state has their own rules. If anything, I think it\u2019s an admission on Trump\u2019s part that he went into a presidential campaign without understanding the rules.\u201dStuart Stevens, the chief strategist for Mitt Romney in 2012, said that many aspects of the primary process \u2014 holding the first contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, for instance \u2014 would appear widely unpopular if posed to voters in a poll.\u201cNone of this tests well,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a bowling league. Do the rules of bowling make sense?\u201dBut other Republicans, even those disinclined to support Mr. Trump initially, have worried about the appearance of denying Mr. Trump the nomination on technical grounds.Anthony Scaramucci, a member of Mr. Romney\u2019s New York finance team in 2012, said his party remained in denial about its voters\u2019 preferences.\u201cThere\u2019s the spirit of something, and then there\u2019s the letter of something,\u201d he said. \u201cI was a Scott Walker supporter. And then I was a Jeb Bush supporter. So I feel like I have some level of credibility. Donald Trump may not have been my first choice, but if he is in fact the people\u2019s choice, I think my establishment friends are making a very big mistake by not acknowledging that.\u201dMr. Cruz, who had argued for months that he could win a majority of delegates before the summer, has bowed to the math this week, acknowledging that a convention is his only option as he seeks to keep Mr. Trump from clinching the nomination.Mr. Cruz has targeted Maryland and Pennsylvania, two of the five states that vote on Tuesday, as potential sources of delegates, and is holding rallies in both states. But his campaign views two other contests as more critical: Indiana, which votes on May 3, and California \u2014 \u201cthe big enchilada,\u201d Mr. Cruz said \u2014 which votes on June 7, the last day of primaries.In a sign of Indiana\u2019s importance, Mr. Cruz campaigned there Thursday, ordering a pastrami sandwich at an Indianapolis deli and quoting the movie \u201cHoosiers\u201d at a state party dinner. He also met with Gov. Mike Pence.The senator has warned reporters against underestimating him.\u201cAt every stage in this primary, folks in the press have reported that we couldn\u2019t win,\u201d he said in Florida, \u201cand then we won over and over and over again.\u201dJonathan Martin contributed reporting from Hollywood, Fla.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chicago Set to Pay $6 Million in Deaths of 2 Men After Arrests", "Date": "2016-04-11", "News": "Supported byCHICAGO \u2014 This city moved Monday toward paying more than $6 million in settlements to the families of two men who died after being taken into police custody, frustrating City Council members who said such cases showed the need for urgent changes to police training and discipline.\u201cWe come here settlement after settlement after settlement, and we never hear termination,\u201d said Alderman Anthony A. Beale, who represents part of the South Side.\u201cWe\u2019re spinning our wheels here. We need to start firing some of these people.\u201dIn both cases, the city\u2019s Independent Police Review Authority has an open investigation, though no officers have been fired or criminally charged.The settlements were advanced without objection by the City Council\u2019s Finance Committee after a lengthy hearing in which aldermen questioned Mayor Rahm Emanuel\u2019s top lawyer and the Police Department\u2019s chief of internal affairs.At Monday\u2019s hearing, Alderman Carrie M. Austin said she knew Mr. Coleman, and recalled him as \u201ca role model to the young men in our area.\u201d Ms. Austin criticized how the city lawyer, Stephen R. Patton, characterized Mr. Coleman\u2019s mental health problems. She said the Police Department \u201chad a deaf ear\u201d when she tried to assist the family and suggested that the Colemans deserved more money than the agreed-to settlement.\u201cTo be snuffed out \u2014 4.9 ain\u2019t enough for me,\u201d Ms. Austin said. \u201cIt is absolutely not enough. But as an elected official, I have to go with that decision.\u201dAbuses by the Chicago police, and the large sums the city pays out to settle alleged misconduct, gained broad attention last year after the City Council approved a $5 million settlement in the death of Laquan McDonald, a black 17-year-old shot and killed by Officer Jason Van Dyke in 2014.The McDonald settlement came months before Officer Van Dyke was charged with murder and city officials released police dashboard camera video of the shooting, setting off weeks of protests.But there have also been changes, and city officials sought to highlight them during Monday\u2019s hearing. More officers have received crisis-intervention training to assist the mentally ill, all patrol officers will soon carry Tasers and more than 450 body cameras were shipped to Chicago recently as the department tests those devices. Mr. Johnson, the interim superintendent, has said he plans to wear one.Still, deaths like Mr. Coleman\u2019s and Mr. Cook\u2019s continue to haunt the Police Department.In December, city officials released video of Mr. Coleman\u2019s limp body being handled roughly and dragged, about three years after the episode and at the height of the protests over Mr. McDonald\u2019s death. The county medical examiner ultimately ruled that an allergic reaction to a medication had caused his death, but Mr. Coleman\u2019s lawyers contended that the repeated use of a Taser had contributed.On Monday, Mr. Patton, the city lawyer, urged aldermen to approve the settlement, citing the \u201chorrific video\u201d and warning that if the case went to trial a jury might find against the city.In the case of Mr. Cook, Mr. Patton said, two officers chased the young man after he fled a traffic stop. Officers recovered a gun after the foot chase, Mr. Patton said, and handcuffed Mr. Cook, who complained he was having an asthma attack and asked to use the inhaler in his pocket.Mr. Patton said the two officers, who both had just completed their probationary period at the time, claimed they helped Mr. Cook use the inhaler. But Mr. Patton said that several witnesses disputed that, and that some said the officers had taunted Mr. Cook with the inhaler even as he screamed that he could not breathe. He died later in the hospital.Alderman Edward M. Burke said the case could be \u201ca clear violation of one\u2019s humanity toward fellow man.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The relative lack of new entrants trying to address problems faced by the less wealthy is caused, in no small part, by the lack of familiarity with these problems among young, largely affluent entrepreneurs like Mr. Chen, a 28-year-old former engineer at Facebook.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to solve a problem you don\u2019t understand,\u201d he said.The companies in the Financial Solutions Lab first gathered last July.

In the months after, the companies gathered several more times to get guidance on how to build affordable financial services while still adhering to the manifold regulations that fall on the financial industry.The lab has had to strike a difficult balance of finding start-ups that want to serve low-income people without overcharging them and making their problems worse. Many payday lenders and prepaid card suppliers say they exist to help their clients, but end up preying on their financial vulnerability.Ryan Falvey, the director of the lab, said that among the 300 applicants to the program last year, many did not meet the Center for Financial Services Innovation\u2019s guiding principles of encouraging inclusion, upward mobility and positive consumer behavior. \u201cThere are a lot of products out there that are at odds with the consumer,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can make a lot of money, and the consumer can find themselves in worse and worse shape.\u201dAscend provides loans of a few thousand dollars to borrowers who fall between the prime and subprime categories.

Another participant in the lab was a nonprofit from Manhattan that is trying to build a mobile phone app, PayGoal, to help clients make better financial decisions.Mr. Chen said Chase executives spent hours helping him and his two co-founders understand the entire route a payment travels after a customer swipes a card at a store. But for Propel the biggest lessons have come from going to poor neighborhoods where people use food stamps.These lessons led his team to change the focus of Propel from helping people sign up for food stamps to making it easier to check the balance in a food stamp account, something that had been virtually impossible from a smartphone.The lessons learned on the street are just the sort of thing that Mr. Falvey, who is now choosing the second class of lab participants, is hoping he can push more young entrepreneurs to pursue.\u201cI think that there is a huge disparity between how most consumers live their financial lives \u2014 quickly, on the edge and with a significant degree of stress, and a lot of distrust of financial service providers \u2014 and the world that many of our financial products were designed for,\u201d he said.An article on Thursday about a program that encourages start-ups to address the problems of people without bank accounts misspelled the surname of the chief executive of Neighborhood Trust Financial Partners, which created PayGoal, a phone app that helps people make better financial decisions.

{"Headline": "Ted Cruz and John Kasich to Coordinate Against Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-04-25", "News": "Supported byIn a statement late Sunday night, Mr. Cruz\u2019s campaign manager, Jeff Roe, said that the campaign would \u201cfocus its time and resources in Indiana and in turn clear the path for Governor Kasich to compete in Oregon and New Mexico.\u201dMinutes after Mr. Roe\u2019s statement, the Kasich campaign put out a similar message. The Ohio governor\u2019s chief strategist, John Weaver, said that his campaign would shift its resources to states in the West and \u201cgive the Cruz campaign a clear path in Indiana.\u201dBoth campaigns said they expected allies and third-party groups to follow their lead, and a representative from the \u201csuper PAC\u201d supporting Mr. Kasich confirmed late Sunday that it would not advertise in Indiana.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.The arrangement is a striking departure for Mr. Cruz, who has in the past rebuffed calls from some Republican leaders \u2014 including members of the Kasich campaign and Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee \u2014 to divvy up states in an effort to complicate Mr. Trump\u2019s path.The move also signals a major shift in tone from the Cruz campaign toward Mr. Kasich, whom Cruz aides have long cast as a spoiler in the race. Mr. Cruz has openly questioned whether Mr. Kasich was auditioning to be Mr. Trump\u2019s vice president.But Indiana, which votes on May 3, is seen as critical to Mr. Cruz\u2019s chances of keeping Mr. Trump safely beneath the delegate count required for the nomination. In a signal of Indiana\u2019s importance, Mr. Cruz has held several events in the state in recent days, giving relatively little attention to the five states that vote on Tuesday, when he is expected to lose more delegates to Mr. Trump.Mr. Kasich\u2019s team had hoped to coordinate in this manner much sooner. Last month, at a debate in Miami, Mr. Weaver broached the possibility with Mr. Roe of splitting the remaining states in an effort to minimize Mr. Trump\u2019s delegate haul. Mr. Cruz\u2019s team rejected the overture, in part because it would have meant ceding the spotlight in high-profile contests, such as New York, in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic states. Mr. Weaver and Mr. Roe reached the accord this time and the two candidates did not discuss it, according to an adviser to Mr. Kasich.What changed between the talks last month and now, according to Mr. Cruz\u2019s advisers, is that there are few states left on the calendar and Mr. Cruz must stop Mr. Trump in Indiana.Mr. Trump\u2019s landslide victory in New York last week and an expected win Tuesday in a handful of Eastern states has demoralized those Republicans hoping to halt his candidacy. They fear that if he wins Indiana after his run of recent success, the appetite and financing to block him in the remaining states will dissipate. Indiana is also one of the few remaining states before California votes on June 7 where there is much indecision. The intervening states either clearly favor Mr. Trump or Mr. Cruz, or they will scatter their delegates through some proportional approach.Public polling in Indiana shows Mr. Cruz trailing Mr. Trump, in part because Mr. Kasich is threatening to win a significant number of votes, particularly in the Indianapolis area, which is filled with more affluent Republicans. Indiana awards delegates based on congressional district results and the overall winner; five of the state\u2019s nine districts include or immediately border the county that is home to Indianapolis.A Fox News survey released last week showed Mr. Trump taking 41 percent of the vote while Mr. Cruz received 33 percent and Mr. Kasich 16 percent. But without Mr. Kasich in the race, Mr. Trump\u2019s lead narrowed to two points.Mr. Trump has faced several setbacks during the delegate selection process, a complex system of rules that was put into place long before Mr. Trump became the front-runner.The timing was crucial, too. Mr. Cruz now will have more than a week of campaigning in Indiana unimpeded by Mr. Kasich. And with Oregon starting its early voting this week, the two camps had to come to an agreement. At this late stage, it is unclear how effective the effort might be at swaying voters, especially if the campaigns do not give more explicit instructions. Unlike a similar gambit last month, when Senator Marco Rubio urged supporters in Ohio to vote for Mr. Kasich to slow Mr. Trump, there was no such request in the two statements on Sunday.Mr. Weaver said the campaign was \u201cvery comfortable with our delegate position in Indiana already,\u201d a reference to success in lining up individual delegates from the state to the national convention. (These delegate will be bound to the results of next month\u2019s primary on the first convention ballot but will be free agents should there be subsequent ballots.) As for why Mr. Cruz\u2019s campaign showed a willingness to deal now, Mr. Kasich\u2019s advisers noted that he was in a stronger position when it rejected the overture that took place over a month ago.As of late Sunday night, a website listing scheduled events for the Kasich campaign no longer included two rallies in Indiana that had been planned for Tuesday.The abrupt change placed some campaign allies in an awkward spot. Trusted Leadership PAC, a \u201csuper PAC\u201d supporting Mr. Cruz, announced on Friday that it planned to spend $1.6 million in Indiana, unveiling an attack ad against Mr. Kasich. \u201cHe just said Republicans have no ideas,\u201d the group says of Mr. Kasich. \u201cHe\u2019s right insofar as we have no idea why he is still running.\u201dMr. Roe said the campaign planned to \u201ccompete vigorously to win\u201d in any other states not mentioned in the statement. But Mr. Cruz\u2019s advisers said he was willing to punt on Oregon and New Mexico, which together account for 52 delegates, because the campaign needed to offer states with approximately the same number of delegates as Indiana\u2019s 57. And Oregon and New Mexico are proportional states, so they are not likely to hand either candidate a significant trove of delegates.An internal Cruz campaign memo last month was bullish on New Mexico, where the campaign said it expected to earn a majority of delegates.For Mr. Kasich, who still trails Mr. Rubio in delegates, the agreement allows them a better chance at winning a handful more delegates going into the convention in proportional states where Mr. Cruz will now not be much of a factor.Ceding these delegates to Mr. Kasich is of little concern to Mr. Cruz now because the senator can no longer clinch the nomination before Cleveland. He is focused entirely on stopping Mr. Trump from reaching 1,237 delegates by the end of voting in June, so whether he or Mr. Kasich were the ones sharing the delegates with the front-runner in New Mexico and Oregon mattered little.For Mr. Trump, who has argued repeatedly in recent days that Republican leaders are conspiring to stop him as part of a \u201crigged\u201d nominating system, the new alliance against him could provide further evidence for his argument to his grass-roots supporters.Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Georgetown and the Sin of Slavery", "Date": "2016-04-23", "News": "Supported byEditorialThe reparations movement, which calls for compensating the descendants of generations of enslaved Americans going back 250 years, has failed to gain traction in this country for a variety of reasons.Most Americans see slavery as an artifact of the distant past that has no bearing on the nation\u2019s present. And even people who are sympathetic to the reparations idea \u2014 and who acknowledge the continued imprint of slavery on society \u2014 have often argued that there is no way to distinguish descendants who have provable claims to compensation from those who do not, partly because enslaved people usually went unnamed in the United States census, which rendered them faceless in the historical record.Bankers, merchants and manufacturers all profited from the slave trade, as did companies that insured slaving ships and their cargo. And more than a dozen universities have acknowledged ties to slavery. Even so, some will find ways to paper over the role that slavery played in their founding and early history.The sale by the Jesuits stands out for its sheer size and the directness of its relationship to the existence and fortunes of one of the country\u2019s top Catholic universities. The names of the people who were taken from the Jesuit plantations in Maryland and shipped to New Orleans are known. The fact that some of their descendants have already been found makes this a particularly salient case in the emerging effort to confront one of history\u2019s worst crimes against humanity.Georgetown is morally obligated to adopt restorative measures, which should clearly include a scholarship fund for the descendants of those who were sold to save the institution.Many people may be startled to learn that the Jesuits were among the largest slaveholders in the nation. But as the historian Craig Steven Wilder notes in the forthcoming book \u201cSlavery\u2019s Capitalism: A New History of American Economic Development,\u201d the Catholic Church was fully involved with slavery in the colonial period. Professor Wilder writes that income from slave plantations gave Catholics the resources to resist colonial-era persecution, allowed the church to survive through the American Revolution and underwrote the church\u2019s expansion.Visitors to the Jesuit plantations, including an Irish priest who visited Maryland in 1820, documented the violence against the enslaved. Some urged the church to get rid of its slaves. But as Professor Wilder writes, \u201cRather than retreating from slaveholding, the bishops built their church by tracking the westward expansion of plantation slavery\u201d after the Louisiana Purchase.At Georgetown, slavery and scholarship were inextricably linked. The college relied on its plantations to help pay for its operations. When the school fell into trouble, the sale of the African-American men, women and children staved off its ruin.Following student protests last fall, the university removed from two campus buildings the names of the two priests who arranged the sale. In addition, a university working group made up of students, alumni, professors and others are studying ways for the university to acknowledge, memorialize and make amends for this history.According to Richard Cellini, the Georgetown alumnus who established the memory project, some of the descendants wept openly when they were told of family histories that had been a mystery to them. As Catholics, some have experienced crises of faith since learning of the brutality of the 19th-century priests. None of the descendants he has spoken with have mentioned money or reparations for themselves, Mr. Cellini said.The descendants want their ancestors recognized in a durable way. Some would like to see a permanent memorial on campus that honors the enslaved families, one descendant said, as \u201creal people with real names.\u201d Georgetown can begin by welcoming the descendants into the university family and listening to their suggestions.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Holocaust Becomes More Distant, Survivors\u2019 Needs Intensify", "Date": "2016-04-22", "News": "Supported byBERLIN \u2014 The German government is negotiating with Jewish representatives to ensure that the thousands of poorest and weakest Holocaust survivors worldwide receive the intensive care they need to live out their final years at home.The German Finance Ministry and the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany continue to hold regular talks but the effort to reach an agreement has taken on a new sense of urgency, because the youngest of those needing full-time care are already in their 80s \u2014 and many others are over 100 years old.With an estimated 100,000 Holocaust victims living in the United States, roughly a fifth of survivors worldwide, their plight has raised concern in Congress, and on Thursday representatives introduced a resolution calling on the German government to do more.Representatives Ted Deutch, a Democrat, and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican, both from Florida, submitted the resolution to the House asking Germany to \u201crecognize the imperative of immediately and fully funding victims\u2019 medical, mental health, and long-term care needs and to do so with full transparency and accountability to ensure all funds for Holocaust victims.\u201d A companion resolution was introduced in the Senate.The German Finance Ministry did not respond to repeated requests for comment.But as they age, Holocaust survivors face increasing special-care needs, linked to the persecution they suffered and the isolation resulting from the loss of family members in the Holocaust.The current round of talks, which opened in January and is scheduled to end by June, is trying to find a way to meet those needs, said Greg Schneider, the executive vice president of the Claims Conference.The German government currently provides compensation for survivors to be cared for in their homes for up to 25 hours per week, based on an assessment of an individual\u2019s need.In many cases, however, that is not enough, leaving mentally and physically frail or forgetful survivors without anyone to look after them over the weekend, or throughout the night.A central element of the negotiations is to move away from weekly caps on hours and to create a more flexible system.German officials have cautioned that for such a plan to be effective, they need to assess what needs are not being met and to structure a program based on a budget that would pay for in-home care of the neediest cases over the next five to seven years.Among the most acute cases are those who suffer from a loss of memory compounded by the emotional triggers that affect many victims.As their memories fail, they often recall their younger lives, when they may have been forced from their homes, crowded into cattle cars and ripped from their parents, whom in most cases they would never see again.\u201cWhen you are a Holocaust survivor and regress, what you are going back to is darkest point of human history,\u201d Mr. Schneider said.He gave the example of a woman in the program with dementia who requires full-time care. Although she still lives with her husband, who also survived the Holocaust, every time he tries to leave their home she starts to scream, \u201cDon\u2019t go! They will take you away, they will get you!\u201d\u201cShe is living in a world where the Nazis are still there,\u201d Mr. Schneider said.In response to a congressional letter written to Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble in December, Jens Spahn, a deputy minister who is leading the negotiations on behalf of the German government, said his country recognized that current levels of care were \u201cinsufficient for those in need of intensive long-term care.\u201d\u201cSome survivors require more extensive care, in some cases full-time care,\u201d Mr. Spahn wrote in the letter.\u201cMany of my constituents are in their 80s, 90s, even 100, and our focus is ensuring that their needs can be provided for,\u201d Mr. Deutch said.\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to help survivors since coming to Congress six years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile we acknowledge that what is being done by the Germans is incredibly generous, survivors\u2019 needs are not being met.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Nor will his followers.Mr. Sanders probably has no more than a 10 percent shot at winning the Democratic nomination \u2014 and that\u2019s if something bad happens to Hillary Clinton or, less likely, if after winning in Wisconsin this week, he scores a huge upset in New York two weeks later and transforms the race.Yet Mr. Sanders, who for the left wing was a consolation choice after Senator Elizabeth Warren wouldn\u2019t run, has a message that will continue to resonate, especially among the multitudes of young supporters.The clarity and coherence of the campaign have surprised even those who sharply disagree with him.\u201cBernie has run a much better campaign than I ever thought he would,\u201d said Trent Lott, the former Senate Republican leader and Mississippi conservative.Mr. Sanders is setting much of the Democratic agenda, forcing Mrs. Clinton to move left by opposing the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Keystone pipeline and by frequently assailing Wall Street. Even Republicans have picked up some of his populist rhetoric.If, as the odds-makers now predict, Mrs. Clinton wins the nomination and the presidency, Mr. Sanders, with two years left in his Senate term, will be looking over her left shoulder.If Democrats, including the next president or the next Democratic Senate leader (likely Chuck Schumer of New York), cozy up to Wall Street, expect a Sanders-Warren barrage. The so-called bank bailout in 2008 probably prevented the economy from going over the cliff. But Mr. Sanders has reinforced a public sense that bankers are making out like bandits while Main Street struggles.One virtual certainty: The next Treasury secretary won\u2019t come from Wall Street.Mr. Sanders also has galvanized public outrage over Supreme Court decisions that unleashed a flood of big money into politics. Most Americans agree with him that the United States system of money in politics is corrupt. Both President Bill Clinton and President Obama gave lip service to campaign-finance reform and then put it on the back burner. Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign ensures that another President Clinton won\u2019t have that luxury.Some of his notions, including higher taxes on the wealthy and a completely government-run health care system, are nonstarters. But the public has moved closer to his view on economic fairness, and his call for free public higher education is a debate that will endure.Mr. Sanders has attracted extraordinary support from young voters, beating Mrs. Clinton by huge margins. These Americans have grown up in tough times, with more limited opportunities. They\u2019re skeptical about the establishment, and the socialist label doesn\u2019t have the negative connotation it does for many older Americans.The question is whether Mr. Sanders will keep these young people politically energized. The last such cause-centric candidate was Eugene McCarthy in 1968, though he basically checked out of Democratic politics after he lost the presidential nomination.Katy Harriger, a political scientist at Wake Forest University who has studied the youth vote, thinks that Mr. Sanders has the capacity to keep them mobilized on issues like campaign financing and economic inequality. That engagement could carry to the off-year elections, when the participation of young voters traditionally drops off. \u201cHe has tapped into something very real and has credibility with a lot of these young voters,\u201d Ms. Harriger said.Unlike McCarthy, whose views evolved over time, Mr. Sanders has been consistently to the left for almost a half-century. Although he started in dingy basements and sparsely attended rallies for lost causes, he now has a national megaphone that he\u2019s not likely to relinquish. He also will have more than two million contributors, mostly small donors, and almost four million \u201clikes\u201d on his Facebook page. In today\u2019s politics, that\u2019s a machine.Advertisement"}

The company also announced that it had secured up to $300 million in financing to pay for day-to-day operations as it goes through the restructuring.SunEdison\u2019s troubles stemmed from its rapid growth across several areas, analysts say. It expanded its financing options with the formation of the yieldcos. It bought several companies as it moved into different kinds of energy projects, including forays into wind, energy storage and residential solar, while at the same time looking to expand its manufacturing operations in large markets like Brazil, China and India.The company\u2019s situation became precarious last summer as investors lost confidence in the alternative energy sector and as SunEdison decided to move into the residential rooftop solar business by trying to acquire Vivint Solar, a deal that drew resistance from the start and ultimately fell apart.At the same time, its relationship to its yieldco subsidiaries frayed. The yieldcos, public companies that exist to help raise cheaper capital by buying the power plants their parents develop, collect the electricity payments and then pay out the bulk to investors as dividends.But as SunEdison\u2019s fortunes tumbled, investors complained that it was improperly using their cash and striking deals that were more favorable to the parent company.After SunEdison was unable to meet its financial reporting deadlines this year \u2014 which hurt it with creditors \u2014 the situation worsened, and TerraForm Global raised the possibility of a SunEdison bankruptcy in a public filing.Its legal troubles also mounted. SunEdison recently acknowledged that it was under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department in several areas.

{"Headline": "The Mirage of a Return to Manufacturing Greatness", "Date": "2016-04-26", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneHalf a century ago, harvesting California\u2019s 2.2 million tons of tomatoes for ketchup required as many as 45,000 workers. In the 1960s, though, scientists and engineers at the University of California, Davis, developed an oblong tomato that lent itself to being machine-picked and an efficient mechanical harvester to do the job in one pass through a field.The battle to save jobs was on.How could a publicly funded university invest in research that cut farmworker jobs only to help large-scale growers? That was the question raised in a lawsuit filed by a farmworker advocacy group against U.C. Davis in 1979.C\u00e9sar Chavez\u2019s United Farm Workers union made stopping mechanization its No. 1 legislative priority. In 1980, President Jimmy Carter\u2019s agriculture secretary, Robert Bergland, declared that the federal government would no longer finance research that could lead to the \u201creplacing of an adequate and willing work force with machines.\u201dThese days, the battle to save American jobs has a different flavor. It echoes in Hillary Clinton\u2019s promise \u201cto win the global competition for manufacturing jobs and production.\u201d It lives in Donald Trump\u2019s call to break Nafta and impose a 45 percent tariff against Chinese imports, and in Bernie Sanders\u2019s rallying cry against trade agreements.\u201cThe observation is uncontroversial,\u201d said Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel-winning economist at Columbia University. \u201cGlobal employment in manufacturing is going down because productivity increases are exceeding increases in demand for manufactured products by a significant amount.\u201dThe consequences of this dynamic are often misunderstood, not least by politicians offering slogans to fix them.No matter how high the tariffs Mr. Trump wants to raise to encircle the American economy, he will not be able to produce a manufacturing renaissance at home. Neither would changing tax rules to limit corporate flight from the United States, as Mrs. Clinton proposes.\u201cThe likelihood that we will get a manufacturing recovery is close to nil,\u201d Professor Stiglitz said. \u201cWe are more likely to have a smaller share of a shrinking pie.\u201dThe shrinking of manufacturing employment is global. In other words, strategies to restore manufacturing jobs in one country will amount to destroying them in another, in a worldwide zero-sum game.The loss of such jobs has created plenty of problems in the United States. For the countless workers living in less developed reaches of the world, though, it adds up to a potential disaster.Japan\u2019s long stagnation can be read as a consequence of a decades-long development strategy that left the nation overly dependent on manufacturing. \u201cThey are focused on a dead-end business,\u201d said Bruce Greenwald, an expert on investment strategy at Columbia Business School. \u201cThey are not eliminating hours of work in manufacturing fast enough to keep pace with the reduction in work needed.\u201dThe richest countries today started deindustrializing when they were already well off and benefited from fairly skilled and productive work forces that could make the transition into well-paid service jobs, as increasingly affluent consumers devoted less of their incomes to physical goods and more to leisure, advanced health care and other services.Poorer countries have more limited options. If the demise of manufacturing jobs in the United States forced many workers into low-paid retail jobs and the like, imagine the challenge in a country like India, where factory employment has already topped out, yet income per person is only one twenty-fifth of what it was in the United States at its peak.\u201cDeveloping countries are suffering premature deindustrialization,\u201d said Dani Rodrik, a leading expert on the international economy who teaches at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School. \u201cBoth employment and output deindustrialization is setting in at much lower levels of income.\u201dThis is even happening in a manufacturing behemoth like China \u2014 which appears to have maxed out the industrial export strategy at a much lower income level than its successful Asian predecessors, like Japan and Taiwan.Manufacturing, Professor Rodrik points out, has unique advantages. For one thing, it can quickly employ lots of unskilled workers. \u201cSetting up a factory to make toys puts you on a productivity escalator in a way that traditional agriculture and services didn\u2019t do,\u201d he said.Moreover, production isn\u2019t constrained by a small domestic market: Exports of goods can easily flow around the world, allowing industry room to grow and giving developing countries time to ride up the ladder of income, skills and sophistication.The natural resources that dominate the exports of many poor countries don\u2019t have these features. They employ few workers and offer little added value. They do not encourage acquiring skills, and they expose countries to violent swings in commodity prices.High-end services such as finance and programming do pay well. But these aren\u2019t the service sectors most poor countries build. A majority of service jobs in most poor countries are generally limited to housework, mom and pop retail and the like. Since these sectors offer little productivity growth and are generally isolated from foreign competition, they cannot pull a nation out of poverty.The first large transition from agriculture to industry in the early 20th century \u2014 well lubricated by public spending on world wars \u2014 liberated workers from their chains far more effectively than Karl Marx\u2019s revolution ever did.The current transition, from manufacturing to services, is more problematic. In poor countries, Mr. Rodrik says, workers may have to pare back their aspirations of development. Who knows \u201chow will political systems manage?\u201d he asks.Note to Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump: A grab at the world\u2019s manufacturing jobs is the wrong answer. Walls will damage prosperity, not enhance it. Promises to recapture industrial-era greatness ring hollow.The United States, though, does have options: health care, education and clean energy, just to name a few. They present big economic and political challenges, of course \u2014 not least the enormous inefficiency of private American medicine and Republicans\u2019 blanket opposition to more public spending.Yet just as the federal government once provided a critical push to move the economy from its agricultural past into its industrial future, so, too, could it help build a postindustrial tomorrow.Advertisement"}

Are patents, which reward inventors by providing them with a government-guaranteed monopoly over their inventions for many years, the best way to encourage new inventions?The question applies to more than how we develop lifesaving drugs. It has acquired new urgency as the world rushes to discover and spread new technologies to replace fossil fuels as sources of energy and stave off impending climate change.The argument is now being echoed in the climate debate.A group of countries led by India argued for transferring intellectual property rights for clean energy technologies to developing nations to accelerate their diffusion.

There is little empirical evidence of the effects of patents on clean energy technology. But the evidence from other industries in which intellectual property protections have been ratcheted up in the name of innovation offers a decidedly mixed picture.Take the World Trade Organization\u2019s 22-year-old Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, known as Trips, the world\u2019s first enforceable deal to protect patents globally. Developing countries were told it would promote their access to innovation. Multinationals would be more likely to sell or license new technologies if they knew their ideas would not be pirated. The deal would encourage foreign investment in local research and development.Tight intellectual property protection can backfire, stopping locals from piggybacking on foreign inventions, discouraging indigenous innovation in less-developed countries.\u201cI do not think we need stronger patents than we have now,\u201d said Bronwyn H. Hall, an expert on intellectual property at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cThere is a large body of evidence that suggests patents are not viewed by firms as key to securing returns to innovation, except in the pharma sector and a subset of firms in other sectors.\u201dThe answer to the conundrum about new innovation and diffusion of existing technology might hinge on what is more important \u2014 spreading existing clean energy systems in the developing world, where energy use is rising sharply, or inventing new ones.It depends, unsurprisingly, on where you sit. \u201cYou do want a pipeline of new technologies,\u201d said Ambuj D. Sagar, professor of policy studies at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. \u201cBut diffusion is the more substantial point, given the time scale in which we need to make substantial progress.\u201dAdam Jaffe, a lead author on the third and fifth assessment reports of the climate change panel who now directs the research foundation Motu Economic and Public Policy Research in Wellington, New Zealand, disagrees. Technology diffusion, he says, is not yet a problem: \u201cToday the problem is inventing the thing.\u201dTo be sure, energy systems are not the same as drugs, which are hard to invent but cheap to make. The most popular technologies being deployed around the world \u2014 like solar panels made in China \u2014 are hardly cutting edge. Finance and know-how are bigger obstacles to the spread of clean energy systems in poor countries than intellectual property rights.Nonetheless, patents are probably here to stay. Still, rich countries will end up one way or another paying to spread clean energy technology among the world\u2019s poor. Why not create a government-supported global fund to buy intellectual property on behalf of poorer nations? Another idea: Finance prizes to encourage innovation to solve poor people\u2019s problems.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Carbon Pricing Becomes a Cause for the World Bank and I.M.F.", "Date": "2016-04-23", "News": "Supported byThe World Bank and International Monetary Fund are pressing governments to impose a price tag on planet-warming carbon dioxide emissions, using economic leverage and technical assistance that institutions like the United Nations cannot muster.The campaign by two of the largest international lenders comes as world leaders have begun to sign the Paris agreement on climate change, the United Nations accord that is supposed to commit nearly every country to take action to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. The document opened for signatures on Friday and will remain open for a year.But the leaders of the World Bank, the I.M.F. and other major global institutions say cutting emissions enough to stave off the worst effects of climate change will not be possible unless all fossil fuel polluters are forced to pay for the carbon dioxide they emit.\u201cThere is now an overwhelmingly obvious scientific consensus that the more carbon pollution we put into the air the more impact it has on warming the massive melting of the Arctic, the cycles of droughts and flooding, the die-offs of coral reefs,\u201d the World Bank\u2019s president, Jim Yong Kim, said in an interview. \u201cAnd to our economists, who have been studying this for quite some time, there is an equally obvious consensus that putting a price on carbon pollution is by far the most powerful and efficient way to reduce emissions.\u201dHe added, \u201cWe strongly urge people to prepare for the carbon pricing that is to come.\u201dTo press that case, the bank has created a Carbon Finance Unit to give financial and technical assistance to countries that are creating a system to put a price on carbon. This is usually set up as a tax on fossil fuels like coal and oil or as a \u201ccap-and-trade\u201d system that sets limits on overall carbon emissions, then allows companies to buy and sell emission allotments sold by the government.The bank is already working with 18 countries with emerging economies, including China, which has received an $8 million grant to develop what is expected to be the world\u2019s largest cap-and-trade program. South Africa and Chile have received similar grants, and World Bank officials are meeting with the governments of Ethiopia, Ivory Coast and Panama to help them create carbon pricing systems.Under the Paris agreement, all countries submitted plans to reduce their carbon emissions, and they are required to update and strengthen those plans over the coming years. Already, about 90 countries have included some form of carbon pricing in their plans. The World Bank has reviewed those United Nations plans, hoping eventually to link the systems into a global carbon trading market.\u201cWe\u2019ve now got carbon pricing on the radar screen in a way it hasn\u2019t been before,\u201d said John Roome, the senior director for climate change programs at the World Bank Group. \u201cWe\u2019re moving from why to how.\u201dThe I.M.F., often seen as the world\u2019s lender of last resort, is also consulting and advising countries on how best to introduce carbon pricing, in part as a way for struggling nations to raise more revenue.\u201cWe can\u2019t make a loan conditional on carbon pricing, but for a country facing a large deficit, we could recommend that they use carbon pricing as a way to simultaneously meet their pledges in Paris and close their deficit,\u201d said Ian Parry, principal environmental fiscal policy expert at the I.M.F.Any policy that drives up the cost of fossil fuels can be expected to generate intense opposition. In the United States, voters \u2014 especially in the depleted middle class \u2014 are leery of the economic pain, and political groups funded by the billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch stand in the way.\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating to watch unelected bureaucrats like the World Bank and other institutions try to leverage their power to force elected leaders to take actions that harm their citizens,\u201d said Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity, a Koch-backed advocacy group.The point of a carbon price is to make fossil fuels more expensive, charging for the toll they take on the environment and guiding markets toward cleaner energy sources such as wind and solar.About 40 countries, including the 28 members of the European Union, along with 23 cities, states and regions around the world, have introduced carbon pricing policies. They cover about 12 percent of the world\u2019s carbon pollution.\u201cOur government has heard loud and clear that Canadians care about standing up for our environment and our livelihoods,\u201d Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada said.Four of Canada\u2019s 13 provinces and territories already have some form of carbon pricing, and Mr. Trudeau hopes to enact a national plan.Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the I.M.F., called carbon pricing the \u201ccrown jewel\u201d of efforts to mitigate climate change.Absent from the statement was President Obama, whose own cap-and-trade bill died in the Senate early in his first administration, when the Democrats controlled the chamber. The bill had passed the House, but many of its Democratic supporters were voted out of office in the Republican avalanche of 2010.Among the 2016 presidential candidates, only Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has publicly embraced carbon pricing, calling for a national tax. Hillary Clinton backs the Paris agreement and has pledged to strengthen Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change policies, but she has stopped short of calling for a carbon price. Both Donald J. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who question the established science of human-caused climate change, have vowed to withdraw the United States from the Paris accord.Still, carbon pricing is expanding at the state level. California and nine Northeast states have introduced cap-and-trade systems. The Oregon Legislature is considering its own trading regime, and a ballot initiative to create a carbon tax is expected to be on the Washington State ballot in November.\u201cWe started the momentum on carbon pricing, and we hope to see it spread across the global economy,\u201d said S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal, the French ecology minister, who helped negotiate the Paris agreement.Mr. Kim, the World Bank president, acknowledged that carbon pricing would come with burdens including higher energy costs.\u201cThese policy reforms may be difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it is difficult, politically. But we are an organization that is completely committed.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mychal F. Judge, the New York Fire Department chaplain who was killed as he attempted to rescue the wounded at ground zero. \u201cHe died praying and taking care of people,\u201d said Mr. Trump.It was a sober turn for the Republican front-runner, who usually speaks extemporaneously. But Mr. Trump is attempting to win convincingly enough here next week to take all of the state\u2019s 95 delegates and steady his campaign, which has suffered from staff turmoil and has struggled to win delegates at a series of recent state contests.With a bank of television cameras and dozens of reporters in attendance, Mr. Trump did not mention Mr. Cruz by name and only glancingly noted that he is \u201cmillions of votes ahead\u201d of his chief rival. Mr. Cruz did not address, let alone repeat, his localized criticism of Mr. Trump, but did allude to the party\u2019s \u201cshared values\u201d at the end of his own remarks.\u201cJobs, freedom, security,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are not 51 percent, narrow wedge issues.\u201dGov. John Kasich of Ohio, though, picked up on Mr. Trump\u2019s paean to New York, noting that he brings his teenage daughters to visit because the city \u201cmakes you feel alive.\u201d Mr. Kasich, who picked up the endorsement of former Gov. George Pataki before the dinner, warned Republicans that the other candidates could not beat Hillary Clinton and would lead to an electoral disaster in the fall.There was little doubt, though, that the audience of donors and activists gathered at the Grand Hyatt New York in Midtown favored Mr. Trump. Many spoke with one another as Mr. Cruz and Mr. Kasich spoke, the din so audible that some attendees sought to hush the crowd by tapping silverware against their glasses.Mr. Cruz has been dogged here by his derisive suggestion earlier in the campaign that Mr. Trump represents \u201cNew York values\u201d and, while refusing to back off his characterization, has been unable to formulate an explanation for what he meant. At a debate in January he said the reference was in regard to the city\u2019s cultural liberalism, but he also pointed to the \u201cfocus around money and the media\u201d in New York.Questioned in recent days about what he meant, Mr. Cruz has sought to shift attention to the policies of the state\u2019s best-known Democratic politicians, like New York City\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio.The dinner marked the first and last time the three Republican presidential hopefuls were to share a stage in New York before the state\u2019s primary on Tuesday. Mr. Trump enjoys a wide lead in every survey of Republican primary voters here. And while both Mr. Kasich and Mr. Cruz have held rallies and media appearances in New York, neither has made an aggressive effort to actually try to defeat Mr. Trump in his home state. The two have left New York to appear at events in other primary states, in Mr. Cruz\u2019s case even going to California, and neither has aired ads targeting Mr. Trump.The two best-financed anti-Trump conservative groups have also declined to spend money against the front-runner here. The groups, Club for Growth and Our Principles, both surveyed New York Republicans, but decided it was not worth the investment when more competitive states are looming in May.Even so, Mr. Trump was loudly attacked outside the hotel, near Grand Central Terminal, as about 1,000 protesters lined the streets to denounce him. A handful even found their way into the hotel \u2013 a building, as Mr. Trump noted in his remarks, he actually rebuilt in the 1970s \u2013 but were ejected by the authorities before the dinner began.Around 8 p.m., the crowd began dispersing, but a breakaway group marched north on Fifth Avenue, with police officers following. At one point the group crossed through Rockefeller Center.Two protesters were taken into custody on West 49th Street in front of the Ambassador Theater.Earlier in the evening, about 100 protesters marched around Grand Central Terminal, carrying red and black flags symbolizing anarchy.

The British chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, described it as a \u201chammer blow against those who hide their illegal tax evasion in the dark corners of the financial system.\u201dThe announcement by the five countries was welcomed by the International Monetary Fund and by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.The United States is not part of the information-sharing plan.

Executive-branch Caesarism has been raised to new heights by the last two presidents, and important parts of the country have responded by upping the ante, and \u2014 like ancient Israelites in the Book of Samuel \u2014 basically clamoring for a king.That clamor is loudest from the Trumpistas and their dear leader. Donald Trump is clearly running to be an American caudillo, not the president of a constitutional republic, and his entire campaign is a cult of personality in the style of (the pro-Trump) Vladimir Putin.But the response to Trump is equally telling. The alleged wise men of the center keep imagining that the problem with Trumpism is just its vulgarity and race-baiting, and that a benevolent technocrat could step in and lead the country out of gridlock and polarization, into the broad, sunlit uplands of reform.Michael Bloomberg sensibly recused himself from this role. But the dream lives on, most recently in the former Politico executive editor Jim VandeHei\u2019s Wall Street Journal op-ed urging the formation of an \u201cInnovation Party,\u201d to be led by our Facebook-Google overlords and our best military minds.VandeHei\u2019s piece was deservedly mocked on political Twitter, but his impatience with the two-party system as we know it is shared across the country\u2019s upper class, from Silicon Valley to the (ahem, Hamiltonian) world of finance.Tellingly, none of these Trump-era enthusiasms involve a reinvigoration of congressional prerogatives or a renewed push for federalism and states\u2019 rights.Quite the reverse: They all imagine that the solution to our problems lies with a more effective and still-more-empowered president, free from antique constitutional limits and graced with a mandate that transcends partisanship.And equally tellingly, they are enthusiasms of the center-left and center-right rather than the ideological extremes. This is obviously true of the people pining for a Bloomberg era, a Silicon Valley-led administration, or a Mattis man-on-horseback presidency. But it\u2019s true of Trump\u2019s constituency as well: While the G.O.P.\u2019s staunch ideologues are mostly voting for Ted Cruz, Trump is winning with Northeastern moderates and blue-collar populists, with voters who may be xenophobic but on many issues are closer to the political middle than to the poles.It\u2019s not that our ideologues are averse to an imperial presidency when their side is in charge. (The theory of Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign assumed a rather \u2026 remarkable level of presidential influence.) But the cult of the presidency is clearly strongest in the American center. This means that political polarization probably isn\u2019t pushing us toward a Weimar moment, in which the only question is whether the far right or far left consolidates a dangerous level of power. Instead it\u2019s encouraging a kind of moderate-middle enthusiasm for crown government, as a means of escape from congressional dysfunction and endless right-left war.The good news for the republic is that this center is itself complex and divided, over specific issues like trade and immigration and then along lines of class and culture. The Bloombergist upper-class moderates fear the Trumpist working-class moderates, and Trump\u2019s middle-American populists loathe the globalist elite right back. As long as that\u2019s the case it\u2019s hard to imagine them finding a centrist Caesar to actually unite behind. (Though they are united in their admiration for the military ...)But even if the risk of a true post-constitutional power grab is low, the arc of our history still bends toward a Trumpian conception of the presidency, which means the limits on its power will probably continue to erode \u2014 justified in the name of pragmatism, of Hamiltonian energy, of the need to \u201cget things done.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll be back, time will tell, you\u2019ll remember that I served you well,\u201d George III sings to his rebellious subjects in \u201cHamilton.\u201dWe still might prove him right.Advertisement"}

As for Republicans, Mr. Nelson said, \u201cThey are not treating it like one.\u201dRepresentative Kevin McCarthy of California, a Republican and the majority leader, maintained on Tuesday that the best way to address the Zika virus was through the regular appropriations process. But he said Republicans needed to know more about the Obama administration\u2019s plans before they could move.\u201cWe have a number of questions that the appropriators have asked for, like what would the money be spent on this year, what is the money you need for next year, where are we on the vaccine?\u201d he told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cNone of these have been answered.\u201dMr. Earnest, the White House press secretary, dismissed such assertions.\u201cThere\u2019s no excuse for them having those unanswered questions when you consider that we\u2019ve already put forward a detailed legislative proposal more than two months ago now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve already participated in 48 hearings in which questions about Zika have been raised.

Some of those refugees formed militias such as the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, and the forest served as their stronghold and hide-out.Bushmeat feeds many of them, and gorillas, which can weigh up to 400 pounds, prove easy and worthwhile targets. To finance their efforts, many armed groups have also set up artisanal mining sites, nearly all illegal.Although the fighting has ebbed somewhat over the last five years, the region today is by no means secure for people or for animals. Eastern Congo \u201cis just tragic on every level imaginable,\u201d said Liz Williamson, a primatologist at the University of Stirling in Scotland. \u201cPeople there have been living through hell for 20 years.\u201dThose trying to protect the region\u2019s flora and fauna are equally at risk. The Wildlife Conservation Society estimates that 170 to 200 park rangers have been killed in eastern Congo since 1996.\u201cThe government has been trying to go into some areas to disarm all these groups, but it\u2019s not an easy job,\u201d Dr. Plumptre said. \u201cIn that large of a chunk of forest, finding people is difficult.\u201dDespite the danger, over the last few years, field teams of local residents, park staff members and scientists have managed to undertake the most comprehensive survey of Grauer\u2019s gorillas ever, covering 7,450 miles of their range. Statistical analyses allowed Dr. Plumptre and his colleagues to estimate a total remaining population of fewer than 3,800.All told, the researchers calculated a 77 percent decline in Grauer\u2019s gorilla populations since 1994, although some sites were hit harder than others. In and around Kahuzi-Biega National Park, for example, there has been an 87 percent decline.Additionally, nearly 80 percent of the total losses took place over just one generation \u2014 a rate three times higher than what is normally needed to officially declare an animal on the brink of extinction. Should this trend continue, most Grauer\u2019s gorillas will be gone within the next five to 10 years, Dr. Plumptre said.While killing gorillas is already illegal in the country, declaring the subspecies as critically endangered would probably bring more funding and support for saving it. Protecting the entirety of the gorilla\u2019s 7,700-square-mile territory would no doubt prove impossible, but Dr. Plumptre and his colleagues are talking with the government and community leaders about establishing two new protected areas that would encompass 60 percent of the remaining gorillas\u2019 habitat.\u201cI think people felt like this was a lost cause and not much could be done,\u201d Dr. Williamson said. \u201cBut now W.C.S. is really pushing to get boots on the ground and create these new national parks, which would really make a difference.\u201dGovernment commitment to saving the gorillas, she added, is essential.There is some evidence that heightened protection and investment could work. In their surveys, the researchers found that one gorilla population, in the highland sector of Kahuzi-Biega National Park, has increased to an estimated 200 from about 130 in 2000. That sector receives the most protection in the eastern national parks, and even welcomes tourists.\u201cThis shows that if you do invest in a site, you can stop the decline,\u201d Dr. Plumptre said.The researchers also plan to set up microcredit schemes \u2014 small loans with minimal interest that are intended to help people living in poverty set up businesses \u2014 and employment opportunities for people from local communities who are involved in mining. Additionally, they hope to establish a certification program for legitimate mining sites.\u201cIf people started lobbying for gorilla-friendly cellphones and iPads, it would force the government of D.R.C. to take this more seriously,\u201d he said.Radar Nishuli, the director of Kahuzi-Biega National Park, agreed that more engagement from people outside the Democratic Republic of Congo was needed. \u201cAll of the world needs to support our efforts to save what\u2019s still left of the gorillas and their forest habitat, and to help the Congo get out of this war situation,\u201d Dr. Nishuli said.\u201cI am optimistic that gorillas can still multiply, to the delight of all,\u201d he added. \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t, I would have already given up this fight.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Tell us about them in the comments.Here\u2019s what else is happening:On Saturday, pull out the rain boots, or winter boots \u2014 whatever you have to keep your feet dry as rain and snow could fall throughout the day. The high is 41.And it\u2019s not much warmer on Sunday, though at least nothing should fall from the sky.Saturday Sunday On this week in 1957, \u201cthe last trolley\u201d car crossed the Queensboro Bridge.For some, it was a bitter moment.\u201cWe regret the passing of the trolley car,\u201d The Times said.Why? \u201cIt represented not only a way to go to work, but also a way to go places to have fun,\u201d according to the article. \u201cIt was, on its own account, a way of having a good time.\u201dIt was the end of the line.As The Times wrote back then, \u201cNew York City does not part easily with its past.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Presses for Open Market for Cable Set-Top Boxes", "Date": "2016-04-15", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama on Friday announced his support for opening the market for cable set-top boxes, singling out the devices in millions of homes as a clunky and outdated symbol of corporate power over consumers, as he introduced a broad federal effort to increase competition.In an unusual step, Mr. Obama weighed in personally on a pending proposal at the Federal Communications Commission, having his administration file comments that applauded the effort to loosen cable companies\u2019 grip on the boxes.The president, in an interview with Yahoo Finance, said it was an example of the kinds of actions government agencies should take in response to an executive order he signed on Friday calling for administrative action to promote competition and to better protect consumers.\u201cThe cable or satellite box is just one example of an area where, because it\u2019s been tied to the provider and you rent it, and consumers spend billions of dollars on it every single year, there hasn\u2019t been much innovation,\u201d Mr. Obama said, adding that the private sector becomes less effective \u201cif we get closed systems or if people are gaming the system.\u201dThe announcements are the newest moves by Mr. Obama to push back against the forces of consolidation and monopoly, and to shift power away from large corporations in an array of industries.They are also the latest to place the president squarely on the side of technology companies \u2014 some led by executives who have contributed to Mr. Obama\u2019s campaigns, hired his former aides and spoken to him often. Among the supporters of the set-top box proposal are companies like Google, Amazon and Apple, which are eager to establish a broader foothold in the TV market.\u201cAn industry that had previously been considered untouchable \u2014 the cable guys \u2014 is now subject to criticism from the president,\u201d said Susan Crawford, a Harvard Law School professor who is a former aide to Mr. Obama. \u201cThis is like weighing in against Big Tobacco or Big Pharma.\u201dCable industry leaders lashed out at Mr. Obama, arguing that he was rewarding political friends and benefactors like those at Google, and undermining the independence of the F.C.C.Jim Cicconi, a senior executive vice president at AT&T, said the president\u2019s move was \u201caimed at muscling Democratic commissioners to support the Google proposal.\u201dThe administration can comment on any proposal by the F.C.C., an independent agency, but it does so sparingly, and it is rare for the president himself to speak out on a pending matter. In this case, his advisers said he felt that the issue merited his involvement because of the broad impact the changes could have on the cable market, one that touches many American households.In comments submitted on Friday, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, part of the Commerce Department, urged the F.C.C. to take a \u201cmeasured and balanced\u201d approach to injecting competition into the set-top box market, including enabling alternative providers to provide their own user interfaces, as well as other features.In a blog post, Jason Furman, the chairman of Mr. Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, and Jeffrey D. Zients, the director of the National Economic Council, called the set-top box rule the \u201cmascot\u201d for Mr. Obama\u2019s new pro-competition executive order.The president\u2019s aides gave no examples of the kinds of rules Mr. Obama would like to see agencies propose in response to the executive order. Mr. Furman said White House officials had already notified the agencies of the coming call for recommendations, so some of the regulations were already underway.The push announced on Friday is in line with Mr. Obama\u2019s promise in his State of the Union address this year to find ways to help workers, small businesses and entrepreneurs. In a report issued on Friday, the Council of Economic Advisers said that competition was declining in many industries and argued that the decrease was having a harmful effect on consumers and workers.Mr. Obama has acted several times to combat the trend, including signing legislation to unlock cellphones, which allows consumers to switch providers while keeping the same device.The Transportation Department has pressed airports to open slots to more airlines, while the F.C.C. adopted rules for auctioning wireless spectrum intended to allow smaller players more opportunities to participate.The report released on Friday listed several areas that the president\u2019s advisers said they thought could be ripe for pro-competition regulations, including so-called Big Data, the consumer information that includes buying habits and Internet browsing histories, price transparency and common ownership of stock by large institutional investors.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dodgers Pitcher Takes a Big Step Up ", "Date": "2016-04-16", "News": "Supported byExtra BasesAs Ross Stripling prepared for this season, his goal was not to make the Los Angeles Dodgers\u2019 rotation and allow no hits in his first major league start. \u201cI was honestly hoping just not to go back to Tulsa,\u201d Stripling said last week before opening day at Dodger Stadium, referring to the Dodgers\u2019 Class AA affiliate in Oklahoma. \u201cI knew we were going to have a lot of guys filter down to Triple-A and that might push guys back to Double-A, and I thought I might be in that mix to go back to Double-A. When they kind of told me early in spring that I was going to Oklahoma City, that was a good thing for me. I was happy to be going up a level.\u201dThen Brett Anderson injured his back. And Mike Bolsinger strained his oblique muscle. And suddenly, with Stripling pitching well, the Dodgers rerouted his path from Oklahoma City to the majors. He fired seven and a third no-hit innings in his debut at San Francisco, then was lifted for a reliever after 100 pitches.The decision to take him out was controversial, but only mildly. Stripling, 26, had Tommy John surgery in 2014 and had topped out at 78 pitches in spring training. He was starting to feel tired and had issued four walks. Stripling\u2019s father actually thanked the Dodgers\u2019 manager, Dave Roberts, for making his son\u2019s health a priority.\u201cHe\u2019s got great command, he\u2019s got repeatable mechanics, and when you\u2019ve got those components and you\u2019ve got a game plan that you can execute, then you\u2019ve got a good chance,\u201d said Roberts, who also praised Stripling\u2019s mound presence. \u201cDid I see him throwing no-hit ball through seven and a third? Absolutely not. But I knew that he was going to compete and make pitches.\u201dStripling\u2019s right arm has a scar, but not many pitches on its medical chart. He did not pitch until his senior year at Carroll High School in Southlake, Tex., and was more interested in basketball until a broken leg limited his athletic options. Unable to play the infield for the baseball team, Stripling concentrated on his arm, learned a knuckle-curveball from a teammate and was a walk-on at Texas A&M.He stayed all four years, earning a degree in finance in 2012, when the Dodgers drafted him in the fifth round. When he realized that his graduation ceremony would conflict with a scheduled start against San Diego State, Stripling asked his coach if he could switch turns with Michael Wacha, the Aggies\u2019 ace and a future St. Louis Cardinal.The coach said no, which Stripling expected; he never even bought a cap and gown. His whole family showed up, anyway, and saw something even more memorable. In his final start at College Station, when Stripling should have been walking across a stage with a fresh diploma, he threw a no-hitter.\u201cIt was pretty crazy,\u201d Stripling said. \u201cPretty wild.\u201dNot as wild, perhaps, as throwing a near no-hitter in his major league debut, a feat accomplished just once, by Bumpus Jones of the 1892 Cincinnati Reds. The last pitcher to carry a no-hitter as deep as Stripling in his major league debut was Boston\u2019s Billy Rohr, who lost a no-hit bid at Yankee Stadium on April 14, 1967, when Elston Howard singled with two outs in the ninth inning.It also gained Stripling a lot more attention. \u201cI had 174 texts when I got back to my locker,\u201d Stripling he said. \u201cNot a ton of phone calls \u2014 my brother, one or two friends who couldn\u2019t make it \u2014 but most of our generation just texts.\u201dStripling continued the strong start to his career on Thursday, allowing five hits and two runs across six innings to help beat the Arizona Diamondbacks. Recognizing Hoover The Washington Nationals added Herbert Hoover to the collection of mascots in their daily Presidents\u2019 Race at Nationals Park last week. For Matthew Schaefer, the archivist at the Hoover Presidential Library in West Branch, Iowa, it is nice to see our 31st president win for a change. Hoover the mascot captured his first three races.\u201cIt\u2019s the only time in contemporary America that he\u2019s running neck and neck with Lincoln and Roosevelt,\u201d Schaefer said. \u201cYou rank the top 10 presidents and you\u2019ll get Lincoln, Roosevelt, F.D.R., different presidents from different times. But you\u2019re never going to get Hoover.\u201dAlas, Schaefer said, that is the fate of the man who held office from 1929 to 1933, at the start of the Great Depression. Hoover\u2019s status as the newest runner in the mascot race \u2014 with George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt, William Howard Taft \u2014 owes not to his record in office.Hoover is included now as part of an educational partnership with the White House Historical Association, which uses a different president each year on its annual Christmas ornament. The 2015 ornament featured Calvin Coolidge, who raced last season at Nationals Park. This year is Hoover, who had strong ties to baseball.\u201cTo us, it\u2019s not about the politics of the president,\u201d said Stewart McLaurin, the president of the White House Historical Association. \u201cIt\u2019s about using the presidents and their families to tell the story of White House history.\u201dHoover is best known to the game for Babe Ruth\u2019s famous put-down in 1930. Defending his $80,000 salary \u2014 which was $5,000 more than President Hoover made \u2014 Ruth quipped, \u201cI had a better year than Hoover.\u201d Ruth had hit .345 with 46 homers in 1929, so it was hard to argue the point.Hoover met Ruth at least once, in 1933, at a football game between Southern California and Stanford, Hoover\u2019s alma mater. Hoover tried out for the Stanford baseball team, and though he did not make it, he was a lifelong fan. He was said to love offense, even advocating a rule change requiring four strikes for a strikeout, believing more runners on base would make for more excitement.Hoover tossed a ceremonial first pitch at a Washington Senators game while president, and again at Yankee Stadium \u2014 at age 86 \u2014 for Old-Timers\u2019 Day in 1960. Hoover lived in New York then, attended many World Series games and knew George Weiss, the Yankees\u2019 general manager. When Weiss became president of the expansion Mets in 1962, he annually offered Hoover a season pass.By then, Hoover was too ill to go to games. He died in 1964, but for a while, his baseball legacy lived on with his quotation on a sign displayed at Crosley Field in Cincinnati: \u201cThe rigid volunteer rules of right and wrong in sports are second only to religious faith in moral training \u2014 and Baseball is the greatest of American sports.\u201d Philosophy Behind a Name The inspiration for the unusual first name of Socrates Brito, the Arizona Diamondbacks\u2019 rookie center fielder, is obvious enough. He is, indeed, named for the ancient Greek philosopher.\u201cMy father picked it out,\u201d Brito said. \u201cHe was thinking Socrates was a smart guy, and he thought of that name. He was saying, \u2018Let\u2019s see if my son can be smart, too.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Brito\u2019s middle name is just as unlikely: Orel.\u201cThat name comes from Orel Hershiser, the pitcher,\u201d Brito said. \u201cHe was one of the best pitchers in that era.\u201dBrito was born in the Dominican Republic in 1992, four years after Hershiser led the Dodgers to a championship while spinning 67 consecutive scoreless innings, including the postseason. Brito said he had never met Hershiser, though, and was not too familiar with Socrates\u2019s writings, either.\u201cI just read a little bit of his philosophy, no more than that,\u201d Brito said. \u201cBut, I mean, I\u2019m the only Socrates in the big leagues. So that\u2019s something big.\u201dThe Diamondbacks signed Brito in 2010 but reduced his bonus to $90,000, from $190,000, after he failed a test for performance-enhancing drugs. Brito made up for that mistake by advancing steadily through the farm system. He hit .300 with good speed (15 triples, 20 steals) at Class AA last season and earned an everyday job just before opening day, when the All-Star A. J. Pollock broke his elbow.\u201cThat can happen to any player \u2014 to me, too \u2014 and it\u2019s sad to lose a really good player,\u201d Brito said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good opportunity for me, but it\u2019s not the way you want to start playing games. You don\u2019t want anybody to get hurt. But that\u2019s how it is, and I\u2019m trying to do my job here and enjoy the opportunity.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Wanted: Cruise Lecturers Who Mingle and Take Good Selfies", "Date": "2016-04-04", "News": "Supported byItinerariesMark P. Hertling, a retired three-star Army general, now gives speeches on corporate leadership. So when a friend suggested he try giving lectures to passengers on a cruise ship, it seemed like a good way for him and his wife to take an affordable vacation.\u201cThey asked if I\u2019d be willing to mingle and do more than just giving speeches,\u201d he said.In an age of social media and more demanding passengers, being a lecturer on a cruise line has moved beyond just giving a couple of talks in exchange for a discounted cabin.Today, cruise lines are becoming ever more selective about those they hire. And the subject areas are moving beyond personal motivation speeches and talks on finance; today, the topics include archaeology, geology, history and politics.\u201cWe get hundreds of applications each month and we need to see a video of the person presenting to a live audience, taking questions,\u201d said Laura Flager, director of the outreach division of Compass Speakers and Entertainment, a provider of cruise line programming.Few make the cut, she said. Instead her team scours the Internet for interesting TED talks, newscasters, retiring ambassadors, professors and others who have the expertise, presentation skills and people skills the cruise lines look for.More than just offering a few lectures, speakers now are told to be ready for a diverse and well-read audience that wants to interact beyond the podium.Speakers unwilling to spend extra time with a guest who wants to socialize day or night won\u2019t last long. \u201cAs soon as you step out of your stateroom, you are in the public eye,\u201d Ms. Flager said.Kiki Hellman, who runs a biomedical consulting business in Clarksburg, Md., with her husband, Alfred Hellman, have taken about 60 cruises over the last 30 years to destinations on every continent. Passengers, Dr. Hellman said, are now more knowledgeable than ever about history, anthropology and archaeology \u2014 and expect more from lecturers.\u201cThey can get some very esoteric questions from the audience,\u201d she said.New technology also places more demands on speakers. Lectures may be streamed to tablets or rebroadcast multiple times on the ship, so visual elements must be strong and the speakers\u2019 presentation must translate well to broadcasting.\u201cPassengers can walk out of my lecture or turn off the TV at any moment,\u201d said John Rennie Short, a cruise lecturer on trips to destinations like Myanmar, \u201cso it better be good.\u201dSome passengers use their smartphones to fact-check a speaker if they think they hear something that seems amiss during a talk.While lecturers were encouraged in the past to socialize a bit with the guests, now it is required, said Douglas Gray, a Manhattan-based consultant. Passengers, he said, want authentic engagement with everyone on board, and that desire for accessibility and openness means that lecturers \u201cstay after the talk and hang out with the participants.\u201d\u201cThey exchange stories and experiences,\u201d Mr. Gray said.Dr. Hellman said that getting to know the speakers was one of her favorite activities on a ship. She prefers cruises with smaller passenger lists, preferably with just a few hundred, so she can spend time with the experts.\u201cThere are so many ways to interact with them over a meal or tea,\u201d she said. She and her husband have even invited speakers to meet them for ballroom dancing in the evening.Dr. Sandy Greer of Spokane, Wash., has taken cruises to Hawaii, Alaska and Mexico. He says he enjoys it most when the speaker \u201cfeels like another passenger, a member of our group.\u201dSocial media has changed the nature of the speaker\u2019s job in another way, Ms. Flager said. The ubiquity of vacation selfies posted to Facebook and Instagram translates to a need for a camera-ready guest lecturer.\u201cTheir ratings often come down to 50 percent content and 50 percent social skills,\u201d Ms. Flager said.While motivational speeches and financial talks have dwindled in popularity over the last five years, demand for anything related to the ship\u2019s destination, whether it\u2019s archaeology, geology, history, politics or culture, has grown, said Tim Castle, who runs a small agency for lecturers in New York and works with luxury cruise lines. The New York Times is among the companies that have worked with cruise lines to offer trips featuring journalists or other specialists as featured speakers.Ms. Flager said today\u2019s traveler considered knowledge of the destination essential to enhance the trip ashore.And the requirements may become even more demanding soon, said Paul DiFilippi, director of enrichment programs at Sixth Star, which provides programs for cruise ships.\u201cCruise lines departing from new ports like China and Brazil have now started asking us for bilingual lecturers and native speakers,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Malaysia Panel Calls for Investigation of Former Head of 1MDB Fund", "Date": "2016-04-07", "News": "Supported byBANGKOK \u2014 A parliamentary committee in Malaysia on Thursday called for an investigation of the former head of the country\u2019s troubled state investment fund and said that the fund\u2019s advisory board, led by Prime Minister Najib Razak, should be abolished.Within hours of the committee\u2019s report, the members of the board of directors of the fund, known as 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB, said they would offer their resignation to the fund\u2019s owner, the Ministry of Finance. The ministry is headed by Mr. Najib, who serves as finance minister in addition to his other roles.\u201cThis has been a difficult decision to take, but we believe it is the right thing to do, given the circumstances, in order to facilitate any follow-up investigations as recommended\u201d by the committee, the board said in a statement.Critics and published reports have accused Mr. Najib of depositing hundreds of millions of dollars in his personal bank accounts, much of it from 1MDB.Some have suggested that he had undue influence over the fund because of his roles as finance minister and head of the fund\u2019s advisory board.The 106-page report, released Thursday by Parliament\u2019s Public Accounts Committee, gave fodder to both sides in the debate.Tony Pua, an opposition member of Parliament who serves on the committee, said the report \u201cvindicated\u201d critics of the investment fund and confirmed that it engaged in \u201cgross mismanagement and wanton neglect of all principles of good governance and accountability.\u201dThe panel called on the authorities to investigate the conduct of Shahrol Azral Ibrahim Halmi, who was the chief executive of the fund from its creation in 2009 until 2013.Mr. Shahrol said in a statement that he had broken no laws and had appeared before the committee on multiple occasions.\u201cI wish to emphasize again that there was no wrongdoing or illegal activity at the company under my watch,\u201d he said. \u201cI will continue to extend my full cooperation, confident in the knowledge that I have done no wrong and have nothing to hide.\u201dMr. Pua went further than the committee, saying that the police should investigate Mr. Shahrol and the entire board of directors.Mr. Pua also charged that 1MDB had hampered investigations by the country\u2019s auditor general and the committee by providing \u201chalf-truths,\u201d withholding crucial information and \u201cdefiantly refusing to supply simple bank statements of its overseas accounts.\u201d Even so, he said, evidence of misconduct was \u201coverwhelming.\u201d\u201cWhat is clear is that there is more than sufficient damning evidence to indict not only the entire top management, but also the entire board of directors,\u201d he said.Mr. Najib, who has rarely commented on the scandal, issued a statement praising the report as \u201ccomprehensive, conclusive and definitive.\u201dHe said the findings rebutted allegations from a former prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, that 42 billion Malaysian ringgit, the equivalent of more than $10 billion, had disappeared from the fund.In his statement on Thursday about the parliamentary report, Mr. Najib said: \u201cHaving reviewed it, I note that the report shows that 42 billion is not missing from 1MDB, as had been alleged by Tun Mahathir. It is now clear that Tun Mahathir\u2019s allegations against 1MDB have been false.\u201dThe prime minister contends that the allegations were part of a politically motivated campaign led by Mr. Mahathir to topple him. Mr. Mahathir, who has called on Mr. Najib to step down, could not be reached for comment.Mr. Pua, who also has called on Mr. Najib to step down, acknowledged that the panel did not conclude that the money was missing. But he said the panel also could not confirm the money\u2019s existence, in part because 1MDB did not provide information about its overseas accounts.Mr. Najib offered no comment in his statement about either the panel\u2019s recommendation that the authorities investigate Mr. Shahrol or its assertion that the 1MDB advisory board be eliminated.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Documents Undercut U.S. Case for Taking Mortgage Giant Fannie Mae\u2019s Profits", "Date": "2016-04-12", "News": "Supported byAs the lawsuit proceeds through Federal Claims Court, documents unsealed in the case on Monday undermine an important defense made by the United States government. Lawyers for the Justice Department maintained early on in the litigation that Fannie and Freddie were in a death spiral and financially weak. Funneling all their profits to the Treasury was a way to protect taxpayers from future losses at the government-sponsored enterprises, the Justice Department said.The mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac remain wards of the state years after the credit crisis receded into memory. Under their original rescue, in 2008, they were required to pay a 10 percent dividend on the money they had drawn from the Treasury.The revised deal, under which their profits are swept every quarter into the Treasury\u2019s general fund, prompted shareholders to sue in Federal Claims Court. Fairholme Funds, a mutual fund company that owns shares in Fannie and Freddie, filed the suit in 2013.Among the documents unsealed by Margaret M. Sweeney, the judge presiding over the litigation, are excerpts from three depositions taken in the case by lawyers for Fairholme. Those depositions center on what the government knew about Fannie\u2019s and Freddie\u2019s financial position in 2012; this is an important question because the government had justified the taking of profits as a way to protect taxpayers who had extended bailout money to the companies.In addition to telling Treasury officials in early August 2012 that Fannie would be able to sustain profits, Ms. McFarland said that Fannie could soon reap about $50 billion in income because of the reversal of an accounting entry, known as a deferred tax asset, required under accounting rules when the company began earning profits again.A copy of the presentation that Ms. McFarland made to the Treasury was also unsealed. It contains 10 years of internal financial projections from Fannie, indicating that the company would not require further assistance from taxpayers.A little over a week after her meeting with the officials, the Treasury announced the profit plan with the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the overseer of Fannie and Freddie.A spokeswoman for the Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Last year, The New York Times filed an amicus curiae brief asking that the judge unseal two of the depositions in the case. She released excerpts from one of those depositions on Monday.But in the deposition in May, Mr. Ugoletti said he did not know whether the Treasury or the Federal Housing Finance Agency officials knew about the potential for the profits at Fannie and Freddie at the time of the sweep.Mr. Ugoletti, who left government in the fall could not be reached for comment.A document produced by Grant Thornton, the accounting firm hired by the government to do financial analysis on the companies, casts additional doubt on the government\u2019s contention that it considered Fannie and Freddie to be in a dire financial condition in 2012, when it changed the terms of the bailout. The document, unsealed on Monday, shows Freddie\u2019s financial results through the first quarter of 2012 alongside handwritten notes from an unknown Grant Thornton employee. That employee noted how Freddie\u2019s profits would require that it reverse the accounting entry, known as releasing the valuation allowance.Since Fannie and Freddie returned to profitability in 2012, they have sent to the Treasury more than $50 billion over the amount they drew down in the bailout. Their profits continue to be funneled to the Treasury each quarter.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "From Wall Street Banking, a New Wave of Fintech Investors", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported byFinance is where they built their careers. Now some of banking\u2019s former stars are pouring millions of dollars \u2014 and in some cases staking their careers \u2014 into new technologies that are shaking up everything from lending to payments to investing.They are part of a wave of investors who sank $17.8 billion into financial technology, or fintech, in the first nine months of 2015, an 88 percent increase from the same period in 2014, according to a new report by Accenture. The three top technologies were cloud, mobile and analytics, the report said.A separate analysis by Citigroup put total fintech investing for all of last year at $19 billion, up from $1.8 billion in 2010.In many ways, the investors are filling a void where the financial industry left off. Traditionally banks have invested heavily in technology, but that activity fluctuates with the fortunes of the industry.Bank tech investing dropped off immediately after the 2008 financial crisis because the banks had to focus on other issues. Regulatory changes since then have forced banks to cut back on riskier ventures, such as trading, as well as the technology investments, like data analytics and electronic systems, that go with those activities. That opened the door to start-up development and the creation of products and services that threaten to upend the way traditional banks work.Former finance executives say that they are bringing their experience to start-ups to steer them on the right path.\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to ruin the banking system,\u201d said Mr. Morris, the former Visa chief and ex-Citi executive, who is now a managing partner at the fintech investment firm Nyca Partners and a board member of Lending Club, Payoneer and CardWorks. \u201cWe help some of the new tech companies understand exactly what the opportunities are and what they aren\u2019t.\u201dToday\u2019s generation of fintech companies are different in that many of the start-ups aren\u2019t developing technology to sell to the financial services industry \u2014 as has been the pattern in past fintech booms \u2014 they are taking their products directly to consumers through easy-to-use mobile apps.The public, particularly younger Americans, has taken to these technologies after the financial crisis eroded its trust in the traditional banking system, says Bruce Wallace, chief digital officer at Silicon Valley Bank. Millennials, especially, are \u201cmore receptive to buying a financial product or service directly from a tech company.\u201dOne concept that has captured a lot of attention is peer-to-peer lending, popularized by online sites like Prosper and Lending Club, which connect ordinary people who want to borrow money with ordinary people who are willing to lend it to them, cutting banks out of the process. The lending sites flourished as banks curtailed unsecured and riskier lending.SoFi brought in Anshu Jain, the former Deutsche Bank co-chief executive, as a board adviser this year and Arthur Levitt, the former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, last year.The firm also invests in Simpl, which makes technology to ease the checkout process for online shoppers, and Two Tap, another online shopping tool that allows users to buy items outside a retailer\u2019s website, by tapping twice on an image of the product on their device.Silicon Valley\u2019s edgy appeal also attracted the former Morgan Stanley finance chief Ruth Porat, now chief financial officer of Alphabet (formerly known as Google). The former Goldman executive J. Michael Evans joined the Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba in 2014, and a fellow former Goldman banker, Anthony Noto, became finance chief of Twitter earlier that year.More recently, the former JPMorgan Chase commodities head Blythe Masters went to the blockchain technology firm Digital Asset Holdings, which just announced a $50 million investment from Goldman, JPMorgan and other banks. And the former card company executives Amit Parikh (Discover) and Gail Hodges (HSBC) joined Apple Pay.Traditional banking isn\u2019t likely to be completely displaced by fintech disrupters, however, said Mr. Wallace of Silicon Valley Bank; the industry is large enough to have room for more firms. \u201cThere can be multiple winners,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Artist Nurtures a Creative Oasis in Conservative Saudi Arabia", "Date": "2016-04-15", "News": "Supported byThe Saturday ProfileYou would never know that from his studio in the Saudi capital. Fifteen-foot walls ring the nondescript house, blocking views into the courtyard. There is no sign or name on the door, which is outfitted with a camera to prevent unwelcome visitors. \u201cEven the neighbors don\u2019t know what\u2019s here,\u201d he said with a laugh.But inside the walls, Mr. Gharem, 43, has created an oasis of sorts for a group of young Saudi artists to whom he serves as role model, mentor and sometime financier. This year, he will lead about 20 of the artists on a tour sponsored by a Saudi government cultural center to showcase the country\u2019s art in the United States, with events in Houston, Los Angeles and other cities.Mr. Gharem is in some ways a curious choice for such a job, having spent his career taking aim at what he sees as the stifling aspects of Saudi life: the byzantine bureaucracy, religious dogmatism and dependence on oil.He is not a political dissident. His longtime day job, in fact, was in the Saudi Army, where he became a lieutenant colonel before retiring in 2014.Despite the limitations, Mr. Gharem remains in the kingdom, hoping his ideas will echo in society.\u201cThat is your role as an artist, to bring out the option that the politician can\u2019t say and that the religious man can\u2019t say,\u201d he said. \u201cYou bring out the solutions that people can\u2019t say.\u201dMr. Gharem charted his own path in a country where the term \u201cart career\u201d is an oxymoron.Raised in the conservative town of Khamis Mushayt in southwestern Saudi Arabia, he liked to draw as a child, but even then he was criticized by those who believed that the ability to render living beings should be left to God alone.\u201cWhy did you draw a portrait?\u201d he said his teachers would ask. \u201cIt was like you were guilty, as if art was a sin you were committing.\u201dAfter high school, Mr. Gharem applied to study art at a Saudi university but was not accepted. Instead, he joined the army, one of the only pathways to social standing for young men from the provinces. He graduated from a military academy and went to a post near the border with Yemen, where there was little to do.The free time turned out to be a blessing, he said, because he had time to read and, after he gained Internet access, to learn about subjects not widely taught in the kingdom, like philosophy, comparative religion, music and art.His first major work was inspired by a rural bridge where villagers had been told by a religious leader to seek refuge during a flash flood. But the water had made the bridge collapse, killing the villagers.Mr. Gharem and some friends spray-painted the word \u201csirat,\u201d or path, on the bridge, a commentary on what Mr. Gharem called \u201cthe culture of the herd.\u201d\u201cI saw how people listened without thinking, like a flock of sheep,\u201d he said.Later, Mr. Gharem stumbled on a fisherman\u2019s community that the government had scheduled for destruction by painting \u201cto be removed\u201d on its houses in red paint. Mr. Gharem painted \u201cto be removed\u201d on his shirt and had a friend take photographs of him walking among the residents and their homes.Mr. Gharem said he had little choice but to comply, but he was impressed that his work had such an effect.\u201cI knew I had to go back to Saudi in a week, and I had a job,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I felt the power I had and the reaction that I could create.\u201dMr. Gharem\u2019s international breakthrough came with an installation called \u201cMessage/Messenger,\u201d a large, golden dome propped up like an animal trap with a white dove suspended underneath. He said it was a commentary on religion, which he believes is beautiful but can be used for ill.In 2011, he put the piece up for auction in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, where an Iranian collector bought it for $842,000, the highest price ever for the work of a living Arab artist at that time.Mr. Gharem was not there to see it. He was at work on a Saudi military base and had no idea about the sale.\u201cAll of a sudden my cellphones \u2014 I had two \u2014 lit on fire, and I didn\u2019t know what was going on,\u201d he said, recalling his friends calling and yelling, \u201cCongratulations!\u201d\u201cFor what?\u201d he said.During a recent evening at the studio, a half-dozen young artists filtered into the living room. The walls were lined with bookshelves and framed artworks, and musical instruments were scattered about on stands.While one young man watched a documentary about Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, the South American independence hero, others worked on projects on computers in the office.In jeans, a faded blue T-shirt and gray wingtips with fluorescent green soles, Mr. Gharem floated among them, looking at their plans and commenting before ordering grilled chicken for everyone and slipping out to head home to his wife and two daughters.Restrictions on their work remain, he said. Male and female artists can be harassed for meeting in cafes, so they hang out in his studio.He has struggled to bring even Muslim artists into the country from abroad, so he tells those willing to visit to apply for pilgrimage visas. And he builds most of his projects outside the country for fear that Saudi customs agents will take offense and impound them.Some of the snags he has encountered sound like practical jokes, like the time he tried to ship a female mannequin from abroad but was told it could not enter Saudi Arabia. In the end, he chopped it into pieces and had friends smuggle them back so he could reassemble the model in Riyadh.His recent works have a darker edge, like a video that shows a young man with a map of the Arab world on his back. His skin is sliced with a razor and suction cups are applied to his skin, filling up with blood.He calls the project \u201cProsperity Without Growth\u201d and would like to show it in Vienna \u2014 near the headquarters of OPEC.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "ISIS Expands Reach Despite Military and Financial Setbacks", "Date": "2016-04-12", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 American airstrikes have killed 25,000 Islamic State fighters in Iraq and Syria and incinerated millions of dollars plundered by the militants, according to Pentagon officials.Iraqi and Kurdish forces have taken back 40 percent of the militant group\u2019s land in Iraq, the officials say, and forces backed by the West have seized a sizable amount of territory in Syria that had been controlled by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.\u201cEven as we advance our efforts to defeat Daesh on the front lines,\u201d Deputy Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken told a congressional committee on Tuesday, using another name for the Islamic State, \u201cwe know that to be fully effective, we must work to prevent the spread of violent extremism in the first place \u2014 to stop the recruitment, radicalization and mobilization of people, especially young people, to engage in terrorist activities.\u201dInstead of engaging a pseudo-state in the Middle East whose fighters have proved susceptible to American airpower, the United States and its European allies must now also engage in a far more complex struggle against homegrown militants who need relatively few resources to sow bloodshed in the West.Attacks in the West are cheap to finance \u2014 Mr. Schanzer estimated that the cost of the materials used in the Brussels attack and the lab needed to make the explosives, for instance, was $10,000 to $15,000. And, he added: \u201cYou can defeat ISIS in ISIS-controlled territories, but you\u2019re not going to defeat ISIS itself. The ideology of jihadism continues to evolve and continues to exist.\u201dWhile some officials have sought to portray the recent attacks in Europe and Turkey as evidence that the Islamic State is growing desperate as a result of its battlefield losses, far more officials and experts see the violence as another indication that the Islamic State is not a problem that will be quickly or easily overcome.Officials on both sides of the Atlantic acknowledge that the Islamic State, which has looted an estimated $1 billion from bank vaults across Syria and Iraq and is widely seen as one of the richest militant groups of all time, remains a resilient and adaptable battlefield adversary, still able to mount spectacular acts, like the abduction of at least 170 workers from a cement factory near Damascus last week.In Mosul, Iraq, and in Raqqa, the Syrian city that is the Islamic State\u2019s de facto capital, salaries for fighters have been cut in half since last year, according to residents and documents. But even with reduced salaries, American officials say, the Islamic State, which collects hundreds of millions of dollars by extortion, fees and taxes on the people it rules, is still paying its fighters.\u201cThere is no simple tool to separate ISIL from its vast wealth,\u201d Daniel L. Glaser, the assistant Treasury secretary for terrorist financing, said recently in a speech in London.Iraqi forces have also retaken the northern city of Baiji, with its oil refinery. And Kurdish and Yazidi forces have driven Islamic State fighters out of the northern city of Sinjar.In recent weeks, American airstrikes have killed what administration officials said were top Islamic State leaders: the group\u2019s minister of war, Omar al-Shishani (Omar the Chechen), and a top commander, Abd al-Rahman Mustafa al-Qaduli. An Islamic State chemical weapons specialist, Sleiman Daoud al-Afari, was captured by American Special Operations forces in February.More than 1,200 people outside of Iraq and Syria have been killed in attacks inspired or coordinated by the Islamic State.At the same time, officials acknowledge that the Islamic State has been able to replace many of its leaders and that taking key figures off the battlefield will not necessarily finish off the group.Alongside the military efforts to disrupt the Islamic State\u2019s finances, the Treasury and its European counterparts are pursuing a number of paths to cut the flow of cash to the group and to keep it from using the international banking system. They persuaded Iraq to prohibit bank branches in cities and towns held by the Islamic State from making international transfers, instead ordering all requests to be routed through the central bank in Baghdad, where they can, in theory, be intercepted and stopped.The United States, European countries and the United Nations have also all sought to add people or companies associated with the Islamic State to financial blacklists.In addition, American officials prevailed upon the Iraqi government to finally stop paying salaries to its officials and workers who live in areas controlled by the Islamic State. The payments totaled about $170 million a year, American officials said, and the Islamic State skimmed off about 10 percent or more of each paycheck in taxes.The falling price of oil, which the militants typically sell on the black market for about half the going rate, has also hurt the Islamic State, American and European officials believe. This time last year, oil was selling for nearly $60 a barrel; it is now around $45.The military said tens of millions of dollars were incinerated, though other American officials and experts were less bullish.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot less certainty about how much money actually evaporated,\u201d said Howard Shatz, a senior economist at the RAND Corporation who has studied the Islamic State\u2019s finances.Whatever the amount, a siege mentality appears to have developed in territory still held by the Islamic State.\u201cThese days, the situation has changed, and there is a shortage of money in Mosul,\u201d Ayham Ali, who sells sandwiches from a wooden cart in Mosul, said in a recent interview.Obaida Nama, a retired engineer there, said he did not think the Islamic State would last. \u201cThe corruption that ISIS is committing is the beginning of its end,\u201d he said.Still, said Derek Chollet, a former top Pentagon official in the Obama administration, \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone is going to declare victory now, nor should they.\u201dThe Islamic State \u201cis going to be a chronic problem that we\u2019re going to have to confront,\u201d he added.Matthew Rosenberg and Helene Cooper reported from Washington, and Nicholas Kulish from New York.

{"Headline": "Borrowing Directly From the Wealthy Can Be a Lifeline for Some", "Date": "2016-04-08", "News": "Supported byWealth MattersJohn Blosser bought a medical device company, changed its products and increased sales to $5 million last year from $300,000 in 2013. It was great that sales went up so quickly, he said. But it became increasingly challenging to manage the time delay between when an order was filled and when it was paid, 60 to 90 days later.John-Anthony Gargiulo had a different cash problem. He had entered an agreement to buy a building for a brewery in Beacon, N.Y., and found experienced brewmasters to run it. He secured a $500,000 development grant from New York State. But the project stalled as he tried to get a loan to close on the building, renovate it and buy the brewing equipment.What saved both men was a relatively new twist on peer-to-peer lending \u2014 borrowing from affluent individuals who are putting up their own money.But that money came at high interest rates. Mr. Blosser borrowed $250,000 at nearly 20 percent, while Mr. Gargiulo paid almost 15 percent on $2.9 million.In an era when money is cheap \u2014 the rate on a Small Business Administration loan is under 4 percent \u2014 these entrepreneurs said they had little choice. They could receive no money from a bank or accept high-interest money from individuals.\u201cWhen you believe in your project, you do what you can,\u201d Mr. Gargiulo said. \u201cIf we had deep pockets, we wouldn\u2019t have to do this. I wouldn\u2019t have chosen to go down this path. But in the end we got what we wanted.\u201dBut one man\u2019s tough choice is another\u2019s remarkable return. In this rarefied niche of peer-to-peer lending, those with money to lend have a chance to earn a high return in a fixed-income-like investment and often have a say in how the money is used and the business is run.\u201cThe basic premise is banks can\u2019t really service any of these guys, but we can,\u201d said Billy Procida, a former general contractor and later a real estate developer in the New York area who presides over a $32 million fund made up mostly of his money. \u201cYou walk into my office and under five minutes you get a straight answer. We do due diligence, but it\u2019s me and my 35 years of experience.\u201dFor the last decade, peer-to-peer lenders like Prosper and Lending Club have offered a platform for individuals to make loans to other people for an array of uses, from paying off medical bills to building their businesses. And those companies continue to grow, benefiting from a combination of the sharing economy with returns reminiscent of the old Roman Empire. The top rate on a loan made through Prosper is 36 percent.Those companies allow small-time lenders to create a portfolio of loans to individuals and pool their risk. Affluent individuals, on the other hand, are making loans one at a time. This would seem to increase the risk, but the lenders say it allows them to know the individuals, monitor the businesses more closely and help the companies get to a point where they can borrow from a traditional bank.With rates that can top 20 percent, even for 12 months, the affluent lenders are filling a specific niche. They say one of their big attractions is the speed with which individuals or funds made up of individuals can approve loans.George Haviland Jr., director of the New Jersey Junior Titans, a hockey club, said he was trying to keep up with the demand for the ice hockey program he runs in Middletown, N.J. The club had bought a sports complex from the town in 2012 and built a 1,200-seat hockey arena with sky boxes.Last year, he said, he started the process to build an additional skating center to keep up with demand but spent over six months trying to get bank financing for it.In January, he said, he was able to borrow $300,000 for eight months from a group of individual lenders to start construction on a rink he hopes to have ready by Labor Day. It took him about three weeks.\u201cThe process for the conventional funding was much longer,\u201d he said. \u201cIt allowed me to start my process without tapping into my own money.\u201dAs building gets underway, he has continued the process with a bank to replace the short-term financing. Until then, the group of lenders, Assure Funding, allows Mr. Haviland to make weekly payments.For these lenders, getting paid back quickly is part of the game and an attraction to the borrowers.\u201cWe\u2019ve had some people who used our financing for capital outlays, then they turned around and found S.B.A. financing and bought out the loan,\u201d said Michael Sinensky, who owns several restaurants in New York and is the founder of Assure Funding. \u201cThey needed to do a deal, and later on they got a much lower rate and we provided the capital to get the deal done.\u201dThese lenders also look at projects that banks might struggle with. That was the case with the brewery in Beacon. Mr. Gargiulo said banks that looked at the project thought it was simply too much money to invest. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t understand the difference between a factory and a restaurant,\u201d he said. \u201cWe said, \u2018We\u2019re a factory. We\u2019re a wholesaler.\u2019 That was the challenge.\u201dMr. Procida said he mostly lends to people he thinks have the right skills and instincts. And he said he liked that Mr. Gargiulo was well known and well liked in the area.\u201cYou only came to us because a bank wouldn\u2019t lend to you \u2014 you had a credit problem or a challenge a bank couldn\u2019t lend to,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cost more than a bank. But we\u2019re a lot cheaper than a partner. Our borrowers use our money for a short period of time, six months to two years.\u201dIf Mr. Procida\u2019s hunch is wrong, though, his money is secured by the real estate. He said he has only taken property a couple of times when someone defaulted. He attributed that to being able to offer advice from the careers that made him wealthy.(Mr. Sinensky of Assure put the default rate with this kind of lending at around 7 to 8 percent.)On a project in Philadelphia, the renovation of the Divine Lorraine Hotel, Mr. Procida arranged a $34 million loan for the developer, Eric Blumenfeld, but he also worked with him to secure $7 million in city and state subsidies.On that deal, Mr. Procida said, he sold $24 million of the loan to a bank, which he expects will provide long-term financing when the hotel is finished.Despite having been a developer in Philadelphia for years, Mr. Blumenfeld said he could not get a bank to finance the renovation. He was grateful for the money, he said, even at an interest rate of around 13 percent.\u201cBilly was the one guy who saw this the way that I see it,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce we get done, he gets taken out, and I\u2019ve probably created $10 million of value just by building it.\u201dMost of the loans made by wealthy individuals are to small businesses, particularly to companies younger than two years. \u201cThere are so many healthy businesses that can\u2019t get loans but are a year old,\u201d said Mr. Sinensky of Assure Funding.When these lenders \u2014 big or small \u2014 step in, they stand to make a substantial return. The borrowers get money they wouldn\u2019t get otherwise, and perhaps a push from the high rate to pay it back quickly.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wall Street Veterans Bet on Low-Income Home Buyers", "Date": "2016-04-17", "News": "Supported byAs the head of Goldman Sachs\u2019s mortgage department, Daniel Sparks helped make the bank more than a billion dollars betting against the market as housing prices began to crash in 2007.Today, he is betting on home buyers who no longer qualify for mortgages in the fallout of that housing crisis.Shelter Growth Capital Partners, an investment firm Mr. Sparks founded in 2014 with two other former Goldman Sachs executives, has been buying homes that were foreclosed on during the financial crisis and later resold to buyers under long-term installment contracts.The firm has bought just over 200 homes from Harbour Portfolio Advisors, a Dallas investment firm that has specialized in selling homes to lower-income buyers through what is known as a contract for deed. In these deals, a seller provides the buyer with a long-term, high-interest loan, with the promise of actually owning the home at the end of it.The homes are often sold \u201cas is,\u201d in need of costly repairs and renovations, and many of the transactions end in eviction when buyers fall behind on payments.The market is growing in part because so many would-be home buyers with damaged credit histories cannot get loans. Banks are unwilling to write mortgages to riskier clients after being fined billions of dollars for pushing borrowers into unaffordable subprime mortgages before the crisis.Last year, the number of new mortgages worth $100,000 or less for homes in the largest metropolitan areas in the United States was at its lowest point in a decade, according to CoreLogic, a financial services research firm.\u201cThere\u2019s a whole underbelly of real estate that\u2019s not through traditional sale,\u201d said Robert Doggett, general counsel for Texas RioGrande Legal Aid and a critic of contracts for deeds. \u201cIt\u2019s not a problem of yesteryear. It\u2019s coming back.\u201dOther Wall Street veterans have entered the scene nationally, too.Battery Point Financial, founded by Jeremy Healey in 2013, is focusing exclusively on buying homes in smaller cities to sell them to buyers through contracts for deeds. Mr. Healey, a former mortgage trader at Goldman Sachs, has $40 million in backing from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, the private equity giant.One reason the contract for deed market has become popular among investment firms is that under many contracts, buyers can be evicted if they default on their loans. That is very different from traditional mortgages, under which the foreclosure process can be lengthy and costly.Shelter Growth, based in Stamford, Conn., has about $500 million under management. The firm says on its website that it is \u201ccreating investments to capitalize on the next phase of the U.S. mortgage\u201d market.Most of the homes Shelter Growth bought from Harbour appear to have been purchased in a bundled transaction in December by the firm\u2019s SG Capital Partners L.L.C. affiliate, according to an analysis by the research firm RealtyTrac. But Shelter Growth has also bought a number of other homes from Harbour this year, with some purchases recorded as recently as last month.Shelter Growth paid an average of $22,000 for the homes it bought from Harbour, according to public filings and RealtyTrac. Harbour, for its part, bought most of the homes in its portfolio for an average of $8,000, through bulk sales by Fannie Mae.The homes Harbour sold to Mr. Sparks\u2019s firm are in two dozen states, but most are clustered in Michigan, Ohio, Georgia, Missouri and Alabama, according to RealtyTrac.One such sale, for $25,500, was for a house in Elyria, Ohio.In April 2011, Harbour sold a contract for deed on the house for $36,300, according to public filings. Under the terms of that deal, the 24-year-old woman who now lives in the house is required to pay 10 percent interest or a monthly base payment of $314 \u2014 a sum that does not include property taxes, insurance or any outlays for repairs or renovations.Under a contract for deed, a buyer gets the legal title to the home either at the end of the contract, which can run anywhere from 20 to 40 years, or if the buyer is able to pay off the balance owed all in one go.After the financial crisis, Harbour emerged as one of the larger national players in the contract for deed market. The firm bought more than 6,700 single-family homes, most of them from Fannie Mae.But in recent months, Harbour has sold more than 600 homes to investment firms like Shelter Growth and individual investors, according to public filings.A review of some of the homes sold to SG Capital found that the contracts used by Harbour have drawn criticism from some housing lawyers because the documents do not provide buyers with a specified time period to remedy a default, give Harbour the right to immediately convert the agreement to a month-to-month tenancy upon a default, and include an arbitration clause for settling some disputes.Through his lawyer, Jacqueline Mallett, the founder of Harbour, Charles A. Vose III, declined to comment for this article.It is unclear whether Mr. Sparks\u2019s firm plans to change the contracts or abide by the terms. Mr. Sparks declined to comment.Another buyer of Harbour homes with contracts for deeds in place is New York Mortgage Trust, a publicly traded mortgage real estate investment trust, or REIT. The firm has bought at least 130 homes from Harbour through one its asset managers, Headlands Asset Management, adding to the mortgage REIT\u2019s relatively small portfolio of contracts for deeds.Steven Mumma, chairman and chief executive of New York Mortgage Trust, says the company, which has a portfolio of roughly $763 million worth of performing and reperforming mortgages, is not in the business of foreclosing on people. He says that the contracts acquired from Harbour were signed two or three years ago and that most of the buyers have kept up with their payments.\u201cWe look at it as a loan, not as an opportunity to repossess,\u201d Mr. Mumma said, with respect to contracts for deeds and homes bought from Harbour.He says the company now uses its own loan-servicing firm to manage the homes and contracts it bought from Harbour, which has partnered with National Asset Advisors, a firm that operates out of a partly empty strip mall on the outskirts of Columbia, S.C.SG Capital, the affiliate of Shelter Growth that has bought homes from Harbour, is licensed as either a mortgage servicer or a lender in 21 states. The firm\u2019s investments typically have focused on so-called jumbo mortgages, which cannot be sold to either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac because they are larger than the underwriting guidelines of the two government-backed mortgage finance companies.Mr. Sparks is much less in the spotlight now than he was six years ago, when he became a target for lawmakers angered over Wall Street\u2019s role in the 2008 financial crisis.At a 2010 Senate hearing that focused on Goldman Sachs\u2019s sale of securities backed mainly by subprime mortgages, Mr. Sparks was questioned by Carl Levin, then a Democratic senator from Michigan. During the proceedings, Mr. Levin pressed Mr. Sparks on why a Goldman colleague had used profanity in an email describing the quality of one such mortgage security that the firm was selling to institutional investors.A somewhat uncomfortable-looking Mr. Sparks responded at the time that he interpreted the email to mean that \u201cmy performance on that deal was not good.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Leaked initially to S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, a German newspaper, the documents have been pored over by a consortium of journalistic outlets, which released a series of articles last week, several about the art market.The documents reveal the surprising extent of art ownership behind such veils. At this point, though, the papers have not established the degree to which these strategies are being used, as some suspect, to manipulate markets, evade taxes or launder money.There may well be plenty of further revelations. At the moment, three cases in particular illustrate just how critical a role secrecy has come to play in the art market of today.According to Mossack Fonseca documents, the British billionaire currency trader Joe Lewis \u2014 or rather, one of his shell companies \u2014 was the seller at the auction, apparently in some kind of partnership with Christie\u2019s. It was all a massive \u201cflip,\u201d a quick resale that was early, if undisclosed, evidence of just how much art was being treated like a commodity.\u201cTo \u2018flip\u2019 an entire collection of that quality is unprecedented,\u201d said the art adviser Wendy Goldsmith, who was Christie\u2019s director of 19th-century European art in London at the time and was unaware of the auction house\u2019s arrangement with Mr. Lewis. \u201cIt was an icon of estate sales, a milestone in pricing. Bidders were buying the Ganz provenance.\u201dPicasso\u2019s \u201cThe Dream,\u201d a 1932 painting of a sleeping Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Walter, soared to $48.4 million. His 1955 \u201cWomen of Algiers (Version \u2018O\u2019),\u201d advertised with a high estimate of $12 million, went for $31.9 million. (Even at that price, it was a sound investment. The work sold at Christie\u2019s last year for $179.4 million.)As revealed by The Guardian, more than 100 works from the 118-piece collection, including those two Picassos, had been bought months earlier for $168 million by Simsbury International Corporation, an entity controlled by Mr. Lewis. The corporation was in some kind of arrangement with Spink, a subsidiary of Christie\u2019s that is now defunct. At that time, the auction house was publicly listed, and Mr. Lewis was its biggest shareholder.The leaked documents state that Simsbury, based on the tiny Pacific island of Niue, and Spink would share the profits if the property sold for more than $168 million, suggesting that they split, with fees, some $38.5 million in profits. The Guardian article does not say whether Ganz heirs also benefited additionally from the sale.Christie\u2019s, which acknowledged its interest in the works at the time of the Ganz sale, has declined to comment on Mr. Lewis\u2019s involvement. In a statement on Friday, the auction house said: \u201cThere is no suggestion that the sale arrangements were incorrect or outside of auction standards governed by law. All necessary financial disclosures were made at the time of sale.\u201dMr. Rybolovlev\u2019s lawyers denied that the divorce had anything to do with his decision to transfer ownership of his art to the entity, Xitrans Finance Ltd., which he had established in the British Virgin Islands in 2002.Mr. Rybolovlev\u2019s wife, Elena, filed for divorce in 2008. According to the article, during the legal battle that ensued, correspondence sent to Mossack Fonseca stated that Mr. Rybolovlev used Xitrans to move his collection out of Switzerland to Singapore and London.In a statement last week, the Rybolovlev family trust\u2019s lawyer said the offshore arrangements \u201cwere set up completely legitimately for the purposes of asset protection and estate planning\u201d and had been publicly disclosed in numerous publications worldwide.On Friday, Swiss prosecutors issued a seizure order for the painting, which the Art Center stores at the Geneva Freeport. The authorities would not discuss their reasoning. A lawyer for the company and the Nahmad family, Aaron Richard Golub, said that the order meant that the painting could not be moved from the freeport and that the company had 10 days to appeal the order.Mr. Golub last week called the ownership question \u201cirrelevant\u201d to the issues of the lawsuit. He said there was no evidence that Mr. Maestracci\u2019s grandfather owned the work in question, a contention the plaintiff has rejected.Doreen Carvajal and Graham Bowley contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

In November, Fnac had offered to pay 558 million pounds, or about $802 million, for Darty.Steinhoff wants to combine Darty with Conforama, a French household goods retailer that it bought five years ago.But on Thursday, Fnac and Conforama each made a series of escalating offers for Darty as the day progressed.Darty did not indicate on Thursday whether it was leaning toward either suitor.Shares of Darty closed up 23 percent in trading in London after the flurry of announcements.Darty operates about 400 stores in France, Belgium and the Netherlands and reported revenue of more than 3.5 billion euros, or about $4 billion, in the 2014-15 fiscal year.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Virtual Reality Lures Media Companies to a New Frontier", "Date": "2016-04-19", "News": "Supported byMedia and entertainment companies want to help shape the next entertainment platform: virtual reality.Some media and entertainment companies are also starting to invest in virtual reality companies themselves.HBO was recently the lead investor in an addition to a funding round for Otoy, a Los Angeles-based special effects start-up. Otoy, whose LightStage facial rendering technology, used in films like \u201cThe Curious Case of Benjamin Button,\u201d has won an Academy Award, has also gotten into virtual reality. Discovery Communications and Liberty Media participated in the funding, which raised as much as $37 million and was an extension of financing that took place in 2014, according to VC Experts, a venture capital research firm.\u201cNot a single media company isn\u2019t thinking about what happens when the rectangle goes away,\u201d said Jules Urbach, 41, the founder of Otoy, referring to a future when videos are experienced in virtual reality rather than watched on screens. \u201cEveryone needs a strategy.\u201dOtoy, whose name is short for \u201conline toy,\u201d lets people capture virtual reality video, process it and then distribute it to viewers with its technology. Otoy also makes a virtual reality player that is free to download; the company wants to become the open standard for virtual reality distribution.\u201cThink of them as the cloud system similar to what Pixar would use to create incredible graphics,\u201d said Matt Miesnieks, whose firm Super Ventures invests in virtual and augmented reality start-ups. Otoy could eventually become a platform, like an Amazon Web Services for graphics, he said.Michael Lombardo, HBO\u2019s president for programming, said most video created for virtual reality currently \u201cleans toward marketing stunts or promotional opportunities,\u201d but that could change when companies like Otoy become more integrated into the process of creating programming.With the additional funding, Otoy\u2019s valuation of more than $300 million did not change from 2014, according to VC Experts, which added that the start-up had raised a total of $101 million.Otoy, founded in 2009 as a company whose software is used to make 3-D graphics, declined to comment on financial details. Its previous investors include Ari Emanuel, co-chief executive of William Morris Endeavor, and the enterprise software company Autodesk.Of the 133 virtual and augmented reality investments made in 2015, media companies participated in six, according to the venture capital research firm CB Insights.Discovery Communications introduced a service last August called Discovery VR, which is available via Apple and Android apps, as well as through other outlets. Discovery VR has more than 75 virtual reality experiences about such topics as sharks, gold mining and surfing. The app has been downloaded nearly 600,000 times and has been viewed more than 23 million times, according to the company.Suzanne Kolb, executive vice president of Discovery Digital Networks, said the deal with Otoy should give Discovery a front-row seat to new technological developments and ways to tell stories. \u201cIt is an evolving space,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

According to that, the company was running out of cash and would need a $310 million loan to make it through the bankruptcy process. It has already reduced staff 40 percent from October 2015 levels, a reduction it plans to push to 50 percent.From the start, the Vivint deal drew resistance from prominent investors, including David Tepper, whose hedge fund, Appaloosa Management, sued to block the deal. The proposed merger was scrapped last month.But the company\u2019s outlook continued to deteriorate in recent weeks. One of its subsidiaries, TerraForm Global, publicly raised the possibility of its parent\u2019s bankruptcy. In addition, SunEdison acknowledged that it was under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department over financing activities in connection with its subsidiaries, the attempted Vivint purchase and a project in Uruguay.Now, Vivint is suing SunEdison for failing to complete the acquisition, as are investors, creditors and one of SunEdison\u2019s own subsidiaries.SunEdison\u2019s troubles stemmed from its rapid growth across several areas, analysts said. Not only did it expand its financing options with the formation of two newfangled subsidiaries known as yieldcos, but it also went on a buying spree as it moved into different kinds of energy projects. Those included forays into wind, energy storage and residential solar, while at the same time the company looked to expand its manufacturing operations in large markets like India, China and Brazil.The result was a ballooning debt, which grew to more than $11 billion by the end of the third quarter of last year. Analysts saw signs of distress as the company used some of that money to acquire new projects to help satisfy the company\u2019s cash-hungry yieldcos. The yieldcos are affiliated public companies that help raise cheaper capital by buying and operating the power plants that the parent companies develop, collecting the contracted electricity fees and paying the bulk of them out as dividends.But investors in the yieldcos complained that SunEdison was improperly using their money to finance its own ventures and striking terms that were more favorable to the parent company.\u201cThey\u2019d kind of created a three-headed dog where all the heads were biting at each other,\u201d said Tyler Ogden, a research associate at Lux Research.As the pressure to raise revenue mounted, SunEdison began looking to sell off power projects and close manufacturing plants to stave off bankruptcy.\u201cA company needs to focus in on one core strength,\u201d Mr. Ogden said, \u201cgrowing from that as a base instead of expanding rapidly into all possible markets, as well as different applications.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The candidates could accept donations of as much as $10,300, but party committees in their counties, and at the state level, could receive about 10 times that.\u201cThis is a widespread practice that Republicans and Democrats, county and state committees, take advantage of,\u201d said Susan Lerner, the executive director of Common Cause New York.The committee pipeline has become even more important as the Republican majority in the State Senate has dwindled.\u201cHe\u2019s made it very clear he wants me to stay in the Senate,\u201d Mr. Padavan said.In the same 2014 election that drew the scrutiny of Ms. Sugarman, a Republican senator running in Erie County, Mark Grisanti, was in a tight race. At the direction of the Republican Party\u2019s leader, Dean G. Skelos, the real estate company Glenwood sent $100,000 to the Erie County Republican Committee, which transferred $78,000 a few days later to Mr. Grisanti\u2019s campaign.In Ms. Sugarman\u2019s report, she pointed to large contributions organized by the de Blasio group to county committees that everyone involved \u2014 donors, county committee and candidates \u2014 knew were going to support the Democratic candidates.\u201cThe documents established a pattern of coordination between Team de Blasio, the candidates,\u201d and county and state political committees, Ms. Sugarman wrote.Her memo does not make clear why such coordination violates the law. Rather than being a matter of \u201ceveryone does it,\u201d there appears to be nothing in the state election law that says it cannot be done.Apparently, Ms. Sugarman\u2019s understanding of the law is that the county and state committees can spend the virtually unlimited money that comes their way on individual candidates as long as there is no joint plan to get and spend it.That\u2019s like a regulation that permits sex only if all parties to the process keep their eyes closed. No such rules exist for sex or for campaign donations.The lawlessness of the state\u2019s campaign finance structure has long been a target of government watchdog groups and people seeking reform.The political parties have \u201chousekeeping accounts\u201d that the law explicitly states are not subject to regulation. Those accounts can take any amount of money from anyone, which can then be used for anything.Contributions to those accounts have increased by 50 percent since 1999, according to research by Prudence Katze and Kyle Gorman of Common Cause.Common Cause and others groups have lobbied for reform of the state\u2019s campaign finance laws, but it has never survived the annual negotiations.\u201cThe big problem with New York State\u2019s campaign finance laws is that there\u2019s relatively little guidance, almost no enforcement, and every campaign and committee figures out the best they can,\u201d Ms. Lerner said. \u201cIt\u2019s a systemic problem that requires a systemic solution that doesn\u2019t just involve enforcement against this campaign or that campaign.\u201dThe Democrats promise that if they win control of both houses of the Legislature, they will fix it. Meanwhile, they are running millions of dollars through the pipelines they promise to dismantle.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Panama Papers\u2019 Leaks Put Iceland Prime Minister Under Pressure to Quit", "Date": "2016-04-04", "News": "Supported byThe prime minister, Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson, insisted he would not resign after documents revealed that he and his wealthy partner, now wife, had set up a company in 2007 in the British Virgin Islands through the law firm. The documents also suggest that he sold his half of the company to her, for $1, on the last day of 2009, just before a new law took effect that would have required him as a member of Parliament to declare his ownership as a conflict of interest.Mr. Gunnlaugsson said the leak contained no news, adding that he and his wife, Anna Sigurlaug Palsdottir, had not hidden their assets or avoided paying tax.But the company, Wintris Inc., lost millions of dollars as a result of the 2008 financial crash that crippled Iceland, and the company is claiming some $4.2 million from three failed Icelandic banks. As prime minister since 2013, Mr. Gunnlaugsson was involved in reaching a deal for the banks\u2019 claimants, so he is now being accused of a conflict of interest.The leaked documents drew immediate attention Monday from officials in Washington, who could be interested in using them as a road map of diplomatic, financial and even criminal dealings around the globe that are connected to the United States and its financial system.\u201cWe are aware of the reports and are reviewing them,\u201d said Peter Carr, a spokesman for the Justice Department in Washington. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, declined to comment specifically on the documents, but said the United States remained a \u201cleading advocate for increased transparency in the international financial system, and in working against illicit financial transactions and in fighting corruption.\u201dThe leaks come at a time of populist anger against business and political elites and sharpening income inequality in Europe and the United States. The information could intensify that anger by suggesting that government officials are lining their pockets in secret and avoiding transparency and taxes on their assets.The anger is particularly acute in Iceland, a tiny country of 330,000 people that was hammered by the financial crisis. When the bubble burst, its three private banks, which had become bloated, could not cover their short-term debts and repay depositors. Iceland suffered a deep economic depression, a stock market collapse and huge losses, requiring emergency loans from the International Monetary Fund and capital controls.Iceland is recovering well but the anger persists, and Mr. Gunnlaugsson, of the center-right Progressive Party, may not survive the political turmoil.Protests erupted on Monday evening in front of the Parliament building. A former prime minister, Johanna Sigurdardottir, said Mr. Gunnlaugsson would have to resign if he could not quickly regain the public\u2019s trust. A former finance minister, Steingrimur Sigfusson, told The Guardian newspaper: \u201cWe can\u2019t permit this. Iceland would simply look like a banana republic. No one is saying he used his position as prime minister to help this offshore company, but the fact is you shouldn\u2019t leave yourself open to a conflict of interest, and nor should you keep it secret.\u201dHaving at first denied ownership in Wintris, Mr. Gunnlaugsson said his joint ownership with his wife was an oversight and was corrected when it was pointed out to him in 2009. He also said Wintris was a holding company to invest his wife\u2019s assets from a company sale, a distinction that made it legally unnecessary for him to declare it in any case.Ramon Fonseca, the director of Mossack Fonseca, defended the firm and the legality of offshore companies, telling Reuters in a telephone interview that the firm had suffered a successful but \u201climited\u201d hacking intrusion. Mr. Fonseca, the firm\u2019s co-founder and until March a senior government official in Panama, said his firm had formed more than 240,000 companies, adding that the \u201cvast majority\u201d had been used for \u201clegitimate purposes.\u201dIn Moscow, which had warned previously of an investigation aimed at Mr. Putin, his spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, said the reports were intended to smear Russia before elections there and were an outgrowth of \u201cPutinophobia.\u201d He suggested that the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, based in Washington, had links to the United States government and other \u201cspecial services\u201d and said the documents showed \u201cnothing concrete and nothing new about Putin.\u201dThe documents do not mention Mr. Putin but indicate that numerous close associates, including a cellist, Sergei Roldugin, a childhood friend of Mr. Putin, had assets of up to $2 billion stashed abroad.Asked if there was still any family money invested in the fund, a spokesman for Prime Minister Cameron, Helen Bower, said, \u201cThat is a private matter.\u201d Mr. Cameron has been outspoken about what he has called the need to shut down offshore tax havens and is scheduled to host a summit meeting on the issue in May.The repercussions extended to Argentina\u2019s president, Mauricio Macri. Leaked documents showed he was a director of an offshore company, Fleg Trading Ltd., incorporated in the Bahamas in 1998 and dissolved in 2009. Mr. Macri, who was mayor of Buenos Aires before his election as president last November, did not disclose his connection to the company in asset declarations in 2007 or 2008. Mr. Macri\u2019s office said in a statement that the disclosure had not been required because the president had no stake in the company.Simon Romero contributed reporting from Rio de Janeiro, and Eric Lichtblau from Washington.Advertisement"}

He was 75.His family said the cause was cancer.Mr. Campbell had exerted a strong influence on Apple and Google, two of the world\u2019s most valuable companies, since the 1980s. Operating in a network of billionaire technology innovators, he was known for making informal but lasting personal connections that helped shape the industry.The term \u201ccoach\u201d was a reference to his days coaching the Columbia University football team from 1974 to 1979 \u2014 he had also played for Columbia \u2014 but it applied as well to his business career.As recently as the end of March, John Doerr, one of the valley\u2019s leading venture capitalists, publicly cited \u201cCoach Bill Campbell\u2019s\u201d advice when Mr. Doerr announced that he would give up his executive role at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and become its first chairman.Mr. Campbell was an Eastman Kodak executive in Europe when he was recruited to Silicon Valley in 1983 by Apple\u2019s chief executive at the time, John Sculley. Mr. Sculley named him vice president of marketing. Mr. Campbell later played a significant role in Apple\u2019s spectacular turnaround when Steve Jobs, who had been fired by Mr. Sculley, returned to the company in 1997. Apple went on to revamp its Mac computer line and introduce the iPod, iPhone and iPad.Mr. Campbell was an Apple director from 1997 until 2014.It was Mr. Doerr who brought Mr. Campbell to Google to serve as an informal adviser to the two founders, Mr. Page and Sergey Brin. Mr. Campbell was instrumental in the hiring of Eric Schmidt to be Google\u2019s chief executive in August 2001.Strikingly, Mr. Campbell\u2019s advisory role was often unpaid, at his insistence; he said he wanted to pay back what he felt was a debt to the nation\u2019s technology region.At Google, for example, he helped shape its leadership for a generation or more but, except for a single stock grant, never had a formal financial relationship with the company, according to Mr. Schmidt, who is now Google\u2019s chairman.\u201cGoogle would not be the company it is today without the influence of Bill Campbell,\u201d Mr. Schmidt said, \u201cand my guess is Apple wouldn\u2019t be, either.\u201dMr. Campbell also worked early on with Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, as well as Ben Horowitz and Marc Andreessen before they founded one of the country\u2019s top venture capital firms, Andreessen Horowitz.Mr. Campbell was deeply involved in Silicon Valley\u2019s start-up culture as well. In 1987 he led a group of Apple executives in setting up a software subsidiary, Claris, with the ultimate goal of spinning the company off as a start-up. When Apple decided not to let Claris become a separate public company, many of the executives, including Mr. Campbell, left.He later became chief executive of Go Corporation, a pioneering tablet computer company that fought a long and ultimately unsuccessful battle with Microsoft. From 1994 until 1998 he was chief executive of Intuit, a personal finance software company.William Vincent Campbell Jr. was born on Aug. 31, 1940, and grew up in Homestead, Pa., near Pittsburgh. He excelled in football in high school.Mr. Campbell ended his coaching career in 1979 with an overall record of 12-41-1. He then went to work for J. Walter Thompson, the advertising agency, before joining Kodak.In 2009, the National Football Foundation and College Hall of Fame announced that its annual award given to the top scholar-athlete would be renamed for Mr. Campbell.He was chairman of Columbia University\u2019s board of trustees from 2005 to 2014 and donated $10 million to help fund the Campbell Sports Center on the university\u2019s campus. As a philanthropist he also donated millions in support of education in the Pennsylvania steel country where he grew up.His survivors include his wife, Eileen Bocci Campbell; a daughter, Margaret; a son, Jim; and his stepchildren, Kevin, Matthew and Kate Bocci.Mr. Campbell was known for his informality. Randy Komisar, a partner at Kleiner Perkins who had been a young lawyer at Apple, recalled Mr. Campbell running down a hall one day and dragging him into a dark conference room to tell him he was starting the software company that would become Claris. Without saying anything about title or compensation, Mr. Campbell looked at him across the table and simply asked, \u201cAre you in, or are you out?\u201dAn obituary last Tuesday about Bill Campbell, an adviser to executives in the technology industry, misstated his history with the tablet computer company Go Corporation. While he was a former chief executive of the company, he did not help found it.Advertisement"}

But the national executive committee of the A.N.C. \u2014 which has dominated South African politics since the end of white minority rule in 1994 \u2014 is stacked with allies of the president, and evidently loath to take action against him in an election year.Yet the need for action becomes more urgent with every new scandal. Mr. Zuma\u2019s predecessor, Thabo Mbeki, fired him as his deputy after Mr. Zuma was implicated in a shady arms deal. Then Mr. Zuma was charged in the rape of a friend\u2019s daughter, and later acquitted. In 2014, an independent inquiry found that Mr. Zuma had the government pay for lavish improvements to his home, but the president refused to refund any of the money, leading to the Constitutional Court ruling on Thursday.In its ruling, the Constitutional Court said that in refusing to pay back the millions spent on his home, Mr. Zuma had \u201cfailed to uphold, defend and respect the Constitution as the supreme law of the land.\u201d That has been the story of Mr. Zuma\u2019s leadership. The president of South Africa is elected by Parliament, which is dominated by the A.N.C., so a withdrawal of support by the A.N.C. national executive committee would be tantamount to a demand that Mr. Zuma resign.

{"Headline": "Bronx Ice Center Plan Hangs in the Balance", "Date": "2016-04-10", "News": "Supported byNow, 28 months after the City Council approved a plan to turn the 99-year-old armory, with its barrel roof, parapets and turrets, into a $350 million center for ice hockey and figure skating, that proposal is also in jeopardy.But the project, called the Kingsbridge National Ice Center, or KNIC, has revealed how difficult it is to find and to finance new uses for some of New York City\u2019s aging but historic buildings, and how political currents can make the process that much more treacherous.The developer still has not taken control of the largely vacant property, which sits in one of the city\u2019s poorest neighborhoods, and the de Blasio administration has given the group until April 25 to demonstrate that it can pay for the $158 million first phase of the project. The two sides are in negotiations.Kevin E. Parker, who leads the development group, has told officials that it has raised $20 million in private financing and secured a nonbinding pledge from the state to provide a $138 million loan. But he contends that the city has hobbled efforts to raise additional capital by refusing to turn over the lease to the building.Alicia Glen, the deputy mayor for housing and economic development, says the city cannot turn over the lease, which is being held in escrow, until the developer shows that it has a binding commitment from the state or another lender to provide the money.\u201cWe do have a responsibility to protect this community in the event this project can\u2019t get financed,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to spend years in court, or be left with a half-demolished building that\u2019s no good to anyone. We\u2019ll get as creative as we possibly can, but those are not lines we can cross.\u201dThe fraught relations between Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, both Democrats, have also cast a shadow over the negotiations. Another Democrat, Ruben Diaz Jr., the Bronx borough president and a champion of the Kingsbridge project, is a vocal critic of the mayor and an ally of Mr. Cuomo. Carl E. Heastie, the speaker of the State Assembly who emerged as an ally of Mr. de Blasio in the most recent budget negotiations, is also behind the project, said Michael Whyland, a spokesman for Mr. Heastie, a Bronx Democrat. \u201cThe speaker and the Bronx delegation strongly support the Kingsbridge Armory project,\u201d he said.Ms. Glen said the city was \u201cbending over backwards\u201d to make the Ice Center happen, extending deadlines for the developer by more than 500 days.William A. Brewer, a lawyer for the developer, was insistent that Mr. Parker\u2019s group had a rock-solid commitment from the state and that it had met every city requirement for releasing the 99-year lease for the five-acre site.\u201cThere is no logical reason for what is happening right now,\u201d Mr. Brewer said. \u201cI have no doubt that KNIC has satisfied the city\u2019s terms and any reasonable third party would agree.\u201dMr. Parker, a former Deutsche Bank executive with two sons who played hockey, began talking to city officials about turning the building into an ice center in 2011, after an earlier proposal to turn the armory into a shopping center failed to overcome opposition from unions, community groups and Mr. Diaz.Mr. Parker invited another Deutsche Bank executive, Jonathan Richter, to join his development group.In 2013, KNIC was chosen over other proposals for the armory in a process overseen by the city\u2019s Economic Development Corporation. The administration, however, declined to invest any public money in the project.In March 2014, Ms. Glen, the new deputy mayor, canceled a meeting with the development group after Mr. Richter challenged Mr. Parker\u2019s authority to act on behalf of the partnership. It took until October of that year for Mr. Parker to win his battle in court.The city then agreed to sign a 99-year lease with Mr. Parker\u2019s group, but insisted on putting the document in escrow until the developer group could demonstrate that it had a solid commitment for $158 million in financing for the first phase. Mr. Parker reluctantly agreed. That agreement was set to expire on March 26 of this year.In late December, New York State\u2019s economic development arm authorized a $30 million loan for Kingsbridge, the first portion of a two-year, $138 million construction loan. The interest rate was set at 7 percent because of the speculative nature of the project. But under the nonbinding agreement between the state and the development group, either side could walk away from the deal.A month later, the state\u2019s Public Authorities Control Board cut the first installment in half, approving only $15 million after a dispute between the Assembly and the Senate over where the money would come from, touching off worry among New York City officials about the vagaries of the process.Mr. Brewer, the developer\u2019s lawyer, said that having the lease in escrow made it difficult to raise money from other sources, including through a federal program that grants visas to wealthy foreign families that invest at least $500,000 in certain American projects.But Nicholas Mastroianni II, president of the United States Immigration Fund, which has worked on similar visa-based financing for many New York developers, said the escrow issue should not be a problem. \u201cA signed lease held in escrow would not inhibit our ability to raise money,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s understandable so long as the escrow terms give you time to raise the capital.\u201dMr. Brewer is adamant that the state\u2019s money is forthcoming. He wants the lease, and said that \u201cif not by agreement, KNIC will obtain the lease by other means.\u201dIn the meantime, Scott Hricay, the owner of Armory Auto Parts and Repairs, which sits across Reservoir Avenue from the armory, said he would believe in the project only when construction workers showed up.\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of talk for 20 years,\u201d said Mr. Hricay, \u201cbut nothing\u2019s been done. It just sits there; doesn\u2019t bring any business to the area.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Summer Jobs for All City High School Students", "Date": "2016-04-13", "News": "Supported byEditorialMayor Bill de Blasio speaks often of narrowing the vast gap that exists between the rich and the poor in New York City. His administration could make a real impact in this area by retooling the city\u2019s inadequate summer jobs program so that more high school students get work experiences that put them in position to compete for full-time jobs later on. A new proposal by the Community Service Society, a New York nonprofit group, makes a strong case for a universal summer jobs program that would be open to all high school students.Across the country, about 20 percent of young people who seek summer jobs cannot find them. Minority teenagers, who typically live in areas that have few businesses, have a much harder time finding work.The city runs a summer jobs program that cost about $80 million last year and employed 55,000 young people, most of them high school students. But only about half of those who applied by lottery got a spot. The program is financed mainly by the city, and funding typically remains uncertain until the last minute. As a result, the community organizations that place young people in jobs often don\u2019t know how much money is available until just days before the program begins in July.On such short notice, the organizations can do little more than rush teenagers into jobs at summer camps or positions for which they have not been screened and for which they might not be suited. And because entry is based on lottery, it is highly unlikely that a teenager will be able to participate in two consecutive years. This means that many miss out on the benefits that several years of summer work would offer.A well-planned, expanded program that served 110,000 young people would probably cost about $242 million. The city would not have to come up with all of it but could seek help from the state and federal governments. It could start with a pilot program that covers, say, about 20 of the city\u2019s 438 or so high schools.Given the profound difference that meaningful, career-related summer jobs can make in the lives of the young, this proposal is well worth pursuing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "De Blasio to Propose $2 Billion for New York City\u2019s Hospital System", "Date": "2016-04-25", "News": "Supported byNew York City\u2019s public hospital system \u201cis on the edge of a financial cliff,\u201d Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s administration is warning in a report to be released on Tuesday as part of his budget, which proposes a restructuring and an infusion of $2 billion in subsidies.Like many health care initiatives nationwide, the plan for Health & Hospitals encourages better primary care and less hospitalization. The budget includes $100 million in capital investments meant to expand or upgrade the system\u2019s community-based health centers and clinics, and it proposes selling vacant land on hospital campuses to create affordable and supportive housing.The report says there will be no layoffs or closings of hospitals in the system, which was known until last year as the Health and Hospitals Corporation. But it acknowledges that \u201ceven with retraining and shifting existing hospital staff to community-based health centers and clinics, there is likely to be a net loss of hospital-based jobs\u201d and some buildings \u201cwill be repurposed to house social support and other community-based services.\u201d\u201cUnlike what has happened in other cities, Health & Hospitals will remain a vibrant public system \u2014 it is not for sale and the city will not abandon it,\u201d the report says, promising that the \u201cunparalleled investment\u201d will help turn the 280-year-old network into a community-based model more focused on primary care that can better compete for patients.As previously uninsured low-income New Yorkers have gained insurance, they also have gained new health care options. The city system has been losing those patients to other providers that are seen as more upscale or convenient to patients. At the same time, it remains the major source of care for nearly one million city residents who remain uninsured, many of them unauthorized immigrants who are ineligible for public insurance.Uninsured patients and those covered by Medicaid, the federal and state program for the poor, now represent nearly 70 percent of Health & Hospitals\u2019 total hospital stays, compared with 40 percent for other hospitals in the city, the report says. Yet federal and state funding that helps cover the cost of caring for the uninsured is projected to decline by almost $1 billion \u2014 from $2.2 billion in the 2016 fiscal year to $1.4 billion in the 2020 fiscal year.As other nonprofit hospitals consolidate, they have begun to compete for the city\u2019s Medicaid patients. While other major systems saw a 5 percent increase in managed Medicaid hospital stays, Health & Hospitals experienced a 3 percent decline between 2012 and 2014. MetroPlus, the city hospitals\u2019 own managed-care plan, grew by 17 percent over a six-year period, to 500,000 members, but still lost out to private competitors as the market grew by 27 percent.Over all, hospital stays dropped more than 5 percent between 2012 and 2014, reflecting a citywide trend. But while the busiest public hospitals, including Queens Hospital Center and Kings County Hospital Center, have few empty beds, in some, like North Central Bronx Hospital, about half of the beds are empty \u2014 which means less patient revenue covering the same fixed operating costs.The number of independent hospitals in the city has been nearly halved, from 34 to 18 over the past 10 years, a decline likely to continue, the report says. Three out of every four hospital stays are now at hospitals affiliated with one of six major systems \u2014 systems that are increasingly competing with one another and with Health & Hospitals for a bigger share of a more diverse pool of patients, not just the sickest.\u201cHealth & Hospitals is quickly losing Medicaid patients to other hospitals as this zero-sum game unfolds,\u201d the report says, referring to sweeping changes in health care financing to a flat-rate or a so-called payment-for-value or pay-for-performance model rather than a payment-for-service one. Historically, the city system has struggled to meet the goals of a pay-for-performance model in part because its patients are generally sicker and poorer and often lack adequate housing.Each year, Health & Hospitals serves more than 1.2 million New Yorkers. It is the largest publicly financed health system in the country with more than 40,000 employees in 11 hospitals and nearly 5,000 beds; five long-term care facilities with nearly 3,000 beds; and more than 70 community-based health care centers.\u201cThis transformation plan is not a plan to close hospitals, lay off workers, or impair quality or access to Health & Hospitals health care services,\u201d the report says. \u201cWe cannot cut our way out of this problem in ways that destabilize quality and access in underserved communities.\u201dAn article in some editions on Tuesday about Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s budget proposal for New York City\u2019s Health & Hospitals, using information from the mayor\u2019s office, described incorrectly the increase in the amount of money in the proposed budget for the city\u2019s public health system. The mayor\u2019s proposed budget, which would bring total city funding for Health & Hospitals to $2 billion annually by fiscal year 2020, would be a $700 million increase in the annual allocation compared with the amount of city funding when Mr. de Blasio took office in 2014. It does not represent a $700 million increase over fiscal year 2016.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sanofi Offers to Buy Drug Maker Medivation for $9.3 Billion", "Date": "2016-04-28", "News": "Supported byThe French drug company Sanofi said on Thursday that it had made a nonbinding offer to acquire the prostate cancer drug maker Medivation for about $9.3 billion in cash.Sanofi, based in Paris, publicly announced the offer on Thursday after it said that Medivation, a San Francisco biotechnology company, had not responded to a letter Sanofi sent nearly two weeks ago offering to acquire the company. Sanofi, which has been suffering from declines in sales of its main diabetes drugs, has said it is interested in making medium-size acquisitions. Analysts describe the company\u2019s existing portfolio as weak.Under the terms of its offer, Sanofi said on Thursday that it was willing to pay $52.50 a share for Medivation, the maker of the prostate cancer therapy Xtandi. That would represent a premium of more than 50 percent over Medivation\u2019s two-month volume-weighted average share price before takeover rumors, Sanofi said.Shares of Medivation closed on Wednesday at $52.05.\u201cWith Medivation\u2019s best-in-class offerings in prostate cancer, we believe a combination would benefit patients and, at the same time, generate value for shareholders of both companies,\u201d he added.In a separate letter to Medivation on Thursday, Sanofi said that it first discussed a possible takeover in a phone call with David T. Hung, Medivation\u2019s chief executive, on March 25 and in a subsequent conversation on April 3.Medivation expressed no interest in discussing a transaction at the time, and Sanofi sent a letter on April 15 offering to pay $52.50 a share for the company, Sanofi said.Medivation has not responded other than to acknowledge the letter\u2019s receipt, Sanofi said.\u201cWe do not understand the delay in responding to our letter,\u201d Mr. Brandicourt said on Thursday. \u201cThe price we put forth represents a very substantial premium, and it would be all cash without any financing condition. In these circumstances we believe it is appropriate to make this letter public, which we are doing today.\u201dMedivation said on Thursday that its board began an evaluation of the Sanofi proposal with its independent financial and legal advisers when it was contacted by Sanofi on April 15.The company said that it expected the board to complete the review at a meeting on Thursday and it would \u201cprovide an update promptly thereafter.\u201d\u201cThere are no assurances that a transaction will be reached or on what terms,\u201d Medivation said in a news release. \u201cMedivation stockholders are advised to take no action at this time.\u201dSanofi already sells two drugs to treat prostate cancer: Taxotere, also known as docetaxel, which now faces competition from generics, and the newer Jevtana. But both are considered chemotherapy, with the attendant side effects, and many men with the disease prefer other drugs.Over all, Sanofi\u2019s portfolio of marketed cancer drugs is \u201cweak and populated by undifferentiated also-rans,\u201d Timothy Anderson, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, wrote in a note on Thursday.Xtandi is among the fairly new, so-called targeted drugs that are not considered chemotherapy and that have been shown in clinical trials to extend the lives of men with advanced prostate cancer. The drug, marketed by the Japanese company Astellas Pharma, had global sales last year of $1.9 billion, with Medivation\u2019s share at $943 million.Sales could grow if the company succeeds in winning approval for the drug\u2019s use in earlier stages of prostate cancer. But it faces competition from Zytiga, made by Johnson & Johnson, and possibly from agents under development.Xtandi has already provided a windfall for the University of California, Los Angeles as the development of the drug was based on discoveries by campus researchers. In March, U.C.L.A. sold its rights to future royalties from the drug to the investment firm Royalty Pharma, for $1.14 billion in cash and potential additional payments based on Xtandi sales. U.C.L.A. will retain $520 million of that. The rest will go to the researchers and to the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, which financially supported the research.Xtandi, however, has also become one of the latest symbols of the controversy over high drug prices. Two activist groups have asked the federal government to essentially pre-empt Medivation\u2019s exclusive patent rights and allow other companies to manufacture the product to lower prices. Some members of Congress, including Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, are also pressing the Obama administration to consider this.The federal government has so-called march-in rights because taxpayers helped pay for the drug\u2019s development, in this case through research funding from the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense. Under federal law, the government can exercise its rights to patents if the benefits of a federally funded invention are not made \u201cavailable to the public on reasonable terms.\u201dThe activist groups, Knowledge Ecology International and the Union for Affordable Cancer Treatment say that Xtandi meets this criterion because of its high price. The drug has a wholesale list price in the United States of about $88 a capsule, or $129,000 for a year of treatment, the groups say, two to four times the price in other high-income countries.In the past, however, the National Institutes of Health has declined to exercise such march-in rights merely because a drug is expensive, saying that they were not an appropriate means of controlling prices.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: In \u2018Exit Strategy,\u2019 Scrambling Before School\u2019s Out Forever", "Date": "2016-05-06", "News": "Supported byAmong the play\u2019s strongest, funniest scenes is its first, a testy meeting between the boyish, tidily dressed assistant principal, Ricky (Ryan Spahn, exuding earnest spunkiness), and a veteran English teacher, Pam (Deirdre Madigan), who glares across the desk that separates them as if she\u2019d like to make a meal of her much younger boss.It\u2019s summer, and Ricky is gently trying to break the news to the school\u2019s staff that, um, as he puts it, \u201cThe negotiations didn\u2019t go as smoothly as we expected.\u201dWhen he continues to dance nervously around the real news, Pam, oozing the weariness of a teacher who has logged 23 years in an inner-city public school, barks at him to get to the point. Like a chastened child, he soon does: The city\u2019s school board has decided that the school will be closed at the end of the year. \u201cLow test scores, unfavorable conditions,\u201d he mumbles. \u201cLots of \u2014 lots of, lots of, lots of stuff.\u201dIf he was expecting a teary reaction, forget it. Pam, played with acrid humor by Ms. Madigan, barely bats an unmascaraed eyelash. \u201cForty percent of our seniors graduated last year,\u201d she says. \u201cOne could say that I had a feeling.\u201d She then wryly adds: \u201cLeaks, holes. Even the paint\u2019s trying to run away from this place.\u201dMost of the rest of the play takes place in the teachers\u2019 lounge, which does indeed attest to the moldering facilities. The minimal furnishings are, shall we say, vintage, and you wouldn\u2019t want to go near the water cooler. (Andrew Boyce\u2019s sets are grimly atmospheric.) As the teachers gather for a fall meeting to plan how to break the news to the students, Sadie (Aim\u00e9 Donna Kelly), casually slaps down a package of rat poison; the budget didn\u2019t stretch to an exterminator this year.The announcement will be made by the senior teacher in their midst, Arnold, played with grizzled cynicism by Michael Cullen. Providing Spanish translation will be Jania (a feisty, funny Christina Nieves). After they\u2019ve settled the matter, Sadie brings up the next order of business: her plan to foster community support to keep the school open, beginning with a public march.This plan is greeted with various degrees of skepticism by her colleagues; Arnold and Jania have tried before \u2014 and failed \u2014 in similar fight-the-city school closure protests. In fact the teachers have already walked out to demonstrate against the lack of funding, with no results. An air of resignation fogs the small room, and the unwanted presence of the ever-perky Ricky doesn\u2019t help matters.Each character in \u201cExit Strategy\u201d comes quickly into clear focus. And while the play serves as a stinging indictment of the state of public schools in Chicago and, more broadly, the country, Mr. Holter deftly embeds his finger-pointing in the drama itself. We see beyond the surface dysfunction to the toll it takes on the lives, and careers, of the teachers, whose dedication to their students comes across movingly, even when they are complaining about them.We eventually meet one of those students, Donnie (Brandon J. Pierce), when he\u2019s called onto the carpet by Ricky for having hacked the school\u2019s website, and essentially turned it into a Kickstarter page to raise funds. This is, technically, cause for disciplinary action, if not expulsion. But Donnie, who is portrayed with blazing magnetism by Mr. Pierce, cuts Ricky\u2019s disciplinary chat short with a shattering monologue about his grim journey through public schools, including one that was so poorly financed that the students had to request toilet paper from their teachers.Ricky is so impressed that instead of suspension or expulsion, he names Donnie his \u201ccreative associate\u201d in charge of social media for a newly formed group called Team Winning, which will seek to rally public support for the school.With this improbable (if sweet) development, \u201cExit Strategy\u201d takes a sentimental turn. The amorous relationship between Ricky and one of the teachers, the genial Luce (a buoyant Rey Lucas), also injects a formulaic note into the proceedings.But the pungent dialogue, winning performances and Kip Fagan\u2019s streamlined direction help us overlook the small hiccups in the dramaturgy. And Mr. Holter is ultimately cleareyed about the parlous state of the American public school system. Donnie and Ricky may stir up quite a firestorm on Facebook, but no amount of social media attention can make up for the straitened circumstances and lack of civic support.The teachers may love their students, the students may love their school, but all the affection in the world won\u2019t buy pencils and books and blackboards.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Respite of Soccer for Qatar\u2019s Laborers", "Date": "2016-04-23", "News": "Supported byDOHA, Qatar \u2014 It was not yet 8 a.m., but already a fierce sun was beating down as the Taleb Group soccer team arrived at the technical committee building of the Qatar Football Association. As had been the case on Friday mornings for the past few weeks, even at such an early hour, the players who passed the white minaret at the center\u2019s entrance on their way toward its state-of-the-art soccer fields were not the first to arrive. As they approached the fields, the players were met by a crowd of about 50 young men, some singing African folk songs, others wearing counterfeit Manchester United and Real Madrid jerseys or banging metal dinner trays with soup ladles. Not all of the fans were there to cheer for Taleb, however; others carried placards bearing the name of Larsen & Toubro, the opponent in Friday morning\u2019s crucially important game: a semifinal clash in the Workers Cup. \u201cThis tournament will make people know that we are footballers, and not just laborers,\u201d said Jerry Ayitey, a 22-year-old construction worker from Ghana who plays as a defender for Taleb Group. As he spoke, another group of fans passed by as they circled the field, banging makeshift drums and singing \u201cPraise Be to God\u201d in a Ghanaian dialect. \u201cWe work 10 hours a day,\u201d Ayitey said. \u201cBut my dream is to have a team in France, England, Spain, Russia.\u201d Each team in the four-year-old Workers Cup represents a local company, one of the dozens of firms at work in the country\u2019s building boom. Medgulf Construction. Nakheel Landscapes. Byrne Equipment Rental. Gulf Contracting. The players \u2014 carpenters, drivers and masons \u2014 are just a fraction of the thousands of migrant workers who are actively building Qatar into a modern state. They are the muscle and backbone of plans to develop the emirate into a global player in everything from finance and energy to sports and the arts.On his one day off each week, Ayitey joins dozens of other workers for matches in this fiercely contested competition. Some dream of playing professionally. Others claim to have already played top-tier soccer in Africa or Asia but said they had decided to come to Qatar to drive buses and build high-rises instead because the paychecks were at least regular. Tens of thousands of Qatari rials are at stake for the Workers Cup winners, as well as a camera or a phone for each player and the chance of playing in the final at the stadium of Al Ahli. But thousands of workers from the labor camps also attend the matches as spectators each Friday, often giving the games better attendance, and a more colorful atmosphere, than almost any game in the country\u2019s top professional division, the Qatar Stars League, which sponsors the tournament. \u201cI joined the team as a player, but my profession is engineer, so I couldn\u2019t continue,\u201d said Mohamed Saadeldin, Taleb Group\u2019s 30-year-old Egyptian coach. \u201cIt is a cup for labor, so they fired me!\u201d he added with a laugh. \u201cBut at least they made me the coach.\u201dBefore the match, hundreds of fans began to fill the bleachers, which stretched halfway along one edge of the field, as Saadeldin wrote out his lineup on a scrap of paper while his assistant, a laborer, read out the players\u2019 names. The crowd heavily favored Larsen & Toubro, whose entire team was Ghanaian. Moments before kickoff, the team lined up in front of its fans to sing an impromptu version of Ghana\u2019s national anthem. Then the dancing, and the drums \u2014 fashioned from boxes and old food tins \u2014 restarted. Despite the overwhelming support for its opponent, Taleb Group took a 1-0 lead and still held it with 10 minutes to go when a fleet of sport utility vehicles arrived nearby. In the wake of the damning Amnesty International report into Qatar\u2019s slow pace of reform on workers\u2019 rights, FIFA\u2019s new president, Gianni Infantino, had arrived in the country for two days of meetings and inspections. During his time there, he met the 2022 World Cup organizing committee and the country\u2019s emir and visited a new city built to house migrant workers. But if Infantino wanted to watch any soccer, the Workers Cup was the only game in town. So he stood alongside local officials on the touchline, watching the final few minutes of the match as Larsen & Toubro pressed for an equalizer that never came.When the final whistle confirmed Taleb Group\u2019s 1-0 victory, its players celebrated wildly on the pitch. Its opponents lay on the turf, shattered. Many were in tears.\u201cWe had one of our players down, we lost concentration; we thought their players would kick the ball out, but they refused,\u201d said Yahaya Mohammed, a land surveyor who had helped press the failed Larsen & Toubro attack. He could barely speak through his tears. \u201cI feel really bad,\u201d he said. \u201cI was looking forward to getting to the finals.\u201dIn more than 40 interviews with fans and players at the tournament, all said that their wages were now being paid on time. Only two said they had paid a recruitment agent to reach Qatar. But several others raised a range of complaints, from low pay to the persistent poor standard of accommodations in Doha\u2019s vast network of labor camps, which remain largely shut off from public scrutiny. One worker said he had not seen his passport for months; he said he had been told by his employer that the company was keeping it so that \u201cit does not get lost.\u201d Another likened his accommodations to a ghetto.\u201cEven a slum is better than this,\u201d he said of dwellings in which he claimed workers sometimes live 14 to a room. \u201cThis is like a rabbit\u2019s house.\u201d After Infantino\u2019s news conference, his motorcade swept out toward the airport, past a parking lot containing the Porsches and Maseratis of the local dignitaries who had hosted him. While they had been inside, dozens of Ghanaian and Kenyan supporters had taken the chance for selfies with the cars. As kickoff approached, the refilled stands heaved again with a crowd now in the thousands, almost all of them supporting Gulf Contracting. \u201cI know we are underdogs,\u201d said Duncan Gondi, 28, a former bus driver who played for Mowasalat, a multinational team of Kenyans, Eritreans, Moroccans, Egyptians and Ghanaians. \u201cI know God will give us victory,\u201d Gondi added confidently. \u201cOne thing I know is that God rewards people that work hard.\u201dAs the game wore on, both coaches shouted instructions from the sidelines with greater urgency. Andy Clayton, Gulf Contracting\u2019s 50-year-old English coach, prowled the technical area in front of his bench. Clayton played nonleague soccer in England when he was younger but later trained as a carpenter, moved to the Gulf and started coaching the team. He set up a tryout three months ago, picking his roster from a pool of 100 hopefuls. \u201cQatar is a transient country,\u201d Clayton said. \u201cSo from my team from last year, we only had four players.\u201dWhen asked about the treatment of his own workers, he said it was his belief that the situation was not \u201cas bad as people say at all.\u201d\u201cI would say that we\u2019ll see 500 to 600 of our workers today from the camps,\u201d he added. \u201cNinety-nine percent will be happy.\u201d What he did not see was a goal. The semifinal ended in a scoreless tie and went to penalties. As the tension increased, both teams missed spot kicks until Gulf Contracting\u2019s Jasper Abbey, a 24-year-old mason from Ghana, scored the winner from the spot, clinching a place in the final. Fans streamed onto the field and ran to the bench to celebrate the victory, hoisting Abbey and Clayton onto their shoulders and carrying them on a lap of honor amid a riot of music and dancing. \u201cI am too much happy,\u201d said Abbey, who was out of breath. \u201cLook at the fans \u2014 2,000 of them! I could not let them down.\u201dClayton, too, was overwhelmed.\u201cIn all my life in football,\u201d he said, \u201cthat is the greatest thing to have happened to me.\u201dWith no letup from the sun, the victorious players and their fans piled into buses for the return trip to their labor camp in Umm Salal, a half-hour north of Doha. It is these camps that have brought the most scrutiny to Qatar\u2019s World Cup preparations. They are vital to the building boom and its preparations for the World Cup \u2014 Qatar\u2019s tiny population could never complete the projects on its own \u2014 but they remain a land apart from the country they serve.Security guards at the front gate at Umm Salal prevent unauthorized people from entering and also keep track of those leaving. Signs urging vigilance in health and safety cover nearly every wall. The camps are tidy but isolated from any settlements. It is nearly a mile walk to the nearest shop outside the gates, but any journey by foot in the summer, when temperatures can reach 120 degrees, would be all but impossible. For the next few weeks, though, the summer heat is far away. For the Gulf Contracting team, all roads lead to the final of the Workers Cup against Taleb Group on May 6, and the prizes that a victory on the pristine turf of the Al Ahli Stadium would bring. The reward for Gulf Contracting\u2019s semifinal victory on Friday was comparatively modest. Buckets of KFC chicken were brought in to a common dining room, and the players devoured it, grateful to have a break from their usual spicy, south Indian menu. \u201cEvery game, we raise our game,\u201d said Abbey, the hero of the penalty shootout. \u201cAnd we give thanks to the almighty.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New Map for America", "Date": "2016-04-15", "News": "Supported byOpinionTHESE days, in the thick of the American presidential primaries, it\u2019s easy to see how the 50 states continue to drive the political system. But increasingly, that\u2019s all they drive \u2014 socially and economically, America is reorganizing itself around regional infrastructure lines and metropolitan clusters that ignore state and even national borders. The problem is, the political system hasn\u2019t caught up.America faces a two-part problem. It\u2019s no secret that the country has fallen behind on infrastructure spending. But it\u2019s not just a matter of how much is spent on catching up, but how and where it is spent. Advanced economies in Western Europe and Asia are reorienting themselves around robust urban clusters of advanced industry. Unfortunately, American policy making remains wedded to an antiquated political structure of 50 distinct states.To an extent, America is already headed toward a metropolis-first arrangement. The states aren\u2019t about to go away, but economically and socially, the country is drifting toward looser metropolitan and regional formations, anchored by the great cities and urban archipelagos that already lead global economic circuits.The Northeastern megalopolis, stretching from Boston to Washington, contains more than 50 million people and represents 20 percent of America\u2019s gross domestic product. Greater Los Angeles accounts for more than 10 percent of G.D.P. These city-states matter far more than most American states \u2014 and connectivity to these urban clusters determines Americans\u2019 long-term economic viability far more than which state they reside in.This reshuffling has profound economic consequences. America is increasingly divided not between red states and blue states, but between connected hubs and disconnected backwaters. Bruce Katz of the Brookings Institution has pointed out that of America\u2019s 350 major metro areas, the cities with more than three million people have rebounded far better from the financial crisis. Meanwhile, smaller cities like Dayton, Ohio, already floundering, have been falling further behind, as have countless disconnected small towns across the country.The problem is that while the economic reality goes one way, the 50-state model means that federal and state resources are concentrated in a state capital \u2014 often a small, isolated city itself \u2014 and allocated with little sense of the larger whole. Not only does this keep back our largest cities, but smaller American cities are increasingly cut off from the national agenda, destined to become low-cost immigrant and retirement colonies, or simply to be abandoned.Congress was once a world leader in regional planning. The Louisiana Purchase, the Pacific Railroad Act (which financed railway expansion from Iowa to San Francisco with government bonds) and the Interstate System of highways are all examples of the federal government\u2019s thinking about economic development at continental scale. The Tennessee Valley Authority was an agent of post-Depression infrastructure renewal, job creation and industrial modernization cutting across six states.What is needed, in some ways, is a return to this more flexible, broader way of thinking. Already, efforts to coordinate metropolitan and regional planning and investment are underway, whether they are quasi-government entities like the Western High Speed Rail Alliance, which aims to link Phoenix, Denver and Salt Lake City with next-generation trains, or industry-driven groups like CG/LA Inc., which promotes public-private investment in a new national infrastructure blueprint. Ironically, even some states are warming to the idea: Regional cooperation and planning is a top item at the National Governors Association.These are the groups that are pushing America deeper into the global economy by rethinking how the national economy functions. But they have to go it alone, because Congress still thinks in terms of states. America needs a new map.We don\u2019t have to create these regions; they already exist, on two levels. First, there are now seven distinct super-regions, defined by common economics and demographics, like the Pacific Coast and the Great Lakes. Within these, in addition to America\u2019s main metro hubs, we find new urban archipelagos, including the Arizona Sun Corridor, from Phoenix to Tucson; the Front Range, from Salt Lake City to Denver to Albuquerque; the Cascadia belt, from Vancouver to Seattle; and the Piedmont Atlantic cluster, from Atlanta to Charlotte, N.C.Federal policy should refocus on helping these nascent archipelagos prosper, and helping others emerge, in places like Minneapolis and Memphis, collectively forming a lattice of productive metro-regions efficiently connected through better highways, railways and fiber-optic cables: a United City-States of America.Similar shifts can be found around the world. Despite millenniums of cultivated cultural and linguistic provinces, China is transcending its traditional internal boundaries to become an empire of 26 megacity clusters with populations of up to 100 million each, centered around hubs such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Chongqing-Chengdu. Over time these clusters, whose borders fluctuate based on population and economic growth, will be the cores around which the central government allocates subsidies, designs supply chains and builds connections to the rest of the world.Western countries are following suit. As of 2015, Italy\u2019s most important political players are no longer its dozens of laconic provinces, but 14 \u201cMetropolitan Cities,\u201d like Rome, Turin, Milan and Florence, each of which has been legislatively merged with its surrounding municipalities into larger and more economically viable subregions.Britain is also in the midst of an internal reorganization, with the government of Prime Minister David Cameron driving investment toward a new corridor stretching from Leeds to Liverpool known as the \u201cNorthern Powerhouse\u201d that can become an additional economic anchor beyond London and Scotland.What would this approach look like in America? It would start by focusing not on state lines but on existing lines of infrastructure, supply chains and telecommunications, routes that stay remarkably true to the borders of the emergent super-regions, and are most robust within the new urban archipelagos.Connectivity isn\u2019t just about infrastructure; it\u2019s about strategy. It\u2019s not just about more roads, rail lines and telecommunications \u2014 as well as manufacturing plants and data centers \u2014 but where those are placed. Getting that right is critical to getting the most out of public investment. But too often, decisions about infrastructure investment are made at the state (or even county) level, and end at the state border.Consider the Gulf Coast arc from Houston to Tampa, an area growing on the back of the shale energy industry and agricultural exports. The ports of Corpus Christi and Tampa both received federal foreign trade zone status in the early 1980s and have been raising bridges and expanding terminals to prepare for larger ships coming through the Panama Canal \u2014 and their modernization also means accelerated export of food, oil and cars from America\u2019s heartland. Their fates are more intertwined than Tampa\u2019s is with Tallahassee or Corpus Christi\u2019s is with Austin, even though they\u2019re in the same state \u2014 and yet building out their infrastructure depends largely on the political whims of their respective state capitals. As a result, the region\u2019s ports have built redundant facilities rather than strengthening those best suited to capitalize on new economic connections.Nor is it just about federal policy. States need to work across borders, too. For example, instead of waging a 1980s Asian-style race to the bottom to attract low-wage auto jobs at Nissan, Honda or Toyota plants, Tennessee and Kentucky should join forces to become an advanced manufacturing hub for the global auto industry, with better cross-border infrastructure. They may end up with fewer plants, but they would be more competitive ones, especially if they could coordinate research and development through the states\u2019 public and private universities.Where possible, such planning should even jump over international borders. While Detroit\u2019s population has fallen below a million, the Detroit-Windsor region is the largest United States-Canada cross-border area, with nearly six million people (and one of the largest border populations in the world). Both sides are deeply interdependent because of their automobile and steel industries and would benefit from scaling together rather than bickering over who pays for a new bridge between them. Detroit\u2019s destiny seems almost obvious if we are brave enough to build it: a midpoint of the Chicago-Toronto corridor in an emerging North American Union.TO make these things happen requires thinking beyond states. Washington currently provides minimal support for regional economic efforts and strategies; it needs to go much further, even at the risk of upsetting established federal-state political balances. A national infrastructure bank, if it ever gets off the ground, should have as part of its charter an obligation to ignore state lines when weighing projects to support.Consider how parts of the Rust Belt could benefit from this approach. A Midwestern high-speed rail network that ran from Southern Illinois to Southern Michigan would not just link wealthy investment hubs like Louisville, Ky., and Columbus, Ohio; by tying in high-unemployment cities like Dayton, it would make it easier for workers to commute to where the jobs are.Such networks would just as easily help poor and rural areas, like Appalachia. Upgraded transportation corridors between New York, Washington and Atlanta could finally lift Appalachia\u2019s isolated and stagnant towns stretching from New York to Alabama by facilitating investment in farms and vineyards, food processing and eco-tourism.States will continue to have an important political and regulatory function to fill. But the next president has to move beyond platitudes and implement a serious policy of leveraging new infrastructure investment from home and abroad and backing the shift toward a new urban political economy built around transportation engineering, alternative energy, digital technology and other advanced sectors.The 21st century will not be a competition over territory, but over connectivity \u2014 and only connecting American cities will enable the United States to win the tug of war over global trade volumes, investment flows and supply chains. More than America\u2019s military grand strategy, such an economic master plan would determine if America remained the world\u2019s leading superpower.An earlier version of this article said that Congress provided support for the construction of the Erie Canal. Rather, the canal was funded by New York State.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Puerto Rico Passes Bill Allowing Halt to Debt Payments", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported byGov. Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla of Puerto Rico on Wednesday signed a bill that would allow him to declare a state of emergency and give him authority to halt payments on the island\u2019s crushing $72 billion debt.The measures capped two days and nights of marathon debate in Puerto Rico\u2019s legislature, where lawmakers from the main opposition party called any unilateral debt moratorium dangerous and members of the governor\u2019s party insisted that doing nothing would be even worse.In Washington, House Republicans seeking to rescue Puerto Rico prepared to release a revised plan that includes a federal oversight panel. The proposal has been contentious on the island, where the governor and his top advisers are increasingly at odds with investors over how to restructure the debt, most of it in the form of municipal bonds.\u201cThis legislation provides us with the tools to address the highest priority of needs \u2014 providing essential services to our people \u2014 without fear of retribution,\u201d the governor said in a statement on Wednesday. He accused Puerto Rico\u2019s creditors of hampering federal assistance by \u201cmisinforming the public and dissuading Congress from doing what is right for our 3.5 million American citizens.\u201dStephen Spencer, who represents some investors who have already agreed to restructure their bonds, said, \u201cWe intend to carefully review the legislation, but at this stage we believe that it may lead to violations of the terms of the agreement.\u201dThe bill did not specify a starting date for a moratorium, leaving that decision to the governor. But a big debt payment, $422 million, is due on May 1, and there have been many signs that Puerto Rico is not able or willing to pay it.But those efforts broke off in the face of a flurry of revelations that the bank was insolvent, that it might be placed in receivership, and that it was swiftly moving deposits to other financial institutions, apparently to keep them from being frozen or drained away by frightened depositors.The bill says the bank has just $562 million in cash. A moratorium would be intended, among other things, to help preserve that cash, so the bank can use it to finance the activities of other parts of the government.The law also establishes a new framework for putting the development bank into receivership, and creating a \u201cbridge bank\u201d that would take over some of its deposits and obligations during the moratorium.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Graft Cases in Chile Multiply, a \u2018Gag Law\u2019 Angers Journalists", "Date": "2016-04-07", "News": "Supported byThe revelations, reported by an emboldened news media and fueled by the leaking of names and documents, prompted the Senate this week to approve a bill that would, among other things, punish anyone who makes public information about current judicial investigations, with up to 541 days in prison.Journalists are calling it a \u201cgag law\u201d that would restrict the public\u2019s freedom of information at a time when the country\u2019s ruling elite are being shamed.\u201cWhy was this never discussed before, when reporters got hold of legal files related to other types of criminals?\u201d said Javiera Olivares, the president of the Journalists Association in Chile. \u201cThese people\u2019s rights are also affected, but this law is approved when it is the powerful who are under scrutiny.\u201dThis led to related inquiries into the mining giant SQM, which controls most of Chile\u2019s lithium production. SQM was privatized during the rule of Augusto Pinochet, whose dictatorship of Chile lasted from 1973 to 1990, and sold to the dictator\u2019s former son-in-law, Julio Ponce Lerou, who has run the company ever since. Investigators found that for years SQM has financed the campaigns of presidential candidates from parties across the political spectrum, including most in the center-left New Majority coalition now in power.So far, Mr. Ponce, the SQM chief, has avoided prosecution. But leaked emails from 2010 between a former SQM general manager, Patricio Contesse, and Pablo Longueira, then a senator for the U.D.I. Party, show them discussing changes to a mining royalty bill, and how Mr. Contesse drafted modifications that benefited the company that were later introduced by Mr. Longueira. The law was passed when Mr. Longueira was minister of economy.Mr. Longueira resigned from his party last month, denying wrongdoing and complaining that the news media had already condemned him without a trial. He and Mr. Contesse are expected to be charged with bribery on June 1, prosecutors said.There are also inquiries into the misuse of public funds by the military, collusion by major paper producers and tax fraud and money laundering involving the former leader of Chile\u2019s soccer federation, Sergio Jadue, who is now cooperating with American officials in the FIFA corruption scandal.Also under investigation is a former congresswoman, Marta Isasi, who is accused of receiving more than 27 million pesos in 2009 from one of Chile\u2019s largest fishing companies, Corpesca, as Congress debated new fishing legislation.\u201cThe depth of corruption is enormous,\u201d said Carlos Huneeus, a law professor at the University of Chile and the author of the book \u201cThe Semi-Sovereign Democracy: Chile After Pinochet.\u201d \u201cPublic interest has been subordinated to private interests, and when there is no clear distinction between them, it opens the door to endless opportunities for corruption.\u201dSeveral high-profile Chileans were among the clients of Mossack Fonseca, the Panamanian law firm whose leaked documents were published on Sunday by a consortium of newspapers. Chile\u2019s Internal Revenue Service announced it would carry out an \u201cexhaustive\u201d inquiry.The details of these far-reaching scandals, and their ramifications, which emerge almost daily, have become a trending topic in Chile, increasing doubts about the political system and the country\u2019s leaders.\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that those of us in decision-making positions are being severely questioned and have lost legitimacy, starting with the executive,\u201d the president of the Senate, Ricardo Lagos Weber, said last week. \u201cBut we are not indolent.

{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Rivals Home In on New York, Hoping to Bruise Him", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported byOne day after Senator Ted Cruz\u2019s decisive victory in Wisconsin, the Republican presidential race hurtled on Wednesday into conspicuously different terrain \u2014 New York City and its suburbs \u2014 with Republicans opposed to Donald J. Trump more hopeful than ever that the front-runner can be bruised anew, even in his hometown.Immediately, the two leading contenders revealed their dueling electoral strategies as the primary calendar drifts to the Northeast.In a show of force intended to reassert himself as a catalyst of voter passion and populist fury, Mr. Trump drew thousands of supporters to a rally on Long Island, filling a cavernous film studio with many of the blue-collar white voters who have powered his bid and are crucial to his winning statewide.\u201cFirst of all,\u201d he said to raucous cheers, \u201cit\u2019s great to be home.\u201dMr. Cruz, exulting in his Midwestern triumph, made a beeline for a slice of New York that even local Republicans have long neglected: the overwhelmingly Democratic, majority-minority Bronx.The appearance reflected Mr. Cruz\u2019s plan in New York and beyond, especially in states he is unlikely to win: He does not have to beat Mr. Trump, some allies say, despite Mr. Trump\u2019s wide lead in delegates. Mr. Cruz must simply continue amassing the delegates necessary to keep Mr. Trump from attaining a majority before the Republican convention.That fight will be waged, street by street if not stoop to stoop, in places like the Bronx, where Mr. Cruz\u2019s team believes its advantage in voter outreach and organization can yield delegates in areas with few Republicans.On Wednesday, at a Chinese-Dominican restaurant beneath the roar of an elevated subway line, the Texas senator did not shy away from his past attacks on Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cNew York values.\u201d\u201cIf you want to know what liberal, Democratic New York values are, follow Donald Trump\u2019s checkbook,\u201d he said, noting Mr. Trump\u2019s long history of donating to Democrats.Lost in Mr. Cruz\u2019s swaggering display was his current position in many of the forthcoming states \u2014 particularly New York, where his message of conservative purity and religious faith is not a natural fit \u2014 and the obstacle posed by Gov. John Kasich of Ohio in these moderate areas.A Monmouth University poll released on Wednesday placed Mr. Cruz far behind in New York, with the support of 17 percent of likely primary voters. Mr. Trump was first at 52 percent. Mr. Kasich received 25 percent.Like Mr. Cruz, Mr. Kasich stands to benefit from the way New York apportions most of its presidential delegates: Three are awarded in each of the 27 congressional districts, all of them to a candidate who wins a majority, or short of that, two to the winner and one to the second-place finisher.Mr. Kasich plans to campaign across the state, with visits planned for Brooklyn on Thursday and around Syracuse, Rochester and north of New York City in the coming days. His campaign, which began last month with a little more than $1 million cash on hand, nonetheless insists Mr. Kasich has the money to advertise in the state.And while Mr. Cruz has long argued that Mr. Kasich is helping Mr. Trump by staying in the race, some Republicans hoping to stop Mr. Trump are hopeful that the Ohio governor will prove useful in denying him delegates. Mr. Trump has other ideas.Appearing invigorated, even overwhelmed, by the rollicking, screaming, sign-waving reception in Bethpage \u2014 where a man kept shouting, \u201cI love you Trump!\u201d \u2014 Mr. Trump repeatedly brandished his local ties. He spoke of growing up in nearby Queens, and of sneaking out to Bethpage for an early-morning round of golf. He lamented that the nation had gone soft: \u201cWe don\u2019t fight like people from Long Island,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t fight like people from New York.\u201d And he suggested that New Yorkers had little use for a certain Texas senator.\u201cYou know, lyin\u2019 Ted came today \u2014 he couldn\u2019t draw 100 people,\u201d Mr. Trump said, reminding the crowd of Mr. Cruz\u2019s scornful dismissal of \u201cNew York values.\u201dAs Mr. Trump spoke, his new adviser, Paul Manafort, watched from the side of the room with other campaign aides. Mr. Manafort was recently brought on to manage Mr. Trump\u2019s convention strategy, and he held a lengthy private meeting with the candidate at Trump Tower in Manhattan to discuss urgent changes that need to be made to maximize the candidate\u2019s chances of securing the nomination, according to two people briefed on the meeting.So far, New York\u2019s elder statesmen are not uniting behind Mr. Trump in the primary. George E. Pataki, the former governor and presidential candidate who has been vocally opposed to Mr. Trump, met recently with Mr. Cruz but has not endorsed anyone. Alfonse M. D\u2019Amato, the former senator, is supporting Mr. Kasich.That leaves Rudolph W. Giuliani, who has not endorsed anyone, but who had been a loyal defender of Mr. Trump in many interviews. Yet since Mr. Trump posted on Twitter an unflattering photo of Mr. Cruz\u2019s wife, Heidi \u2014 juxtaposed against one of Mr. Trump\u2019s wife, Melania, a former model \u2014 Mr. Giuliani has been absent from public view.Mr. Giuliani did not return repeated messages seeking comment about his views of that Twitter post.Mindful of Mr. Trump\u2019s potential strength, the main outside groups opposed to his candidacy have not yet decided how aggressively to attack him in New York.On Wednesday, the two best-financed anti-Trump groups, the Club for Growth and Our Principles, were still reveling in their Wisconsin success, while quietly assessing how they could be most effective. \u201cLast night was, I do believe, a real pivot point in the campaign,\u201d said David McIntosh, who runs the Club for Growth. \u201cThe most likely scenario is now an open convention.\u201dAccording to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.Neither group is likely to purchase broadcast ads in the costly New York City market, but they are considering doing so in some of the more modestly priced upstate cities where the spending could have a greater impact and where Mr. Trump may be more vulnerable.But even as they wait to see if the Wisconsin results appreciably changed the state of the New York race, the two anti-Trump groups are looking elsewhere \u2014 with plans, for example, to compete aggressively in Indiana, a stand-alone primary on May 3.Mr. Cruz, whose campaign has prided itself on competing even in states viewed as long shots, suggested that he had no plans to cede New York: On Thursday, he plans to visit a matzo bakery in Brooklyn.On Wednesday, down the block from a Kennedy Fried Chicken, a \u201cBangladeshi-Indian-Pakistani-African-American\u201d deli and a purveyor of \u201clady toys\u201d and \u201ckarate movies,\u201d Mr. Cruz held forth with a group of ministers while supporters, protesters and occasionally confused patrons filled the restaurant. \u201cTed Cruz has no business being in the Bronx!\u201d one attendee, who identified himself as Rodrigo Starz, shouted before being escorted out by the police. (He and a peer were critical of Mr. Cruz\u2019s views on immigration and climate change.)One of Mr. Cruz\u2019s hosts, Ruben Diaz Sr., a Democratic state senator and minister who is staunchly conservative on social issues, said the protests had reinforced Mr. Cruz\u2019s criticism of \u201cNew York values.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re giving him the reasons,\u201d he said, beneath his customary cowboy hat.Speaking to reporters afterward, Mr. Cruz was asked in Spanish about bringing his hard-line message on undocumented immigration to a community of immigrants. \u201cOur community, the Hispanic community,\u201d Mr. Cruz began, before the reporter asked if the candidate could answer in Spanish. He said he understood the language better than he could speak it, before sprinkling in a bit of what he called \u201cSpanglish.\u201d\u201cI think the most powerful value in the Hispanic community is the American dream,\u201d he said. Moments later, Mr. Cruz stepped out of the restaurant, Sabrosura 2, and onto Westchester Avenue, where his car waited below the hum of a No. 6 train.Jonathan Martin and Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Williams Companies Sues Energy Transfer, Citing Breach of Deal", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported byAdding fuel to an increasingly contentious deal, the Williams Companies on Wednesday said it was suing Energy Transfer Equity and its chief executive, Kelcy Warren, for breaching their merger agreement.It is a bizarre turn of events for the $38 billion deal between Williams and Energy Transfer, which was signed in September but has since been dragged into the gutter with the sharp decline in commodity prices. Energy Transfer, based in Dallas \u2014 which would be taking on billions in debt to finance the acquisition \u2014 has sought any way out of the agreement. However, the deal is so ironclad that only Williams, based in Tulsa, Okla., can end it by paying a $1.5 billion breakup fee.The Williams board said in a release on Wednesday that it was still committed to the merger as it was signed in September. Shareholders still have to approve it.Williams\u2019s legal dispute, however, focuses on a transaction Energy Transfer recently made that gives certain unit holders, notably Mr. Warren, preferential treatment at the expense of investors in the soon-to-be combined company. Energy Transfer is a so-called master limited partnership that provides distributions \u2014 similar to dividends \u2014 to its investors. However, in a cash squeeze, those distributions can be cut. A recent private offering that Energy Transfer disclosed in March would give the select group protection if the company needed to reduce those distributions.\u201cWilliams has commenced litigation to protect the interests of its stockholders,\u201d the company said in the statement. \u201cThe litigation is intended to ensure that Williams\u2019s stockholders will receive the consideration to which they are entitled under the merger agreement.\u201dOver the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.Mr. Welch, a former investment banker, was hired to solidify Energy Transfer\u2019s deal with Williams. However, as oil and natural gas prices plummeted, so did the company\u2019s stock price, making the deal a difficult one to swallow under the $6 billion in cash that Energy Transfer is required to pay to Williams shareholders.The deal is expected to close before July. Energy Transfer shares gained 3.6 percent in early trading on Wednesday, while Williams shares declined slightly.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Panama Law Firm\u2019s Leaked Files Detail Offshore Accounts Tied to World Leaders", "Date": "2016-04-03", "News": "Supported byThe German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung said its reporters had obtained the documents from a confidential source. The newspaper then shared the files with other media organizations, like The Guardian and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.It is not illegal in many cases to have offshore bank accounts. But they are used in some instances by wealthy individuals and criminals to hide money and business transactions, and to avoid paying taxes.The leak followed a series of high-profile breaches in recent years in which individuals working for governments or companies have amassed internal files and then given them to media organizations. In 2013, Edward J. Snowden, a contractor for the National Security Agency, gave reporters what intelligence officials have estimated was thousands of documents from the agency. Hundreds of articles have been published based on those documents.The media organizations looking into Mossack Fonseca are expected to publish many more articles based on the new documents in the coming days.The firm, which has dozens of offices around the world, has been investigated by law enforcement authorities in several countries over accusations of connections to money laundering.In a lengthy statement provided to The Guardian, the firm said it could not respond to specific questions, but insisted that many of the individuals and companies named in the documents were never clients of Mossack Fonseca. The firm added that in many cases it was \u201clegal and common for companies to establish commercial entities in different jurisdictions for a variety of legitimate reasons.\u201d\u201cOur services are regulated on multiple levels, often by overlapping agencies, and we have a strong compliance record,\u201d the firm said.\u201cIn addition, we have always complied with international protocols\u201d to assure \u201cthat the companies we incorporate are not being used for tax evasion, money laundering, terrorist finance or other illicit purposes,\u201d it added.According to the news reports, the documents related to Russia identified several officials with close ties to Mr. Putin, including two of his oldest friends, Sergei Roldugin, a cellist, and Yuri V. Kovalchuk, the principal shareholder of Bank Rossiya, a financial institution that has come under sanctions by the United States as the \u201ccashier\u201d of officials in the Kremlin.The reports said Mr. Putin\u2019s friends and associates had channeled $2 billion through a complex, deliberately convoluted network of offshore companies. Mr. Putin\u2019s name appears on none of the records for the companies or the transactions, but Bank Rossiya and Mr. Roldugin do.Mr. Roldugin acknowledged in an interview with The New York Times that he owned a share of Bank Rossiya, which he acquired in the 1990s, but offered few details about an investment that made him, on paper at least, a very rich man.\u201cI\u2019ve got an apartment, a car and a dacha,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have millions.\u201dAccording to the disclosures, Mr. Roldugin holds similar shares of other companies, including an advertising firm founded by another close associate of Mr. Putin\u2019s, Mikhail Y. Lesin, who was found dead in a hotel in Washington last fall.Last week, the Kremlin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, preemptively denounced the articles published on Sunday. He warned that the consortium had prepared an \u201cinformation attack\u201d against Mr. Putin and his associates, and described the articles as \u201can undisguised paid-for hack job.\u201dThe revelations also touched Ukraine\u2019s president, Petro O. Poroshenko, who was elected in the aftermath of the political upheaval in the country in 2014 that led to the annexation of Crimea and open conflict with Russia in eastern Ukraine.Mr. Poroshenko, a tycoon with assets in television and a chocolatier before his entrance into politics, pledged to divest himself of his holdings but instead moved the assets into an offshore company in the British Virgin Islands, according to the consortium\u2019s reporting. It said that Mr. Poroshenko, who has received political support from the United States, had not disclosed the arrangement.The documents also contained information about how some foreign leaders used foundations and companies in Panama to anonymously own mining companies and real estate, according to the consortium.An article on Monday about roughly 11.5 million leaked documents from a Panama law firm that helped some of the world\u2019s wealthiest people \u2014 including politicians, athletes and business moguls \u2014 establish offshore bank accounts misstated the year that Edward J. Snowden, a contractor for the National Security Agency, gave reporters documents from the N.S.A., and the number of documents he gave them.

The prime minister has, however, removed officials who were critical of his actions, including an attorney general, Abdul Gani Patail, and a deputy prime minister, Muhyiddin Yassin.The prime minister\u2019s office has sought to explain the deposits by saying that Mr. Najib received $681 million from the Saudi royal family as a gift with no strings attached and later returned $620 million of the donation. This version of events received backing last week when the Saudi foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, told reporters in Istanbul that the money was a \u201cgenuine donation.\u201dMr. Najib\u2019s office declined to comment on Monday about Mr. Nazir\u2019s decision to take a leave of absence, saying it was a matter for CIMB.Mr. Nazir, who at times has been critical of the 1MDB fund, which was created under his brother, was drawn into the scandal last month after The Wall Street Journal reported that he had received the $7 million from the prime minister and distributed it to governing party leaders.Mr. Nazir said on Monday that he accepted the money after determining that the transactions would not violate any law and that he would not be abusing his position at CIMB.But once the unusual transfers became public, he said, he recognized that it was \u201ca cause of concern\u201d and that he should step aside to safeguard the bank\u2019s integrity.\u201cThe reputation and well being of this banking group has always been my utmost priority,\u201d he said. \u201cUnless I am completely absent from the company during this period, this institution would not be practicing the highest standards of corporate governance that we want to stand for, and I would be undermining what I have described as my utmost career priority.\u201dCIMB, which began the review on April 5, expects it to be completed in a few weeks, according to a statement issued by the bank. The multinational audit firm Ernst & Young will assist.Mr. Wan Saiful, the analyst, said that Mr. Nazir\u2019s willingness to step aside while he was being investigated was a rare step for a public figure in Malaysia and showed his confidence that he would be exonerated of any banking violations.Mr. Wan Saiful also said it was clear Mr. Nazir had not broken campaign finance laws because Malaysia did not regulate such funding.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Starwood Bidding War Ends Abruptly, Yielding a Merger and a Puzzle", "Date": "2016-03-31", "News": "Supported byAnd then early Thursday morning, Starwood and its advisers began to learn that Anbang was likely to walk away, just weeks after first emerging to challenge Marriott International in a highly visible merger contest.But after being topped twice in bidding by the group \u2014 which included Anbang, the American private equity firm J.C. Flowers & Company and Primavera Capital, an investment firm led by a former chairman of Goldman Sachs for Asia \u2014 Marriott decided earlier this week not to immediately raise its latest offer beyond roughly $13.25 billion, betting that something would befall the consortium\u2019s efforts.That wager paid off. Combining Starwood with Marriott will create the biggest hotel company in the world, with more than 5,500 owned or franchised hotels and 1.1 million rooms.\u201cThroughout this process, we have been focused on maximizing stockholder value now and in the future,\u201d Bruce Duncan, Starwood\u2019s chairman, said. \u201cOur board is confident this transaction offers superior value for Starwood\u2019s stockholders, can close quickly and provides value-creation potential that will enable both sets of stockholders to benefit from future financial performance.\u201dShares in Starwood fell more than 4 percent in after-hours trading after Anbang\u2019s disclosure, to $79.92. Shares in Marriott fell 5 percent, to $67.61.What happened to Anbang\u2019s takeover effort is unclear. In a statement on Thursday, the insurer\u2019s consortium blamed unspecified \u201cvarious market considerations\u201d for its need to withdraw.The abrupt withdrawal of the offer raised new questions, including whether the Chinese government, which has close ties with Anbang, had blocked the proposed transaction, or whether the insurer and its fellow bidders had run into issues with the financing for the deal.It is a mysterious end to the pursuit by Anbang, a huge insurer that has risen to prominence in recent years, in part through audacious deal-making. The Chinese firm, which has assets of more than $291 billion, became a force in the luxury hotel business in less than two years after buying the likes of the Waldorf Astoria and the JW Marriott Essex House.Its chairman, Wu Xiaohui, had begun to gain a reputation as a Chinese counterpart to Warren E. Buffett, his wealth compounding rapidly since founding the insurer in 2004.Still, the company he oversees has been criticized for its unusually opaque corporate structure: Thirty-seven interlocking holding companies control over 93 percent of Anbang\u2019s shares, while two government-owned companies own the remainder.Had Anbang won Starwood, its deal would have been the biggest takeover of an American target by a Chinese buyer, according to data from Dealogic.Yet from the time Anbang publicly bid for the hotel chain, investors and analysts questioned whether the Chinese-led group could actually close on its offer.Analysts said that Marriott would be hard-pressed to beat that price, since doing so could hurt its earnings per share.But Marriott publicly questioned whether Anbang and its partners truly had the financing needed to close their offer, as well as how long American government regulators would take to bless the deal.Another particular concern was whether a government panel focused on the national security aspects of mergers would require selling off Starwood properties near sensitive locations. The St. Regis Washington D.C., for example, is only blocks away from the White House, while a W hotel is near the Treasury Department.Starwood and its advisers pressed the consortium for more information about financing and whether the Chinese government would bless the new proposal, these people said, requesting anonymity to discuss confidential negotiations.People involved in the transaction spoke on the condition of anonymity.The hotelier had been waiting several days for a response from the Chinese-led group when word first began to filter in early Thursday that Anbang and its partners were preparing to walk away, according to the people briefed on the matter.Then around midafternoon on Thursday, Anbang\u2019s consortium sent Starwood\u2019s board a letter thanking them for their work but stating that it needed to walk away for unspecified market reasons.No further reason was given.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trumpism and Clintonism Are the Future", "Date": "2016-04-16", "News": "Supported byCampaign StopsNo matter who wins the New York primaries on Tuesday or which candidates end up as the presidential nominees of the two major parties, one thing is already clear: Trumpism represents the future of the Republicans and Clintonism the future of the Democrats.Those who see the nationalist populism of Mr. Trump as an aberration in a party that will soon return to free-market, limited government orthodoxy are mistaken. So are those who believe that the appeal of Senator Bernie Sanders to the young represents a repudiation of the center-left synthesis shared by Bill Clinton, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. In one form or another, Trumpism and Clintonism will define conservatism and progressivism in America.This may turn out to be the most turbulent election year since 1968, but the source of the turbulence is different. The presidential election of 1968 was a milestone in partisan realignment \u2014 the breakup of the mid-20th-century Democrats and Republicans and the reshuffling of voter blocs among the two parties. In 2016, this half-century process of partisan realignment is all but complete. What we are seeing instead of partisan realignment is policy realignment \u2014 the adjustment of what each party stands for to its existing voter base.We are accustomed to thinking of the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980 as the beginning of a new era. But from the vantage point of 2016, both Reagan and Bill Clinton look more like transitional figures. During this period, the migration from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party of socially conservative, economically populist Democrats, like the supporters of the segregationist Democrat George Wallace\u2019s independent presidential campaign in 1968, was not yet complete. Neither was the flow of moderate Rockefeller Republicans in the opposite direction.In Ronald Reagan\u2019s Republican Party, the traditional conservative wing focused on business and limited government was much stronger relative to the growing number of populist Reagan Democrats or Wallace Democrats. Like Barry Goldwater, Reagan was, in his economic views, much more of a classical liberal or libertarian than a populist. As a candidate, he denounced Social Security and Medicare, although as president he chose not to attack them. In 1986, he supported and presided over the first large-scale amnesty of illegal immigrants in American history. Although he benefited from the support of working-class whites who resented affirmative action, busing, mass immigration, sexual liberation and cultural liberalism, Reagan himself was animated by an optimistic individualism that had more in common with Chamber of Commerce boosterism than it did with the defensive and combative communitarianism of conservative populism.Like Reagan, Bill Clinton was a transitional figure in an era of partisan flux. He himself had worked in the George McGovern campaign in 1972. Nevertheless, in the 1980s and 1990s, Reagan Democrats were important enough as swing voters that Bill Clinton, Al Gore and other New Democrats sought to distance themselves from the liberal left on the military, policing, the death penalty, censorship and other issues.But in the midterm election of 1994, when the Republican party captured both houses of Congress, many centrist and conservative Democrats, particularly in the South and West, were replaced by Republicans. The Democrats who survived the slaughter were concentrated in New England and the West Coast, big cities and college towns, and majority black or majority Latino districts. The midterm elections of 2010 wiped out much of the remnant of centrist-to-conservative \u201cBlue Dog\u201d Democrats in the House.Today\u2019s Democratic base is, to simplify somewhat, an alliance of Northern, Midwestern and West Coast whites from the old Rockefeller Republican tradition with blacks and Latinos. To give one telling example, former Senator Jim Webb, the candidate who most fully represented the white Southern working-class base of the F.D.R.-to-L.B.J. Democrats, abandoned his campaign after receiving little support in a party that bears ever less resemblance to the New Deal Democrats.For their part, the Republicans of 2016 rely for their votes on the Southern white and Northern white working-class constituencies that were once the mainstays of the other party. With this partisan realignment over, the policy realignment has begun \u2014 the closing of the gap between the inherited program of a political party and the values and interests of its present-day voters.In the Republican Party, the inherited program shared by much of the conservative movement and the party\u2019s donors, with its emphasis on free trade and large-scale immigration, and cuts in entitlements like Social Security and Medicare, is a relic of the late 20th century, when the country-club wing of the party was much more important than the country-and-western wing. The anger and sense of betrayal of the newly dominant white working class in the Republican Party makes perfect sense.Donald Trump has mounted and ridden the horse of conservative populism, but it was already out of the barn. Before Mr. Trump, similar populist themes were sounded by Mike Huckabee, Rick Santorum and Patrick Buchanan. For a while, the strength of the religious right allowed elite Republicans to trade tax cuts for the rich for support for banning abortion and gay marriage. But as religious conservatism declines, a kind of European-style national populism is rising, for which protectionism and immigration restriction are central issues, not peripheral concerns.Long before Mr. Trump threw his hat into the ring in 2015, the economic libertarians who are overrepresented in the donor class and Republican think tanks and magazines were losing to the populists. Opposition to illegal immigration went from being a fringe issue associated with Patrick Buchanan in the 1990s to a central test of whether one was a \u201ctrue conservative\u201d or a Republican in Name Only. In 2007 and again in 2013, the opposition of populist Republicans thwarted so-called comprehensive immigration reform in Congress.Similarly, opposition from their own voters forced the Republicans who controlled both houses of Congress to squelch George W. Bush\u2019s proposed partial privatization of Social Security. The Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit, enacted in 2003, had the support of aging white Republican voters even as it appalled and infuriated free-marketers and deficit hawks on the right.Whatever becomes of his bid for the presidency, Mr. Trump exposed the gap between what orthodox conservative Republicans offer and what today\u2019s dominant Republican voters actually want \u2014 middle-class entitlements plus crackdowns on illegal immigrants, Muslims, foreign trade rivals and free-riding allies. Other candidates less flawed than Mr. Trump and more acceptable to the Republican establishment, like Ted Cruz, are likely to bring Republican policy positions and Republican voter preferences more closely into alignment, by moving somewhat to the left on middle-class entitlements and somewhat to the right on immigration and trade.A similar process of policy realignment is underway among the Democrats. But notwithstanding the enthusiasm of the young for Bernie Sanders, the major tension is not between Mr. Sanders and Hillary Clinton. It is between Hillary Clinton and the legacy of Bill Clinton.President Bill Clinton, as we have seen, was still trying to appeal both to the so-called rising American electorate of minorities, single women and progressives and to white working-class remnants of the old Roosevelt coalition. Looking back, many progressives today blame the Clinton administration for appealing to white voters by contributing to mass incarceration. Likewise, many progressives resent President Clinton\u2019s support of the anti-gay Defense of Marriage Act and the discriminatory \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d rule in the United States military.Today the country and the Democratic Party are more liberal on gay rights. Thanks to the Supreme Court, gay marriage is the law of the land, and the integration of gays and lesbians into the military is official policy, something inconceivable as recently as a decade ago.At the same time, the success of the Democrats in winning the popular vote for the presidency in every election since 1992 except 2004 has convinced most Democratic strategists that they don\u2019t need socially conservative, economically liberal Reagan or Wallace Democrats any more. Many Democrats hope that the long-term growth of the Obama coalition, caused chiefly by the growth of the Latino share of the electorate, will create an all but inevitable Democratic majority in the executive branch and perhaps eventually in the government as a whole. The Clintonian synthesis of pro-business, finance-friendly economics with social and racial liberalism no longer needs to be diluted, as it was in the 1990s, by opportunistic appeals to working-class white voters.This realignment within the Democratic Party requires Hillary Clinton to distance herself from many of the policies of her husband\u2019s administration and to adopt policies favored by her party\u2019s core constituencies. On issues from criminal justice to immigration enforcement, that is precisely what she has done. Even if she had not been challenged by Mr. Sanders, she probably would have done this anyway, because with the departure of the Reagan Democrats, the Democratic coalition has shifted to the left.What, then, explains the appeal of Bernie Sanders? Part of the explanation, no doubt, is that, as she herself acknowledges, Mrs. Clinton is less charismatic a candidate than Barack Obama or her husband was, despite their similar policies and backers. Part of it is simply generational. Remember, many young people were as enthusiastic about Mr. Obama in 2008 as their counterparts are about Mr. Sanders today.But on the social and racial issues that are important to today\u2019s Democratic base, it is Mr. Sanders, not Mrs. Clinton, who has had to modify his message. At the beginning of his campaign, Mr. Sanders the democratic socialist focused in the manner of a single issue candidate almost exclusively on themes of class, inequality and political corruption. But because he is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, he has had to put greater emphasis on other issues, including racial disparity in policing and sentencing and the environment and immigration.Having told Ezra Klein of Vox last July that open borders is \u201ca Koch brothers proposal\u201d that \u201cwould make everybody in America poorer,\u201d Mr. Sanders recently criticized Mrs. Clinton for opposing drivers\u2019 licenses for illegal immigrants in 2007. Mrs. Clinton, for her part, told a crowd in Henderson, Nev., in February: \u201cIf we broke up the big banks tomorrow, would that end racism? Would that end sexism?\u201dThe centrality of identity politics, rather than progressive economics, to the contemporary Democratic Party is nothing new. In 1982, the Democratic National Committee recognized seven official caucuses: women, blacks, Hispanics, Asians, gays, liberals and business/professionals. Thirty-four years later, this is the base of the Democratic Party of Hillary Clinton. The pro-Sanders left objects to the solicitude of the Democratic Party for Wall Street and Silicon Valley, the sources of much of its funding. But it is safe to assume that most progressives, when confronted with conservative candidates, will prefer incremental, finance-friendly Clintonism over the right-wing alternative. Moreover, the ability or even willingness of Mr. Sanders to help down-ballot or state candidates is doubtful. The next generation of Democrats are figures like Julian and Joaquin Castro and Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, who are much more in the mold of the Clintons and Mr. Obama than of the maverick outsider Bernie Sanders.Most important of all, it would be a serious mistake to assume that the growing sympathy of many of today\u2019s millennials for the concept of democratic socialism as embodied by Mr. Sanders will translate into a social democratic America in the 2030s or 2050s. Half a century ago, as the Age of Aquarius gave way to the Age of Reagan, many of the hippies of the \u201960s became, in effect, the yuppies of the \u201980s \u2014 still socially liberal, but with new concerns about government spending, now that they were paying taxes and mortgages.For all of these reasons, it is likely that the future of the Democrats will be Clintonism \u2014 Hillary Clintonism, that is, a slightly more progressive version of neoliberalism freed of the strategic concessions to white working-class voters associated with Bill Clintonism. On the other side of the aisle, it is probably only a matter of time before the conflict between elite libertarianism and the populism of the voters in the Republican Party is resolved more or less in favor of the voters, by a new orthodoxy that moves left on entitlements and right on immigration, while eschewing Mr. Trump\u2019s inflammatory approach.In the larger perspective of history, 2016 proves that Roosevelt Democrats and Rockefeller Republicans are gone for good.

The company believed that it was being unfairly labeled, and that the regulations that came with the designation were hindering its business.My initial reaction, I distinctly remember, was to say: \u201cThat\u2019s a terribly risky idea. The government always wins.\u201dBoy was I wrong.A judge determined that the government\u2019s process for designating MetLife a systemically important institution was not just \u201cfatally flawed,\u201d but seemingly purposely so. \u201cEvery possible effect of MetLife\u2019s imminent insolvency was summarily deemed grave enough to damage the economy,\u201d Judge Rosemary M. Collyer wrote in her opinion.Not surprisingly, Jacob J. Lew, the Treasury secretary, took great umbrage. \u201cIn overturning the conclusions of experienced financial regulators, the court imposed new requirements that Congress never enacted, and contradicted key policy lessons from the financial crisis,\u201d he said.I have no idea if MetLife is too big to fail. I\u2019ve read hundreds of pages of legal briefs from both sides, and talked to company and government officials and outside experts, and I\u2019m still not sure. I\u2019ve tried to make sense of it, but it is a highly complicated puzzle and to make such a determination with any degree of certainty requires mathematically projecting how money will flow between hundreds of institutions around the globe.Which raises this question: How can any judge with anything short of a doctorate in statistics and economic modeling be tasked with effectively overseeing the decisions of a group like the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which includes the leaders of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the list goes on.Judge Collyer smartly chose not to comment on whether MetLife was actually too big to fail, and she left open the possibility that the company could someday merit that designation. In her opinion, she said more narrowly that the process of determining that status in the case of MetLife was problematic.The judge has a long history as a thoughtful lawyer and jurist. She\u2019s also a member of the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and once worked as the general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board. In other words, she\u2019s a legal rock star.But her job in the case was, in effect, to approve or reject the approach the oversight council took in its analysis.Judges, of course, are often asked to weigh in on complicated matters that are beyond their area of expertise. The judge in the case of the F.B.I.\u2019s effort to unlock an Apple phone was not an engineer or a computer scientist. And our legal system regularly asks jurors with no background in a particular subject to decide difficult cases.But in certain instances, like the case involving MetLife and the oversight council, should there be a special court, perhaps with an area of expertise?Many of the lawyers I spoke with scoffed at the idea of a specialized tribunal to deal with issues related to the oversight council, saying that it is a judge\u2019s job to determine whether government agencies provide appropriate regulation.Still, Joshua D. Wright, a former commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission, co-wrote a 2011 study that determined in antitrust cases, a judge\u2019s expertise had a significant impact on the validity of the ruling. \u201cDecisions of judges trained in basic economics are significantly less likely to be appealed than are decisions by their untrained counterparts,\u201d the study says. \u201cOur analysis supports the hypothesis that some antitrust cases are too complicated for generalist judges.\u201dNow, with the ruling by Judge Collyer in the MetLife case, many analysts are expecting that other companies, including potentially General Electric and Prudential, will sue to have their designation lifted too. That puts the decision not to a committee of ostensibly qualified experts, but to a panel of judges with limited experience.Judge Collyer\u2019s decision may well be entirely valid, but at least in certain places she appears off base. For example, she said the government \u201cnever projected what the losses would be, which financial institutions would have to actively manage their balance sheets or how the market would destabilize as a result.\u201dWell, the government appears to have done much of that in its report, but you\u2019d need a pretty sophisticated understanding of finance to understand exactly how their numbers were calculated.Judge Collyer either decided to ignore those numbers or decided they were chosen arbitrarily.The conundrum in the case of the oversight council is that determining which companies pose a systemic risk can\u2019t be done with a straight formula. The nature of financial crises means that, as a regulator, you\u2019re playing against a 100-year storm that you can\u2019t fully foresee.That\u2019s not to say the government didn\u2019t mess up in its process of designating MetLife. It now seems as if the government, in some instances, didn\u2019t even follow its own guidelines. It may get another shot, though, with the chance to go back and remake its case that MetLife should be designated too big to fail.For now, we are left with a ruling that has damaged the government\u2019s ability to regulate an institution that at least some pretty smart people who study these things thought required an extra level of scrutiny. They may or may not have been right, but ultimately it should be left to experts to decide.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Puerto Rico Aims to Appease Congress With New Debt Proposal", "Date": "2016-04-11", "News": "Supported byPuerto Rico proposed a new plan on Monday to restructure its debt, offering some creditors better terms than an earlier plan but falling well short of winning broad support.If the threat of a debt payment moratorium was Puerto Rico\u2019s stick, the restructuring offer on Monday appears to be a carrot. Puerto Rico said it had found a way to make debt payments of $1.85 billion a year, compared with the $1.7 billion a year it had offered before.\u201cThe commonwealth is in crisis, and the fact is that we will only be able to address these issues by working together,\u201d Victor A. Suarez, Puerto Rico\u2019s secretary of state, said in a statement. \u201cOur commitment to this is underscored by our willingness to listen to our different creditors and work to meet their needs.\u201dThe new restructuring plan covers $49.3 billion of Puerto Rico\u2019s total debt, most of which is in the form of municipal bonds. It calls for creditors to accept $32.6 billion to $37.4 billion up front by exchanging existing bonds for two new classes of bonds. The offer is up from a previous offer of $26.5 billion.Puerto Rico\u2019s Government Development Bank, a crucial part of the local economy, risks defaulting on $422 million in debt payments due May 1, and the island faces $2 billion in payments on debt in July. Lawmakers both in San Juan and Washington have been working to prevent a disorderly collapse of the island\u2019s finances. Congress is working on a revised proposal to help Puerto Rico restructure under the supervision of a federal oversight panel.The Treasury secretary, Jacob J. Lew, speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations on Monday, said, \u201cThere are still some open issues.\u201d\u201cThere are a lot of details, but when you get down to the bottom line the question to us is: Does that restructuring authority work? It has to work or it\u2019s not going to be acceptable,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can\u2019t be something that you put a label on but in the marketplace it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d He did not comment on Puerto Rico\u2019s new proposal.Puerto Rico began presenting its first restructuring proposal to creditors in January. A number of them said they considered it unacceptable; some have tried with little success to interest Puerto Rico in counteroffers.Particular resistance has come from creditors who hold bonds backed by Puerto Rico\u2019s most ironclad pledges. General obligation bonds, for example, are specifically guaranteed by the island\u2019s constitution, and some holders argue that anything less than full, timely repayment would be unconstitutional.Puerto Rico has taken the position that all types of creditors must sacrifice, however. The new offer announced on Monday reflects that position. General obligation bonds held by investors who do not live on the island would get a recovery rate of 74 percent under the new proposal. Holders of sales-tax-backed bonds would get 57 percent; and holders of bonds issued by the Government Development Bank would get just 36 percent.Puerto Rico\u2019s financial crisis, and the solutions sought by Washington, could reverberate throughout municipal finance. A potential sticking point is that Puerto Rico\u2019s other long-term commitments, such as the pensions of retired government workers, would not be reduced under the new restructuring plan. Pensions do not currently have top legal priority in the order of creditors seeking payment, and some lawmakers think that switching around credit priorities for Puerto Rico would send a shock through the capital markets, making it harder for other states and cities to borrow.The new proposal calls for current bondholders to trade in their holdings for two new types of bonds. Bondholders would get more or less of each type, depending on the priority of the bonds they now hold. Those with the highest-priority bonds would get more of the first type, which offer less monetary value but greater certainty of repayment.The first type would be a \u201cbase bond\u201d with a total face value ranging from $32.6 billion to $37.4 billion, depending on whether bondholders in Puerto Rico opted in or took advantage of the special offer available to them alone.The new base bonds would start out paying 1.1 percent interest for the coming fiscal year. (Under Puerto Rico\u2019s previous offer, interest payments would not have started until a year later.) The interest rate would then rise gradually to 5 percent in 2021, the same year principal repayments would start.Bondholders living in Puerto Rico would, however, have the chance to recover more of their initial investment if they were willing to wait. Instead of trading in their holdings for the regular base bonds, they could opt for \u201clocal holder base bonds,\u201d which would have a value equal to the face amount of the bonds being handed over. The local holder base bonds would pay a fixed, 2 percent rate of interest over a longer period of time.A summary of the proposal noted that Puerto Rico was seeking to \u201cprovide relief to those Puerto Ricans who live day-to-day off their interest payments,\u201d and the government was also looking at other ways of helping them.For investors not living in Puerto Rico, there would be only a chance of getting a full recovery. In addition to their base bonds, they would get a second type, called \u201ccapital appreciation bonds,\u201d which would not offer any cash payments until after the base bonds had been fully repaid and it was clear how much of a loss each type of bondholder had suffered.At that point, this second type of bond would start paying investors enough to make up for their losses over a long time.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ripple Aims to Put Every Transaction on One Ledger", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported byChris Larsen started with a vision of making it possible for, say, a goatherd in Central Asia to do business efficiently with a fisherman in Africa or a merchant in London.But now he has tweaked the idea into something that could play a role in transforming the international financial system \u2014 and the world beyond.\u201cWe\u2019re heading for a day when every device in the world might be an economic actor,\u201d said Mr. Larsen, who made a fortune as a pioneer in online lending and founded Ripple, an Internet technology company. \u201cIt starts by being in the sewer system of finance.\u201dThe big banks at the center of global money movement, coordinating cash transfers for companies paying overseas suppliers, would not enjoy the comparison to a network of underground tunnels and pipes that carry waste. Yet while mail, music and movies travel fast online, older-style money transactions remain slow, creaky and clogged. It can take days for someone in the United States to pay someone in Africa.Ripple and several other companies working in the online world aim to fix that with a technology known by the yawn-producing term \u201cdistributed ledger.\u201dIts possibilities are anything but dull, however: Mr. Larsen imagines that the technology could go far beyond accommodating financial transactions among people and eventually enable self-driving cars to pay for tolls, parking and fuel without the help of humans. Home energy meters with ledgers might buy different sources of energy. Jet engines could record the installation of new parts and pay for maintenance on the spot.Like many things in tech, a distributed ledger is a seemingly complex idea that is actually built on a very simple one.Since the dawn of record-keeping, ledgers have been where receipts and disbursements of cash and goods are recorded. If you buy a sandwich at a deli, for example, several ledgers come into play. The money you carry to pay for it registers a slight deduction on your personal ledger. The deli owner\u2019s ledger records a gain in one place and in another a payment for the ham it bought from a supplier. A ledger at the bank records the deposit it receives from the deli owner.In a world where every business has its own books, payments tend to stop and start between different ledgers. An overseas transfer leaves the ledger of one business, then goes on another ledger at a domestic bank. It then might hit the ledger of a bank in the international transfer system. It travels to another bank in the foreign country, before ending up on the ledger of the company being paid.Each time it moves to a different ledger, the money has a different identity, taking up time and potentially causing confusion. For some companies, it is a nightmare that can\u2019t end soon enough.\u201cWhy should it take me 48 hours to make a foreign currency payment?\u201d said David Morton, chief financial officer of Seagate Technology, a major manufacturer of computer data storage devices. \u201cI have 10,000 suppliers and handle 100,000 invoices a month. If I could pay people immediately, what kind of a discount would I get?\u201dIn other words, what if one ledger could be shared among all the people in a transaction, who would agree on a common database of value that would do away with the need for currency exchanges? The actions would be recorded securely, with each participant able to see only the parts he needed to see. None of the middlemen would be needed, and payments could happen much faster.That is the idea behind a distributed ledger. Seagate has invested in Ripple and is testing the technology.The distributed ledger is best known as the underlying system that makes possible Bitcoin, the stateless cryptocurrency. Bitcoin got a bad name as a wildly fluctuating currency for drug dealers and tax cheats, in part because its participants remained anonymous. But many banks and businesses say the underlying ledger technology, if it is secure and transparent, can be more efficient than our current methods.\u201cBanks are struggling with different regulations, fragmented systems and siloed practices,\u201d said Owen Jelf, global managing director for capital markets at Accenture, which has also worked with Ripple. \u201cWe\u2019re excited about this as a technology to make things more efficient.\u201dAccenture has made several bets on the technology. Aside from Ripple, it has invested in the distributed ledger company Digital Asset Holdings, and it is working with clients in financial trading on using the technology.Another distributed ledger platform, called Ethereum, works off the same technology that Bitcoin does, but it is run as an open-source software project, meaning the software code is freely available for anyone to work on.Still another, the Hyperledger Project, recently received 44,000 lines of code from IBM, which is sharing some of its software with developers who are trying to create distributed ledgers. IBM also plans to deploy distributed ledgers internally in what would be a significant test, considering that the company does $45 billion in global financing each year.There is even the ledger system Bigchain DB that is posited as a way to prevent blood diamonds \u2014 those sold to finance armed conflicts \u2014 from entering the international gems trade. (A distributed ledger can be set up to identify every actor and what they do.)Ripple\u2019s technology is similar to the Bitcoin system, but with some differences that make it easy to manage a far larger number of transactions at the same time. Following Bitcoin\u2019s lead, Mr. Larsen also worked on developing his own currency, called XRP. But he later decided to incorporate XRP into his ledger technology as a way to improve the existing international system, instead of overwhelming it with a new cryptocurrency.He appears to have decided he will have more success by working with authorities on the existing problems of global transactions than on a new currency like Bitcoin, whose fans favor major disruption. \u201cA lot of financial technology is foolhardy,\u201d Mr. Larsen said. \u201cSaying, \u2018We\u2019re going to kill banks. We\u2019re going to disrupt everything,\u2019 ignores some realities.\u201dA San Francisco native, Mr. Larsen began his career conducting international audits for Chevron. He graduated from Stanford Graduate School of Business in 1991.Five years later, he started E-Loan, one of the first online mortgage companies. He took it public, but left in 2005 to start Prosper Marketplace, a peer-to-peer lending operation that, after initial regulatory clashes over lending laws, has facilitated several billion dollars\u2019 worth of loans.He left Prosper in 2012 to work on XRP and a global ledger system open to everyone trading anything that two people agreed was worth something \u2014 goats, money, labor, you name it.He started Ripple, originally Ripple Labs, in 2013. In 2015, it paid a $700,000 civil fine for selling XRP without registering with the United States Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. Then Mr. Larsen abandoned his Internet currency plans and turned toward the bigger transactional system.Perhaps in a sign that regulators agreed it was time to figure out how to move money in the networked world, Ripple was invited to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January, where Mr. Larsen gave a presentation to central bankers from 40 countries.Even die-hard Bitcoin fans seem ready to accept the idea that the most promising approach to reforming financial transactions \u2014 at least for now \u2014 is to focus on the system, rather than on a currency.\u201cWhat Chris and his team have done is to work within existing constraints,\u201d said Barry Silbert, founder of the Digital Currency Group, which has made 67 investments in financial technology businesses. \u201cLonger term, we\u2019ll see if that can compete with an entirely new system.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "President Obama Weighs His Economic Legacy", "Date": "2016-04-28", "News": "The Money IssueEight years after the financial crisis, unemployment is at 5 percent, deficits are down and G.D.P. is growing. Why do so many voters feel left behind? The president has a theory.Supported byTwo months ago, across an assembly-room table in a factory in Jacksonville, Fla., President Barack Obama was talking to me about the problem of political capital. His efforts to rebuild the U.S. economy from the 2008 financial crisis were being hit from left, right and center. And yet, by his own assessment, those efforts were vastly underappreciated. \u201cI actually compare our economic performance to how, historically, countries that have wrenching financial crises perform,\u201d he said. \u201cBy that measure, we probably managed this better than any large economy on Earth in modern history.\u201dIt was a notably grand claim, especially given the tenor in which presidential candidates of both parties had taken to criticizing the state of the American economy \u2014 \u201cMany are still barely getting by,\u201d Hillary Clinton said, while Donald Trump said that \u201cwe\u2019re a third-world nation.\u201d Asked if he was frustrated by all the criticism, Obama insisted that he wasn\u2019t, at least not personally. \u201cIt has frustrated me only insofar as it has shaped the political debate,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were moving so fast early on that we couldn\u2019t take victory laps. We couldn\u2019t explain everything we were doing. I mean, one day we\u2019re saving the banks; the next day we\u2019re saving the auto industry; the next day we\u2019re trying to see whether we can have some impact on the housing market.\u201dThe result, he said, was that he lacked the political capital to do more. As his presidency nears its end, this has become an increasingly common refrain from Obama, who, despite his prodigious skills as an orator, has come to seem more confident about his achievements than about his ability to promote them. \u201cI mean, the truth of the matter is that if we had been able to more effectively communicate all the steps we had taken to the swing voter,\u201d he said, \u201cthen we might have maintained a majority in the House or the Senate.\u201dThe president had come to this factory, built by Saft America for the manufacture of state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries, for a kind of belated victory lap. One of Obama\u2019s first major acts as president was to sign the American Recovery and Re\u00adinvestment Act, and some of the money in that bill went to Saft. Now batteries were rolling off the line, and Obama had stopped by to shine the national spotlight on how far we had come since the financial crisis.But the president did seem frustrated. As he tried to sum up his economic legacy in Florida, our discussion stretched to twice as long as planned, seemingly to the consternation of the Secret Service. When we got back on Air Force One, he sent an aide to ask if we could continue the conversation; when I joined him again, he looked as if he\u2019d been stewing over something. He quickly returned to the topic of public perception. \u201cIf you ask the average person on the streets, \u2018Have deficits gone down or up under Obama?\u2019 probably 70 percent would say they\u2019ve gone up,\u201d Obama said, with some justifiable exasperation \u2014 the deficit has in fact declined (by roughly three-quarters) since he took office, and polls do show that a large majority of Americans believe the opposite.Obama is animated by a sense that, looking at the world around him, the U.S. economy is in much better shape than the public appreciates, especially when measured against the depths of the financial crisis and the possibility \u2014 now rarely even considered \u2014 that things could have been much, much worse. Over a series of conversations in the Oval Office, on Air Force One and in Florida, Obama analyzed, sometimes with startling frankness, nearly every element of his economic agenda since he came into office. His economy has certainly come further than most people recognize. The private sector has added jobs for 73 consecutive months \u2014 some 14.4 million new jobs in all \u2014 the longest period of sustained job growth on record. Unemployment, which peaked at 10 percent the year Obama took office, the highest it had been since 1983, under Ronald Reagan, is now 5 percent, lower than when Reagan left office. The budget deficit has fallen by roughly $1 trillion during his two terms. And overall U.S. economic growth has significantly outpaced that of every other advanced nation.Gene Sperling, the former director of the National Economic Council who spent hours inside the Oval Office debating and devising the president\u2019s economic strategy, told me, \u201cIf we were back in early 2009 \u2014 when we were coming to work every morning with clenched stomachs, with the economy losing 800,000 jobs a month and the Dow under 7,000 \u2014 and someone said that by your last year in office, unemployment would be 5 percent, the deficit would be under 3 percent, AIG would have turned a profit and we made all our money back on the banks, that would\u2019ve been beyond anybody\u2019s wildest expectations.\u201dThere are, of course, many reasons so few Americans seem to be celebrating. \u201cHow people feel about the economy,\u201d Obama told me, giving one part of his own theory, is influenced by \u201cwhat they hear.\u201d He went on: \u201cAnd if you have a political party \u2014 in this case, the Republicans \u2014 that denies any progress and is constantly channeling to their base, which is sizable, say, 40 percent of the population, that things are terrible all the time, then people will start absorbing that.\u201dBut as Obama also acknowledged, the public anger about the economy is not without empirical basis. A large swath of the nation has dropped out of the labor force completely, and the reality for the average American family is that its household income is $4,000 less than it was when Bill Clinton left office. Economic inequality, meanwhile, has only grown worse, with the top 1 percent of American households taking in more than half of the recent gains in income growth. \u201cMillions and millions and millions and millions of people look at that pretty picture of America he painted and they cannot find themselves in it to save their lives,\u201d Clinton himself said of Obama\u2019s economy in March, while on the campaign trail for his wife. \u201cPeople are upset, frankly; they\u2019re anxiety-ridden, they\u2019re disoriented, because they don\u2019t see themselves in that picture.\u201dIt is this disconnect that haunts Obama. He has, by his own lights, managed the recovery as well as any president ever could, with results that in many cases exceeded his own best hopes. But despite the gains of the past seven years, many Americans have been left behind. Something has changed, and as he prepares to leave office, Obama seems to understand that his economic legacy might be judged not just by what he has done, but by how the results compare to a bygone era of middle-class opportunity, one that perhaps no president, faced with the sweeping changes transforming the global economy, could ever bring back.The next day Obama found himself in the Cabinet Room just down the hall from the Oval Office, along with McCain and congressional leaders from both parties. Henry M. Paulson Jr., the Treasury secretary, was developing a bank bailout by which the Treasury would buy up to $700 billion in shaky mortgage-backed securities \u2014 \u201ctroubled assets\u201d \u2014 a plan that eventually became the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP. He needed votes, and Republicans weren\u2019t going for it. Nobody wanted to be seen as a friend of the banks.\u201cWe\u2019re sitting around a table, McCain is on one side, I\u2019m on the other, Bernanke and Paulson and President Bush,\u201d Obama recalled. \u201cPaulson says, \u2018If we don\u2019t take action now, we could go into a free fall.\u2019 And given how bad the politics were, it was still very tempting for Nancy and Harry\u201d \u2014 that is, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid \u2014 \u201cto let the Republicans do what they needed to do.\u201dMany within Bush\u2019s own party were supporting an alternative bill that was focused on mortgage-\u00adasset insurance and tax cuts. But Obama, convinced that anything short of a major bailout could lead to economic catastrophe, said Democrats should back Paulson\u2019s plan. They did.It was a rare moment of bipartisanship, with long-term political consequences. To Obama, this was a necessary alliance with Wall Street and a Republican president. To many others, it looked like a sweetheart deal for the same people who created the mess; some critics wondered why he was not equally quick to help aggrieved homeowners through an aggressive mortgage-relief or forgiveness program. \u201cThe whole thing about financial crises is the tools that work are the ones that will make you look like you\u2019re in bed with the banks,\u201d said Timothy Geithner, an architect of TARP whom Obama made his Treasury secretary.The strange hot-cold relationship with Wall Street made the next part of Obama\u2019s program extremely complicated. When Obama took office, he turned immediately to trying to pass a stimulus package. If TARP was meant to keep the economy out of free fall, the stimulus was meant to help it get back into good shape. The crucial questions was: How much money was needed?Many argue today that Obama\u2019s $800 billion plan, the one that eventually became law, was not enough. With a bigger boost, the economy would have recovered much more quickly and years of needless suffering could have been allayed. In truth, of course, the political headwinds against stimulus were extraordinary. Republicans dismissed it as an irresponsible shopping spree that would leave the country in even greater debt. Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the minority leader in the House, physically threw the bill on the ground, arguing that it was \u201cnothing more than spending, spending and more spending.\u201d But Democrats, led by the \u201cdeficit hawk\u201d wing of the party, also fought against anything too ambitious, and Obama, still in the first month of his presidency, was left in the position of negotiating with his own party, such that he was just barely able to get the $800 billion on a straight party-line vote.At first, the results of the stimulus were just as feeble as a stalwart Keynesian might predict. The economy needed a big injection, but it got only a medium-size one, so it continued to falter. A January 2009 report from the president\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers projected that the stimulus would keep unemployment below 8 percent. Instead, it climbed to 10 percent in 2009 and only fell back below 8 percent in 2012, leading to criticism that the stimulus was ineffective. Obama\u2019s critics regularly trot out the talking point that Obama\u2019s economy is \u201cthe worst recovery since World War II.\u201d Judged solely by the growth of gross domestic product, that is accurate. But Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard economics professor and co-author of \u201cThis Time Is Different,\u201d a well-regarded history of financial crises, scoffed when I mentioned the \u201cworst recovery\u201d epithet. \u201cWell, have we had a systemic financial crisis since World War II?\u201d he asked rhetorically. \u201cI mean this was like nothing we\u2019ve experienced since World War II. The 1982 Volcker recession was nothing compared to this, and so you have to look at the nature of the shock.\u201dObama, though, was unable or unwilling to rhetorically underscore the severity of the crisis as it unfolded, so perhaps what should have been seen as successes were seen as failures. \u201cIt was a delicate balance throughout 2009 and 2010 to be straight with the American people about the depths of the problem, how close we were to disaster, without scaring the heck out of them,\u201d Obama said.Beyond the messaging challenge, Obama faced a practical bind as well: Just as he was trying to reinflate the economy, he was also being forced to cut government jobs, under pressure from Republicans who contended that government bloat and the cost of it could create our next financial crisis. Call it an anti-stimulus. \u201cThis is the first recovery where you actually saw the government work force decline, and that created this massive fiscal drag throughout the recovery,\u201d Obama said.Despite all this, over the course of his presidency, Obama has actually been able to oversee a much larger stimulus than has been typically reported. If you add up all of his administration\u2019s classic stimulus measures, including the many tax breaks the administration extended, you get $1.4 trillion, a figure that is nearly twice the original figure. The anti-stimulus, then, was counteracted by a stealth stimulus.\u201cProgressives don\u2019t fully appreciate the degree to which the 2011 budget deal not only averted a potential default but actually limited the potential damage of a newly emboldened Congress in imposing austerity on a still-fragile recovery,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnd by me winning in 2012 and getting the Bush tax cuts for the upper 2 percent repealed, we ended up getting a grand bargain. It\u2019s just we got it sequentially instead of all at once.\u201dWhen I asked Barney Frank about how history will judge the recovery, he was simultaneously rueful and amused. As chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, Frank was one of the major legislative architects of Obama\u2019s economic program. \u201cYou get no credit for disaster averted or damage minimized,\u201d Frank said. By way of illustration, he described a bumper sticker that a friend made him in 2010, with a slogan that could have worked just as well for Obama: \u201cThings would have sucked worse without me.\u201d Frank, with a halfhearted laugh, added, \u201cThat\u2019s not a very salable message.\u201dIn December 2009, Obama was not reluctant to chastise bankers. \u201cI did not run for office to be helping out a bunch of fat-cat bankers on Wall Street,\u201d he told Steve Kroft on \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d \u201cThe people on Wall Street still don\u2019t get it. They don\u2019t get it. They\u2019re still puzzled, \u2018Why is it that people are mad at the banks?\u2019\u2009\u201dGiven the national mood at the time, Obama\u2019s words shouldn\u2019t have come as a surprise to the business leaders. But the financial sector had buoyed Obama\u2019s campaign, giving him $16 million in political support, nearly twice what McCain received from it, and some executives responded to his new populism in emotional terms. \u201cIt\u2019s a war,\u201d Stephen Schwarzman, a co-founder of Blackstone Group, the giant private-equity firm, said of Obama in 2010 and his effort to close a tax loophole that benefited the industry. \u201cIt\u2019s like when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939.\u201d (Schwarzman later apologized.) Others seemed more concerned with the language itself. In 2011, Leon Cooperman, a billionaire hedge-fund manager, wrote a public letter to Obama, saying: \u201cThe divisive, polarizing tone of your rhetoric is cleaving a widening gulf, at this point as much visceral as philosophical, between the downtrodden and those best positioned to help them. It is a gulf that is at once counterproductive and freighted with dangerous historical precedents.\u201dWhen I asked him about these reactions, Obama laughed. The criticism he leveled at Wall Street \u201cwas extraordinarily mild,\u201d he said, but \u201cit hurt their feelings. I would have some of them say to me, \u2018You know, my son came home and asked me, \u2018Am I a fat cat?\u2019\u2009\u201d He laughed again.Obama\u2019s rhetoric does seem mild, at least compared with the withering contempt of, say, Franklin Roosevelt, who, laying out the objectives for the second stage of the New Deal in 1936, said that reckless bankers and speculators are \u201cunanimous in their hate for me \u2014 and I welcome their hatred.\u201d Obama, to the contrary, seems to find their hatred irritating. \u201cOne of the constants that I\u2019ve had to deal with over the last few years is folks on Wall Street complaining even as the stock market went from in the 6,000s to 16,000 or 17,000,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019d be constantly complaining about our economic policies. That\u2019s not rooted in anything they\u2019re experiencing; it has to do with ideology and their aggravations about higher taxes.\u201dWall Street\u2019s biggest fight with Obama was over the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which Obama signed into law in the summer of 2010. The legislation, which runs to 2,223 pages, limited Wall Street\u2019s riskiest trading schemes, established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and created a system to wind down failing banks without taxpayer-funded bailouts and break up banks that don\u2019t comply. Like the stimulus, Dodd-Frank has been seen as both going too far and not far enough.Some economists have suggested that the reform package, combined with the Federal Reserve\u2019s efforts to force the banks to hold more capital, most likely slowed lending and potentially economic growth in the short term. The new rules may have been sensible in the aftermath of the crisis, but they did take an economic toll. \u201cGrowth requires access to capital to finance investments in plant, equipment, technology, and workers,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office who now runs American Action Forum, a right-leaning research group. \u201cDodd-Frank made capital scarcer and more expensive at a time when the weak economy desperately needed a boost to growth.\u201d Holtz-Eakin estimated in 2015 that the regulations would shave $895 billion off gross domestic product over the next decade.Obama sees the legislation in more complicated terms. He said that he liked the film \u201cThe Big Short\u201d \u2014 a vivid portrayal of the 2008 crisis with a special emphasis on the avarice of its main architects \u2014 but not its ending. It suggests, wrongly, he said, that nothing has changed on Wall Street. The financial sector \u201cis bigger, absorbs more resources and maybe most importantly, more talent than I would like to see. I would like folks who are really good at math to be going into engineering and the sciences more than they\u2019re going into trying to build algorithms to beat the market and to work arbitrage,\u201d he said.\u201cBut there is no doubt that the financial system is substantially more stable,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is true that we have not dismantled the financial system, and in that sense, Bernie Sanders\u2019s critique is correct\u201d \u2014 a reference to the Vermont senator and presidential aspirant who regularly calls to break up America\u2019s biggest banks. \u201cBut one of the things that I\u2019ve consistently tried to remind myself during the course of my presidency is that the economy is not an abstraction. It\u2019s not something that you can just redesign and break up and put back together again without consequences.\u201d\u201cThe reason I\u2019m here today is because Saft is telling a story about the amazing work that people all across this country have done to bring America back from one of the worst financial crises in our history,\u201d Obama said, surveying the crowd.He added: \u201cAnybody who says we are not absolutely better off today than we were just seven years ago, they\u2019re not leveling with you. They\u2019re not telling the truth.\u201dThe story Obama told was one of American ingenuity and growth since the financial crisis. Unemployment in Florida peaked at 11.2 percent in 2009, higher than the national average, and the state was a center for home foreclosures. Saft America was an example not of the government\u2019s effort just to reduce unemployment right now, which it has, but also to spur investment in the next-generation green technologies, like lithium-ion batteries, that will help the economy expand for decades to come.In a way, though, the plant was inadvertently telling a more complicated story, about globalization and the changing nature of commerce. Saft America is a unit of Saft Groupe, a French company with holdings around the world. Sales of lithium-ion batteries have been considerably slower than anticipated, and the factory has yet to turn a profit. The French parent doesn\u2019t expect profitability for another two or three years and has already written down part of its investment on the factory.Here was a factory built, in part, with U.S. government dollars for the benefit of the local and national economy. Yet the factory, its technology and its patents are all owned by a foreign corporation. Its French chief executive is almost completely detached from the community here in Jacksonville; he did not even attend Obama\u2019s speech. And the factory\u2019s profits, to the extent they ever come, may very well be sent abroad instead of being reinvested here.The factory visit might also tell a more complicated story about the presidency. It has always been the case that voters credit or, more often, blame the president for the nation\u2019s economic performance. But it is also the case that the president generally has considerably less sway to move the economy than even he might like to acknowledge. And as the economy continues to disperse, that sway may be diminishing further. A president has less power than ever, in either a hard- power (legal/regulatory) or soft-power (cultural) sense, over American chief executives, let alone over the chief executives of multinationals based in France or China or other places where many U.S. employers make their headquarters.In the assembly room after the speech, Obama acknowledged as much. \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about inversions,\u201d Obama said, referring to the practice whereby American companies effectively move overseas, \u201cor you\u2019re talking about C.E.O. perks or the gap between what the assembly-line worker is making compared to what the C.E.O. is making, all those things used to be constrained by the fact that you live in the city, you\u2019re going to church in that city, your kids might be going to the same school as the guy who is working on the assembly line because public schools actually were invested in,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnd all those constraining factors have been greatly reduced or, in some cases, eliminated entirely. And that contributes to the trends toward inequality. That contributes to, I think, a divergence between how the people who run these companies and economic elites think about their responsibilities and the policies that they promote with political leaders. And that\u2019s had, I think, a damaging effect on the economy overall.\u201dLeaning forward in his chair, Obama described the profound structural shifts in the economy over the past two decades that voters often don\u2019t appreciate or acknowledge. \u201cIf you are a blue-collar worker, you saw manufacturing head out to China,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re in a town, the plant closes. But \u2014 in part because of the housing bubble \u2014 a whole bunch of blue-collar manufacturing workers could suddenly shift into construction.\u201dThe underlying economic decay was covered up by cheap credit, as homeowners made up for the shortfall in wage growth with low-interest second mortgages and unprecedented loads of credit-card debt. And that \u201cmeant that people felt pretty good in terms of their purchasing power even though their underlying situations hadn\u2019t improved appreciably,\u201d Obama said. Then the bubble bursts, \u201cand suddenly they get washed away.\u201d Those construction jobs have returned slowly, and many of those manufacturing jobs never came back at all.\u201cThey\u2019d be much worse off had we not taken the steps that we took,\u201d Obama said. \u201cBut they have a sense that it\u2019s a little more of a struggle for them than it might have been for their parents or for their grandparents.\u201dObama considered the problem from a political perspective. \u201cIn some ways,\u201d he said, \u201cengaging in those hard changes that we need to make to create a more nimble, dynamic economy doesn\u2019t yield immediate benefits and can seem like a distraction or an effort to undermine a bygone era that doesn\u2019t exist. And that then feeds, both on the left and the right, a temptation to say, \u2018If we could just go back to an era in which our borders were closed,\u2019 or \u2018If we could just go back to a time when everybody had a defined-benefit plan,\u2019 or \u2018We could just go back to a time when there wasn\u2019t any immigrant that was taking my job, things would be O.K.\u2019\u2009\u201d He didn\u2019t mention Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders by name, but the implications were obvious.It was Obama\u2019s boldest piece of legislation and the one that will most likely define him. It has been largely viewed as a social program, a way to provide health insurance to tens of millions of uncovered citizens. But the bill, which affected not just insurance companies but doctors, hospitals and pharmaceutical companies, also had an immediate and growing impact on the economy as a whole. The health care industry accounts for 17.5 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product, and health care spending accounts for 8 percent of the average household budget. Of course, the largest economic challenge most Americans ever confront comes in the form of a sudden health crisis. \u201cIn the long term,\u201d Sperling told me, \u201cthe Affordable Care Act will actually be seen as one of the great economic accomplishments, not just health care, economic. Because it actually is closing a key part of the insecurity gap.\u201dIn closing that gap, though, Obama has been confronted with a knotty economic and political paradox. The legislation was designed to slow the growth of health care costs, even as it extended coverage. Slowing the growth of an industry that accounts for nearly a fifth of the U.S. economy is inevitably going to mean slowing the growth of the economy as a whole. The legislation was also designed to exert a more subtle economic influence. For most of the postwar era, most Americans received health insurance from their employers, in the form of benefits. If they quit their jobs or were fired, they could lose those benefits, and if they had a pre-existing condition, they could have a hard time getting them back, even if they got a new job with good benefits elsewhere. That meant they would be much less likely to leave a job, and that meant employers could be a little less worried about raising wages, because they had a somewhat captive work force. In the age of the gig economy, more portable insurance could transform the way we work and potentially have a real effect on wages in some sectors.In 2014, the Congressional Budget Office released a report estimating that the Affordable Care Act would \u201creduce the total number of hours worked, on net, by about 1.5 percent to 2.0 percent during the period from 2017 to 2024\u201d \u2014 a seemingly disastrous outcome for the economy. But, the director of the office, Doug Elmendorf, later wrote, \u201cThe reason for the reduction in the supply of labor is that the provisions of the A.C.A. reduce the incentive to work for certain subsets of the population.\u201d In other words, a lot of people worked because they had to, in order to keep their insurance. Now they could quit, even if they were sick; a positive development for them, but with a perverse effect on the economy.And for all of that, Americans do not yet seem to be feeling the benefits of the new program, in part because the benefits remain uncertain. \u201cIf your health care premiums go up by 6 percent, you\u2019re still irritated,\u201d Obama said, \u201ceven though the trend lines have been those premiums are going up 15 percent.\u201dRepublicans were unanimously opposed to the bill, and Obama could pass only so much major legislation before the congressional election that many expected to flip House control from the Democrats to the Republicans, as it indeed did. That meant that he had to choose the A.C.A. over any number of other high-priority agenda items, including another stimulus, perhaps in the form of a massive infrastructure bill, which would have given the economy an unambiguous boost. \u201cIf you went back a few years, you might say, \u2018Well, he should\u2019ve focused even more on pushing through a bigger fiscal stimulus, which he could have if he wasn\u2019t going for the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Rogoff said. \u201cThat was a trade-off he made, and it cost him.\u201dObama knows it. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, is that our failure in 2012, 2013, 2014, to initiate a massive infrastructure project \u2014 it was the perfect time to do it; low interest rates, construction industry is still on its heels, massive need \u2014 the fact that we failed to do that, for example, cost us time,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIt meant that there were folks who we could have helped and put back to work and entire communities that could have prospered that ended up taking a lot longer to recovery.\u201dAfter 2010, all that was available to Obama was executive action: The ascendant G.O.P. made anything else nearly impossible. So the president turned more and more to regulatory rule changes and executive orders. He raised the minimum wage for federal contract workers to $10.10; he overhauled immigration policy to protect some illegal immigrants from deportation (the Supreme Court just heard a case to overrule the action); he signed an order calling on government agencies with oversight of industry to find ways to make them more competitive, like pressing cable companies to let customers use cable boxes made by rivals. But without Congress, the big legislative moves, the ones that would really change history, seemed past.\u201cI can probably tick off three or four common-sense things we could have done where we\u2019d be growing a percentage or two faster each year,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe could have brought down the unemployment rate lower, faster. We could have been lifting wages even faster than we did. And those things keep me up at night sometimes.\u201dIt was a scene that underscored a challenge facing the U.S. economy and one that may be the driving factor behind greater inequality: We\u2019re not only losing jobs to overseas competition, we\u2019re losing them to technology. Obama noted the robots, too. \u201cWe just saw here those robots were pretty impressive, but also pointed to the direction the economy is going,\u201d he said.He clearly recognizes the problem \u2014 he said he spends a lot of time thinking about it \u2014 but he also knows the solutions will come only when he is long out of office. Many citizens, he said, back on Air Force One, \u201chave to worry about retraining at some point in their careers, because they can\u2019t anticipate being in one place for 30 years. The occupational mix in the economy places greater demands on people because it\u2019s changing more rapidly. And all of this makes people feel that they don\u2019t know what\u2019s around the corner.\u201d For whatever sense of \u201cuncertainty\u201d business leaders lament, this may be a much more profound sense of uncertainty.\u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons that I pursued the Trans-Pacific Partnership,\u201d he said, bringing up the free-trade pact that, uniquely, has divided both parties, \u201cnot because I\u2019m not aware of all the failures of some past trade agreements and the disruptions to our economy that occurred as a consequence of globalization, but rather my assessment that most trends are irreversible given the nature of global supply chains, and so we better be out there shaping the rules in ways that allow for higher labor standards overseas, or try to export our environmental standards overseas so that we have more of a level playing field.\u201dWhether a president can truly improve, or damage, an economy remains an open question. The greatest economic power might in fact remain in the hands of the Federal Reserve. Economists credit the Fed\u2019s policy of keeping interest rates at historic lows with helping to pump up the economy and bring unemployment down. At the same time, the Fed has been blamed for widening inequality, swelling the price of real estate and corporate profits, even as savers and retirees dependent on fixed-income assets have suffered.That can cut either way in terms of a president\u2019s economic legacy. Critics of Obama, including the new House speaker, Paul Ryan, credit Ben Bernanke, the former Federal Reserve chairman, and Janet Yellen, the current chairwoman, for whatever recovery we\u2019ve had since the crisis, contending it happened in spite of the president. \u201cI think the Federal Reserve has done more,\u201d Ryan said at a January news conference. Frank, for his part, almost jumped through the phone when I mentioned that argument during an interview. \u201cAnd Bernanke and Yellen were appointed by whom? Neither Bernanke or Yellen would have been able to do what they were doing without his full backing.\u201dUltimately, however, Obama said the lessons of his time in office are being misunderstood in the election campaigns. \u201cIf you look at the platforms, the economic platforms of the current Republican candidates for president, they don\u2019t simply defy logic and any known economic theories, they are fantasy,\u201d Obama said. \u201cSlashing taxes particularly for those at the very top, dismantling regulatory regimes that protect our air and our environment and then projecting that this is going to lead to 5 percent or 7 percent growth, and claiming that they\u2019ll do all this while balancing the budget. Nobody would even, with the most rudimentary knowledge of economics, think that any of those things are plausible.\u201dHe continued: \u201cIf we can\u2019t puncture some of the mythology around austerity, politics or tax cuts or the mythology that\u2019s been built up around the Reagan revolution, where somehow people genuinely think that he slashed government and slashed the deficit and that the recovery was because of all these massive tax cuts, as opposed to a shift in interest-rate policy \u2014 if we can\u2019t describe that effectively, then we\u2019re doomed to keep on making more and more mistakes.\u201dAndrew Ross Sorkin is a financial columnist for The New York Times, founder and editor at large of DealBook and co-anchor of CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Padres Count on a Career .200 Hitter to Guide Them to Contention ", "Date": "2016-04-30", "News": "Supported byExtra BasesThe Mets surged late last season by mercilessly beating bad teams down the stretch. They have done it again this season, sweeping the lowly Atlanta Braves and the Cincinnati Reds heading into the weekend. They will play the Braves again this week, at Citi Field, and then head for San Diego to meet the Padres, another last-place team.The Padres have had an unusual season. They were shut out in each of their first three games, and they have since been blanked three more times. When they broke loose for nine runs on Thursday, they gave up 13 and lost to the Giants, who completed a three-game sweep.In Andy Green, at least, the Padres have a manager who should help them grow. The Padres, who have not reached the playoffs in a decade, gave Green his first major league managing job last October.\u201cHe is a star,\u201d said Tony La Russa, the Arizona Diamondbacks\u2019 chief baseball officer, who would know. La Russa, a Hall of Fame manager, noticed Green\u2019s acumen while touring the Arizona farm system in 2014. Green \u2014 who, like La Russa, had a brief major league playing career as an infielder \u2014 knew his boss\u2019s meager batting statistics.\u201cThe first time I met him, he asked me to introduce him to my team in Double-A,\u201d Green said recently. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, \u2018You really think you need an introduction?\u2019 He\u2019s got, like, all three World Series rings \u2014 he\u2019s Tony La Russa.\u201cSo I said to the guys: \u2018If he needs an introduction, you don\u2019t deserve the jersey that\u2019s on your back. He\u2019s got more World Series rings on his fingers than I\u2019m guessing all of you have ever seen. But there\u2019s really only one thing all of you need to know: He\u2019s a career .199 hitter, I\u2019m a career .200 hitter. So in this clubhouse, you know who you need to be listening to.\u2019\u00a0\u201dGreen laughed as he told the story. He played parts of three seasons with the Diamondbacks, hitting .199 from 2004 to 2006. He went 1 for 4 in four games for the Mets in 2009, freezing his average at .200.After one more season as a minor league player, Green spent four years climbing the managerial ranks for the Diamondbacks, who promoted him to Chip Hale\u2019s staff as the third-base and infield coach last season.\u201cHe knows how to communicate with people; he knows how to develop relationships, which then creates a trust factor where he can start to teach the game,\u201d said Diamondbacks shortstop Nick Ahmed, who played for Green in the minors. \u201cHe\u2019s very intelligent about the game, he studies it, he cares about it. There\u2019s no arrogance about him. He just wants to learn and get better.\u201dThe Padres have plenty of room to get better. After a series of costly moves for veterans before last season, the Padres staggered to a 74-88 record. Two of the new stars \u2014 Craig Kimbrel and Justin Upton \u2014 did not return, and while others like Wil Myers and Matt Kemp have been productive, the Padres entered the weekend with the National League\u2019s second-worst slugging percentage. They also lost their No. 2 starter, Tyson Ross, to a shoulder injury after one start.Green cannot control all that, but he said that he hoped he could at least influence the Padres\u2019 style of play.\u201cI want to be opportunistic,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery team has a weakness on the field, and we should be able to take advantage of it. We should play intelligent, aggressive baseball. That\u2019s why the fine details matter to me, because that\u2019s how I want my teams to be defined.\u201d A Road Back to Baseball By the end, Jeremy Sowers\u2019s body was screaming the message to him: He needed to find a new line of work. Sowers, chosen sixth over all by Cleveland in the 2004 draft, had lost one season to rotator-cuff surgery and another to a torn Achilles\u2019 tendon. He was accepted to business school at the University of North Carolina in 2013, but he wanted to pitch just a bit more, in an independent league, to show that two years of rehabilitation had paid off.\u201cAfter about 50 innings, my arm hated me,\u201d Sowers said. \u201cIt was everything imaginable just to get ready to pitch.\u201dSowers, who was 18-30 in four major league seasons, got on with his life. After business school, he went to work in a finance and strategy program at the Walmart headquarters in Arkansas. The job offered a stable lifestyle, but it was not for him.\u201cI started realizing I actually care a lot about this game,\u201d Sowers said. \u201cWhen you do play the game, you think this is normal because you\u2019re around it every day and these are your friends. You grow up with these guys, you spend tons of time in the clubhouse, you have to treat it like it\u2019s everyday life \u2014 but it\u2019s far from it. Every now and then, you need to take a step away and re-remind yourself of how significant and privileged you are to get to play this game.\u201dPlaying was no longer an option, but working was. Armed with a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 on the field and in the classroom \u2014 he also has an undergraduate degree in political science from Vanderbilt \u2014 Sowers landed a baseball operations internship with the Baltimore Orioles last season. That led to a full-time job as a major league operations assistant for the Tampa Bay Rays.Sowers spends the games in Tampa Bay\u2019s video-replay room, and he was ready in the first week of the season when the Rays won a game on a replay reversal. Toronto\u2019s Jose Bautista was ruled to have slid illegally to break up a double play, the first prominent application of baseball\u2019s new slide rules.\u201cThe first meeting I went to, they were basically coming in and saying, \u2018O.K., new slide rule, let\u2019s talk about this,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Sowers said. \u201cAny baseball person knew it was going to get interesting, how this gets interpreted.\u201dSowers joked that in one game, he was more valuable to the Rays than he had been to the Indians, for whom he compiled 1.5 wins above replacement, as calculated by the Baseball-Reference website. The Rays\u2019 manager, Kevin Cash, said he was happy to have him on staff.\u201cJeremy\u2019s got a calmness about him,\u201d Cash said. \u201cIn that position, there\u2019s a lot going on in the game, there\u2019s an urgency to get a call right, the umpires are waiting, we\u2019re waiting. You\u2019ve got to have that calm presence about you, and Jeremy definitely has that. He\u2019s as smart as anybody in the room, obviously, and having played the game, it helps.\u201dKnowing when to stop playing \u2014 and how to stand out when he wanted back in \u2014 may have been Sowers\u2019s smartest move of all.Near Miss for a CatcherLast Monday afternoon, the Chicago White Sox posted their lineup for that night\u2019s game against the Toronto Blue Jays. A new catcher, Kevan Smith, would be batting ninth and making his major league debut.\u201cIt\u2019s awesome,\u201d Smith told reporters before the game, \u201cand it\u2019s going to be a great experience.\u201dBefore batting practice, though, his experience turned sour. Smith felt back spasms while the White Sox stretched, and he was scratched from the game. Smith was placed on the disabled list and has still not officially appeared in a major league game.Smith had been hitting well at Class AAA Charlotte, with a .345 average and two homers in eight games, so he would seem to have hope of coming back. But returning to the majors, after coming so close, is no guarantee. Smith, 27, will hope to avoid the fate of Larry Yount.The Houston Astros called on Yount to pitch the top of the ninth inning against Atlanta on Sept. 15, 1971. Yount, who had not thrown for a week while fulfilling a military obligation, felt elbow pain while warming up. Because he was announced, Yount was officially listed as having played in the game. But he was removed before ever throwing a pitch and never returned to the majors.A few years later, though, Yount\u2019s brother, Robin, did play in the majors for the Milwaukee Brewers. He ended up staying for 20 seasons, collecting 3,142 career hits and earning a spot in the Hall of Fame.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "John Kasich Sees Path to Nomination Despite Low Delegate Count", "Date": "2016-04-11", "News": "Supported byGov. John Kasich of Ohio has performed so abysmally in the Republican presidential primary that his curious insistence on remaining in the race has made him into a can\u2019t-take-a-hint punch line.As the race for the Republican presidential nomination turns toward a series of Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states this month, even Mr. Kasich\u2019s supporters concede that he must quickly demonstrate relevance if he is to have even a long-shot hope of emerging as an alternative candidate at a contested convention this summer.\u201cFunny things can happen at conventions, but John has got to start picking up some delegates,\u201d said former Representative Thomas M. Davis III, a Virginia Republican who is co-hosting a fund-raiser for Mr. Kasich this week. \u201cHe\u2019s got to walk in there with at least 230 or so delegates, some sort of critical mass in hand.\u201dMr. Kasich has repeatedly found reasons to explain away losses and remain in the race, but the conditions now are about as favorable as he is likely to find: Mr. Trump has suffered a series of self-inflicted wounds that have solidified resistance among his many skeptics. Mr. Cruz has shown little ability to appeal to heavily secular Republican primary voters in the Northeast. And the only states voting through the end of April are filled with the sort of pragmatic centrists whom Mr. Kasich has targeted since entering the race last year.If he is not competitive in New York, which votes next week, or in Connecticut, Rhode Island, Maryland, Delaware and Pennsylvania, where voters go to the polls on April 26, it is not clear where he will fare any better.\u201cWe have to be a real factor in those places,\u201d said Tom Rath, a supporter of Mr. Kasich in New Hampshire.But Mr. Kasich is still trying to keep expectations low, resisting the suggestion that he will have to eventually win a state other than Ohio to become his party\u2019s nominee.\u201cI need to continue to gather delegates, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do, and go into the convention aggressively with as many delegates as we can muster,\u201d he told reporters in Connecticut last week when asked about the possibility of finding a victory.Mr. Kasich has drawn sizable crowds in his ventures into upstate New York, and some surveys show him drawing more votes than Mr. Cruz in the state. That could mean he nets more delegates than Mr. Cruz in a state where the second-leading vote-getter in each of the 27 congressional districts receives a delegate, provided the top finisher does not get more than 50 percent of the vote. But the governor is far behind Mr. Trump in the same polls, and he lacks the money to finance a sustained and significant advertising campaign in a state with 10 media markets.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.So, facing the prospect of losing to the front-runner in New York and beyond, Mr. Kasich has fashioned a new rationale for going forward: Savvy convention delegates will prove far more receptive to his electability argument than rank-and-file voters.\u201cThese party bosses and ward heelers, you think they want to get skunked in their wards or in their neighborhoods?\u201d he asked in Greece, N.Y., on Saturday, promoting his advantage in hypothetical polls against Hillary Clinton. \u201cBecause Cruz and Trump are going to get killed in the fall. I mean, they cannot win.\u201dIn a campaign that has continually defied prediction, Mr. Kasich\u2019s supporters believe that it is worth the risk of embarrassment to see the race into the convention in Cleveland starting on July 18. They believe none of the candidates will enter with the necessary 1,237 delegates needed to clinch the nomination.A lack of success in the primary season will matter less to the delegates than who can win a general election, Mr. Kasich\u2019s advisers argue.\u201cWhen the Super Bowl goes into overtime, does it matter what happened in the first quarter?\u201d asked John Weaver, Mr. Kasich\u2019s chief strategist.The theory, say Kasich backers, is that the governor could be a compromise pick, somebody who is not as polarizing as the two leading candidates but is also not a \u201cwhite knight\u201d foisted upon the party by elites.\u201cHe\u2019d be something between Trump and Cruz who divide the party and have real electability problems, and an outside candidate who has not run for the nomination and is going to be perceived as illegitimate by delegates,\u201d said Vin Weber, a former Minnesota congressman who is assisting Mr. Kasich\u2019s convention effort.But other Republicans not affiliated with any campaign are skeptical that, if the convention goes to multiple ballots and increasingly desperate delegates begin to look for somebody who can unite the party, they would limit their options only to those who ran this year or stayed in the race through the convention.\u201cWhy would you take Miss Ohio when you can take Miss America?\u201d was how Alex Castellanos, a veteran Republican strategist, put it.But even if the delegates do go to Mr. Kasich should Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz fail to amass a majority at the convention, it is uncertain that the governor can even be nominated. Republicans instituted a rule at their 2012 convention stating that a candidate must win a majority of the delegates in eight states to be placed in nomination, a standard Mr. Kasich is unlikely to reach.\u201cThe only path that exists relies on the front-running candidates faltering and/or the rules being suspended or rewritten,\u201d said Danny Diaz, a Republican strategist who was Jeb Bush\u2019s campaign manager, noting that \u201chope is not a strategy.\u201dIt is possible that the rule makers at this year\u2019s convention lower the eight-state threshold or do away with it. And some of Mr. Kasich\u2019s backers believe that the rule about a candidate\u2019s name being placed in nomination is entirely ceremonial, arguing that state delegations can vote on roll calls for any candidate they choose.But even Mr. Kasich\u2019s most devoted supporters recognize that they are up against tall odds.\u201cI\u2019m not saying we have a nine-out-of-10 chance to pull this off, or even a five-of-10 chance,\u201d Mr. Rath said. \u201cBut it\u2019s at least three, and it may be trending four.\u201dThomas Kaplan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Alibaba Financial Affiliate Raises $4.5 Billion", "Date": "2016-04-26", "News": "Supported byThe Alibaba Group of China has become a colossus in the global Internet world, with a market value of nearly $200 billion.Now its online payment affiliate is aiming for a similarly lofty financial goal: becoming one of the most valuable privately held technology companies in the world.The affiliate, known as the Ant Financial Services Group, said on Tuesday that it had raised $4.5 billion from investors. The private financing round suggests that the company is now valued at about $60 billion \u2014 or more than $10 billion over the market value of PayPal Holdings, its closest analogue.It is also one of the most prominent symbols of strength in China\u2019s private sector, particularly in the field of online payments. Slow-moving state-run banks and an initial absence of regulation have allowed privately run companies to weave themselves into everyday life.Ant Financial now encompasses not only online payments, but also low-risk money market funds and a wallet app that enables easy payment from smartphones around China.Chinese consumers use Alipay to shop online, transfer money to one another, hail taxis, buy movie tickets and even invest their spare change. A money-market fund affiliated with Ant Financial was once one of the world\u2019s largest. According to the announcement on Tuesday, Alipay has more than 450 million users, or more than double the number PayPal has.Such is the power of the company that its latest financing was led by some of China\u2019s biggest state-controlled banks, including arms of the China Construction Bank and China Life Insurance. That indicates the level of government support that the company enjoys in a country where much of the economy is still state-directed.Ant Financial\u2019s previous fund-raising round, which was held last year, included China\u2019s national social security fund and an arm of the China Development Bank.In its statement on Tuesday, Ant Financial said it would use the money it had raised to support its global expansion and would also continue its work to connect people in rural China with its payment, loan and banking services.Ant Financial and Alipay face intense competition from Tencent Holdings, a Chinese rival that owns the WeChat mobile messaging system. Tencent has integrated e-commerce and financial services into recent versions of WeChat, encouraging use by a wide range of businesses, including department stores, municipal water and electricity departments, neighborhood bicycle repair shops and noodle stands.As a result, investors did not get a share of that business in 2014, when Alibaba listed its stock publicly in the United States. At the time, many pointed to Ant Financial as being in charge of some of the more innovative ideas that Alibaba had recently developed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Municipal Bond Defaults Shake Up a Once-Sedate Market", "Date": "2016-04-22", "News": "Supported byWealth MattersStill, money has continued to flow into municipal bonds, a market dominated by individual investors. There have been 27 straight weeks of inflows into municipal bond funds, according to Dan Heckman, senior fixed income strategist with U.S. Bank wealth management.The main reason for municipal bonds\u2019 continued strength is that the interest paid on municipal bonds is free of federal and state taxes, which can exceed 50 percent for top earners in states like New York and California. Those savings give the bonds a substantial advantage over Treasury bonds with similar yields and even higher-yielding corporate bonds.Still, selecting municipal bonds is not as simple as it was before the spate of defaults changed what was generally a stodgy asset class.\u201cThe municipal bond market has transformed from what used to be a rates market like Treasuries to a true credit market like the corporate world,\u201d said John Bonnell, a portfolio manager at USAA.\u201cIt used to be a given that if the issuers had the ability to pay their debt, they would,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s their willingness to pay that\u2019s become more of a focus. Some of these issuers end up with budget situations where they have to pick and choose who\u2019s going to get paid what.\u201dBefore the financial crisis of 2008 and several high-profile defaults, municipal bond investors relied more on the rating of the bonds, something that an issuer could improve by buying insurance on them.\u201cWhat mattered was underlying credit quality and the issuer, but it got obscured for a long time by municipal bond insurance,\u201d said John Bussel, chief investment officer of Hewins Financial Advisors, which manages $4 billion for wealthy investors.\u201cShakier issuers would buy municipal bond insurance to get them a AAA rating,\u201d Mr. Bussel said. \u201cWhen people were buying muni bonds from a broker, he would say they\u2019re AAA insured.\u201dWhen the crisis came, the solvency of municipal bond insurers was tested, since they had also branched out into insuring the bonds created out of mortgages. While about 55 percent of municipal bonds had insurance in 2008, that number is around 6 percent today. And the number of insurers has dwindled to three from seven.Mr. Bonnell at USAA said he would rather have no bond insurance, \u201cbecause we\u2019re doing the work,\u201d adding, \u201cI\u2019d prefer the issuers didn\u2019t pay for the insurance and I\u2019d have the extra yield.\u201dAt the moment, shorter-duration municipal bonds are more in favor than longer-duration bonds, even when they pay a quarter of what the longer ones do, because interest rates are expected to rise and the shorter term all but guarantees investors will be paid back.\u201cSix months to one-year munis have become a bigger part of the market,\u201d said Kimberly Foss, founder of Empyrion Wealth Management. \u201cToday, it\u2019s about high-quality municipalities that will be able to pay the duration of the bond and give people the income they need. What\u2019s left in their pocket after taxes is the most important thing for them.\u201dWith longer-duration municipal bonds, the concern is that an increase in interest rates will erode the value of the investment.\u201cThe biggest risk is with long bonds,\u201d said Todd M. Morgan, chairman of Bel Air Investment Advisors, which manages $3 billion in municipal bonds. \u201cInterest rates are unpredictable. They go up 100 basis points,\u201d or 1 percentage point, \u201cand you could lose 20 to 30 percent of your investment.\u201dAs to determining which municipalities will not be able to make their payments for longer-dated bonds, investors can look to the recent past for a lesson \u2014 few of the problems cropped up overnight.\u201cYou may get into fiscal difficulties like a Detroit or a Puerto Rico, but those things had a long tail and were running out,\u201d Mr. Heckman of U.S. Bank said. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have come as any surprise that Detroit ran into financial problems.\u201dMr. Bonnell said that investors also needed to bear in mind political changes in the municipalities themselves.\u201cWhen it comes to the willingness to pay part, the officials you bought that bond from might be totally different 10 years from now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to predict with a 30-year bond.\u201dHe added, \u201cIf it looks like things are deteriorating and they\u2019re going to have to prioritize, hopefully if you\u2019ve done your work correctly, you\u2019ll be out of it by then.\u201dThe long time horizon shows the value of having someone watch the municipalities, which is something that bond managers do but is also a role played by municipal bond insurers for individual investors.Natalie R. Cohen, the head of municipal research at Wells Fargo, said that even though the remaining insurers are writing policies on a small number of new bonds, they play a role in negotiations for existing issues \u201cwith high-powered legal help in distressed situations, such as Detroit, helping to battle for bondholder recoveries.\u201dBill Fallon, chief executive of National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation, a municipal bond insurer, said his firm was doing just that on general obligation bonds from Detroit. He said the holders of the city\u2019s bonds continued to receive interest and principal payments.While these insurers still have a marketing problem from the financial crisis, Mr. Fallon said that their coverage continued to be needed by smaller municipalities or those that do not regularly sell municipal bonds.\u201cIf a large A-rated municipality is issuing $300 million, institutional buyers will know the issuer and put the resources toward it,\u201d Mr. Fallon said. \u201cPut that against an Iowa school issuance and it\u2019s for $17 million, it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll have a large institutional manager putting the staff behind it.\u201dBrenda Wenning, who manages $22 million in fixed income for 30 clients, said that if her clients bought municipal bonds with insurance, it was generally for longer-dated bonds and for municipalities where they lacked the time or knowledge to do the analysis.\u201cBuying insured bonds removes having to understand each bond\u2019s creditworthiness and allows the client to sleep at night,\u201d she said.For people buying municipal bonds on the secondary market, the more general risk comes from the lack of transparency on what the dealers paid for a bond and what they are selling it for.\u201cMost of the transactions in the secondary market are conducted through a broker or a discount broker, and the individual investor doesn\u2019t have the horsepower or tools for price discovery,\u201d Mr. Heckman said.But in the end, what matters now is understanding the bond issuers more deeply. \u201cCredit analysis is important,\u201d said Mr. Bussel at Hewins Financial Advisors, \u201cand it\u2019s hard to do credit analysis on muni bonds.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incompletely to the business of Bel Air Investment Advisors. It manages $3 billion in municipal bonds, not $3 billion over all.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Valeant Is a Reminder of the Peril of Outsize Executive Pay", "Date": "2016-04-04", "News": "Supported byCompensationThe firm\u2019s strategy of hugely increasing the price of certain drugs eventually met stiff resistance from Congress. Its stock has fallen about 90 percent since August, as investors began to learn of accounting problems. The plunge in the stock also means Valeant cannot easily acquire other drug makers \u2014 a main source of growth.There\u2019s another reason: the compensation of Valeant\u2019s chief executive, J. Michael Pearson, and its senior executives, which most likely played an important role in driving the company\u2019s behavior. Through shares and options acquired mostly from his compensation plans, Mr. Pearson owned nearly 3 percent of Valeant, a stake that was worth over $2.5 billion when the company\u2019s stock was trading at its highs.The sheer size of Mr. Pearson\u2019s holdings gives the impression that his package was uniquely aggressive. But in many ways it wasn\u2019t.As with any other public company, the details of Mr. Pearson\u2019s pay can be found in proxy statements issued each year, which lay out the intricate methods that company boards have devised for tying pay to performance.These statements show that Mr. Pearson earned the most in long-term awards. The metric that determined these awards was something called total shareholder return, basically the performance of a company\u2019s stock price, with any income from dividends added in.Paying a chief executive largely or solely on the basis of stock price performance might seem reckless. It would seem to create incentives for the executive to focus on actions that get impressive results for a year or two, rather than longer-term actions that might yield higher and more sustainable profits.But placing a heavy emphasis on the share price is a surprisingly common practice \u2014 and is supported by influential groups that advise shareholders on how to vote at annual meetings.Mr. Pearson\u2019s long-term plan also had a feature that gave him a lot more shares as total shareholder return hit certain levels. His 2011 compensation agreement, providing a big payday for him, said that he would get zero \u201cperformance\u201d shares if Valeant\u2019s stock price did not go up by at least 15 percent a year over the following three years.Once he hit that threshold, he would get 120,000 shares. As the stock price hit other marks, he got more shares. The award topped out at a 60 percent-plus return, which would win him 480,000 shares.Ratcheting up pay like that is not uncommon. In 2014, 54 percent of companies surveyed by the Conference Board had maximum payouts that were 200 percent of the base award. Almost none exceeded 250 percent, so Mr. Pearson\u2019s 300 percent reward was unusual.Mr. Pearson got something else in the long-term plan set in 2011 that appears to have made it particularly bountiful. The agreement included an outright grant of 500,000 stock options. An analysis by Kevin J. Murphy, a finance and economics professor at the University of Southern California, found that, under a certain range of stock prices, the options grant was significantly more generous than the performance share plan.The outright size of the options grant, and the price at which it started to pay off, is what made it more lucrative than the stock awards for the range of stock prices. (The stock awards became more valuable as the share price went up beyond this range, according to the analysis.)Few companies are like Valeant, pursuing the sort of growth-at-all-costs strategy that appeared to fell the firm. Still, there are plenty of signs that the drive for higher executive compensation propels a lot of the short-term thinking in American corporations. Companies that have raised many billions of dollars in the junk bond market in recent years have spent startlingly little of it on new plants and operations \u2014 things that prime future growth and provide more jobs. It went instead to paying back more expensive debts, and to financing acquisitions and private equity deals.Companies are currently spending about $450 billion a year buying back shares. This helps chief executives increase the company\u2019s earnings per share, a measure of profits that shareholders focus on obsessively. Conveniently, it is often a measure used to help set executive pay.The impact of buybacks on earnings per share is not small; Deutsche Bank calculates that in recent years about a quarter of per-share earnings growth has come from using buybacks to reduce the amount of shares outstanding.But Valeant also raises the issues of skewed incentives and inequality. Mr. Pearson did put some of his own money into Valeant, a requirement that was supposed to make him more accountable. But those sums were tiny in comparison with what the company paid him.And Mr. Pearson\u2019s pay is a stark reminder of how executive pay has helped widen wage differences. Analysts from the A.F.L.-C.I.O., a federation of unions, estimated that chief executive pay was 331 times as much as that of ordinary workers in 2013, up from 46 times in the 1980s. In his best-selling book on inequality, \u201cCapital in the Twenty-First Century,\u201d Thomas Piketty placed much blame for rising income differences on the lucrative pay packages given to senior executives year after year.Imposing significantly higher taxes on the highest earners is the other way to get at the problem, since companies might not pay as much if they knew that, say, 70 percent of the compensation was going to the government. But Congress shows zero appetite for taxing at that level.Shareholders support all the elaborate efforts that aim to bring accountability to compensation. Supporters of such measures as pay for performance might even contend that Mr. Pearson got his comeuppance, since his wealth is now a fraction of what it was, after the plunge in Valeant\u2019s shares. But even at these bombed-out levels, his effective holdings appear to be worth more than $200 million.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ant Financial\u2019s Different Breed of Unicorn", "Date": "2016-04-26", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsThe $60 billion implied valuation of the Chinese financial technology group Ant Financial sounds like a case of disruption on steroids.That price tag, implied by a funding round the company disclosed Tuesday, easily tops the $48 billion market capitalization of the United States payments giant PayPal. But look under a metaphorical microscope, and it\u2019s clear that these are different species. The pumped-up Ant Financial rests on uniquely Chinese characteristics.Ant Financial is best known as the financial affiliate of the e-commerce giant Alibaba and the owner of China\u2019s dominant online payment engine, Alipay. A planned initial public offering of stock would therefore be a good way for investors to get their tentacles into a rapidly growing, and slowly liberalizing, market for consumer finance in China. Its $4.5 billion funding round suggests Ant Financial is already following a similar route as its former parent Alibaba, whose valuation rose as it edged toward an I.P.O. in 2014.Though the injection of funds into Ant Financial doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the whole is really worth $60 billion, it\u2019s possible to rationalize that kind of valuation. PayPal has fewer than half the users of Alipay, and it processed $282 billion of transactions in 2015. By 2018, Credit Suisse reckons, Ant Financial will be handling $1.7 trillion.Then again, there are no public numbers to help understand exactly how Alipay makes money, or whether the rest of Ant Financial is a solid finance business or a collection of potentially bad Chinese loans.One thing is clear, though. The group\u2019s fortunes look to be tied more closely to the vagaries of Chinese state capitalism than to private-sector disruption. The backers in Ant Financial\u2019s latest funding round are Chinese state-backed vehicles, not Silicon Valley capitalists. Both Ant Financial and Alibaba exist because Beijing lets them.Ultimately, Ant Financial\u2019s returns and value will depend on many things that outsiders cannot yet see, like how its relationships with Alibaba and the government pan out. This ant is destined for bigger things, but it would be unwise to confuse it with the standard variety tech-industry unicorn.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Renewable Energy Stumbles Toward the Future", "Date": "2016-04-22", "News": "Supported byIt was just last summer that SunEdison was a Wall Street darling, the very air around the fast-growing company seeming to shimmer with potential.There is a timeless element to SunEdison\u2019s swift demise: an executive with an Icarus complex chasing a fast-growing market embarks on an aggressive strategy fueled by cheap debt. Soar. Crash. Burn. Repeat.Yet the collapse raises a bigger question: Can renewable-energy companies be profitable? Can green make green?The answer, of course, is yes. Just as soon as they cross over a fundamental hurdle: finding a strategy that actually works.\u201cWe haven\u2019t totally figured out exactly what the business models are going to look like, for who wins and who loses,\u201d said Jason Bordoff, director of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University.Significantly, though, the sudden decline in oil prices isn\u2019t largely to blame. The difficulties run much deeper, echoing industrial collapses of earlier eras \u2014 the telecom-industry boom and bust of the 1990s and early 2000s, and disruptive cycles before that.On the surface, the various green-energy companies all seem to be pursuing different strategies. But there is a unifying problem they have yet to overcome: Finding enough customers to support the costly infrastructure they must first build.SunEdison is far from being the only troubled green-energy business.What\u2019s remarkable is that these leading energy companies are struggling at a time when regulatory, public and investor support for the renewable-energy industry has arguably never been greater.Moreover, investors around the world sank hundreds of billions of dollars into clean-energy technologies last year even as the prices of competing fossil fuels \u2014 oil and natural gas \u2014 tumbled.Though development in renewable energy climbed in the last 15 years, the industry is still widely considered to be in its early stages. Nonetheless, there has been a race among companies to develop, commercialize and eventually prosper from what many see as one of the largest tectonic economic shifts in decades.And in the United States, the federal government recently approved a major new transmission line to move wind-generated electricity east from the Great Plains.But all good bubbles burst. What is happening in renewable energy now has similarities to the telecommunications bubble of the 1990s. Led by hard-charging executives seeking big paydays, giants like WorldCom, Global Crossing and Adelphia started far-reaching acquisition and capital-expenditure programs \u2014 burning through billions of dollars \u2014 to buy cable companies or bury long-haul fiber-optic cable under land and sea. They were all chasing expected high demand and soaring revenues from the dawn of the Internet.But the infrastructure they created lived on. Last weekend, when you binge-watched the fourth season of \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d or streamed your own cooking show on Facebook Live, chances are better than not that your data zoomed through at least some of those networks.In that case, it turned out that if you build it, they will indeed come. But as many renewable energy companies are learning, building it costs dearly.Even before SunEdison, the landscape of green energy companies was littered with failed strategies.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.Part of the conundrum for these companies is that the most effective way to cut costs has been to grow, to take advantage of economies of scale, certain forms of financing and generous subsidies that were set to expire.But with all that growth has come debt, and an inability to show a profit, even if the companies are creating value.\u201cClearly in a market that has had a lot of growth, you are going to have some companies \u2014 and in this case many companies \u2014 that try to do too much, too fast,\u201d said Shawn Kravetz, founder of Esplanade Capital, which invests in solar power. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to see a shakeout.\u201dBut it is especially the case at SunEdison, where its chief executive, Ahmad R. Chatila, set about expanding, seemingly in all directions at once.\u201dThis is going to be a big industry globally, but we\u2019re stumbling and bumbling to get there,\u201d said Erik Gordon, a clinical assistant professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan. \u201cIf they weren\u2019t trying to beat each other to the next rooftop they wouldn\u2019t be needing to do this financial engineering.\u201dStill, industry analysts and executives say that despite the fall of SunEdison, the future for renewable energy is bright.Indeed, there are a few stalwarts in the renewable-energy race.Take First Solar. The company, which supplies solar panels and develops solar farms, has had its share of troubles. It has been the target of shareholder lawsuits claiming it hid big problems and misrepresented its prospects. Its stock, at $62 a share, is a far cry from its bubble-peak of $311 in the spring of 2008.But by adopting a slower-growth strategy and reducing debt, First Solar is a rarity in the green-energy industry. It is profitable. Last year, the company made $546 million on $3.6 billion in revenue.For now, First Solar may be an anomaly, particularly amid uncertainty around the presidential election and the policy stances of candidates like Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump on renewable energy sources.

She wondered if the money could be used for something else.\u201cWhy do we want to do a mural?\u201d Ms. Lamb said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we talk about doors and windows and fixing up the insides of apartments?\u201dBut now Ms. Lamb has come to see the value of creating public art in a poor neighborhood where graffiti is more the norm, and gang rivalries and street violence can overshadow community life. Since February, a group of Castle Hill youths has been meeting two nights a week, to transform a room at a community center into a testament to their shared experiences and goals. Their vividly hued mural includes renderings of two hands clenched together in unity, one child helping another, and a basketball player flying through the air with a ball.\u201cEverybody has dreams,\u201d Mousa Conteh, 16, said as he dabbed at the mural with a paintbrush. \u201cThis is going to most likely inspire them to keep doing what they\u2019re doing.\u201dThe other four developments participating in the program are the St. Nicholas Houses in Harlem, the Tompkins Houses in Brooklyn, the Queensbridge Houses in Queens and the Stapleton Houses on Staten Island. Groundswell hopes to expand the program to other housing developments after the pilot program is finished at the end of the summer.Rob Krulak, the interim executive director of Groundswell, said his organization aimed to give residents \u201ca platform for using visual art to explore vital issues facing their communities.\u201dAt the Castle Hill Houses, where more than 5,100 people live in 14 buildings, residents suggested a theme of community and unity.\u201cFor me, the most powerful aspect of this project has been seeing the excitement among everyone who has played a part in the mural as they put their personal stamp on the anonymous space of the community center,\u201d Mr. Krulak said of the Castle Hill effort. \u201cThis mural is an act of telling the world and each other about the importance of the people and activities that populate the center.\u201dFor the first mural, the Castle Hill youths met on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. in February and March, working until it was completed. The second and third murals will be outside, on the exterior of a boiler room, and on a wall leading to a day care center.In return for participating in the program, the youths get pizza or snacks at each program meeting, and receive a stipend of $150 for working on the first mural, an additional $150 for the second. For the third mural, which will be painted over the summer, Groundswell will employ them through its summer jobs program and pay an hourly wage.Of the 13 people who signed up for the first mural, seven showed. One later dropped out. Four more joined, bringing the group to 10.Eric Miles, a teaching artist for Groundswell, said that as part of the process of creating the first mural, the participants played icebreaking games to get to know one another better and studied examples of public art as well as the history of the Housing Authority.Mr. Miles taught them about symbols and composition and the mechanics of a cohesive design. The first mural was created in stages, with the youths sketching out ideas on paper in individual and group exercises. Then their ideas were brought to life with paint.Ms. Lamb, 72, stopped by every week to check on their progress. She liked what she saw, and even made a few suggestions. She told them that a vine, which had previously run through three-quarters of the mural, should be extended to the final section as a symbol of unity. It was.Ms. Lamb, who moved into the development in 1969 and raised her four children there, said she hoped the murals would bring together younger residents who are sometimes divided by gang rivalries, and show them the difference between art and graffiti. In the past, she said, graffiti had been a problem, defacing stairwells, hallways and playground equipment.On a recent night, Ms. Lamb sat and watched the youths paint. Several of them had tied plastic bags around their sneakers to protect them from paint splatters. As one boy came in late, she told him, \u201cTake your coat off and get busy.\u201dOne participant, Brenda Rodriguez, 20, a customer service representative for an insurance company, said she liked to draw and paint, but had not had much time or opportunity to do so until now. \u201cI thought it was cool because we don\u2019t usually have that many art programs,\u201d she said.Adrian Frometa, 16, the third of four children of a single mother, said he signed up for the mural as a way to help the community. He has gotten to know some of the other teenagers painting alongside him, whom he had seen around but had never spoken to before. \u201cIt\u2019s showing we\u2019re coming together as one unit to do this project,\u201d Adrian said.He added that when he first told his other friends about how he was spending his nights, some of them said that he should play basketball with them instead. No more.\u201cBefore they\u2019re like, \u2018You\u2019re wasting your time,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut now when they see it, they\u2019re like, \u2018I should have joined.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A (Mostly Men\u2019s) Club for Cigar Aficionados on Long Island", "Date": "2016-04-22", "News": "Supported byDining | Long IslandCigar smokers don\u2019t get much respect. In movies and television, there is no prop so directly associated with villainy as the cigar. From Gordon Gekko to Tony Montana to Yosemite Sam, whenever a character fires up a stogie, you can be pretty sure you\u2019ve found your bad guy.There is also the smoking-ban movement, which achieved a law in New York State in 2003 that covers all enclosed workplaces, including bars and restaurants. Then, in 2011, a New York City ordinance banned smoking at public parks, boardwalks, beaches and pedestrian plazas.Even at home, men and their cigars are often shooed out the door to the patio, or sometimes beyond. I know one cigar smoker who is obligated to keep a distance of 20 feet from his house.Long Island cigar aficionados have a refuge from this ignominy: Matador Cigars. Matador, which started in 2008 with a store in Roslyn Heights, has expanded to a mini-empire with additional locations in Massapequa Park and, more recently, Hauppauge. The reason for its success? In addition to having a comprehensive cigar selection, it is also the most comfortable place to legally smoke on Long Island.The Matador chain is owned and run by Boris Grossman, a cigar enthusiast who acquired his taste for tobacco while working on Wall Street. When the financial crisis hit in 2008, Mr. Grossman believed that he\u2019d had enough of finance and decided to open a cigar shop. Initially he looked for space in Manhattan; he recalls riding around the city on a bicycle just after the crash looking at shuttered businesses. But when he inquired, everything was still too expensive. Shortly thereafter, he found the space in Roslyn Heights.Each of the Matador shops, which are open from morning through evening, has an elaborate exhaust and circulation system, so the plumes of smoke are quickly expelled, with fresh air constantly pumped in.The layouts of the three stores follow a similar formula: In the center is a large walk-in humidor with over 1,500 cigars. It is anchored on either side by two comfortable smoking lounges. These lounges include rows of handsome leather club chairs, ottomans and ornate standing ashtrays. No matter where you are sitting, you will be facing at least one of the many flat-screen televisions that line the wall, so no sporting event need be missed. There is no liquor license, but a server can help customers cut and light their cigars, and keep the ashtrays fresh. Need to use the restroom? In this temple of tobacco, even the toilets have ashtrays.With optional yearly memberships that include a personalized humidity-controlled cigar locker, Matador can give the impression of a private men\u2019s club; female guests are rare. In other respects, the environment is highly democratic: Guests do not need to be members to enjoy the lounges (the purchase of a single cigar will do), and the diverse crowd is a mix of both white- and blue-collar. The televisions tends to favor professional hockey and Megyn Kelly.Male-centric as it is, the energy at the Matador shops is also polite and comradely \u2014 there seems to be none of the posturing sometimes found with men at a bar or a live-sporting event. And despite all the screens, conversation abounds, the subjects including sports, politics and a healthy dose of gossip. \u201cLike women at a nail salon\u201d is how Mr. Grossman characterizes it. It all amounts to a kind of impromptu social experiment, the results of which you don\u2019t need a sociology degree to interpret: Remove alcohol and jockeying for women\u2019s attention, and men actually get along well.What should you smoke at Matador? Prices range from about $7 (the Padron 2000, a full-bodied robusto from Nicaragua, is a good bargain at approximately $8) to $50 a stick for the Zino Platinum series, a refined, medium-bodied brand from the Dominican Republic. Mr. Grossman\u2019s personal favorites include the complex, medium- to full-bodied Don Carlos 30th Anniversary, which costs around $35.Though his days on Wall Street are behind him, it is clear that Mr. Grossman hasn\u2019t lost his entrepreneurial spirit. Asked if he would consider opening yet another Matador shop, he replied without hesitation: \u201cSure. In fact I\u2019d like to see it franchised.\u201d He added, \u201cI could see the stores spreading all around the Northeast, you know?\u201dAdvertisement"}

It was very unproductive, and we let our tempers get the better of us before we finally walked away to cool off.With the benefit of some time and space, however, we figured out that it wasn\u2019t so much that she was wrong. And it wasn\u2019t so much that I was wrong. What we argued about boiled down to a matter of personal preference.Truth is a pretty rare thing in personal finance. More often than not, what we call truth is simply a state of mind or an opinion. Even when the math points at what seems to obvious truth, feelings can get in the way.For instance, take the common advice from some investment professionals to borrow as much as you can for your house at the lowest possible interest rate for the longest length of time. Then, take every extra dollar you have and invest it in the stock market instead of paying down your mortgage.The sales pitch goes like this. The overall stock market earns roughly 10 percent annually over long periods if you reinvest the dividends and don\u2019t trade. Let\u2019s say your mortgage only costs you around 4 percent. As long as you stick with your investment plan for the 30-year term of your mortgage, you\u2019ll end up with more money in your pocket than if you just paid off your home as quickly as possible.If that\u2019s true though, why have I been to way more mortgage-burning parties than portfolio celebrations? For many people, the cognitive comfort of having the home paid off as soon as possible is worth it \u2014 even if the spreadsheet says otherwise. There is security in being free of their largest debt, and that good feeling has real value.And before you jump on the rationalist bandwagon and criticize emotion-driven, illogical behavior, ask yourself a simple question: What is money for? In the end, isn\u2019t the point of money to make us feel more comfortable, more secure, more at ease and happier? If so, it may not make a lot of sense for us to try to talk our friends (or ourselves) out of mathematically incorrect behavior.We tend to forget that money is about feelings, and feelings don\u2019t always fit neatly into the \u201ctruth.\u201d So the next time you find yourself in a heated debate about money, feeling like a crusader for truth, put the sword down and remind yourself that what you\u2019re debating is probably not a matter of right or wrong, but one of personal preference.Take a step back, breathe and try again. But this time, leave the truth out of it.Advertisement"}

Mr. Romney proposed that the candidate in the best position to beat Mr. Trump in each state should run unimpeded by other contenders.After losing in New York, Senator Ted Cruz and Gov. John Kasich seemed ready to embrace this idea. Late Sunday they announced that Mr. Cruz would run hard in Indiana\u2019s May 3 primary, and Mr. Kasich, though he was favored in suburbs surrounding Indianapolis, would stand down in that state. Mr. Kasich, in turn, would focus on beating Mr. Trump in New Mexico and Oregon, unimpeded by Mr. Cruz. But within hours, they backed away, as Mr. Cruz\u2019s campaign quietly told supporters not to engage in \u201ctactical voting,\u201d and Mr. Kasich said that although he wouldn\u2019t hold rallies, he\u2019d still attend a fund-raiser and meetings with Republican leaders in Indiana.So it goes as Republicans contend with the prospect of Mr. Trump, with his hater\u2019s agenda, becoming the party\u2019s standard-bearer. Some of the party leaders are far from uncomfortable with that idea. In fact, a growing swath of the party leadership now seems determined to embrace Mr. Trump.

The Democratic Party has also been caught by surprise by the anger of middle-class voters it thought it could rely on, even while failing to move meaningful legislation on college affordability, gun control, the minimum wage and better care for veterans. The Democratic leadership is also too often captive to its own elites. Though they practically invented the ideal of campaign finance reform, Democratic politicians, including Hillary Clinton, now at times seem tone-deaf to public anger while they take vast amounts of money from industries with business before the federal government. The Democratic Party has long considered itself the institutional champion of the poor, unemployed and indebted.

{"Headline": "When an Olympian Goes to College, Riches Stay Out of Reach ", "Date": "2016-04-16", "News": "Supported byOn SwimmingMESA, ARIZ. \u2014 In the third grade, a music teacher inspired Katie Ledecky to take piano lessons. She showed an innate talent for the chords, picking them up quickly. Her formal lessons were phased out in the eighth grade as her swimming took off. Roughly five years later, no one is questioning Ledecky\u2019s harmony with the water. She has developed into the best female distance freestyler in history and a legitimate quadruple Olympic gold medal threat this summer in Rio de Janeiro.As a swimmer, Ledecky faces financial restrictions that would not have existed had she stuck with the piano. In the fall, she will enroll at Stanford on a swimming scholarship after deferring her entrance a year to train for the Summer Games. The arrangement she agreed to when she signed a letter of intent to swim for the Cardinal in exchange for tuition, books and housing precludes her from a potential seven-figure financial payoff through endorsements and paid appearances.\u201cI always knew I wanted to swim in college,\u201d said Ledecky, who won the 200 and 400 freestyles in the first two days of this weekend\u2019s Arena Pro Swim Series event at Skyline Aquatic Center. \u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to the opportunity.\u201dBut why does accepting endorsement money and racing in college have to be an either-or proposition? The rules of amateurism that severely curb the earning potential of college student-athletes do not apply to college student musicians. If Ledecky had applied herself to the piano instead of swimming and earned a music scholarship to Arizona State, she would have been free to test her value in the open market while working toward her degree.David Hickman, a trumpet virtuoso and professor at Arizona State, said his students were generally permitted to perform off campus \u201cfor as much money as they can make.\u201d In some instances, the person offering employment has ties to the university, an arrangement, he said, that is viewed as widely acceptable. In an email exchange, Hickman said that some of his graduate students earned as much as $20,000 a year performing freelance engagements, or with area orchestras and chamber ensembles, or both. The exception, he added, is foreign-born students who do not have green cards.If artists aren\u2019t expected to starve for their craft, why are the highest-profile athletes?\u201cI haven\u2019t really thought about it,\u201d Ledecky said, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t think anything\u2019s really going to change.\u201dThe N.C.A.A. is facing a class-action suit, brought by the former U.C.L.A. basketball player Ed O\u2019Bannon, over the commercial exploitation of college athletes. It could have ripple effects that reshape the college landscape \u2014 and not just for the athletes in the revenue-producing sports. The core question is whether the N.C.A.A.\u2019s amateurism rules, which currently restrict compensation for college athletes to a scholarship and a few thousand dollars to cover the full cost of attendance, are a necessary component of college sports to help ensure competitive balance, or are unreasonable and, perhaps, illegally restrictive.\u201cIf Katie Ledecky goes to Stanford and she has a deal with a suit company, does that take away from what she\u2019s doing there, does that give her an unfair advantage?\u201d said Bob Bowman, the A.S.U. men\u2019s and women\u2019s swimming coach. \u201cI don\u2019t know that that changes anything except for her bank account.\u201dBowman watched the 22-time Olympic medalist Michael Phelps, whom he has coached since he was 11, forgo college swimming to turn pro as a teenager. Imagine, he said, the exposure swimming would have received on the N.C.A.A. level if Phelps had not been forced to choose between making money and making college memories in the pool. More than a decade later, Bowman can\u2019t come up with a compelling argument for why Ledecky should have to make the same choice.\u201cI think that there\u2019s too much money being made off the athletes\u2019 skills, likenesses, whatever they\u2019re doing,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cWhether they\u2019re in revenue or nonrevenue sports, they\u2019re certainly bringing in some kind of positive impact for the university. It has to be dealt with somehow.\u201dThe five-time Olympic medalist Missy Franklin, another competitor in the Pro Swim Series event, competed in college, at California, as a freshman and a sophomore before turning pro last year.The Golden Bears don\u2019t charge attendance at their meets, so Franklin\u2019s presence didn\u2019t help improve the swim team\u2019s fortunes directly. But she did attend fund-raising events for a donor-financed on-campus aquatics facility that is in the works, including one appearance that kept her from attending an Association of National Olympic Committees gala in Thailand in which she was to be honored for her performance at the 2012 London Games.Franklin, 20, has also been featured in mailings sent to prospective student-athletes in sports other than swimming. On one envelope sent to California sports camp participants was the teaser \u201cWhy did five-time Olympic medalist Missy Franklin choose Cal?\u201dFranklin, who stepped away from her classes at Cal to begin her pro career and prepare for the United States Olympic trials at the end of June, said she was not sure she would have been able to juggle school, sponsors and collegiate swimming, even if all had been in play.The sponsorship aspect, she said, \u201cis a little bit more tiring than I was expecting it to be.\u201d\u201cIt sounds kind of silly when you talk about it, but photo shoots and commercials \u2014 those days are actually really, really taxing, more mentally than anything,\u201d she said.In a joking aside, her father, Dick, recently asked Franklin to imagine carving out time in her schedule to study for finals.\u201cI wanted to cry,\u201d Franklin said, laughing. \u201cI definitely could not have handled all that.\u201dThe day is dawning when the best student-athletes \u2014 even those in the Olympic sports that don\u2019t make money for the athletic departments \u2014 will be able to decide how thin they want to spread themselves instead of operating within the narrow confines established by the N.C.A.A.David Grenardo, an assistant professor of law at St. Mary\u2019s University in San Antonio and a former football player at Rice, argues that the N.C.A.A. cannot continue to deny athletes the same free-market rights that allow a music major to make money playing music, a business major to make millions creating a tech company, or a coach to make a small fortune endorsing the apparel that his athletes wear free.\u201cLedecky should not lose the opportunity to compete in college athletics simply because her unique skills, abilities and world-renowned physical feats merit compensation through endorsements,\u201d Grenardo said in an email.Grenardo noted that the athletes\u2019 shelf life as product endorsers could be shorter than an Olympic cycle.Therefore, he said, \u201cthey should be allowed to take advantage of that opportunity to endorse products like everyone else can, including coaches and college-sports analysts.\u201dWhat\u2019s the worst that can happen?\u201cEven if all the swimmers received endorsements,\u201d Grenardo said, \u201cthen it still would not change the product in the pool, except maybe to create more excitement and buzz around the sport.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "AbbVie to Buy Cancer Treatment Start-Up", "Date": "2016-04-28", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In Silicon Valley, being a unicorn is no guarantee of financial success. But an eight-year-old drug maker focused on novel cancer treatments has landed itself and its investors a windfall by selling itself to a bigger competitor.AbbVie said on Thursday that it would buy Stemcentrx for $5.8 billion in cash and stock. That\u2019s up about 16 percent from the $5 billion valuation that the start-up fetched during its last fund-raising round. It also appears to be one of the highest prices ever paid for a privately held biotechnology company, if not the highest.Under the terms of the deal, AbbVie will pay about $2 billion in cash and finance the remaining amount with newly issued shares. Stemcentrx\u2019s backers could receive up to $4 billion in additional cash if the business hits certain performance milestones.Such is the size of the payoff that one of Stemcentrx\u2019s staunchest investors, the venture capital firm Founders Fund, appears able to return its entire $625 million fourth fund and more than half of its $1 billion fifth fund.Another big winner is Artis Ventures, which invested early in Stemcentrx, in 2011, when it had a valuation of only about $100 million. Artis is known more for investing in YouTube than in life sciences.Behind AbbVie\u2019s willingness to pay up is the drug maker\u2019s big push into cancer treatment, in part because it is an attractive area of the pharmaceutical business, and because its blockbuster autoimmune disease drug Humira will face competition from cheaper, related versions known as biosimilars in the coming years, though just when will depend on how patent litigation plays out.\u201cAbbVie is committed to continued innovation in oncology, a critical component of our long-term growth and an area of significant need to millions of patients worldwide,\u201d said Richard A. Gonzalez, AbbVie\u2019s chairman and chief executive, in a statement. \u201cWe believe the acquisition of Stemcentrx will strengthen and accelerate our ability to deliver innovative therapies that will have a remarkable impact on patients\u2019 lives.\u201dStemcentrx is developing drugs aimed at killing cancer stem cells, which some scientists believe give rise to cancers. Under this theory, merely killing most cancer cells is not sufficient because if the stem cells survive, they can give rise to the cancer again. So drugs are needed specifically to kill the root stem cells, which are thought to account for only 2 percent of all the cancer cells and might be resistant to conventional chemotherapy.Stemcentrx\u2019s main offering so far is rovalpituzumab tesirine, known as Rova-T, a drug in late-stage testing for treatment of small-cell lung cancer. The disease accounts for about 15 percent of all lung cancers and is very hard to treat, with a poor prognosis.In an early clinical trial, tumors shrank significantly in 44 percent of patients whose tumors made a particular protein that the drug latches onto. However, if the idea is to kill the tiny cadre of stem cells, then merely saying that the drug shrank tumors, presumably by killing the nonstem-cell masses, doesn\u2019t indicate that much.But AbbVie said in slides it provided to investors that \u201ccompelling\u201d data about how long people taking the drug live will be presented at a cancer conference soon. It said Rova-T could reach the market in 2018 and eventually achieve sales of billions of dollars a year, justifying the price AbbVie paid.Stemcentrx has four other drugs in earlier-stage clinical trials, including treatments for breast, ovarian and other types of lung cancers.\u201cWe are thrilled to be joining the AbbVie team and believe that, together, we can bring much-needed therapies to cancer patients,\u201d said Brian Slingerland, Stemcentrx\u2019s founder and chief executive, in a statement. \u201cWe have worked for eight years exploring the origins of cancer and drivers of its recurrence and have discovered novel therapeutic targets to attack the most difficult-to-treat tumors.\u201dBut the theory of cancer stem cells is not universally accepted, and there are no assurances this approach will work. Other companies are developing drugs aimed at killing cancer stem cells and have suffered setbacks in clinical trials. One of them, OncoMed Pharmaceuticals, has a market value of less than $400 million. Another, Verastem, has a market capitalization of around $60 million.The deal for the eight-year-old Stemcentrx, which is based in South San Francisco, represents a windfall for the company\u2019s backers, who have invested close to $500 million. Those investors include Founders Fund, which was co-founded by the billionaire Peter Thiel; Sequoia Capital; Silicon Valley Bank; and the mutual fund giant Fidelity Investments.For Founders Fund, the investment was a validation of the firm\u2019s belief in the start-up despite not being a specialist investor in biotechnology, according to Brian Singerman, the partner who oversaw the investment.Mr. Singerman said that Founders Fund first began investing in Stemcentrx in 2012, intrigued by the novel approach to fighting cancer. As the start-up continued to grow, the venture capitalists continued to double down, eventually investing roughly $300 million in the drug maker.\u201cOnce we see a company performing and exceeding even our lofty expectations, we go big,\u201d he said in an interview.When Stemcentrx unveiled new performance data at an industry conference last year, the company had gained plenty of interest from potential buyers, Mr. Singerman said. At the same time, the start-up was ready to find a partner to begin commercializing its products.Mr. Singerman declined to comment on the firm\u2019s return from the AbbVie transaction.The Stemcentrx deal is expected to dilute AbbVie\u2019s earnings this year by about 20 cents a share, and will begin adding to them in about four years.Advertisement"}

Banks in India and elsewhere are pressing Mr. Mallya to get their money back. Authorities accuse him of money laundering, bribing bank officials, defaulting on loans and other misdeeds.Last weekend Indian authorities canceled Mr. Mallya\u2019s passport, nearly a week after a court in Mumbai issued a warrant for his arrest. On Thursday, India\u2019s Foreign Ministry said it would ask Britain \u2014 where authorities believe he is staying \u2014 to deport him.\u201cWe hide the sickness and ultimately it\u2019s the poor who suffer,\u201d said K. C. Chakrabarty, a former deputy governor of India\u2019s central bank. \u201cWe are addressing Vijay Mallya. He\u2019s not the problem. He\u2019s the symptom of the problem.\u201dMr. Mallya, who left India last month, disputes accusations by Indian lawmakers and lenders that he fled the country to avoid bad debts. \u201cI am an international businessman,\u201d he said on Twitter. \u201cI travel to and from India frequently. I did not flee from India and neither am I an absconder. Rubbish.\u201dCredit Suisse estimated that bad loans in the final months of last year totaled nearly $128 billion, making up more than 11 percent of outstanding loans, and said India\u2019s banking system had still more \u201cunrecognized stress.\u201dThe pain has rippled outside the country. Standard Chartered, a British bank, said in February that its India unit lost nearly $1 billion last year. The bank says it is selling problem loans.Diageo, the British spirits maker, has also been hit, after guaranteeing a $135 million loan last year from Standard Chartered to a company affiliated with Mr. Mallya. Diageo says it is pursuing the matter.The sour loans are raising questions about whether India\u2019s financial system could deal with the sort of debt crisis that hit the United States and Europe in 2008. \u201cWe\u2019re coming so late into the too-big-to-fail issue,\u201d said Susan Thomas, assistant professor at the Indira Gandhi Institute for Development Research in Mumbai and a member of the country\u2019s bankruptcy law reform committee.When the post-2008 lending binge hit, Mr. Mallya saw a chance to help one of his newer businesses: airlines. His Kingfisher Airlines was initially modeled on the low-cost American carrier JetBlue, with an all-economy configuration that included seat-back TVs, unheard of on Indian domestic flights.Mr. Mallya quickly added a lavish business class to Kingfisher. Roomy seats came with champagne glasses filled with cider, since India forbids alcohol on domestic flights. The airline was a pet project of Mr. Mallya\u2019s; he examined the in-flight napkins and interviewed some of the prospective flight attendants himself.But Kingfisher Airlines suffered from an inefficient mix of planes and tough competition, which increased when it started flying internationally. Capitalizing on the looser lending practices, the airline persuaded its lenders to restructure its debt. Two years later, in 2012, Kingfisher stopped flying in the face of high fuel prices and a global slowdown.Kingfisher owed at least $1.4 billion in loans, much of it to state-controlled banks, as well as back pay to former employees and other bills. Because Mr. Mallya and his United Breweries Holdings backed some of the loans, creditors began pressing them for repayment. The dispute began to wind its way through the courts. Banks tried to seize Mr. Mallya\u2019s assets, including his estate in Goa.Late last year authorities raided Mr. Mallya\u2019s homes and offices in Mumbai, Bangalore and Goa. As his lavish lifestyle came under scrutiny, he began to speak less publicly. \u201cOnce a media witch hunt starts it escalates into a raging fire where truth and facts are burnt to ashes,\u201d he said in March on Twitter.By early March, banks had asked India\u2019s highest court to seize Mr. Mallya\u2019s passport. By then he had already left, setting off criticism. \u201cHow did he run away from the country?\u201d asked Rahul Gandhi, vice president of India\u2019s main opposition party, the Congress party. \u201cHow did you allow him to escape?\u201dFinance Minister Arun Jaitley said in Parliament that the country\u2019s banks were seeking to recover \u201cevery penny\u201d from Mr. Mallya.Indian officials have continued to warn about the impact of debt on the economy.\u201cDebt is very much like a dynamite,\u201d said Mr. Rajan, the central banker, in December. \u201cIt is an instrument which is very useful in right places and explosive in others.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Tampon of the Future", "Date": "2016-04-01", "News": "Supported byIS it possible to extract blood from people without causing pain? For decades, this problem has stumped the medical industry. In an effort to replace the old-fashioned needle, companies are trying to deploy laser beams and tiny vacuums to draw blood.In 2014, an engineer at Harvard named Ridhi Tariyal hit on a far simpler workaround. \u201cI was trying to develop a way for women to monitor their own fertility at home,\u201d she told me, and \u201cthose kinds of diagnostic tests require a lot of blood. So I was thinking about women and blood. When you put those words together, it becomes obvious. We have an opportunity every single month to collect blood from women, without needles.\u201dTogether with her business partner, Stephen Gire, she has patented a method for capturing menstrual flow and transforming it into medical samples. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of information in there,\u201d Ms. Tariyal said, \u201cbut right now, it\u2019s all going in the trash.\u201dWhy did Ms. Tariyal see a possibility that had eluded so many engineers before her? You might say she has an unfair advantage: her gender.Because she lives in a female body, she had experiences that just wouldn\u2019t be available to her male colleagues. She doesn\u2019t have to imagine using her device, because she herself has been able to beta-test it.Early on, she and Mr. Gire had thought about putting diagnostic chips inside tampons to give women real-time updates about their health. But Ms. Tariyal quickly realized that the \u201csmart tampon,\u201d outfitted with chips and transmitters, gave her the heebie-jeebies \u2014 it sounded like a torture device from a David Cronenberg film \u2014 and customers would no doubt feel the same way. That\u2019s why she decided that all medical testing must take place outside the body, an insight that shaped the way that she and Mr. Gire designed their product.Eric von Hippel, a scholar of innovation at M.I.T., has spent decades studying what seems like a truism: People who suffer from a problem are uniquely equipped to solve it. \u201cWhat we find is that functionally novel innovations \u2014 those for which a market is not yet defined \u2014 tend to come from users,\u201d he said. He pointed out that young Californians pioneered skateboards so that they could \u201csurf\u201d the streets. And surgeons built the first heart-and-lung machines to keep patients alive during long operations. \u201cThe reason users are so inventive is twofold. One is that they know the needs firsthand,\u201d he said. The other is that they have skin in the game.Dr. von Hippel\u2019s principle certainly applies to menstruation. Since ancient times, women have tinkered with pads, tampons and pain cures. In Egypt in the 15th century B.C., women found creative uses for papyrus, while their counterparts elsewhere in Africa and in Asia experimented with absorbent moss. Centuries later, the nurses of World War I repurposed cellulose bandages.She also gathered lists of women\u2019s hacks and alterations to the off-the-shelf sanitary pads; for instance, one Smith College student imagined a discreet pad called the Invisos for a Jazz Age flapper who planned to dance in a clingy dress. Companies had been manufacturing diaper-like products with names like the Flush Down Ideal and the S.S. Napkin. Gilbreth\u2019s research showed that women had been altering the pads to fit their own bodies and that they were embarrassed by the names. Johnson & Johnson used these insights as the inspiration for new product lines.But Gilbreth\u2019s quest to understand female customers seems to have been the exception rather than the rule at companies. According to the authors of the 2012 book \u201cSerial Innovators,\u201d one inventor at Procter & Gamble recalled that even in the 1980s his bosses didn\u2019t seem to know or care that women hated the brick-like sanitary pads the company produced.Recently, I\u2019ve been digging through 200 patents, granted since 1976, related to tampons; I\u2019ve found that three out of every four of the inventors behind those patents were men. Clearly men have exerted an enormous amount of control over the look and feel of menstrual products.Ms. Tariyal points out that there are many unexplored possibilities in women\u2019s-health technology because for so long, women have not had the power to push forward their ideas. And this problem isn\u2019t just restricted to women\u2019s health.Consider the story of Sybilla Masters, often identified as the first female inventor in America. After she engineered a corn-grinding machine in the early 1700s, Masters left her home in the colony of Pennsylvania and sailed to London, hoping to procure a British patent. But the laws of that time prevented married women from owning property, and so she had to file her claim under her husband\u2019s name. Thomas Masters received the patent on \u201ca new invention found out by Sybilla, his wife.\u201d The contents of her mind belonged to him.\u201cMen had more helpful social networks for getting ideas and commercial activities off the ground,\u201d said Toby Stuart, a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, who was an author of the study. \u201cA prominent male faculty member may make noise at a university\u2019s technology-transfer office if he doesn\u2019t get what he wants, and he also has relationships outside the university and he\u2019s more likely to know venture capitalists.\u201d Meanwhile, \u201ca female professor doesn\u2019t tend to know as many people in industry.\u201dRidhi Tariyal didn\u2019t have that problem. In 2013, as a life-sciences entrepreneurship fellow at Harvard Business School, she was expected to produce inventions. \u201cThe fellowship came with an extensive network,\u201d she said. A chemistry professor invited her to work in his lab, and experts from Harvard\u2019s technology-transfer office helped her refine her idea.\u201cHarvard even paid for our patent attorneys,\u201d she said. \u201cSo obviously, my experience was an exception.\u201dAnd yet, even with all of these advantages, Ms. Tariyal and Mr. Gire discovered how hard it can be to raise money for a women\u2019s-health technology. They spent a year meeting with funders, showing off a 3D-printed prototype that extracts liquid from a tampon.The method holds great promise for the home-diagnostics industry; it is simple enough for a woman to use in her own bathroom. Initially, Ms. Tariyal and Mr. Gire envisioned their customer as a young woman who wanted to monitor herself for common infections like chlamydia. Though tests for sexually transmitted infections are now available free in clinics, \u201cnobody wants to be standing in line\u201d to ask for a chlamydia test, according to Ms. Tariyal. \u201dYou know what beats a free test? Privacy beats free,\u201d she said. \u201cWomen want to test themselves at home. And you can charge a premium for that privacy. So we were trying to push that angle.\u201dBut it turns out that \u201cwhen you say that you\u2019re going to build a company around menstrual blood, people think you\u2019re joking,\u201d Mr. Gire lamented.They attempted to sanitize their demo \u2014 for instance, they used blue-tinted water in place of blood. But there\u2019s really no way around the gross-out factor of a wet tampon. Meetings with potential funders were \u201cvery disheartening,\u201d Ms. Tariyal said.\u201cSomeone told us that the product would only help women, and women are only half the population \u2014 so what was the point?\u201d Ms. Tariyal said. Other potential funders wanted to reimagine their technology as a product for men: Was there some way to re-engineer it so that it would measure testosterone? And one guy suggested they develop a machine that a man could use to covertly test the health of his sexual partners, because \u201cwomen are liars\u201d who spread venereal diseases.By the summer of 2015, Ms. Tariyal and Mr. Gire began to despair. \u201cAfter we had an especially tough week, Stephen and I decided that we had to find a way to make this more palatable to investors,\u201d Ms. Tariyal said. \u201cAnd then we had an aha! moment,\u201d Mr. Gire added.Menstrual flow contains more than just blood; it is also rich with cells shed by the ovaries and uterus. Those cells, paired with genomics tools, might open up a window on women\u2019s bodies and give early warning of cancer and reproductive diseases. \u201cStephen and I were looking to replace traditional blood tests, and we ended up stumbling across something far better,\u201d Ms. Tariyal said.Their new vision resonated with executives at Illumina, a company that makes gene-sequencing equipment. The company contributed lab space and technical assistance. Now Ms. Tariyal and Mr. Gire are experimenting with a new diagnostic test for endometriosis, a painful disease caused by uterine tissue that grows in the wrong places. Women drop off tampons that can be mined for uterine cells; the cells are then scanned for genomic changes that are associated with disease.The gold standard for diagnosis of endometriosis is laparoscopic surgery, and many women suffer for years before deciding to undergo it. A tampon test, if it worked, could provide a much easier way to find endometriosis in its early stages.They also discovered that their new idea appealed to a certain kind of funder.\u201cOur first big check came from Len Blavatnik,\u201d the Ukrainian-American billionaire and philanthropist, Ms. Tariyal said. Mr. Blavatnik then asked an adviser named Patricia Benet to follow their start-up, now called NextGen Jane, because he wanted a female perspective on it \u2014 and that led to an even bigger check. The start-up also received financing from Pardis Sabeti, one of the world\u2019s leading researchers in evolutionary genomics; she runs the Harvard lab that tracked mutations in the Ebola virus during the 2014 outbreak.The role of women in this story suggests that female networks can transform the way we develop technology.Ms. Tariyal told me she chose her field because she\u2019s drawn to science\u2019s audacious sci-fi aspirations. \u201cI want a hyperloop! I want to live on Mars!\u201d she said, speaking admiringly of male inventors like Elon Musk.At the same time, she is troubled that \u201ca small coterie of people are determining what our future looks like.\u201d If our inventors and funders are homogeneous, Ms. Tariyal pointed out, then \u201cour future is going to look homogeneous.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "De Blasio Team Violated Campaign Finance Laws, Report Says", "Date": "2016-04-22", "News": "Supported byAn investigation by the New York State Board of Elections found evidence of flagrant violations of campaign finance law by a team of people that Mayor Bill de Blasio created to raise money for Democrats running for the State Senate in 2014, according to a confidential board report.The board sent the report to Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, three months ago, prompting a criminal investigation into the fund-raising.The mayor\u2019s Senate effort, which failed in its goal to wrest the legislative body from Republican control, has proved damaging to him in multiple ways. Democrats remained in the minority in the Senate; the mayor\u2019s relationship with Senate Republicans was severely strained, hurting his ability to win support in Albany for his agenda; and now it has led to one of several investigations that are tarnishing his administration.The board\u2019s investigation, and the subsequent continuing inquiry by Manhattan prosecutors, is looking at whether there was an effort to illegally circumvent limits on campaign contributions to individual candidates by directing money instead through Democratic Party county committees and a statewide party campaign committee.The county and statewide committees can receive contributions of up to $102,300, which is much greater than the general election limit on contributions to candidates\u2019 campaigns, $11,000 per donor.\u201cThe evidence demonstrates that the de Blasio team coordinated its fund-raising activities\u201d with the campaigns of several candidates and routed contributions to them through the county and statewide committees \u201cin order to evade contribution limits and to disguise the true names of the contributors,\u201d according to the report.Risa S. Sugarman, the board\u2019s chief enforcement counsel, wrote in a memo to board commissioners, \u201cI have determined that reasonable cause exists to believe a violation warranting criminal prosecution has taken place.\u201d She added, \u201cThe violations discovered by this investigation can only be described as willful and flagrant.\u201d The New York Times obtained a copy of the report.The board\u2019s investigation was prompted by complaints from Republican Party officials in Putnam and Ulster Counties, where hundreds of thousands of dollars in contributions from union political action committees and others poured into the local Democratic county committee in October 2014, shortly before the election. Large sums of money were then transferred to the local Democratic candidates. Those candidates also received large transfers from the statewide Democratic Senate Campaign Committee.The board\u2019s report says that the fund-raising effort was run out of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s City Hall and involved Emma Wolfe, his top political aide, and Ross Offinger, a fund-raiser for the mayor\u2019s election campaign as well as the Campaign for One New York, a nonprofit created by Mr. de Blasio to support his agenda. The report also names several union officials and political consulting firms, including BerlinRosen, which has longstanding ties to the mayor.It says that those people worked closely with the candidates and their campaigns in arranging for large donations to be made through the county and statewide committees, and then designated how the money would be spent. Some of the checks to the statewide committee included notations such as \u201cDonation per Mayor,\u201d the report said.One of the potentially most damning pieces of evidence cited in the report was in an email from the treasurer for Ms. Tkaczyk\u2019s campaign, Matthew Lerch, to Hayes Clement, the treasurer of the Ulster County Democratic Committee. \u201cHas the check for $60k cleared?\u201d the email from Mr. Lerch said, according to the report. \u201cBelow is our banking info, we need the 60 transferred over ASAP please.\u201dThe email was sent on Oct. 16, 2014. State campaign finance records show that the Ulster County committee received a $60,000 contribution from the political action committee of the New York State Nurses Association, a union, on Oct. 14. The records indicate that on Oct. 17, the county committee transferred the same amount to Ms. Tkaczyk\u2019s campaign.In all, the Ulster County committee transferred $330,000 to Ms. Tkaczyk\u2019s campaign over a few days. Around the same time, the Putnam County committee transferred $367,000 to Mr. Wagner\u2019s campaign and $273,750 to Mr. Gipson\u2019s, in each case after taking in similar amounts from donors outside the county.\u201cReasonable cause exists to believe that all the contributions were made to the county committees simply as straw donors,\u201d the report said. \u201cTherefore they should be considered contributions to the candidates and subject to the candidates\u2019 contribution receipt limits.\u201dDespite the flood of cash, all three candidates lost their races.Investigators said that similar patterns existed with candidates running in Monroe and Erie Counties.Ms. Tkaczyk did not return a call for comment on Friday night. An email message for Mr. Clement was not returned and his voice mail was full. Efforts to reach Mr. Lerch and Mr. Gipson were also unsuccessful.\u201cWe are confident that all of our efforts were appropriate and in accordance with the law at all times,\u201d Karen Hinton, a spokeswoman for Mr. de Blasio, said on Friday. \u201cWe will cooperate fully with the investigations.\u201d Of Ms. Wolfe, the mayor\u2019s aide who led the effort to capture the Senate for Democrats, she said: \u201cEmma Wolfe is a highly regarded public servant whose integrity should not be in question. She followed the letter of the law.\u201dMike Murphy, a spokesman for the statewide Democratic Senate Campaign Committee, said that it had followed all campaign finance regulations.J.

But the rule does not specify how to calculate the value of the foreign investments.For example, it does not indicate whether to use historical prices or market prices, nor which exchange rate to use. The rule does not even specify how to determine an insurer\u2019s assets, except to say that they shall be calculated at the end of the previous year.So regulators have a lot of wiggle room. If the China Insurance Regulatory Commission made an unfavorable calculation, it might have raised the uncertainty for Anbang, compelling the company and its partner to withdraw the bid.The derailed deal reflects the changing fortunes in China.But such overseas investments are coming under increased scrutiny as the Chinese economy slows.Overseas acquisitions account for a significant source of capital outflows. And those outflows, which have weighed on the currency and the markets, have become a major point of concern for the Chinese authorities.Anbang has been one of the most acquisitive Chinese insurers.\u201cIt would be good for everybody in China to see that the rules are being applied more uniformly than people would have anticipated,\u201d said David Zweig, the director of the Center on China\u2019s Transnational Relations at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.Financing, too, may have been an issue.Starwood was not comfortable with Anbang\u2019s ability to finance the latest bid of $14 billion, according to people briefed on the matter. An earlier bid by Marriott, just $700 million lower, appeared to meet Starwood\u2019s expectations.The 15 percent rule appears in Chinese insurance regulations as early as 2012. But it really became relevant only a year and a half ago, when the Chinese government started encouraging insurance companies to invest overseas. Even now, the Chinese insurance industry remains overwhelmingly domestic; only 1.5 percent of its assets were invested overseas as of last summer.Anbang is one of the few insurers that have made a big overseas push, so the company has been viewed as a test case of how the 15 percent rule would be enforced. But Anbang is a particularly complicated corporate group to analyze for calculating asset ratios.For example, Anbang bought a 35 percent stake in the Chengdu Rural Commercial Bank in 2011 for nearly $1 billion. But Anbang is closely held. And the limited publicly available data on the insurer does not make clear whether it has included a portion of the bank\u2019s assets in figures for its total domestic assets.Leslie Picker contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

On Thursday, the Democratic mayor briefly took part in a call-in for those with immigration questions, at a City University of New York building in Midtown Manhattan.Shortly after, he emerged from a narrow lobby onto the sidewalk, and into a crush of microphones and cameras, before walking to his car, trailed by reporters.The bizarre moment for New York\u2019s mayor \u2014 a scene more common to celebrity appearances or on courtroom steps \u2014 was the latest chapter in a story of investigations, but as yet no criminal charges, that has hounded Mr. de Blasio for weeks and has threatened to consume his administration\u2019s third year.It obscured, on Thursday, a bit of good news about homelessness, one of the mayor\u2019s biggest challenges of the past year: an annual federally mandated count, conducted in February, found a 12 percent drop in the number of men and women living on the street, to 2,794. But rather than hold a news conference to promote the reduction, his office announced the development via email.After the Midtown event, reporters, told to wait for Mr. de Blasio outside the building, peppered him for 1 minute 4 seconds \u2014 the time it took the mayor to deliver a brief statement and then walk to his car.\u201cMr. Mayor, anything you can say about the subpoenas?\u201d one reporter asked, referring to those received by his top aides and advisers from federal prosecutors and the Manhattan district attorney.\u201cSure,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said, stepping into the unwieldy scrum and seeking to project a calm demeanor.\u201cAs I\u2019ve said before \u2014 hey guys, don\u2019t knock each other over \u2014 guys, as I\u2019ve said many times we hold ourselves to the highest standard of integrity,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything we\u2019ve done from the beginning is legal and appropriate.\u201d He added that, because the investigation was continuing, he could not comment further on the details.\u201cWe look forward to the speedy conclusion of it, but we\u2019ll fully cooperate,\u201d he said, before turning to make the short walk east along Bryant Park to his car.As he walked, he responded to questions.

What did they specifically ask for?Mr. de Blasio at that point reached his waiting car. He took off his jacket, sat in the front seat and closed the door.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Fintech\u2019 Loses Some of Its Attraction for Investors", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported byWhen Elevate Credit sought an initial public offering of stock in January, its pitch went like this: Elevate uses big technology to approve nonprime borrowers for loans quickly.The word \u201ctechnology\u201d was plastered all over its marketing documents, appearing 122 times in its 200-page prospectus. Elevate would operate solely online, the prospectus showed. Its proprietary software and analytics would replace the hordes of people who in the past were required to approve loans for those with credit scores below 700. The company was even backed by Sequoia Capital and Technology Crossover Ventures, two of the most prestigious Silicon Valley venture capital firms.So Elevate, based in Fort Worth, wanted I.P.O. investors to pay up for its stock, with a valuation more in line with that of a technology company \u2014 higher than one for a conventional subprime lender.But investors did not bite.One day before Elevate was to have its debut, the company withdrew its offering, citing \u201cmarket volatility.\u201d True, the market was inhospitable to new issues at that time. Behind the scenes, though, investors did not think Elevate warranted such a high valuation.Another online mortgage lender, LoanDepot, faced similar investor sentiment, pulling its own I.P.O. two months earlier.Just as slapping \u201c.com\u201d at the end of any corporate name in the early 2000s increased the amount investors were willing to pay, the term \u201cfintech,\u201d or financial technology, has had the same power.Investments from venture capital, hedge funds, private equity and mutual funds have poured into fintech start-ups. In 2015, $19.1 billion was invested in the industry, almost eight times the amount invested in 2011, according to data compiled by CB Insights, a research firm. Where the money went, the start-ups followed, with about 4,000 businesses now labeled fintech, by CB Insights\u2019 categorization.\u201cThe word fintech is a bit overused,\u201d said R.A. Farrokhnia, a professor at Columbia Business School and Columbia\u2019s School of Engineering and Applied Science. \u201cSaying something\u2019s driven by tech is akin to saying fire is driven by oxygen.\u201dThese days, public investors have become much more scrupulous about the sector \u2014 which has expanded to cover things as varied as lending, payments, currency and investment management. Their challenge has been to distinguish those that deserve the fintech premium from others that are simply putting lipstick on a lender.One problem for Elevate is that its technology does not truly overcome a crucial hurdle faced by subprime lenders: high default rates. The company\u2019s documents show that a large proportion of the loans it underwrites are likely to never be repaid. So-called net charge-offs represent about half of its annual revenue \u2014 a big price tag for an already unprofitable company.Elevate said net charge-offs have not made its margins worse over time. For the first nine months of 2015, Elevate\u2019s operating margin was negative 1 percent, compared with negative 29 percent during the same period in 2014.\u201cWe have delivered strong margin expansion at this target loss rate as our loan portfolio has matured,\u201d Ken Rees, the chief executive of Elevate, said by e-mail. \u201cAs we continue to improve our underwriting, our goal is not to drive down losses as a percentage of revenue but to drive down the average interest rate to our customers.\u201dWho gets a membership to the fintech club is still somewhat unclear. Even industry leaders are divided over what separates a fintech company from a plain old financial services company that uses technology.Matt Burton, the chief executive of Orchard Platform, which sells technology services to online lenders, said real fintech companies should have more than half of their employees in engineering or coding roles. Mr. Burton estimated that only about 30 percent of companies that are said to be fintech companies actually are.On the other hand, Ravi Viswanathan, a general partner at New Enterprise Associates and one of the earliest venture investors in fintech, said his firm defined fintech much more broadly. \u201cWe don\u2019t really use technology as a lens,\u201d he said. \u201cWe use disruption.\u201dJon Stein, the chief executive of Betterment, said fintech was also about using technology to make finance better for individuals. That\u2019s the mission of his company, he said; it uses software to customize investment portfolios with automated rebalancing aimed at each customer\u2019s goal.Over time, though, the public-market investors will decide which companies should be awarded the technology multiples.\u201cThe term fintech has gotten broader and broader every year,\u201d Mr. Burton of Orchard said. \u201cInvestors are going to start to differentiate technology companies that are in finance from financial services companies that are using technology.\u201dSome of that will stem from what is in their public filings. Technology companies are often characterized by having simple balance sheets, fast revenue growth and high operating margins. Words like \u201cnet interest margin\u201d and \u201csecuritization\u201d describe banks \u2014 typically not technology businesses.The discrepancy between the valuations fintech companies have received privately and what public-market investors are willing to pay has already narrowed.Shares of LendingClub, which is viewed as one of the more tech-like companies in fintech, have plummeted over the last few months, trading at half their I.P.O. price from December 2014. As opposed to a traditional lender, LendingClub uses a marketplace model, meaning it connects lenders with borrowers without taking on much of the risk.Square, an online payments provider and small-business lender, priced its November initial offering well below the valuation it achieved in the private markets.That has not stopped banks from trying to look more like fintech companies. The financial crisis turned \u201cbank\u201d into a dirty word. As traditional banks were skewered for their lending practices and blamed for the decline of the broader economy, new models were popping up. This was also the time that fintech became a greater part of the vernacular. BankSimple, founded during the trough of the crisis, soon changed its name to just Simple.No matter how much technology is incorporated into finance, the companies will always have to deal with regulatory risk \u2014 something that can often weigh on a valuation. Fintech companies must grapple with current regulation and the potential for more, since they are dealing with the finances of consumers and businesses.Additionally, many of these companies have yet to withstand a downturn in the economic cycle, since they had their starts after the latest recession. Companies will need more history behind them before investors can truly price and categorize fintech.\u201cThe defining attribute of fintech is you are helping the financial services industry reduce costs and boost returns in a very regulated environment,\u201d said Rory Eakin, the founder and chief operating officer of CircleUp, a start-up that helps investors take a stake in small consumer businesses. \u201cIt\u2019s very different from other types of V.C. investing.\u201dAn article in the DealBook special section on April 7, about financial technology start-ups, rendered incorrectly the original name of the online bank Simple. It was BankSimple, not SimpleBank. The error was only recently called to The Times\u2019s attention.Advertisement"}
