{"Headline": "Exxon Mobil\u2019s Sterling Credit Is Downgraded by Standard & Poor\u2019s", "Date": "2016-04-26", "News": "Supported byHOUSTON \u2014 Standard & Poor\u2019s stripped Exxon Mobil of its top credit rating on Tuesday for the first time since the Great Depression, signaling that even the mightiest oil company cannot escape the worst oil and gas slump since the 1980s.Only two American companies now have an S.&P. AAA rating \u2014 Microsoft and Johnson & Johnson. Nearly every oil and gas company has been downgraded recently; scores of mostly small ones have filed for bankruptcy protection.But investors shrugged off the downgrade to AA+, still a stellar rating, and slightly bid up Exxon Mobil\u2019s stock price on Tuesday to close at $87.63. Standard & Poor\u2019s described the company\u2019s financial situation as \u201cstable.\u201d The downgrade, though, will probably raise the company\u2019s borrowing costs and may lower somewhat its status among state oil companies as the premier partner to have for complex project development.It also underscored a persistent problem Exxon Mobil and other large oil companies have tried to solve with only mixed success in recent years: finding additional reserves to replace the oil and gas it pumps out of the ground every day. Unfortunately for the companies, many of those new reserves can be found only in places that carry political risk or are so deep in the ocean or high in the Arctic that they are prohibitively expensive to produce when commodity prices are low.\u201cIt shows you low oil prices humble even the mighty,\u201d said Fadel Gheit, a senior oil analyst at Oppenheimer. \u201cThey are off the gold standard.\u201dThe ratings demotion did not come as a surprise. S.&P. put the company on notice in February, shortly after oil prices had collapsed to below $30 a barrel, vaulting much of the industry on the verge of bankruptcy. Pressures have eased somewhat since then as oil prices have bounced back by about 60 percent. Nevertheless, few analysts project that oil prices will recover to their 2014 levels of over $100 a barrel \u2014 well over double the current price \u2014 any time before 2020. A glut of natural gas on domestic and international markets has also trimmed Exxon Mobil\u2019s revenue.The company\u2019s saving grace has been its refinery and chemical industries, which benefit from the low oil and gas input costs.Analysts are divided about which way oil and natural gas prices will go in the coming months, though most see a firming to more normal levels sometime next year. Crude and gas inventories are bulging around much of the world, and Iran\u2019s oil exports continue to increase as it receives relief from nuclear sanctions. Few oil and natural gas wells are profitable to drill at today\u2019s prices.The ratings agency explained that it made its decision based on the company\u2019s cash flow and debt levels, saying that the ratio between the two was inadequate to sustain the AAA rating.It noted that the \u201ccompany\u2019s debt level has more than doubled in recent years, reflecting high capital spending on major projects in a high commodity price environment and dividends and share repurchases that substantially exceeded internally generated cash flow.\u201d\u201cIn our view, the company\u2019s greatest business challenge is replacing its ongoing production,\u201d S.&P. added.While it complimented Exxon Mobil\u2019s traditional fiscal prudence, the ratings agency warned that it could lower the company\u2019s rating further if it was incapable of adapting to a persistent period of low oil and natural gas prices.The ratings agency pointedly raised questions about the company\u2019s decision to spend $54 billion on stock buybacks since 2012 while its debt load was ballooning. That cash could have been used to pay down debt, critics have noted.S.&P. also noted that while the company was currently reducing capital spending, it will ultimately need to spend more to maintain levels of production and replace reserves from aging oil and gas fields.Exxon Mobil officers said the rating cut would make little difference to the company.\u201cNothing has changed in terms of the company\u2019s financial philosophy or prudent management of its balance sheet,\u201d said Scott J. Silvestri, a spokesman. \u201cExxon Mobil\u2019s access to financial markets on attractive terms remains strong and is a competitive advantage to industry peers.\u201dWall Street analysts also did not react to the news with alarm, saying the low oil and natural gas prices made the move inevitable.\u201cIn the grand scheme of things I don\u2019t think it matters that much,\u201d said Philip H. Weiss, chief investment analyst at Baltimore Washington Financial Advisors. \u201cIf Exxon needs to raise some cash it might cost them a little bit more, but it\u2019s not going to keep them from getting the money.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s Cloud Business Lifts Its Profit to a Record", "Date": "2016-04-28", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 Amazon delivered a blowout quarter on Thursday, joining Facebook as one of the rare bright spots in a technology sector that has recently produced a string of disappointing earnings reports.Helped by its fast-growing Amazon Web Services business, the company jumped to the most profitable quarter in its nearly 22-year history.Amazon often flip-flops between showing profits and losses, depending on how aggressively it decides to plow money into big new business bets. Investors have granted the company much wider leeway to do so than other technology companies of its size often receive, because of its history of delivering outsize growth.Revenue at the company rose to $29.13 billion from $22.72 billion a year ago.\u201cThe fact that they\u2019re profitable is a big deal,\u201d said Christian Magoon, chief executive of Amplify Investments, a fund manager that counts Amazon as a top holding. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a big deal after some of the disappointing numbers from Apple and others.\u201dThe results were well above the average estimates of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters for earnings of 58 cents a share and revenue of $27.98 billion.\u201cI saw the number, and I thought, \u2018O.K., did I read this wrong?\u2019\u201d Mr. Magoon added. \u201cThe beat was big. On the income side, it was fantastic.\u201dFor the last four quarters, Amazon has run in the black, even if it is still not quite as profitable as some technology companies. Facebook, by contrast, reported that its net income for the first three months of the year tripled to $1.5 billion from a year earlier.The biggest source of the company\u2019s profits is Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing business that started just over a decade ago and is now on track to bring in more than $10 billion a year in revenue. A.W.S., as the business is known, is the most popular cloud service for start-ups and for a growing number of big companies that want to rent computing capacity, rather than run their own hardware and software.Cloud computing is also much more profitable than Amazon\u2019s North American retail business, which runs on thinner margins, and its international retail business, which runs at a loss. The operating income for A.W.S. more than tripled in the quarter to $604 million.The profits from A.W.S. represented 56 percent of Amazon\u2019s total operating income, even though the $2.57 billion in revenue from A.W.S. \u2014 up 64 percent from a year earlier \u2014 amounted to less than 9 percent of total revenue.On a conference call, Brian Olsavsky, Amazon\u2019s chief financial officer, said the company continued to make hefty long-term investments in initiatives, singling out original content for its Prime video service.In a statement announcing the earnings, Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, highlighted the performance of another growing area of investment \u2014 hardware devices \u2014 though with the lack of detail that has often characterized Amazon disclosures. He said customers bought twice as many Fire tablets during the first quarter as they did a year earlier, and he said the company could not keep its Echo intelligent speaker in stock.Last year, Amazon reached $100 billion in annual sales. Investors believe that even at that size, the company can become a lot bigger because online commerce still represents a relatively small portion of total retail sales. Online sales in 2016 are expected to reach about $385 billion in the United States, or 8 percent of total retail sales, according to eMarketer, a technology research firm.Amazon is the rare technology company of its size to still deliver double-digit revenue growth. The company\u2019s retail sales in North America jumped 27 percent to almost $17 billion for the quarter, while its international retail sales rose 24 percent to $9.57 billion.Amazon said revenue in the current quarter is expected to be between $28 billion and $30.5 billion, with operating income between $375 million and $975 million.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Aging Air Fleet Gives His Bid, and His Brand, a Lift", "Date": "2016-04-23", "News": "Supported byHis Boeing 757 jet, often referred to as Trump Force One, has received the full rich-and-famous lifestyle treatment; The Washington Post even queried whether it was better than Air Force One.A close look at Mr. Trump\u2019s two airplanes \u2014 the 757 and a smaller jet used on the campaign trail \u2014 and three helicopters, however, suggests that their value rests chiefly in their marketing potential, with the Trump stamp of status masking the fleet\u2019s age.While the 757 might seem like an odd choice for a man who puts his net worth at $11 billion, and, records show, does not use the plane much to travel abroad, Mr. Trump has cited it and his other planes as proof of how he gets good value for his money. In the 1980s, for example, he paid $8 million to buy a 1968 Boeing 727 from a financially troubled Texas company, Diamond Shamrock, according to his book \u201cThe Art of the Deal.\u201d Mr. Trump said a smaller Gulfstream jet would have cost more than twice as much.\u201cIt was a little more plane than I needed,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut I find it hard to resist a good deal when the opportunity presents itself.\u201dIn the interview on Saturday, Mr. Trump said he did not own the five aircraft to burnish his brand, but agreed that the fleet had \u201cpromotional value.\u201d He added that he could get by without owning a Boeing 757 but it was a \u201cgreat luxury to have.\u201dAir travel is one of the largest expenses of Mr. Trump\u2019s Republican presidential campaign: A company he owns has charged the campaign approximately $3.7 million in travel costs since he announced his candidacy in June 2015. Using the 757 does not help keep costs down: It guzzles fuel and costs thousands of dollars an hour to fly, more than private planes being used to shuttle other presidential candidates. Still, Mr. Trump has used it to crisscross the country, sometimes with just a small group of people aboard.Mr. Trump said that he was aware of the Boeing\u2019s limitations and that he did not \u201cuse it that much.\u201d According to F.A.A. records, the Boeing has flown about 333 hours between Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement of his intention to run for president last June and March 16, 2016. During the same stretch, F.A.A. records show, the Cessna has flown roughly 216 hours. A review by The Times shows most of the hours logged were for campaign travel.Buying older planes has advantages: In addition to being less expensive, their depreciation costs are lower.Mr. Trump said he liked older planes because they had been \u201ctested\u201d and had \u201cbeen around.\u201dAs for Mr. Trump\u2019s personal travel, he prefers to fly private. In 2009, he decided to sell his Boeing 727, which was by then 41 years old. He replaced it with another used aircraft, the Boeing 757.He agreed to sell it to Mr. Trump in 2010, records show. The purchase price was not disclosed, though it was widely reported that Mr. Trump paid $100 million. The aircraft was insured at a value of $35 million in 2011, records show, and aviation experts say it is currently worth about $18 million. Boeing no longer makes 757s, but a 2015 Boeing Business Jet would sell for approximately $80 million, and cost anywhere from $20 million to $40 million to outfit.After Mr. Trump took possession of the 757 in 2011 he made a number of changes but did not fundamentally undo Mr. Allen\u2019s initial renovation, records show. For instance, he kept the headboard in the master bedroom, as well as most of the chairs, couches and toilet seats Mr. Allen had left, choosing to reupholster them.Greg Raiff, chief executive officer of Private Jet Services, an aviation consulting firm and private-jet charter broker for corporations and individuals, said the Boeing was an unusual aircraft for a man of Mr. Trump\u2019s wealth. \u201cBuying a 25-year-old 757 is like buying a bag of Cheetos. It\u2019s a lot of food for a low price,\u201d he said.The Cessna was previously owned by NetJets, an aircraft company that caters to the nation\u2019s wealthiest people, and has flown more than other planes its age, records show. It was worth $15.3 million new and has a current resale value of approximately $3.2 million, according to an estimate by Vref Publishing, a company that supplies information about aircraft values. The Times paid Vref to value the plane based on publicly available information.Mr. Trump\u2019s three other aircraft are helicopters. Two of those are 1989 Sikorsky S-76Bs, one of which was used to give rides to children at the Iowa State Fair.Mr. Trump took possession of the other 1989 in August 2014. It has logged only a handful of flights with the F.A.A. since he took possession, records show, though not all chopper flights are logged with the federal regulator. One notable trip that it received clearance to make was on New Year\u2019s Eve in 2015, when, records show, it was given authorization to fly to Nassau, in the Bahamas, from West Palm Beach, Fla. Both helicopters are worth approximately $875,000, according to Vref.Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about how Donald J. Trump\u2019s brand has gotten a lift from his aging fleet of airplanes misstated part of the name of a television program that featured a segment on the renovation of one of his helicopters. It was CNBC\u2019s \u201cSecret Lives of the Super Rich,\u201d not \u201cSuper Lives of the Super Rich.\u201dSusan C. Beachy contributed research, and David W. Chen and Jeremy B.

{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Privacy Watchdogs Call for Changes to U.S. Data-Transfer Deal", "Date": "2016-04-13", "News": "Supported byThe agreement, the so-called E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield, which would allow companies to continue sending personal data back and forth across the Atlantic, is still widely expected to be ratified by early summer. But by sounding the alarm over the current deal, national privacy watchdogs from France, Germany and other European Union member states have served notice that American companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon could face protracted country-by-country legal battles.The regulators say they worry that companies could misuse data, including information from search engine queries and social media posts. They also say they fear that American law enforcement and intelligence agencies might gain access to European citizens\u2019 personal information without sufficient safeguards in place.\u201cFrom the outside, it must look like Europe can\u2019t speak with one voice on privacy,\u201d said Patrick van Eecke, a data protection lawyer at DLA Piper in Brussels. \u201cThis is becoming kind of a circus.\u201dAnd the protest from the regulators signals that they could open cases and levy fines on companies that rely on moving data such as employees\u2019 financial information or social media posts across the Atlantic.As part of their announcement on Wednesday, European national privacy regulators said the data-transfer agreement was an improvement on previous rules. But they added that they remained concerned over American intelligence agencies\u2019 seemingly indiscriminate access to citizens\u2019 personal data when it is transferred to the United States.That access, according to the privacy watchdogs, is not subject to protections that match those currently offered in Europe. The regulators also said that new legal mechanisms to allow Europeans to monitor how their data is used in the United States needed to be strengthened.Ms. Falque-Pierrotin called on the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union that negotiated the data-transfer pact, to make further changes to the deal to meet the regulators\u2019 concerns.Those included fears that the indiscriminate bulk collection of Europeans\u2019 data by United States and European intelligence agencies failed to comply with the region\u2019s data protection rules. The privacy agencies also said the independence of a United States ombudsman reviewing European data protection complaints had to be strengthened.Vera Jourova, the European justice commissioner, said in a statement on Wednesday that she would try to incorporate the regulators\u2019 views into the final Privacy Shield pact, though she did not say which of the proposals would be included.But Ms. Jourova also emphasized that attention should now turn to getting European countries\u2019 approval for the data-transfer agreement by next month.\u201cI count on data protection authorities to help ensure that the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield works well in practice,\u201d she said.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.American officials contend that new oversight mechanisms \u2014 including an ombudsman in the State Department to handle European data queries \u2014 sufficiently protect privacy. They also say that American safeguards over how national intelligence agencies gain access to personal data go beyond what is available in many countries in the European Union.Despite Europe\u2019s national regulators raising concerns over Privacy Shield, legal experts and policy makers still expect the agreement to be approved by European countries by early summer.That is because the European Commission has the sole power to agree to the new rules, and because some countries, particularly the likes of Britain and Ireland, where many American technology companies have headquarters, have given their support to the trans-Atlantic deal.It remains unclear how the European Commission will alter Privacy Shield to answer national regulators\u2019 concerns, though it is unlikely that European officials will reopen negotiations with their American counterparts.\u201cNo national regulator wants to put companies in a legal limbo,\u201d said Alexander Whalen, a senior policy manager at Digital Europe, an industry body whose members include Google and Microsoft. \u201cWe\u2019re now in a waiting game.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the surname of a senior policy manager at Digital Europe.

{"Headline": "Outshone by Smaller Screens, PCs Aim to Be Seen as Cool Again", "Date": "2016-04-03", "News": "Supported byPALO ALTO, Calif. \u2014 Dion Weisler, the chief executive of HP Inc., recently held out a bulky laptop that was the pride of 2012. \u201cThis is the laptop we had when I came here,\u201d he said.He opened it to reveal another HP laptop within its hollowed-out insides. Then he opened that machine to produce another smaller and lighter laptop. Like the last in a set of nested Russian dolls, a final and even more slender laptop emerged from inside the third machine.\u201cPretty spectacular, right?\u201d said Mr. Weisler, a toothy and optimistic Australian.It was an impressive visual trick \u2014 and one with a point. On Tuesday, Mr. Weisler will publicly introduce a personal computer similar to the slimmest one he brought out of the nested machines, with a 13.3-inch screen but even thinner. At less than 11 millimeters thick (less than half an inch), he said, it beats the best effort by Apple and shows that HP\u2019s PCs are still hip and innovative. In fact, HP has made a small number of the new slim laptops in gold and diamonds, to be sold for $25,000 each for charity, with the unveiling planned for a New York Times Luxury Conference in Paris.HP\u2019s new laptop, called Spectre, underlines the lengths to which PC makers must now go to attract customer attention. Apart from HP, PC makers like Dell and Lenovo are also pumping money into the design of desktop and laptop computers, coming up with increasingly sleek machines, as well as \u201ctwo in ones,\u201d whose screens detach to become tablets. There are PCs that fit in a pocket, understand voice and gesture, or sense when they need repairs and call on their own for a remote tuneup.The sales decline was just the latest in several years when the PC market faced an onslaught of smartphones and tablets as cooler alternatives. The falloff is expected to level off this year, with PC sales even expected to begin growing slowly in 2017. But that still leaves the question of whether PCs can seem cool again.Even people who depend on the PC industry now lack passion for these onetime miracle products. \u201cIt\u2019s one of many ways onto the Internet now,\u201d Mikako Kitagawa, an analyst at Gartner, said of the PC. \u201cThe big companies are pretty much making similar devices.\u201dThat clearly sticks in the PC industry\u2019s collective craw.\u201cI hear \u2018post-PC era\u2019 and think it\u2019s rubbish,\u201d said Jeff Clarke, president for client solutions at Dell. \u201cWe sell a quarter-billion devices. The installed base is 1.9 billion devices. Maybe it\u2019s taken for granted, but the innovation is second to none.\u201d\u201cIn aggregate, devices like PCs, tablets and smartphones are still growing, but they are also shifting,\u201d said Mr. Weisler, 48, who has spent his career in PCs, working at Acer and Lenovo before joining HP. \u201cYou can create new categories.\u201dTo do that, Mr. Weisler has modestly increased research and development spending and plans to raise that amount. Under Hewlett-Packard\u2019s previous chief executive, Meg Whitman, printing and PCs \u201cdidn\u2019t get investment dollars,\u201d Mr. Weisler said. He also plans to merge HP\u2019s consumer and commercial PC businesses, hoping to bolster the cachet of PCs both at home and at the office.Obstacles remain in the way of Mr. Weisler\u2019s vision. When Hewlett-Packard was one giant company, it was valued at $60 billion. Now HP Inc. and the separate enterprise company, called Hewlett Packard Enterprise, are worth about $53 billion.Even so, he insists on a bright future. On a recent day, he showed off the early results of his push at the company\u2019s Silicon Valley headquarters. One device that looked like a small tablet or a large smartphone could, in fact, be either of those \u2014 or a PC, or a laptop. It worked on its own, or it could fit into a dock attached to a keyboard and a big screen, functioning like a PC. It could also connect wirelessly with a keyboard and folding screen, making it a laptop.Another machine in the room was simply a laptop, but the edges hid a series of quality microphones. It had Internet phone controls built in, and it was designed to open up until it was completely flat. That way it could be used for conference calling, catching voices all around the table.Nearby, HP\u2019s latest printers had lost their moving nozzles in favor of an 8.5-inch bar that spits about a billion dots a second. The company said it could now do laser-quality printing twice as fast and for half the cost, setting it up for the day when 3-D printing becomes commonplace.\u201cWe\u2019re bringing an elegance of design,\u201d Mr. Clarke said, adding that Dell planned to increase spending on research and development.And for all the challenges, Mr. Weisler thinks HP can thrive when PC demand picks up, and it might even get itself some of the shine that surrounds Apple \u2014 which has soared in value on the back of the iPhone \u2014 after the last diamond-encrusted PC leaves his desk.\u201cThere is value in building things that are close to people and understand things like facial expressions,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you focus on building for the high end, your other devices get better, too.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Microsoft\u2019s Cloud Business Falls Short of Investors\u2019 Hopes", "Date": "2016-04-21", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 Cloud computing is seen by many investors as Microsoft\u2019s salvation, the growing business that has convinced many there\u2019s a bright future for the company beyond the troubled PC market.But Microsoft\u2019s cloud business didn\u2019t grow quite fast enough during its last quarter to keep investors happy. The company missed Wall Street estimates, though Microsoft executives said it would have beaten them without the impact of unexpectedly high taxes.Weak PC sales are affecting many large tech companies. On Tuesday, Intel, the chip maker that for many years was Microsoft\u2019s inseparable partner in the PC business, reported disappointing earnings and said it would cut about 11 percent of its work force, roughly 12,000 people.The revenue Microsoft gets from licensing Windows to PC makers did better than the market over all, but it still fell 2 percent, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.Yet Microsoft has convinced many investors that it has found a way to adapt to technology changes, in part by vigorously embracing cloud computing. Shares of Microsoft, which is based in Redmond, Wash., are still trading near their price in 1999, their high, even with a 5 percent drop in value Thursday evening.The optimism stems from its success in transitioning legacy software businesses like Office to a cloud business model in which customers subscribe to the applications. There are now 22.2 million subscribers to Office 365, the subscription version of its Office business, up from 12.4 million a year ago.Microsoft has become a credible No. 2 to Amazon in the business of renting computing infrastructure to other companies in Microsoft-owned data centers, a business it calls Azure. \u201cIt remains clear we\u2019re one of two leaders in this market,\u201d Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, said in a call with investors on Thursday.One of the brightest spots at Microsoft during the last quarter was its intelligent cloud business, which includes Azure. Revenue in that group increased 8 percent, excluding the impact of foreign currency, to $6.1 billion.Brad Reback, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, said that the company didn\u2019t do quite as well as he had forecast in its cloud business, but that he believed that area was still performing well.\u201cI think they\u2019re doing a good job of focusing on areas where they can make healthy returns,\u201d Mr. Reback said.To some extent, Microsoft\u2019s success in the cloud has overshadowed its struggles in the mobile market. The company tried for a time to compete in handset sales against Apple and others by acquiring the mobile business of Nokia, but it has greatly scaled back the number of phones it sells and laid off many of the employees in that business after weak sales.Microsoft said its phone revenue fell 46 percent in the quarter, excluding the impact of foreign currency. On the positive side, revenue from Surface, the company\u2019s family of mobile computers, increased 61 percent.Microsoft\u2019s results reflected a $1.5 billion deferral of revenue related to its Windows 10 operating system. Without the impact of that deferral, the company\u2019s earnings were 62 cents a share and revenue was $22.1 billion.Microsoft\u2019s quarterly results were slightly shy of the 64 cents a share that was the average earnings estimate of Wall Street analysts, compiled by Thomson Reuters. The average revenue estimate was $22.09 billion.In an interview, Amy Hood, the chief financial officer, said Microsoft would have exceeded analysts\u2019 estimates without a 4-cent-a-share negative impact from changes in its tax rate.Ms. Hood said the tax rate stemmed from an unexpected shift in Microsoft sales to countries with higher tax rates, along with a shift to revenue from cloud computing, which is taxed at a higher rate than traditional software licenses.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Billing by Millionths of Pennies, Cloud Computing\u2019s Giants Take In Billions", "Date": "2016-04-10", "News": "Supported byBitsSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Imagine building an enormous beach resort, maybe the best in the world. Instead of renting the rooms, you charge guests based on the grains of sand they touch. You charge very little per grain, but if they lie on enough of them, it adds up.That is one way to think about what is going on at the world\u2019s biggest cloud-computing companies. Instead of grains of sand, think about computing cycles, the activity that goes on in a computer server that is running software. For a price, think about one line of software code for two one-millionths of a penny.When tolls that tiny are paid often enough, they can make a billion-dollar business. At Amazon Web Services, which pioneered this method late last year, there is no charge for the first million times a customer runs code. Thereafter, A.W.S. charges by the million times, or for the hundreds of milliseconds the computer is used.\u201cThe scale at which we operate allows us to do innovative things,\u201d said Matt Wood, general manager of product strategy at A.W.S. \u201cWhen we get better economies of scale, we\u2019ll use that to our advantage.\u201dThis economics of tiny things demonstrates the global power of the few companies, including Microsoft and Google, that can make fortunes counting this small and often. In other words, you have to be really big to worry about making money off things that are really tiny.Google charges pennies for search ads and spends $9.9 billion annually building out a global computing business. Given enough software, in the realm of millionths of pennies, it could do even better. Good luck to any new entrant without the scale of these tech giants, however, as customers come to expect that sort of cheap metering.Cloud-computing companies are not the only ones focused on the small. Banks, of course, have for years been content taking a sliver of big transactions, so long as there are many of them. Uber, which enables private cars to temporarily become taxis, can monitor drivers and riders to adjust prices and routes, changing the value of things throughout the day. An auto insurance company called Metromile charges customers based on how many miles they drive a year.As tech companies get better at measuring things, other businesses can pick up on the techniques, and the fine counting at the big clouds augurs for more precise measurements and pricing everywhere. Mitch Hedberg\u2019s joke about rice being a good meal when you are hungry for 2,000 of something may turn out to be a prophecy.A.W.S. was an early leader in public cloud computing, or renting access to computing equipment or software over an Internet connection. It started in 2006 as a barely noted fluke by Amazon. It now has over two million computer servers and a million customers, including Netflix, Shell and Brooks Brothers.The per-millionth pricing began last November, in the A.W.S. product Lambda. Lambda runs a customer\u2019s line of code in response to a request, like looking up a ZIP code when given an address. Customers never rent servers, but pay for the moments of computing.Microsoft last month announced that it would have its own \u201cserverless\u201d product. Google has something similar in early release, which is likely to be a product by the third quarter of this year.Microsoft is even trying to do A.W.S. one better by microslicing the cost to rent some of its software licenses into the minutes of actual use. \u201cWe\u2019re renting the sand and charging for the sun\u2019s UV rays that hit you,\u201d said Scott Guthrie, who runs Microsoft\u2019s cloud.For the big clouds, microslicing is also a way of coping with a tough task: Customers have to feel like they can rent all the computing they want, and the providers must always run at near full capacity. If someone is using cycles, and not whole machines, more people can be packed in.\u201cThe secret to cloud economics is utilization \u2014 every minute unsold is money you don\u2019t get back,\u201d said Greg DeMichillie, the head of product for Google\u2019s cloud. \u201cThere are very few of us who can work at this scale.\u201dLike any important new tech trend, the microsliced, serverless model is already attracting investors and start-ups eager to work in the new world \u2014 and in this case, wary of what the giants will do next.An Oakland, Calif., company called Serverless makes software that other engineers can use to develop products for computing in Lambda and its ilk. \u201cWe think this could be the focal point of A.W.S., even though I have no idea how they make money charging this little,\u201d said Austen Collins, the founder of Serverless.One way they make money is by adding on other products and servers. So does Mr. Collins think A.W.S. could thwart his business? \u201cIt\u2019s a mistake to think Amazon won\u2019t be in everything,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t say, \u2018What if Amazon does it?\u2019 We assume they will, and try to do something a little better and faster.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In the 21st century, it is not impossible to imagine an Internet revolution beginning in China.That possibility is, as with so many aspects of China, a function of scale. Alibaba, the sprawling Chinese digital marketplace, is already by some measures larger than Amazon. Its payment tool Alipay alone accounts for one-third of the $2.5 trillion global online payments market. The dizzying rise of the company is a crucial part of China\u2019s ascension as a global economic power, and if you\u2019ve never heard of the company, rest assured that you will. When the Alibaba founder Jack Ma appeared onstage last year at a summit in Manila with Barack Obama, Obama interviewed him.We often think of successful tech C.E.O.s climbing from the nerdy ranks of tinkering programmers, like Bill Gates, but as \u201cAlibaba,\u201d Duncan Clark\u2019s engaging biography explains, Ma\u2019s humble origins gave no clue to his future \u2014 then again, in 1970s China, the very idea of a homegrown technology business executive was inconceivable. Born in 1964 to a photographer and a factory worker, Ma grew up a mediocre student in the city of Hangzhou. About the only thing that set Ma apart was learning English, which he would practice by speaking to tourists passing through his hometown. One of these tourists, a vacationing Australian Communist, became a generous benefactor who even helped buy a house for young Ma and his wife.After a stint teaching English, Ma began running a tiny translation business, focused on Chinese companies \u2014 beginning to flourish under Deng Xiaoping \u2014 seeking to do business with the West. During his first visit to the United States in the mid-90s, a friend in Seattle logged Ma onto the Internet, and it occurred to him that listing Chinese companies online might be a good idea.If you think early American web pioneers had a tough time persuading investors and consumers to embrace the scary new world of e-commerce, imagine the challenge Ma\u2019s start-up faced: Most of China had no Internet, so his early clients were handing him thousands of dollars to create web services they themselves could not see. \u201cI was treated like a con man for three years,\u201d Ma said.Soon enough, though, his clients answered their phones to find curious Western customers on the line. In the late \u201990s, as the Chinese government began a delicate program of encouraging Internet growth without giving up state control, Ma\u2019s \u201cChina Pages\u201d and several other Chinese start-ups began to attract the attention of outside investors. That money, some of which came from the Japanese billionaire Masayosha Son, was rocket fuel for what became Alibaba, which has a massive shipping-logistics arm on top of its e-commerce services. When Alibaba went public in 2014, the $25 billion it raised made it the largest I.P.O. in world history (the next two, incidentally, were Chinese state-controlled enterprises).Clark is a China-based investment adviser and onetime consultant to Alibaba; he notes that his failure to exercise stock options he was given as payment became a $30-million mistake. The access he got to the company pushes his breezy account more toward the business than to Ma\u2019s personality. Still, Ma emerges as an unpretentious, self-deprecating leader, fond of quoting martial arts novels and \u201cForrest Gump.\u201d Yet he is clearly also shrewd and extremely driven. And his company has acquired enough wealth to begin to reshape the Western business world; he has announced a Netflix-style video streaming service and now has a movie division that invests in Hollywood blockbusters. The Chinese government\u2019s control over the Internet may still make political dissent difficult, but Ma and some others have demonstrated that there are few limits to building world-beating companies.James Ledbetter is the editor of Inc. His next book is on monetary debates and American politics. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "General Mills and 7-Eleven Join the Venture Capital Crowd", "Date": "2016-04-18", "News": "Supported byAt first glance, the maker of Cheerios and Cocoa Puffs might not fit the image of a cutting-edge venture capital investor.But with the food business moving to healthier offerings and online distribution, General Mills has created a venture capital unit that recently led a $3 million investment in Rhythm Superfoods, a specialty start-up that makes kale chips and broccoli crisps.General Mills, based in Minneapolis, is part of an increasing number of old-economy companies, including the convenience chain 7-Eleven and the Campbell Soup Company, that have joined a crowd of technology companies to create venture capital funds. Through them, they scout for new products or services and promising potential business partners.Their moves have accompanied a surge and recent crest in the valuations of many venture capital-backed start-ups. Critics say the corporate-run funds have contributed to inflated valuations for start-ups, and some funds have begun selling stakes even as they face reduced valuations on some holdings.Reports recently surfaced that Intel\u2019s fund, the largest of its kind, might sell up to $1 billion of its holdings as it narrows its strategy under its chief executive, Brian M. Krzanich.With valuations of many young, private companies faltering as interest in initial public offerings of stock has waned, corporate venture investing faces a test.\u201cI think some of the corporate V.C. will get a little less enamored as the venture market goes from euphoria into a little more normal period,\u201d said J. Sanford Miller, a general partner at Institutional Venture Partners in Menlo Park, Calif.Since 2011, the number of companies making venture capital investments has risen 79 percent, to 801 globally, according to Global Corporate Venturing, a data provider. The ranks include Verizon Ventures, Volvo Group Venture Capital, Chevron Venture Capital, Pfizer Venture Investments and Blue Cross Blue Shield Venture Partners.Even as total venture capital investment more than doubled from 2011 to 2015, to $58.8 billion, the amount invested by corporate venture funds quadrupled to $7.6 billion in the same period, according to the National Venture Capital Association. Corporate funds make up 12.9 percent share of the total, the highest since 2000.As a sign of how start-up valuations have waxed and waned, the size of the median late-stage fund-raising roughly tripled from 2012 to 2015, but it has fallen by 23 percent so far this year, according to Global Corporate Venturing.For many company funds, financial gain is less important than finding the next big idea.Arvind Sodhani, who led Intel\u2019s venture unit for 10 years, until mid-2015, said corporate venture investing has grown partly because of interest by chief executives. \u201cC.E.O.s who are worried they\u2019re going to get disrupted want to have an outpost in Silicon Valley to discern where the disruption is coming from,\u201d he said.Such corporate funds have \u201cclearly been driving up valuations,\u201d he added.For General Mills, which has also invested in the plant-based food maker Beyond Meat and two other start-ups, the venture capital fund is a way to keep pace with the growing number of small food brands that have found consumer success, especially online.\u201cThe traditional consumer packaged goods model of big advertising budgets, trade leverage and scale \u2014 a lot of those factors have been neutralized by these small brands,\u201d said John Haugen, who heads the General Mills venture fund after managing brands such as Nature Valley, Yoplait and Hamburger Helper. Emerging brands, he added, \u201chave alternative pathways to market online.\u201dTechnology companies pioneered corporate venture funds 30 years ago, followed by media, finance and health care companies. The two giants of the field are Intel, with stakes estimated by outsiders of more than $5 billion in more than 400 companies, and Google, now Alphabet, which has a $2.4 billion venture fund called GV with more than 300 investments.Comcast Ventures invests in companies it can later introduce to its cable and broadcast television customers. In 2009 and 2011, it took stakes in iControl Networks, a broadband home security and energy management service, and it later offered it to its customers through Xfinity Home.Comcast\u2019s portfolio also includes stakes in DocuSign, Birchbox and TiVo, as well as FanDuel, the fantasy sports betting site. Comcast introduced FanDuel to its NBC broadcast TV unit and its large customer base of sports fans.Other corporate venture funds acknowledge that their growing ranks have pushed up private company valuations. \u201cIn the last few years, there has been more and more corporate V.C. money coming in, and I do think that\u2019s had an impact on valuations,\u201d said Rob Salvagno, head of corporate development at Cisco Investments, which has $2 billion of stakes in 100 companies and 40 venture funds.Some funds have had bubble-style returns \u2014 as well as bubble-style losses. Qualcomm, a maker of chips for mobile phones, participated in a $25 million early-stage funding round for Waze, a crowd-sourced traffic application, in 2010. When Waze was acquired by Google for about $1 billion in 2013, Qualcomm\u2019s return was 10 times its investment.But some of Qualcomm\u2019s investments have struggled, too. It invested $5 million in the fitness device maker Fitbit in 2013 and had a paper profit of about 20 times its cost after Fitbit\u2019s initial public offering in mid-2015. However, Fitbit shares have since come back to earth, falling 67 percent from their post-I.P.O. peak in August.Qualcomm is prepared to invest through downturns because such stakes offer a ringside seat for \u201cthe next generation of disruptive innovation around our mobile core,\u201d said Brian Modoff, who oversees strategy, mergers and acquisitions and ventures for the company.Microsoft is renewing a venture investing push, hiring Nagraj Kashyap, the former head of Qualcomm Ventures, in January. The software giant was a big investor in tech and telecommunications companies in 1999 and 2000, but after losing about $5 billion from such investments in the three years that ended in mid-2003, it curtailed the effort in favor of more acquisitions.Venture investments have mushroomed recently at Salesforce, a maker of customer relations software, which began investing in 2009. Since 2011, Salesforce has increased its investments to $505 million, from $27 million. Five of its 150 companies have had I.P.O.s, and another seven or eight are waiting in the wings.Salesforce was one of five named participants in a $350 million investment in the cloud-storage start-up Dropbox in January 2014 that valued the company at $10 billion. Recently, however, one mutual fund investor that was part of the same investor group cut its valuation of Dropbox to less than $5 billion.John Somorjai, executive vice president of corporate development and Salesforce Ventures at Salesforce, said that he did not agree that corporate venture funds have helped inflate valuations. Prices for most investments are set by the traditional venture capital firms that lead the deals, not by the corporate participants, he said.As for Dropbox, Mr. Somorjai called it \u201ca very small investment.\u201d Salesforce does try to reflect such fluctuations in valuing its holdings, but \u201cno single investment is going to move the needle,\u201d he added.Sue Siegel, the chief executive General Electric\u2019s GE Ventures, said the company got into venture investing in 2013 to identify up-and-coming entrepreneurs in the health care and energy industries. She added that G.E. planned to stick with venture investing in the current valuation downturn. \u201cWhen you have these down cycles, it\u2019s a wonderful time for us to look.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Drones Marshaled to Drop Lifesaving Supplies Over Rwandan Terrain", "Date": "2016-04-04", "News": "Supported byHALF MOON BAY, Calif. \u2014 From a bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean, a loud pop signals the catapult launch of a small fixed-wing drone that is designed to carry medical supplies to remote locations almost 40 miles away.\u201cThe concept of drone ports is something that a very small decision-making unit in the country decided they were going to do,\u201d said Michael Fairbanks, a member of the Rwandan president Paul Kagame\u2019s presidential advisory council. \u201cIt took a very short time. It\u2019s something that America could learn from.\u201d\u201cRwanda has a vision to become a technology hub for East Africa and ultimately the whole continent of Africa,\u201d said William Hetzler, a founder of Zipline, which is based in this seaside town. \u201cProjects like ours fit very well with that strategy.\u201dThe new drone system will initially be capable of making 50 to 150 daily deliveries of blood and emergency medicine to Rwanda\u2019s 21 transfusing facilities, mostly in hospitals and clinics in the western half of the nation.The drone system is based on a fleet of 15 small aircraft, each with twin electric motors, a 3.5-pound payload and an almost eight-foot wingspan. The system\u2019s speed makes it possible to maintain a \u201ccold chain\u201d \u2014 essentially a temperature-controlled supply chain needed to provide blood and vaccines \u2014 which is often not practical to establish in developing countries.The Zipline drones will use GPS receivers to navigate and communicate via the Rwandan cellular network. They will be able to fly in rough weather conditions, enduring winds up to 30 miles per hour.When they reach the hospitals, they will not land but will drop small packages from very low altitudes. The supplies will fall to earth suspended by simple paper parachutes. The planes will then return to a home base, where they will be prepared for a new mission by swapping in a new battery and snapping in a new flight plan stored in a SIM card.\u201cThis is the new face of the aerospace industry,\u201d said Jay Gundlach, president of FlightHouse Engineering, an Oregon-based aviation consulting firm. \u201cEstablished unmanned aircraft companies should learn from Zipline\u2019s agile and innovative culture.\u201dLike Zipline, others are trying to solve the problem of the autonomous distribution of medical supplies. Many other systems being developed, however, are based on less-efficient multicopter or quadcopter designs that have shorter range and less ability to fly in all-weather situations.Zipline began in 2014 when two of its founders, Keller Rinaudo and Mr. Hetzler, visited a young public health worker in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The worker had created a text-messaging system that enabled hospital workers to urgently request medical supplies in life-or-death situations.But Mr. Rinaudo said he realized that what he was looking at was a long list of death sentences. Today in many places worldwide, attempts are made to deliver medical supplies by motorcycle or pickup truck over roads that are frequently impassable.The public health worker \u201cshowed me the database that had entries every time someone texted, and it was thousands of names long,\u201d Mr. Rinaudo said. \u201cIt was mostly infants, and there was no response. The supply chain had no way of taking them into account.\u201dMr. Rinaudo and Mr. Hetzler set about to find an airborne alternative to automate a supply chain. They met Keenan Wyrobek, a Stanford-trained roboticist who was instrumental in the design of the PR1 robot, a pioneering general purpose mobile robot with arms, and later the more advanced PR2 robot developed by Willow Garage.The three technologists assembled an engineering team with aerospace industry experience, attracting talent from Space X, Aurora Flight Sciences, Boeing and Lockheed Martin, as well as Stanford and Google. The start-up has raised $18 million from investors including Sequoia Capital, GV (formerly Google Ventures), SV Angel, Subtraction Capital, Stanford University and individuals including Jerry Yang, a founder of Yahoo, and Paul Allen, a founder of Microsoft.Mr. Hetzler said that by placing engineers who have consumer electronics expertise in close collaboration with roboticists and aerospace engineers, it had been possible to rapidly build a highly automated system that would be operated by a staff of five to eight.In February, Zipline signed a contract with the Rwandan government to begin operating the drone service this summer. A small team will be based in a city near the Rwandan capital of Kigali to oversee the service.\u201cI always think of Peter Thiel, the venture capitalist, who said, \u2018They promised us flying cars and all we got was 140 characters,\u2019\u201d said Paul Willard, a former Boeing aerodynamics engineer who is now an investor in Zipline, referring to the social media service Twitter. \u201cThis feels a little bit more like flying cars.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Famous for its personal finance and tax software, the Silicon Valley company rose to prominence more than three decades ago as one of the first and most popular makers of PC software.But among people who have spent years in the tech industry, Intuit is just as memorable for being the company that got away from Microsoft in the mid-1990s \u2014 a rare moment when Bill Gates\u2019s giant, at the peak of its influence, did not get its way.In 1994, Microsoft tried to acquire the financial software company for $1.5 billion in stock.Even then, Microsoft was squarely in the cross hairs of antitrust investigators, so to satisfy antitrust concerns, it planned to sell Money to a rival called Novell, which at the time sold PC software that competed with Microsoft\u2019s Office software package.It was not enough.

But in recent years, Starboard and its chief executive, Jeffrey Smith, have risen in prominence.Starboard, which was spun off from the financial firm Ramius five years ago, built up its successes gradually. In 2011, it sought to pressure the Internet company AOL, demanding that it shut down its Patch local news arm and sell off its trove of patents.In 2014, Starboard succeeded in ousting the entire board of Darden Restaurants, the owner of the Olive Garden chain \u2014 a rare achievement by any activist. That came after a campaign marked memorably by a nearly 300-page presentation that castigated the company for a host of sins, including not salting the water in which it cooked pasta and profligate breadstick distribution.Starboard has not always been successful. The hedge fund sought to block the $4.7 billion sale of Smithfield Foods to a Chinese meat processor in 2013, but it failed to put together a rival offer.A representative for Starboard declined to comment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.U. Charges Dispute Google\u2019s Claims That Android Is Open to All", "Date": "2016-04-20", "News": "Supported byGoogle has long stressed that Android, its popular mobile software, is open for anyone to use, including its rivals.Margrethe Vestager, the European Union\u2019s antitrust chief, said Google had required some of the cellphone manufacturers to preinstall the company\u2019s services, including its Google Play smartphone application store, and had given them unfair financial incentives to favor Google\u2019s services on their mobile devices. Those practices undermined competition and consumer choice, she said.\u201cGoogle has abused its dominant position,\u201d Ms. Vestager said on Wednesday. The company\u2019s \u201cbehavior has harmed consumers by restricting innovation in the wider mobile space.\u201dThe company denies it has broken European competition rules, and the charges may not lead to financial or other penalties against Google, which now has three months to respond to the accusations.By taking aim at Android \u2014 the mobile software that holds more than 80 percent of the worldwide market share for smartphone operating systems \u2014 Europe has opened the latest chapter in its continuing battle with American technology companies.Europe\u2019s antitrust claims highlight Google\u2019s increasingly thorny relationships with smartphone manufacturers such as HTC and Samsung, among others. Ms. Vestager said Android\u2019s prominent role in the mobile market was not in question but that she was concerned the contracts the company signed with smartphone manufacturers had made it difficult, if not impossible, for rival search engines and smartphone app stores to compete in the European Union.\u201cIf a company is dominant, that\u2019s fine,\u201d Ms. Vestager told reporters. \u201cBut if that dominance is abused, then we have an issue.\u201d She declined to name which cellphone manufacturers might be affected, citing their right to privacy.The device makers, already struggling against cutthroat competition, have become reliant on Google\u2019s digital services available on Android, even as they have tried to persuade consumers to try their own mobile services or those of Google\u2019s competitors. Some, including Samsung, have backed rival operating systems to loosen Android\u2019s grip, but such efforts have so far proved unsuccessful.And while global cellphone manufacturers once profited from using Android to expand rapidly, particularly in emerging markets, their growth has since slowed.Analysts say these cellphone makers\u2019 inability to wean consumers off Google\u2019s popular mobile mapping, email and other services has potentially shut them out of billions of dollars in extra revenue as people\u2019s digital habits \u2014 including online search and e-commerce purchases \u2014 shift to mobile devices.\u201cTheir attempts at beating Google\u2019s services haven\u2019t worked,\u201d said Neil Mawston, a mobile analyst at the technology research group Strategy Analytics. \u201cFor most companies that want to operate in the smartphone market, there isn\u2019t another option but to use Google.\u201dRepresentatives from the leading smartphone manufacturers declined to comment on their relationship with Google.The dominance of Android, at least in Europe and the United States, is almost absolute.The basic Android software can be downloaded for free and modified by device makers and telecom operators.In total, Google\u2019s version of Android powers more than 98 percent of the Android-based smartphones in Europe and the United States, according to Ian Fogg, a senior director at IHS, a technology consultancy in London.Only in China, where Google is banned, and Russia, where the local search engine Yandex holds a significant market share, does Google not dominate in mobile.\u201cIf someone buys an Android device in Europe or the U.S., it\u2019s almost certainly Google\u2019s version,\u201d said David McQueen, research director at ABI Research in London.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.If Google is found to have broken European rules, the company may face fines of as much as 10 percent of its annual revenue. Given the company\u2019s recent annual revenue, that could be roughly $7 billion. Such a high financial penalty is unlikely, however, according to legal experts.The company could also be forced to alter its Android software to give competitors a greater position in its mobile software or to change its existing contracts with cellphone makers.That would potentially provide Europeans with a wider choice of mobile services than would be available to their American counterparts. Most people in the 28 member states of the European Union, though, still rely primarily on Google services for many daily activities.Paulo Trezentos, chief executive of Aptoide, a rival Portuguese Android app store that is one of the complainants in the European competition case against Google, said his company would welcome greater access to Android users.\u201cGoogle makes it difficult for people to install applications from rivals,\u201d Mr. Trezentos said. \u201cIt\u2019s actively making it harder to compete.\u201dIn the United States, some lawmakers on Wednesday called on the Federal Trade Commission to more closely scrutinize Google after Europe\u2019s charges. In 2013, the F.T.C. closed a two-year antitrust investigation into Google\u2019s search business, citing a lack of evidence for pursuing a case. The F.T.C. said it did not comment on or confirm investigations.Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, who is a member of the Judiciary Committee, said regulations and laws differed in Europe and the United States but \u201cthe spirit and goal of our laws is very similar.\u201d\u201cThere is now clearly a need for exacting and penetrating scrutiny,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal said in an interview. \u201cPerhaps it is overdue. But it is now clearly necessary.\u201dAn article on Thursday about European Union antitrust charges against Google misstated the process though which Google receives revenue related to its Android operating system. Google earns revenue from, among other sources, advertising generated from services like mobile search that are included in the software. It does not receive fees from device makers.Cecilia Kang and Farhad Manjoo contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Messaging Apps Boom, Brands Tiptoe In", "Date": "2016-04-04", "News": "Supported byAdvertisingGatorade owns one of the iconic television moments of the Super Bowl, the dousing of the winning coach with a huge bucket of the sport drink, ice included. For the 2016 game, though, the brand wanted to reach more younger people, who tend to watch less TV.The company turned to Snapchat, the mobile photo messaging app popular with teens and millennials. Aiming to \u201cdemocratize the dunk,\u201d according to Kenny Mitchell, senior director of consumer engagement, Gatorade created a \u201csponsored lens\u201d ad that allowed people to overlay an animated dunk of the drink onto their selfies. They did so 165 million times in just two days.But should brands insert themselves into one of the most personal activities online? Many apps, such as games, allow advertising, but who wants ads from Pampers cluttering their most intimate chats with friends?Marketers are wary, too.\u201cIf we misstep with certain audiences, they\u2019ll unplug,\u201d said Suzy Deering, chief marketing officer at eBay.That doesn\u2019t mean brands are completely unwelcome on messaging apps. But it does mean that so far on these services, they are remarkably restrained in their approaches, focusing less on promotion and more on providing entertainment or utility \u2014 or both. In some cases, the marketing isn\u2019t even in the form of paid ads.On WhatsApp, for instance, the shoe brand Clarks avoided an overt sales pitch, and instead created three virtual characters to promote its venerable Desert Boot, allowing users to connect to them on the app to receive messages, videos and music playlists.Focus Features, a film division of NBCUniversal, used a chatbot created by Massively, an interactive marketing technology start-up, to promote its 2015 movie \u201cInsidious: Chapter 3.\u201d People could converse on the Kik chat app with a bot version of a main character in the film, Quinn Brenner. A sample snippet of a chat:Quinn: Do you believe in life after death?Me: Not really.Quinn: A little while ago I might have agreed with you\u2026 but lately\u2026This might sound crazy\u2026 but I tried to contact my mom on the other side.Me: Did it work?Quinn: It was like I could still feel her, you know? I thought if I just reached out, maybe I could speak with her. ...Over a period of a few days, the Quinn-bot sent increasingly intense messages about being haunted and threatened. Some 350,000 people exchanged an average of 69 messages. Kik, which has done 80 of these \u201cpromoted chat\u201d campaigns, on Tuesday plans to open a \u201cbot shop\u201d for consumers to try out more of them.\u201cBots are a creative canvas just starting to be realized,\u201d said Josh Jacobs, president of Kik Services, a company unit exploring messaging-related services like banking and shopping.In fact, these kinds of interactions might not be advertising at all. Several marketers say they are talking to Facebook about connecting clients to users of its Messenger app for personalized customer relations, such as answering questions or making appointments.\u201cAn interaction in messaging may look very different from other marketing,\u201d Matthew Idema, Facebook\u2019s vice president of monetization product marketing, said in an interview.In reality, nearly all the marketing in these apps remains experimental. Because the apps vary in their user appeal and acceptance of ads, companies often have to create different campaigns for each app, a costly and time-consuming process. And they lack the tools to track results as well as they can with other forms of advertising.Besides, said Kira Wampler, chief marketing officer at the ride-hailing service Lyft, \u201cWe have a lot on our plate with our other marketing channels.\u201dBut perhaps not for long. \u201cMessaging is a more human and conversational way to interact, much more powerful than throwing out a bunch of media dollars,\u201d said David Hewitt, a vice president for mobile strategy at the agency SapientNitro.An article on Monday about a Gatorade advertising campaign on Snapchat described incorrectly a function of the Gatorade \u201csponsored lens.\u201d It can overlay an animation of a bucket of Gatorade being dumped on a Snapchat user\u2019s photos or video clips. It cannot do the same on photos or video clips of the user\u2019s friends.Advertisement"}

The team used an internal version of group chat to communicate with one another while building the game. When Glitch was shuttered in 2012, Mr. Butterfield and his partners made the communication software the primary product offering.But critics warn that while Slack may have traction with tech companies and small start-ups, it could be difficult for the company to attract the even larger corporations that would provide significant repeat revenue over time.Recently, the ride-hailing service Uber dropped Slack because the service could not handle the thousands of Uber employees trying to communicate simultaneously, according to people who work at both companies.Advertisement"}

This week is a different matter.It might seem O.K. to sneer at the companies that increasingly run much of our lives, but a deeper reading of the reports shows an industry in transition, and perhaps getting ready to get even bigger.Of course, each unhappy company is unhappy in its own way, and Yahoo has a very particular form of sadness. For over a decade it has tried to figure out if it was a technology company or a media company, succeeding in neither while holding a sizable audience.The others, however, are each coping with transitions: All save Google are dealing with a transition to cloud computing, and the diminishing importance of personal computers at home and in the office.Even IBM counted on its software being consumed in a world where people used PCs. Now, the old services and hardware business are in trouble, but it showed progress in selling cloud and artificial intelligence services. The company also almost doubled its cash on hand, to $14 billion, in just one quarter.Microsoft has to adjust to selling fewer PC operating systems and making money off its cloud, and before Thursday\u2019s slip saw its shares near a 16-year high. It has $105 billion in cash, up $9 billion in the last three quarters.Wall Street appears to be worried that Google increased its head count over the last quarter, but net income per employee was $65,616 in the recent quarter, up from $63,426 a year ago. Earlier this week Goldman Sachs, considered pretty good at making money, had per-employee net earnings of $31,095. Google also bumped the cash it has on hand by about $2 billion over the quarter, to $75 billion.If the new hopefuls don\u2019t make it and have to sell at big markdowns compared with their once-lofty valuations, there are a few big tech companies that have gathered the cash to buy them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On Encryption Battle, Apple Has Advocates in Ex-National Security Officials", "Date": "2016-04-22", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In their years together as top national security officials, Michael V. Hayden and Michael Chertoff were fierce advocates of using the government\u2019s spying powers to pry into sensitive intelligence data.Mr. Hayden directed a secret domestic eavesdropping program at the National Security Agency that captured billions of phone records after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Mr. Chertoff pushed for additional wiretapping and surveillance powers from Congress both as a top prosecutor and as Homeland Security secretary.But today, their jobs have changed, and so, apparently, have their views on privacy. Both former officials now work with technology companies like Apple at a corporate consulting firm that Mr. Chertoff founded, and both are now backing Apple \u2014 and not the F.B.I., with which they once worked \u2014 in its fight to keep its iPhones encrypted and private.They are among more than a half-dozen prominent former national security officials who, to varying degrees, have supported Apple and the idea of impenetrable \u201cend-to-end encryption\u201d during a furious national debate over the balance between privacy and security in the digital age.In white papers, op-ed articles, conferences, newspaper and television interviews and elsewhere, the former officials have made their support for Apple clear. While their former jobs in the government are always featured prominently in their public appearances, their current business affiliations often go unmentioned.The barrage of support has given Apple a public relations boost in a fight it once seemed destined to lose, but it has surprised and angered some law enforcement officials.These officials question whether the business relationships that some of the former officials now have with Apple and other Silicon Valley companies \u2014 jobs that usually pay far above their former government salaries \u2014 are behind their enthusiastic advocacy of privacy and encryption.Among those who have voiced support for Apple\u2019s position are Mike McConnell, a former director of national intelligence; David H. Petraeus, a former director of the Central Intelligence Agency; R. James Woolsey, another former C.I.A. director; and Richard A. Clarke, a former top White House counterterrorism official. Like Mr. Chertoff and Mr. Hayden, they all now work with firms that have ties to the technology sector, records show.It is unclear how much money Apple and other technology firms involved in the F.B.I. litigation have paid to the firms where the former officials now work; most of the firms declined to discuss their private business dealings, calling them irrelevant.Mr. McConnell, who served as national intelligence director under President Obama and George W. Bush, argues that keeping the United States\u2019 computer systems safe from rival nations and rogue hackers should outweigh the F.B.I.\u2019s interests in unlocking smartphones in criminal cases.The technology company has been locked in a major legal battle against law enforcement officials over privacy and security.\u201cI believe ubiquitous encryption is something that the nation is going to have to embrace,\u201d Mr. McConnell, who is now a senior executive adviser at the consulting giant Booz Allen Hamilton, said in a telephone interview. \u201cApple has been leading the fight to go down that path, Google is right behind and Microsoft will be there before too long.\u201dBooz Allen\u2019s executive vice president, Thad W. Allen, a former Coast Guard commandant, has also voiced support for Apple\u2019s position on encryption, because, he said, American technology firms need to stay competitive in the international market.Booz Allen has made a recent push to form \u201cstrategic alliances\u201d with Apple and other technology companies, executives said.Mr. McConnell and other former national security officials said that their work in the private sector had no impact on their public support for Apple. Not everyone agrees.Some current law enforcement officials say they have been angered by the former officials\u2019 sharp and sometimes personal criticism of the F.B.I. (Mr. Hayden, for instance, said in an interview, \u201cI think Jim Comey\u2019s wrong,\u201d referring to the bureau\u2019s director.)The Justice Department and the F.B.I. declined to comment. But Stewart Baker, a former Homeland Security official who is one of the few former officials publicly backing the F.B.I. in the encryption debate, said it was frustrating to see old colleagues now echoing what he sees as erroneous assertions from Apple about the threat to its customers\u2019 privacy.Still, he conceded that the efforts had been effective. What started as a dispute over a locked iPhone used by a terrorist in San Bernardino, Calif., has instead become a broader one over privacy and computer security, Mr. Baker said, and \u201cthey\u2019re getting a lot of people to side with Apple.\u201dSo strong is their support that Apple has included comments from several of the former officials in its legal pleadings. One filing included a comment from Mr. Chertoff at a conference last month that if Apple were forced to create a \u201cback door\u201d to get around its encryption, it would be like creating \u201ca bacteriological weapon.\u201dAnother vote of support that Apple has included in its legal filings came from Mr. Hayden, who is one of the top executives at Mr. Chertoff\u2019s consulting firm, the Chertoff Group. \u201cAmerica is more secure \u2014 America is more safe \u2014 with unbreakable end-to-end encryption,\u201d Mr. Hayden, who led both the National Security Agency and the C.I.A., told a television interviewer a week after the Apple fight broke out.Mr. Chertoff\u2019s firm also produced a 28-page report this year on the value of encryption, and its dealings with technology companies on security issues are extensive. Apple was also a corporate sponsor of a cybersecurity conference it hosted in October.Mr. Hayden has acknowledged that he might have come down differently in the Apple dispute when he was the head of the N.S.A. If faced with an unbreakable device, he might have gone straight to the budget office and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to need another $500 million because I\u2019m going to kick my way in,\u201d he told the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.Still, Mr. Hayden said in a telephone interview that his strong stance on encryption dated back years and was not influenced by his post-government work at the Chertoff Group.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have any relevance to what I think about this,\u201d he said. \u201cI answered this on its merits.\u201dMr. Chertoff was traveling and unavailable for comment, the Chertoff Group said. The firm declined to discuss its financial dealings with Apple.But Mr. Chertoff acknowledged in a panel discussion last month that during his time inside the government, there were situations in which \u201cI knew I had to move heaven and earth\u201d to find out where a threat was coming from. His current focus on encryption, he said, is complementary to that previous stance on security and not contradictory.The encryption debate erupted in February after the F.B.I. said it needed Apple\u2019s technical help to get into the iPhone used by Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the San Bernardino attackers.Initially, the F.B.I. appeared poised to win the battle for public opinion. The attack, which killed 14 people, was the worst terrorist strike on American soil since the Sept. 11 attacks. Mr. Farook was dead; the phone\u2019s owner \u2014 the county of San Bernardino, where he worked \u2014 had consented to the search; and the Justice Department had a court order to do it.With the F.B.I. still pushing to open other locked phones, Apple\u2019s backers are preparing for a long fight.Mr. Hayden, the former N.S.A. director, warned listeners last month at the American Enterprise Institute that the flare-up in the San Bernardino case was \u201cnot a one-and-done.\u201dEncryption is at the root of Internet communications, Mr. Hayden said, and \u201cthere is nothing we can do to stop that.\u201d His advice to his onetime government colleagues on the other side of the fight was simple: \u201cGet over it,\u201d he said.Kitty Bennett, Matt Apuzzo and Michael S. Schmidt contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Taking Shelter in Old-School Dividend Stocks", "Date": "2016-04-09", "News": "Supported byOver the last several years, growth stocks, like Amazon and Netflix, have brought much momentum to the market. But in the first quarter, those kinds of stocks lost some of their sizzle, as old-school dividend payers came back into favor.That is where three of the quarter\u2019s top-performing mutual funds found some of their better stock picks.Cheapness is not enough, though. A company must also have a durable, defensible business and a burly balance sheet. That is not to say they avoid wading into situations that some investors might consider scary. Part of their strategy is to hunt in sectors where \u201cfear and anxiety\u201d have depressed prices, Mr. Sertl said.Thus, a couple of years ago, they bought gold-mining stocks \u2014 a first for their 10-year-old fund. \u201cGold and gold stocks went into a horrific bear market, and that\u2019s when we got involved,\u201d he said. \u201cGoldcorp peaked at $55 in 2011 and bottomed out in January at under $10.\u201d The stock ended up being one of the fund\u2019s better-performing holdings in the first quarter.A period of disfavor for media companies likewise drew the fund\u2019s managers into CBS and Time Warner shares, which also have done well lately. Some consumers have been dropping cable TV in favor of online video streaming, and media companies have responded by offering \u201cskinnier bundles\u201d of services and channels, Mr. Sertl said. That could mean less revenue, which has prompted some investors to scurry away. But Mr. Sertl said he and his colleagues believed that companies with popular programming, like CBS\u2019s sports broadcasts and the Time Warner division HBO, would continue to thrive.\u201cSome people say, \u2018Content is king,\u2019 and we believe that,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you have good content, you\u2019ll be able to monetize it.\u201dThe Artisan fund, whose investor shares have an expense ratio of 1 percent, returned 6.38 percent in the first quarter, compared with 1.35 percent for the S.&P. 500.The managers assemble the portfolio annually and replace a stock in the interim only if its yield falls below the median yield of the S.&P. 500 or if a company is taken over, Mr. Pettee said. Otherwise, they leave the holdings alone.\u201cA big part of our success is the fact that we reconstitute the fund only once a year,\u201d he said. \u201cThat cuts down on our opportunities to make mistakes.\u201dThe strategy has led to the fund owning an abundance of companies in traditional sectors like industrials and energy, and fewer in higher-flying ones like health care and information technology. But as tech companies mature, more of them are finding their way into the fund \u2014 and even more will most likely end up there in the future, Mr. Pettee said.\u201cThink about Apple,\u201d he said. \u201cIt declared a dividend in 2012, so it\u2019s now in my world. It didn\u2019t score well in our model \u2014 the valuation was too rich \u2014 so it\u2019s not in the portfolio. But I\u2019m looking forward to the day when I own Apple as a Dog of the Dow.\u201cMicrosoft was the Apple of the \u201980s, and in 2013, we bought it as a Dog of the Dow.\u201dThe SunAmerica fund, whose A shares have an expense ratio of 1.07 percent, returned 6.29 percent in the first quarter.Croci (pronounced \u201ccroaky\u201d) stands for \u201ccash return on capital invested,\u201d she said. That is a measure that Deutsche Asset Management, a division of Deutsche Bank, developed to compare stocks across industries and countries. It was conceived as an improvement over traditional measures like the price-to-earnings ratio, Ms. Kumble said.\u201cEarnings are based on accounting numbers,\u201d she said. But accounting rules can vary across industries and countries, making earnings and thus P/E ratios tough to compare. \u201cWith Croci, we make adjustments to transform accounting reports into economic values,\u201d she said.The fund\u2019s managers apply a series of screens to winnow their potential holdings from among large-cap domestic stocks.\u201cWe start with the S.&P. 500 and exclude financials and any stock that pays no dividend,\u201d Ms. Kumble said. The managers then seek stocks with low financial leverage and low price volatility as well as above-average dividend yields and low prices based on their proprietary calculations. All of the stocks they buy are given an equal weight in the portfolio, and they are rebalanced and, as needed, replaced quarterly.The methodology produces a portfolio that can yield picks that might seem surprising when viewed via traditional metrics.Consider Exxon Mobil and Coca-Cola, Ms. Kumble said. Back in 2013, Coke had a price-to-earnings ratio of 19, while Exxon\u2019s was 12. \u201cSo on the surface, Exxon was cheap,\u201d she said. \u201cBut our Croci economic P/E was higher for Exxon Mobil than Coke. So our methodology said Coke was actually the cheaper stock.\u201d The Croci approach made a number of adjustments, including, for example, counting Coke\u2019s advertising and brand as assets, which differs from the traditional approach, Ms. Kumble said.Coke was also among the fund\u2019s most recent reported holdings, though Exxon Mobil was not. Apple, too, was a holding.The Deutsche fund, with a net expense ratio of 1.08 percent, returned 6.45 percent in the first quarter.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Chatbots Reveal About Our Own Shortcomings", "Date": "2016-04-21", "News": "Supported byOn TechnologyEvery so often, an idea comes along that mesmerizes Silicon Valley and convinces the most powerful people there that this innovation will irrevocably alter the course of humankind. Outsize proclamations are made, lavish events are held and millions of dollars in venture money are funneled into young, unproven companies. Right now, that fixation has landed on chatbots, little artificial-intelligence programs that work like personalized assistants.In January, Sam Lessin, an entrepreneur and former Facebook employee who is working on his own chatbot called Fin, wrote a blog post breathlessly declaring the trend \u201ca fundamental shift that is going to change the types of applications that get developed and the style of service development in the Valley.\u201d If prominent investors, executives and entrepreneurs like Lessin are to be believed, the arrival of the chatbot heralds an entirely new phase of computing, one with the potential to overwrite the current app-centric model that smartphones rely on.In late March, Microsoft invited 5,000 developers to San Francisco for an annual conference called Build. A palpable sense of excitement surrounded the event: Microsoft intended to show off its latest achievement, a software tool kit that would allow anyone to use its A.I. platform to create custom chatbots. Though the company is often viewed as a dinosaur, it has introduced some surprisingly sleek products in recent years, and its bot tool kit seemed interesting enough.Over a live stream, I watched Satya Nadella, the chief executive, pacing triumphantly as he talked about the company\u2019s advances in machine learning and language processing. I nodded along as he described a \u201cpersonal digital assistant that knows you, knows about your world,\u201d a bot \u201chelping you with your everyday tasks.\u201d A few minutes later, an executive giddily showed off a chatbot that lets people order pizza via text message, Skype or Slack. The demonstration centered on what Microsoft presumably found most dazzling about the bot: It could be programmed to recognize slang. You can send it a message like \u201csup pizzabot, send a cheese pizza to my crib ASAP,\u201d and a cheese pizza will still arrive at your crib, ASAP.We\u2019ve long been promised a future augmented by intelligent helpers, of the type depicted in movies like \u201cHer\u201d: benevolent digital beings who remove some of the chaos of modern existence by organizing our lives, all the while offering emotional support through chipper encouragement and cute jokes. Sometimes, these helpers turn on us, as in \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey.\u201d Either way, artificial intelligence represents the manifestation of humanity\u2019s biggest hopes and fears for technology. But for now, it can help us order Domino\u2019s in a different window on the same device we would normally use to order Domino\u2019s.Commerce seems to be the primary preoccupation of the booming chatbot universe. There\u2019s Operator, an all-around assistant bot created by a founder of Uber; Assist, which lets people reserve hotels and concert tickets by text; and x.ai, which books appointments. In April, Facebook announced that it was introducing chatbots to its Messenger app, so that the company\u2019s 900 million users can order food and get the news, simply by \u201cchatting\u201d with the bots on their contact list. Like Facebook\u2019s, most of these bots work right inside messaging apps; it\u2019s like texting with a concierge, or if Siri birthed a litter of smarter, faster and nimbler offspring \u2014 ones you can issue orders to silently and who never get tired, or creeped out, by the nature of your requests.Outsourcing work to bots sounds ideal to me. My attitude toward technology is fueled by a desire for efficiency \u2014 and by laziness. In college, while my friends got into D.I.Y. hobbies like woodworking and sewing, I joked that I was ready for the D.I.F.M. \u2014 do-it-for-me \u2014 revolution. And yet for all the hype, none of these bots seem to work that well yet. Over the last few weeks, I\u2019ve played with a handful and have struggled to make much use of them. I recently needed to make a reservation for a work lunch. I fired up Operator to find me a table, and it quickly sent back a pleasant but unhelpful reply \u2014 declining my request, as it didn\u2019t yet have that capability.I also suspected that many chatbots depend on human workers to complete their requests. Mat Honan, the San Francisco bureau chief for BuzzFeed, was able to uncover the logistics behind M \u2014 a chatbot concierge in development by Facebook \u2014 by sending, of all things, a rental parrot to another Bay Area tech reporter. It worked; the parrot arrived. But afterward, Honan made some phone calls and discovered that M\u2019s artificial intelligence was largely a front. M processed the question and passed it along to a human counterpart to finish the job.Similarly, Operator, Magic and Fin all fall back on hybrid bot-human models. Seen this way, chatbots aren\u2019t that different from hiring a worker through a service like TaskRabbit or Handy, but without ever having to acknowledge there\u2019s another human at the other end. As the sheen of A.I. fades, you can see these chatbots for what they really are: a convenient way to hide human labor. It starts to resemble an update on a centuries-old illusion called the Mechanical Turk, a chess-playing device that was said to be automated but was, in fact, powered by a person hidden inside the \u201cmachinery\u201d itself.Even when the services are truly automated, their functions seem secondary to Facebook\u2019s quest for domination. Bots developed in partnership with CNN and The Wall Street Journal can deliver news headlines by Facebook Messenger; Operator and Spring let people shop from within Messenger for clothing and food. Disney built a bot based on the Muppet Miss Piggy that users can talk to if they are bored, and there\u2019s even a version of Zork, an early, text-based video game, that works in there, too. Eventually, Facebook users will be able to use bots to check movie times, bid on eBay items, browse for hotel deals on Expedia, place an order at Burger King and check their bank balances \u2014 all without ever having to exit Messenger.Indeed, it\u2019s hard not to see that as the depressing point of it all: These bots will simply help Facebook and others rope users in as long as possible, like fishermen trawling the open seas with gaping nets. The current slate of chatbots on Facebook look like innovation clipped for the sake of supremacy. The company has been moving in this direction for some time now. Everything from Facebook Live, its new real-time streaming product, to Internet.org, the nonprofit it oversees that seeks to provide Internet access to the developing world, has been accused of harboring the same goal: keeping users on Facebook\u2019s turf.Bots, which promise to make us more godlike, are instead revealing our all-too-human shortcomings and pettiness. This was on full display when Microsoft tried to show off the prowess of its A.I. in March with a chatbot named Tay, a virtual buddy you could talk to on messaging services like GroupMe and Twitter. Almost immediately, the demonstration turned into a public-relations nightmare as online pranksters taught Tay to mimic hate speech (e.g., \u201cHitler was right I hate the Jews\u201d; \u201cI [expletive] hate feminists and they should all die and burn in hell\u201d). Tay\u2019s rants weren\u2019t the intended work of Microsoft, obviously, but the meltdown revealed an uncomfortable truth: A bot, like any other piece of software, is only as good as its makers\u2019 imagination. Technologies embody the values \u2014 and the biases and prejudices \u2014 of the society that incubates them, and if we can\u2019t imagine the future we want, then neither can our creations.Jenna Wortham is a staff writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Wyoming, Hard Times Return as Energy Prices Slump", "Date": "2016-04-12", "News": "Supported byWRIGHT, Wyo. \u2014 For 17 years, Scott Pearce worked as a mechanic here in the Powder River Basin, a Saudi Arabia of Western coal deposits. But about a week ago, he became a casualty of the declining local economy, one of nearly 500 people laid off from the Black Thunder and North Antelope Rochelle mines. It was among the latest and worst rounds of job losses to hit Wyoming.Hard times have come crashing back on energy-reliant towns like this one in northern Wyoming, where lives and fortunes hinge on the coal, oil and gas buried beneath the rolling plains.A church in Gillette, about 40 miles north, held a prayer vigil for laid-off miners last week, and state officials were scrambling to find them seasonal work with state parks or jobs as prison guards. But U-Haul vans and trailers are already starting to carry people away from Wright, a town of 1,800 that sprouted up in the 1980s to serve the mines. Mr. Pearce, 52, is leaving for Alaska to chase work with his brother in the gold mines.\u201cI\u2019ll have to turn my house back in to the bank. We\u2019re not going to be able to sell,\u201d he said one afternoon last week as he watched television at a friend\u2019s electronics shop. \u201cThis is a sinking ship.\u201dBankruptcies in the coal industry and a slowdown in oil drilling have sown economic pain and budget shortfalls from Appalachia to Alaska, but the effects have been especially concentrated in Wyoming.The state\u2019s unemployment rate has climbed by 1.2 percentage points over the past year, more than in any other state. While Wyoming\u2019s overall jobless rate is about even with the national average, 5 percent, the layoffs in mining country have created pockets of a new recession, raising fears that rural economies here are veering away from the rest of the country\u2019s economic progress.\u201cIt is, no question, a hard time for the state,\u201d Gov. Matt Mead said in a telephone interview. \u201cAs difficult as it is now, I think it can get worse. If these people pack up and leave, the local restaurant won\u2019t even get that occasional business. It\u2019s heartbreaking to see.\u201dThe layoffs have forced an economic reckoning in a state where oil, gas, coal and uranium provide 60 to 70 percent of revenue. Tourists and second-home buyers are still flocking to Jackson Hole, wind turbines are blooming along the plains and Microsoft is expanding a data center in Cheyenne. But those pale in comparison with the shadow that energy extraction \u2014 much of it on federal lands \u2014 casts across the economy.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to diversify the economy,\u201d Mr. Mead said.Falling tax revenue forced deep budget cuts this year and prompted lawmakers to draw $180 million from the state\u2019s rainy-day fund. The budget crunch also intensified a debate within the Republican-dominated state government over whether to expand Medicaid under President Obama\u2019s health care law.Mr. Mead, a Republican, opposed the Affordable Care Act, but in 2014 started urging the Republican-controlled State Legislature to accept the Medicaid expansion, saying it would bring in about $268 million in federal dollars and cover about 20,000 low-income people. But the Legislature balked, saying it would force Wyoming to shoulder a huge government expansion with an unknown price tag down the line.\u201cWe care about our people,\u201d said Phil Nicholas, the State Senate president. \u201cBut we also believe you can create problems by creating straight-out entitlements without any obligation or effort to improve your situation.\u201dDemocrats said the budget cuts and Medicaid rejection ended up heaping most of the pain on Wyoming\u2019s poor. A literacy program that helped people earn high school equivalency degrees was eliminated, as were programs that provided dental care and property-tax rebates to low-income old people.Mary Throne, the Democratic minority floor leader in the State House of Representatives, said the Medicaid expansion could have helped the families of laid-off miners.\u201cAs people lose benefits and they don\u2019t have access to health insurance, we\u2019re going to need a safety net,\u201d she said. \u201cWe made very bad choices. We panicked. And we really should have been thoughtful and deliberate.\u201dIf jobs are scarce around here, blame is not. Some conservative lawmakers and laid-off workers seethed at the Obama administration\u2019s carbon regulations and its halt on coal leasing on public lands. But others said that coal was struggling to compete against cheap, plentiful natural gas, and that oil and gas drilling would rebound once prices did.In Casper, Eric Kraft, 30, sat down at a computer terminal at a packed work force resource center and started filling out a r\u00e9sum\u00e9.

Not his.\u201cMine said they appreciated your service, and there was a bus to haul me home,\u201d Mr. Kraft said. \u201cIt was more of a relief \u2014 the biggest part of it was the waiting, knowing it\u2019s coming.\u201dTowns like Wright are still bracing for the worst. It survived a bust in the mid-1980s just after it incorporated from an outpost of trailers into a real town.

Now, Ms. Harlow said, she was working to bring in experts from the community college to counsel residents on how to refinance their mortgages, navigate a job search and apply for food stamps.The town of Wright\u2019s $3 million budget is already down about 30 percent. And as workers in the area brace for the possibility of more layoffs, they said they were still unsure where the bottom might lie.\u201cReminds me of going to a funeral,\u201d said the mayor, Ralph Kingan. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening to my town.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified the structures on the outskirts of Wright, Wyo.

{"Headline": "Yahoo\u2019s Suitors Uncover Few Financial Details", "Date": "2016-04-14", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 As Yahoo prepares to accept first-round bids for its core Internet business on Monday, potential buyers have found themselves facing one big problem: How do you value a company with a declining business when the company appears reluctant to share vital financial details?But several big companies are expected to place bids for Yahoo anyway, according to people briefed on the matter. Verizon Communications, which has publicly expressed interest in buying Yahoo\u2019s core Internet business and merging it with its AOL division, plans to press forward with a bid, some of these people said.The Daily Mail, a British tabloid newspaper and website, said publicly that it had considered joining with potential investors, including one or more private equity firm, for a bid. And the private equity firm TPG plans to make a bid in the first round on its own, according to a person briefed on the matter.Yet other huge companies plan to sit out the bidding. Google, which competes with Yahoo on search and display advertising and has a search partnership with the company, considered making an offer, but is unlikely to proceed because it fears any deal would draw stiff antitrust scrutiny, according to people briefed on the company\u2019s thinking.Other notable businesses, including AT&T, CBS and the investment firms Silver Lake, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and General Atlantic, are unlikely to bid, according to others briefed on their plans. And SoftBank, the Japanese telecommunications giant that controls Yahoo Japan, does not plan to bid despite press reports to the contrary.A 90-slide presentation shown to potential Yahoo bidders is dense with figures, but even people familiar with the company\u2019s operations have struggled to make sense of them. At the same time, Yahoo devoted just a couple of slides to important strategies, like its costly Hail Mary project to create an entirely new mobile search experience to leapfrog competitors like Google, Apple and Amazon.Representatives of Verizon, Google, AT&T and CBS declined to comment. A Yahoo spokeswoman also declined to comment on the sales process.Marissa Mayer, Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, is expected to face questions about the bidding on Tuesday, when the company reports its latest quarterly earnings. The report should offer a window into how Yahoo is weathering the upheaval caused by the layoff of 15 percent of its work force announced in February. The total value of Yahoo shares is now about $35 billion.The company may also disclose sales of patents and real estate, which it began shopping a couple of months ago in the hope of raising $1 billion to $3 billion.One reason for Yahoo\u2019s reluctance to share information may be that the business is worse than the company has publicly disclosed. That has added to confusion regarding the intentions of a board of directors that, just a few months ago, publicly said it had no intention of selling.Ms. Mayer has often said she wants to make Yahoo services a \u201cdaily habit\u201d for Internet users. But after nearly four years of effort, only about 10 percent of the one billion monthly visitors to Yahoo sites return every day, suggesting little attachment to the brand, according to people who have seen confidential internal data. At Facebook, by comparison, 65 percent of users visit daily.Yahoo is in a difficult position. Ms. Mayer\u2019s four-year turnaround effort has failed to deliver significant improvements at a company that has been in decline for a decade. Ms. Mayer argues that she is turning the tide with new investments in areas like video and native advertising.Activist investors, led by the Starboard Value hedge fund, have run out of patience and are pressing the board to sell the core business, separating it from the company\u2019s far more valuable investment stakes in Alibaba, China\u2019s leading e-commerce company, and Yahoo Japan, a separate, publicly traded company.Yahoo\u2019s board, which spent more than a year working on other plans to separate the investment stakes, reluctantly agreed to explore a sale of all or parts of the company and hired three investment banking firms to run the process. Starboard has formally threatened a proxy fight to replace the entire board at the next shareholder meeting if the directors do not follow through on a sale.Ms. Mayer has publicly laid out a path for an independent Yahoo and made the case to potential bidders that they should retain her as chief to carry out the plan.Abandoning previous forays into video and digital magazines, Ms. Mayer, who formerly headed search at Google, is now focused on returning Yahoo to its glory days as a search engine. Although comScore says that Yahoo is currently the No. 3 player in desktop searches, behind Google and Microsoft, Ms. Mayer argues that Yahoo can leap ahead through a \u201ccomplete reimagination of mobile search.\u201dMs. Mayer has assigned about 1,000 people to search products, or about 10 percent of the company\u2019s staff, according to people briefed on the business. The mobile effort, code-named Project Index, has officially been underway for two years and aims to create a search tool similar to Google Now on Android phones, Apple\u2019s Siri, Microsoft\u2019s Cortana and Amazon\u2019s Alexa.But the team has little to show for its work, and many at Yahoo wonder whether it is a hopeless quest. Industry experts as well as Yahoo insiders say that without the location and personal data that Apple and Google have, Yahoo will have a difficult time predicting what people want with enough accuracy to get them to switch from other services.As Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, Ms. Mayer acquired more than 20 companies, but ultimately struggled to turn around the web pioneer.\u201cThere is a massive opportunity for mobile search,\u201d said Keith Rabois, a partner at Khosla Ventures, who invests in search start-ups. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think Yahoo has the core assets or skills you would need to succeed or thrive right now.\u201dA Yahoo spokesman said that the company was exploring many search ideas, including the use of software bots that would fetch information on behalf of users.Ms. Mayer\u2019s vague plans for reversing Yahoo\u2019s decline, along with the lack of disclosure about the company\u2019s finances, have made prospective bidders nervous.Though several private equity firms have been looking at the company, people involved in the bidding process said that they were unlikely to prevail against a determined corporate buyer.Verizon is viewed by analysts as the leading bidder for Yahoo, but its likely offer comes despite trepidation among its executives, according to the people briefed on the bidding.Verizon is still struggling to digest its $4.4 billion acquisition last year of AOL, and some executives worry that buying Yahoo would simply be doubling down on integration troubles.Verizon could certainly combine the content properties and ad products and networks run by Yahoo and AOL.The company, with more than 112 million cellphone customers on top of its landline Internet subscribers, would have the ability to preinstall Yahoo services and distribute them widely.However, the contracts governing Apple iPhones and phones running Google\u2019s Android operating system generally restrict what phone carriers can do to promote alternatives for major services like search and email. So Yahoo would still need to build products good enough to persuade people to switch.Wall Street is hoping for a quick sale, to anybody, at any reasonable price.\u201cWe continue to believe that one of the greatest risks in the stock is the core being a \u2018melting ice cube,\u2019 as a prolonged sale process draws on, creating questions for employees, advertisers and partners,\u201d wrote Robert Peck, an analyst with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, on Wednesday.Because of an editing error, an article on Friday about Yahoo\u2019s reluctance to share financial details with prospective buyers misstated the amount the company hoped to raise by selling patents and real estate. The amount is $1 billion to $3 billion, not $1 billion to $35 billion.Conor Dougherty contributed reporting from San Francisco, and Emily Steel from New York.Advertisement"}

Since taking over as chief executive of Microsoft in early 2014, Satya Nadella has shown a willingness to collaborate more closely with companies that were once bitter rivals.Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google, was named to that position last August, after a major reorganization that formed a new holding company, Alphabet, to oversee Google and other divisions.Despite the detente between the tech giants, Google still faces powerful adversaries, particularly in Europe where local publishers and telecom operators, among others, remain wary of its powerful role in how people in the 28-member bloc gain access to digital services.Some of those companies have filed complaints that have led to two formal documents of accusations against Google from Europe\u2019s competition authorities.Several American tech companies, including Oracle, Yelp and Expedia, also claim that Google has broken antitrust rules in Europe, the United States and elsewhere.At Microsoft, the previous target of multiple European regulatory investigations, the focus has shifted in the last 18 months from attacking Google to lobbying over privacy regulation \u2014 important rules that underpin its fast-growing cloud computing business.Microsoft has been a vocal supporter of Europe\u2019s tough privacy rules \u2014 often positioning itself in contrast to Google and Facebook \u2014 repeatedly highlighting how it has complied with the region\u2019s strict stance on data protection to a greater degree than its rivals.Nick Wingfield reported from Seattle and Mark Scott from Rome.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Services Shut Down in China in Startling About-Face", "Date": "2016-04-21", "News": "Supported byFor years, there has been a limit to the success of American technology companies in China. Capture too much market share or wield too much influence, and Beijing will push back.Apple has largely been an exception to that trend. Yet the Silicon Valley company is now facing a regulatory push against its services in China that could signal its good relations in the country may be turning.Last week, Apple\u2019s iBooks Store and iTunes Movies were shut down in China, just six months after they were started there. Initially, Apple apparently had the government\u2019s approval to introduce the services. But then a regulator, the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television, asserted its authority and demanded the closings, according to two people who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\u201cWe hope to make books and movies available again to our customers in China as soon as possible,\u201d an Apple spokeswoman said in a statement.China\u2019s pushback against Apple shows that the company may finally be vulnerable to the heightened scrutiny that other American tech companies have faced in recent years. That scrutiny was spurred by revelations from the former United States National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden in 2013 of the use of American companies to conduct cyberespionage for Washington.China has sweeping goals in its move against Apple, said Daniel H. Rosen, founding partner of Rhodium Group, a New-York based advisory firm specializing in the Chinese economy.\u201cThey are interested in protecting the content that the Chinese people see, policing its national security and favoring indigenous giants such as Huawei, Alibaba and Tencent,\u201d Mr. Rosen said. In this new era, he added, China \u201cis strongly disinclined to accept the dominance of foreign players on the Internet, not least those from the United States.\u201dAfter the shutdown of Apple\u2019s services, President Xi Jinping of China, who has led a crackdown on Western ideology, conducted a meeting on Tuesday in Beijing on China\u2019s restrictive Internet policies. China\u2019s top tech leaders, including Jack Ma, chairman of the e-commerce company Alibaba, and Ren Zhengfei, head of Huawei, were present at the meeting.\u201cChina must improve management of cyberspace and work to ensure high-quality content with positive voices creating a healthy, positive culture that is a force for good,\u201d a report by the state-run news service Xinhua quoted Mr. Xi as saying.Since the Snowden leaks, China\u2019s state media identified eight American companies that it has labeled guardian warriors and that it has said were too deeply established in the country\u2019s core industries such as energy, communications, education and military.Though Apple is one of the eight, it has had a much easier time.There have been some signs of trouble ahead. Mr. Xi has presided over a deep freeze on the Internet, increasing censorship and taking aim at online tools used to circumvent China\u2019s system of online filters, known as the Great Firewall. He has also added new policy tools to keep tabs on electronic communications. Mr. Xi heads a committee of top leaders set up to streamline tech and Internet policy and turn the country into a \u201ccyberpower.\u201dIn addition, the Chinese government proposed an antiterrorism law two years ago that would require foreign companies to turn over encryption keys \u2014 the codes that enable otherwise-scrambled information to be viewed \u2014 for security reasons. Though the language was ultimately dropped, analysts said the government wants to have access to all communications within China.The two Apple services that Chinese regulators shut down, iTunes Movies and the iBooks Store, compete directly with Chinese Internet companies\u2019 products. Beijing has recently added initiatives to support a sputtering economy with new emphasis on industries that require higher skills and command better profit margins, like the Internet.That push may eventually trickle down to other Apple services. Apple Pay, for example, competes with mobile payments systems from some of China\u2019s largest Internet companies: Alibaba and Tencent.In the longer term, China\u2019s tough line on foreign tech companies like Apple could have heavy consequences for the Chinese economy, Mr. Rosen said.\u201cAs surely as the tremendous welfare gains for China and its people from deepening links to global tech production, disassembling those connections is likely to entail a heavy economic loss,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

But unlike the United States company, Onefinestay oversees each rental, providing toiletries, bedding and other amenities to serve the high-end house rental market.By acquiring Onefinestay, which had raised just over $80 million in venture capital, including some from hotel groups like Hyatt Hotels, AccorHotels has secured one of Europe\u2019s leading sharing economy start-ups.Just as in Silicon Valley, where a lack of venture capital funding and concerns about overheated valuations have started to raise concerns, European founders and venture capitalists are starting to question if their region\u2019s tech sector has hard times ahead.In recent months, for instance, a number of European start-ups have been sold to outside investors at lower valuations than many of their investors had initially expected. Among them is the artificial intelligence company SwiftKey, purchased by Microsoft for a reported $250 million in a deal announced in February.Greg Marsh, Onefinestay\u2019s co-founder, though, dismissed such fears, saying that his company had several potential funding options before choosing to sell to AccorHotels.

{"Headline": "Intel to Cut 12,000 Jobs as PC Demand Plummets", "Date": "2016-04-19", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Intel, the world\u2019s largest maker of semiconductors, said on Tuesday that it was laying off 12,000 people, about 11 percent of its work force, as it continues to reel from a long downturn in global demand for personal computers.The company\u2019s chief executive, Brian Krzanich, announced the layoffs as part of a larger corporate restructuring, which will result in a $1.2 billion charge. Intel also reported lower-than-expected first-quarter earnings and reduced its projected revenue for the year.\u201cIntel has been known as the PC company,\u201d Mr. Krzanich said in an earnings call with Wall Street analysts. \u201cIt\u2019s time to make this transition and push the company all the way over\u201d to supplying chips for things like smartphones, cloud computing, sensors and other devices.Yet Intel still gets 60 percent of its revenue from chips supplied to PCs, and its profit margins there are not as good as in data center chips, its other major business. The company\u2019s other businesses have small profits, or else lose money.That means PCs are still core to what Intel does. Most of the layoffs, along with things like consolidating facilities and cut projects, are expected to be inside the PC business. Employees who are affected by the restructuring will be notified in the next 60 days, the company said. The layoffs are the largest since 2006, when the company let go 10,500 employees.\u201cThe hope was that PC demand, which has fallen for years, would be flat, and other segments would start filling in,\u201d said Mark Hung, an analyst with Gartner. \u201cThis threw a monkey wrench into that.\u201dFor the first quarter, Intel had net income of $2 billion, or 42 cents a share, and revenue of $13.7 billion. Wall Street analysts had projected that Intel would earn 47 cents a share on revenue of $13.8 billion, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters.Revenue at the PC group fell 14 percent from the previous quarter, indicating Intel had to cut prices as demand fell.Intel faces other potential stumbling blocks. The company is unique as much of the tech industry counts on it continually delivering chips with more transistors for the same money. The process, known as Moore\u2019s Law after Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, has generally happened in two-year intervals. The next generation of chips, however, is likely to arrive in two and a half years, or more, leading to fears that Moore\u2019s Law is slowing.Mr. Krzanich, who previously had played down the significance of his production schedule, took pains on Tuesday to say that Intel wanted to pick up its pace. \u201cWe are continuously striving to get back to two years,\u201d he said.Intel had better do so, Mr. Hung said. \u201cIts competitors don\u2019t seem to be slowing down,\u201d he said. \u201cThey may get to the next generation of chips at the same time as Intel. That would be unheard-of.\u201dBesides cutting its operating expenses by $700 million this year through the restructuring, Intel may be seeking to sell different types of chips in combined ways for better efficiency and profit.\u201cWe\u2019re moving from a company that was at the center of the PC market to being a company at the center of cloud computing,\u201d said Stacy Smith, Intel\u2019s chief financial officer.On Tuesday, Mr. Smith was named to run Intel\u2019s sales, manufacturing and operations, another indication of how Intel needs to tighten its relationship with a few big cloud companies, like Amazon and Microsoft.This would involve integrating the production and sale of things like chips for computer memory along with computer processors. The company also wants to build a business in connecting things like automobiles to cloud computing, and needs to build faster wireless computing technologies for that. Intel added that it would begin a search for a new chief financial officer.Advertisement"}

There, it plans to showcase autonomous shuttles, electric bikes and other green modes of transportation.The project will take 10 years to complete and consolidate some 30,000 employees now housed in 70 buildings, the company said.\u201cThis is more than an investment in new buildings,\u201d Mark Fields, Ford\u2019s chief executive, said in a webcast.Donna Inch, who heads Ford\u2019s real estate arm, said the company hoped that the interconnected campuses and new buildings with new open work spaces would spur innovation.\u201cThe whole idea is to think differently,\u201d Ms. Inch said in an interview.

Ford has budgeted $7.7 billion for capital costs this year and is projecting to increase that to $9 billion by around 2020, a spokesman said.The headquarters plan reflects a broader struggle by automakers to shed their Rust Belt images and recast themselves as nimble, high-growth companies, said Akshay Anand, an analyst at with the research firm Kelley Blue Book.It is a move that is aimed at investors and potential employees as much as consumers of the future, Mr. Anand said. \u201cFord is now saying, \u2018We want to be the place everybody is talking about when you\u2019re working in these fields.\u2019\u201dHenry Ford founded his car company in Detroit, but in 1917 began building a factory in Dearborn, his hometown.

Over several more years, it will be connected to a series of new and existing buildings. They will be linked to parking decks, soccer fields and a nearby arboretum.Together, the two campuses will serve as a showcase for the future, with autonomous vehicles ferrying executives around and other people riding electric bikes.All of the buildings will be designed to minimize energy use. One of them will demonstrate sustainability by generating more energy than it consumes. It will rely on solar power as well as geothermal power for heating and cooling, Ford said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Intuit Sheds Its PC Roots and Rises as a Cloud Software Company", "Date": "2016-04-10", "News": "Supported byBut Intuit decided to shed its PC roots and become a cloud software company. \u201cWe try to live up to being a 33-year-old start-up,\u201d Mr. Smith said. So the company faced a hard choice: \u201cDo we have this beautiful child that we\u2019ve had for 33 years that we know we\u2019re not going to feed, or do we find it a new home?\u201d\u201cI find that for people who\u2019ve never used any kind of accounting software, the ones I\u2019ve put on Xero are so happy with it,\u201d said Stacey L. Byrne, a certified public accountant in San Diego who works with both companies\u2019 products. \u201cThey sing its praises because it\u2019s so easy to use.\u201dIn Intuit\u2019s early days, that\u2019s what people said about Quicken and QuickBooks, which made concepts like cash flow, income and expenses, and balance sheets accessible to nonaccountants. But over time, the desktop PC versions of the software became more complicated, and Intuit treated the online versions as an afterthought.Xero, which started 10 years ago, saw an opening. Intuit essentially owned the market for small-business accounting software in the United States and Canada, but it had ignored the rest of the world. At the same time, the migration of data to the cloud and the rapid rise of smartphones were changing how small business owners, many of whom do not operate from offices, wanted to use technology.\u201cThis was a once-in-a-lifetime land grab to get this data off PCs and into the cloud,\u201d Rod Drury, Xero\u2019s chief executive and one of its founders, said via Skype from the company\u2019s headquarters in Wellington, New Zealand.Rather than build everything itself, Xero opened up its platform so that banks and financial app makers could plug their services into it, offering users the ability to customize Xero and offering partner companies the ability to strengthen ties with their customers. After establishing a strong foothold in New Zealand and Australia, Xero publicly sold shares in Australia in 2012, and it took its software to Britain and the United States.Intuit \u2014 and the accountants who relied on its software for so many years \u2014 took notice.\u201cFor so long it was QuickBooks, and that was pretty much it,\u201d Ms. Byrne said. \u201cRod Drury poked the bear. He woke up this sleeping giant.\u201dIntuit embarked on a crash overhaul of its neglected, decade-old QuickBooks Online product. The effort, code-named Harmony, resulted in a new version that, like Xero, was easy to use and open to different apps \u2014 even ones like PayPal and Square that competed with some of Intuit\u2019s own services. Intuit also began to push hard into some overseas markets, including Australia, the heart of Xero\u2019s territory.Mr. Smith said the decision to rebuild QuickBooks Online as an open platform was hotly debated within the company. But the company found that the average small-business owner used 16 to 20 apps, and it concluded that its software needed to accommodate those outside services.\u201cIf you have a competitor that you\u2019re afraid to let work with your product because it\u2019s better than your version of payroll or payments, then it\u2019s not if you\u2019ll get disrupted in the market, it\u2019s when,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to win in the open market.\u201dQuickBooks Online now connects with about 2,000 apps, and the company said that the open structure has increased customer retention and helped feed customers into the TurboTax side of the business.TurboTax and Intuit\u2019s traditional QuickBooks desktop software have provided a financial cushion for the company\u2019s strategic shift, and the divestiture of Quicken and some other businesses brought in about $500 million this year. But the pivot has not been easy.\u201cThey haven\u2019t actually been very successful in converting existing QuickBooks customers over to the online product,\u201d said Ross MacMillan, a software industry analyst with RBC Capital Markets. While he lauded the company\u2019s international efforts, \u201cit costs money to go into these new markets and you get less revenue per customer.\u201dXero, which last year sold $111 million in additional shares to the American venture capital firms Accel Partners and Matrix Capital, has established itself as a clear alternative to QuickBooks, especially in foreign markets. It now has more than 600,000 paying customers worldwide.Intuit\u2019s reinvention strategy is bearing fruit. In the quarter that ended on Jan. 31, the company finished with 1,257,000 subscribers to QuickBooks Online, up 49 percent from the previous year. At the same time, sales of the desktop software remained robust, and TurboTax gained market share. The company\u2019s overall revenue grew 23 percent.Intuit is also diversifying in related businesses, such as a loan marketplace that connects small businesses with lenders, with QuickBooks data supplementing traditional credit ratings. (Quicken Loans, a home mortgage lender that Intuit sold in 2002, is no longer affiliated with the company.)Analysts said Intuit\u2019s willingness to change course is one of its biggest strengths.\u201cWhenever Intuit makes a wrong turn, they quickly get off the gravel and back onto the blacktop,\u201d said Brent Thill, an analyst with UBS. \u201cThat\u2019s why the company has done so well for such a long time.\u201dHe noted that over a 10-year period, the returns on Intuit\u2019s stock have been larger and more consistent than for some other leaders in the industry, such as Microsoft or Oracle.Both Intuit and Xero are courting accountants to help them sell their wares, as they have great influence over the software used by their small-business clients. Although many accountants still prefer traditional desktop software, the companies argue that by moving online, accountants will save hours on bookkeeping and can spend more time providing business advice \u2014 or just getting out of the office.Ms. Byrne, a solo practitioner, said going to the cloud has definitely helped her live the lifestyle she wants. Last year, she went to eight baseball games in 12 days. Logging in to clients\u2019 accounts remotely from her laptop or iPad, she said, \u201cI worked the whole time.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve worked at 8,000 feet during summer family camp and at the beach on my iPhone,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cloud Services Show Their Value in Earnings Reports", "Date": "2016-04-29", "News": "Supported byBitsThe star of the show was Amazon Web Services, or AWS, that cloud business. Amazon breaks out that sector from the rest of its business, and it makes for impressive reading: Operating income as a percentage of sales for Amazon\u2019s retail business was 3 percent; for AWS it was 24 percent.AWS is still a relatively small part of the company\u2019s total business, but that outsize profitability is reshaping Amazon. Over all, the company\u2019s operating income is 3.6 percent of revenue, but that is up from 1.1 percent a year ago. A big reason is that AWS has doubled its profitability.Cloud computing makes a lot of money in part by automating things: A large data center, supplying potentially thousands of customers, may be run by just a half-dozen people. The people engineering these systems have become very clever about running them efficiently too, devising special semiconductors and software.Google and Facebook are also cloud-based companies, though for now they get most of their money from advertising.As we near the end of the tech earnings season, it is useful to look at net income earned per employee at the company. Microsoft had profits of about $32,200 per person in the quarter, a healthy performance considering how many employees it still has in older businesses. It came in just ahead of Goldman Sachs, on a profit per employee basis.There are two lessons from that: If you do sell retail products, it helps to sell highly profitable fetish objects, like iPhones \u2014 which, not incidentally, have a lot of value because of the cloud-based apps running on them.And if you are selling bargain retail, it\u2019s a very good idea to be in the cloud computing business, too.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Virtual Reality Check: Rating the HTC Vive and the Oculus Rift", "Date": "2016-04-05", "News": "Supported byTech FixSimilar to the Rift, the Vive \u2014 a joint development by the Taiwanese manufacturer HTC and the video game distribution company Valve \u2014 is a virtual reality headset that connects to a powerful computer.There are plenty of other differences, too. Here\u2019s how the Vive compares with the Rift.The Vive system includes a pair of motion controllers for interacting with objects in virtual reality and a camera embedded in the front of the headset that lets you peek into the real world. It also includes earbuds for sound and two base stations for detecting motion. The computer must be bought separately.In contrast, the Rift includes a Microsoft Xbox game controller and a remote control; the company delayed the release of its motion controllers until later this year. For sound, the Rift\u2019s headset has headphones built into the sides. An external camera is used to detect your body. A computer can be bought as part of a bundle or separately.HTC recommends a computer with a powerful graphics card, like Nvidia\u2019s GTX 970 or AMD\u2019s R9 290. It also recommends a powerful processor, such as Intel\u2019s i5-4590 or AMD\u2019s FX 8350. You will also need four gigabytes of RAM and two display ports.For the Rift, Oculus recommends a similar setup: a computer with the same Nvidia or AMD graphics card and Intel processor. It requires eight gigabytes of RAM and four USB ports.The Rift was released with about 30 games and a few apps. HTC said the Vive was released with about 50 games. The companies will regularly update their libraries with new apps and games.The main advantage of the HTC Vive headset is that it comes with motion controllers, which let you effectively reach out and grab objects in virtual reality. This kind of interaction feels much more natural for virtual reality than the game controller included with the Rift.Also, the Vive\u2019s motion-sensing base stations capture richer movements, enabling people to walk around in a larger space or crouch and grab something while using virtual reality; the Rift\u2019s camera can detect movements, too, but the Rift was primarily designed to be used while standing or sitting.Another benefit of the Vive is that the headset fits better. With the Rift, I could always see a small gap in the space beneath the nose. The Vive headset completely blocks the outside world. HTC also includes a piece of foam that can be inserted into the Vive for a better fit for a narrower face.But a major downside of the Vive is the setup, which is more demanding than the Rift\u2019s. HTC recommends that you drill mounts into the ceiling to install the motion-sensing base stations to ensure that the sensors have a clear line of sight with the headset and your body. In other words, to take full advantage of the Vive, you probably need to dedicate a room to virtual reality; to use the Rift, you can get away with clearing out a bit of standing space.The other obvious downside of the Vive is the higher cost. With a computer and accessories included in the total price, the Vive will cost roughly $300 more than the Rift. Then again, if you are willing to spend more than $1,000 for virtual reality, that extra $300 might not matter much.This is Year 1 of powerful and capable virtual reality systems coming to the mainstream. Over time, the content that will become available for these devices will define their worth. There isn\u2019t much to do with either system yet, and consumers would be wise to wait to see if any killer virtual reality apps or games emerge for the systems.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified the game shown.

{"Headline": "Twitter Gains Rights to Stream Thursday N.F.L. Games", "Date": "2016-04-05", "News": "Supported byLeave it to the N.F.L. to sell the same product three times.A decade ago, the league began showing Thursday night games on its fledgling NFL Network. Then CBS, and later NBC, agreed to pay the league hundreds of millions of dollars a year for the right to broadcast some of those games as well.The games shown on Twitter will be the CBS or NBC broadcasts, depending on which network is showing the game, and will include pre- and postgame highlights only available on Twitter. Twitter and the N.F.L. have not announced how the games will look on individual feeds.The partnership speaks volumes about the power of the country\u2019s most powerful sports league, which wants to expand its footprint overseas and reach younger consumers who may never pay for a cable or satellite package, or even own a television.It also illuminates the sharp-elbowed race to survive in Silicon Valley, where Twitter and other technology companies like Facebook, Amazon and Netflix are rushing to find ways to offer consumers must-see content everywhere and at any time. By joining a sports behemoth that garners the highest ratings in television, Twitter hopes to pump air back into its sagging fortunes.\u201cThey need to give people more reasons to come back to Twitter to get their info-of-the-day fix,\u201d said Eric Jackson, managing director of SpringOwl Asset Management and a close watcher of the company. \u201cIf these N.F.L. games go well, they can expand into other types of content and give users more reasons to spend more time on Twitter properties each day.\u201dMajor League Baseball, the N.B.A. and other sports leagues already stream national packages of games for $100 or more a season. But they, like the N.F.L., will be watching to see how fans consume games on their smartphones and tablets and whether the alliance with Twitter can generate profits.Even as the nation\u2019s largest sports league with $13 billion in annual revenue, the N.F.L. is trying to anticipate shifts in the media landscape. For decades, the league has relied on a tested model: Collect billions of dollars from television networks that broadcast games for free over the air, or from cable and satellite networks.Most of the league\u2019s television agreements with these networks expire in the next five years, so the N.F.L. wants to find new ways to market its games for the next generation of fans.\u201cThere are huge swaths of young people who never watch broadcast television,\u201d said Ed Desser, a sports media consultant. The streaming experiment \u201callows them to plan ahead.\u201dFor now, along with appearing on Twitter\u2019s mobile and desktop apps, the company said it will show games on video game consoles that use Twitter apps, such as Microsoft\u2019s Xbox.At the N.F.L.\u2019s annual meeting last month, league executives told team owners and executives that the biggest opportunities for new revenue would come from digital and international businesses. Selling the streaming rights to live games to Twitter appears to fill both of those categories, without upsetting CBS, NBC and other networks that pay dearly for media rights.To assuage them, Twitter will show the networks\u2019 ads. But to make money it will sell ads for the time normally reserved for local spots. This let Twitter pay less than it might have otherwise, and it will allow NBC and CBS to reach more viewers.\u201cThe attraction wasn\u2019t just revenue, it was a reach decision,\u201d said Joe Lockhart, a league spokesman. Other bidders, he added, had offered more money than Twitter.By signing a one-year deal with Twitter, the N.F.L. will retain the flexibility to look elsewhere for the long run.Roger Goodell, the N.F.L.\u2019s commissioner, announced the deal, appropriately enough, on his Twitter feed, his first Tweet in 19 months.The league might have had a receptive ear at Twitter. The company\u2019s chief financial officer, Anthony Noto, held the same position at the N.F.L. from February 2008 to October 2010.The move is a significant strategic shift for Twitter, which last month celebrated its 10th anniversary. While Twitter has grown to hundreds of millions of regular users, for years the company has been on a quest to boost its slowing growth by making significant changes to the product and by spending millions in marketing campaigns.So far, little has helped. Twitter user growth was flat at the end of 2015, compared to the third quarter of the year, at 320 million monthly visitors.\u201cWe wanted to focus on what we do best,\u201d Noto said, explaining the sports push. For Twitter, he added, that focus was \u201clive\u201d content.The league experimented with live-streaming last season when Yahoo paid about $20 million for the rights to show a Buffalo Bills-Jacksonville Jaguars game played in London in October. In a sop to its broadcast partners and fans, the Bills-Jaguars game was still shown on television in the Buffalo and Jacksonville markets.But streaming games free to the more than 180 countries where Twitter is available might attract fans in places where the N.F.L. does not have major broadcast partners.But according to one mathematical conversion that Yahoo disputes, the 15.2 million unique users for the Bills-Jaguars game amounts to the television equivalent of 2.36 million average viewers, about 1.6 million of whom were in the United States.Still, Twitter hopes that the magnetism of the N.F.L. provides them with a sorely needed boost.\u201cThis to me is much more about publicity and marketing for Twitter than selling ads,\u201d said Richard Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG Research.Advertisement"}

While this means putting more of ourselves inside the machine, Google argues that its method is more efficient.The product, called Goals, works like this: Inside the online calendar, people choose from a menu of goals like \u201cexercise,\u201d \u201cme time\u201d or \u201cskill building.\u201d The software then asks for some specifics, like how often a person wants to run, for what duration and typically when in the day.It then scours the white spaces in a calendar for possible times and maps out a schedule, filling those times with the desired aspiration. Afterward, the goal can be marked completed or not, which helps the algorithm work out a better schedule over time.Along with Goals, Google is introducing a calendar feature that enables two people in the same company to find mutually convenient meeting times, by enabling a software \u201cagent\u201d to scour both datebooks and pick an optimal time.Not coincidentally, Google\u2019s calendar features are something of a riposte to competitors like Apple, Microsoft and Facebook, which have been getting into the life management business.Presumably, friends\u2019 encouragement programs people to stay with a goal. Artificial intelligence, or A.I., software that behaves socially aims to do the same.Sherry Turkle, who studies the social effects of technology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the Google calendar software appeared to be a promising alternative to the more seemingly \u201chuman\u201d software agents, which she worries can diminish authentic human interactions.\u201cToo often we\u2019re cheap dates that fall for programs that pretend to know us, or ask about our emotional states,\u201d Ms. Turkle said. \u201cThis is harnessing the calendar to make an aspiration real. Of all the applications of a computer dialogue that have been thrown at me lately, this seems good.\u201dMr. Ariely is a professor of psychology and behavioral economics at Duke University and the author of \u201cPredictably Irrational,\u201d a book about why people do things like overpaying and procrastinating. Last year Google bought Timeful, a scheduling company where he worked.Google, which is increasingly trying to move from Internet search and advertising company to a more general provider of A.I.-type software, says its technology already sorts email into high- and low-priority items and weeds out the junk. Unfortunately, this appears to have freed up time to send more work email.\u201cEmail shows up and says, \u2018Answer me!\u2019\u201d Mr. Ariely said. \u201cUnfortunately, time for thinking does not do that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Viswanathan worked on five previous services that tried to connect people, three of them with Mr. Lau, but Down to Lunch was the first to catch on.The San Francisco start-up has needed little capital so far, and the founders have turned away dozens of potential investors.

Down to Lunch is designed to allow communications only between people who know each other and have each other\u2019s phone number.Kirsta Melton, who heads the human trafficking division of the Texas attorney general\u2019s office, said that she looked into the app and found no evidence supporting the allegations.\u201cUnless you have random strangers in your address book or someone stole your phone, it\u2019s unlikely that this app could be used for human trafficking,\u201d she said.It\u2019s not clear who is behind the smear campaign, although Mr. Viswanathan and Mr. Lau believe it might be a competitor. They traced the accusations back to several Twitter accounts. Twitter temporarily suspended one account and appears to have blocked offending tweets from others. Apple and Google have also removed app-store reviews that mention the trafficking allegations.But that has not stopped worried users from contacting Mr. Viswanathan or Mr. Lau or simply deleting the app. Mr. Viswanathan said one school administrator even called him about it.Despite the damage the trafficking accusations have caused, there is no question that Down to Lunch has struck a chord with young people. After the app appeared on the University of Notre Dame\u2019s campus, for example, 15 percent of the student body downloaded it within 12 hours, Mr. Viswanathan said.Aakash Malhotra, a freshman at the University of Georgia who downloaded the app last September, said it helped him build friendships on campus. \u201cWe have enough apps on our phone that give us information or entertain us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019d rather have an app to help us connect in person.\u201dUntil February, Mr. Viswanathan and Mr. Lau were the only employees. The six-person company still operates from the loft-style apartment that the founders share in San Francisco\u2019s South of Market neighborhood.Whiteboards cover one wall, laying out the top tasks for the day and week. Mash notes from fans are posted as inspiration. Leaky takeout containers have colonized the kitchen, and Mr. Lau often stashes McDonald\u2019s breakfast burritos in the refrigerator to fuel marathon coding sessions.Mr. Viswanathan, 28, interned at Microsoft, Google and Facebook, where he sat right outside the glass-walled office of Mark Zuckerberg, the co-founder and chief executive, and occasionally played chess with him.Mr. Lau, 26, was an engineering intern at LinkedIn. When the job wound down, LinkedIn\u2019s chairman and co-founder, Reid Hoffman, personally implored him to stay. Mr. Lau declined and later went to Pinterest.While the pair has not been shy about tapping their networks for help, they have eschewed most of the usual marketing tactics for a start-up.And in an industry where an investment from a top venture capitalist confers immediate credibility, \u201cthey\u2019ve been pushing everyone away, even the who\u2019s who of investing,\u201d said Cameron Teitelman, the chief executive of StartX, a nonprofit for Stanford entrepreneurs that has helped the company.Mr. Lau explained, \u201cIf we take time out to raise money, that\u2019s time we\u2019re not working on the product. That\u2019s time that users can\u2019t talk to us. That\u2019s time that we\u2019re not keeping servers up.\u201dThe founders and their small team have instead focused on improving the app. When they have a new version to test, they drive across the Bay Bridge to the University of California, Berkeley, to get feedback from students.They try to respond personally to the thousands of messages they get from users every week. At one point, Mr. Viswanathan was getting so many texts that his iPhone\u2019s messaging app froze. The problem stumped even Apple\u2019s V.I.P. support team, which got involved after Mr. Viswanathan emailed Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, for help.The founders are also wrestling with a question faced by developers everywhere: How hard do you push your users to recruit friends to download your app?Last week, they added a button that allowed people to invite all of their contacts with one click. But many people consider such requests to be spam, and Twitter was already filled with complaints from people who received unwanted Down to Lunch invitations.After a couple of days, the pair decided to disable the mass-invitation feature.Although their lives are stressful, the founders say they are having a blast.\u201cWe know we can build something that improves the lives for every single person on the planet,\u201d Mr. Viswanathan said. \u201cIt sounds kind of crazy, but we\u2019re going to do it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Europe Tried to Rein In Google. It Backfired.", "Date": "2016-04-18", "News": "Supported byBut a landmark court ruling intended to rein in Google has instead put it at the forefront of Europe\u2019s enforcement of Internet privacy. That has upended conventional wisdom about the company and raised questions about the role of commercial interests in protecting people\u2019s privacy, often with little or no transparency.Google\u2019s total number of privacy-related judgments is double those of most of Europe\u2019s biggest individual national authorities over the same period, even though these public agencies address a wider range of data protection complaints.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.Less than 1 percent of Google\u2019s decisions are appealed to Europe\u2019s privacy authorities, according to the regulators\u2019 statistics, and those authorities said they generally ruled in the company\u2019s favor.But several individuals who sent requests to Google told The New York Times that the lack of detail over how these decisions were made left them frustrated and, in some cases, angry that a company adjudicated on such delicate matters. These people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to publicize their own privacy cases.\u201cIf governments were handling \u2018right to be forgotten,\u2019 they would have to publish data,\u201d said Martin Husovec, a professor at the Tilburg Institute for Law, Technology, and Society in the Netherlands, and a signatory of the open letter to Google. \u201cBut with Google, we can\u2019t see what\u2019s happening behind the company\u2019s closed doors.\u201dAfter Europe\u2019s highest court ruled in May 2014 that people with connections to the Continent could ask search engines like Google and Microsoft\u2019s Bing to remove links about themselves from online search results, the companies were handed the power to decide which of these requests were legitimate. Citing European privacy rules, the European Court of Justice mandated that search engines, and not a public body, should be the first port of call for the decisions. Europe\u2019s top court did not require that companies make their decision-making process open to public scrutiny.People\u2019s privacy requests must relate to online information, like personal circumstances or a past criminal conviction, that is no longer relevant or not in the public interest, definitions that privacy lawyers say are inherently fuzzy.Thus far, that has mostly involved people demanding mundane information like phone numbers or addresses be removed from links to online directories (the largest collective group of sites affected). Individuals have also requested that links to references about themselves on social media, including Facebook, be taken down.All the talk about data privacy can get caught up in political wrangling. But the different approaches have practical consequences for people, too.Though Google would not comment publicly about the review process, two company executives gave some detail on how decisions were made. They spoke to The Times on the condition they not be named.Typically, requests are sent to Google\u2019s legal team. Straightforward rulings, like those that involve a public figure who cannot legally apply for links to be removed, are handled by junior staff members. Tougher decisions are referred to senior lawyers who must weigh an individual\u2019s privacy against the public\u2019s right to information, the company officials said.When Google\u2019s team accepts a request, it informs an individual that the privacy demand has been successful, while also notifying the website that links to certain European search results have been removed. The website cannot appeal the decision. If Google refuses the request, the company must tell an individual that the decision can be appealed, but does not specifically explain why the submission failed.Some European officials remain wary of handing Google the power to make privacy decisions, though they declined to comment publicly on the court-mandated privacy process. But regulators acknowledge that the company\u2019s system \u2014 which has so far dealt with removal requests for 1.4 million links \u2014 has proved surprisingly straightforward. Some officials also remain satisfied that Google makes these initial privacy rulings despite a lack of openness over how decisions are made.\u201cWhen it comes to appeals, we agree with Google most of the time,\u201d said Mathias Moulin, a deputy director at the Commission National de l\u2019Informatique et des Libert\u00e9s, the French privacy authority.This muted official response \u2014 from both European regulators and politicians \u2014 is partly because agencies lack the financial, technical and human resources to handle the substantial influx of \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d requests, according to regulatory officials and legal experts.Still, for privacy campaigners and some regulators, Google\u2019s regulatory track record remains outweighed by Europe\u2019s effectively handing the policing of one of its fundamental rights to a for-profit company.\u201cIs Google the right entity to have such power over these decisions?\u201d said Johannes Caspar, supervisor at the Hamburg data protection authority, the primary regulator in Germany that oversees American tech companies such as Alphabet, the parent company of Google, and Facebook. \u201cWe have to live by European law, and that says Google must decide.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Law enforcement often does not want to tip off a target, or someone\u2019s life could be put at risk if certain information is revealed.Microsoft argues, however, that law enforcement is overdoing it with its gag orders and unfairly depriving the company of its right to be transparent with its customers.The case could wind its way through the courts for years.

Later, writers had to find paper and a typewriter, or a laptop or desktop computer, to get busy with their storytelling.Nowadays, they can write into a smartphone and tablet app almost anywhere when an idea seizes them. So what are some of the popular apps for scribes?To help build a novel, Storyist provides different types of \u201cstory sheets\u201d to work on. You can use the sheets to note information about characters, plot points, scene settings and other details. This part of the app is surprisingly powerful, and I have found that the preformatted sections of the story sheets (for example, the Smells heading under the Settings story sheet) help me think about characters and scene settings.The app\u2019s cleverest feature is its \u201cfocus mode,\u201d which fades out everything else in your document other than the line or paragraph you\u2019re working on. This works similarly to how your eyes stay focused on the words you have just typed on the paper when using a traditional typewriter.

{"Headline": "Microsoft Sues Justice Department to Protest Electronic Gag Order Statute", "Date": "2016-04-14", "News": "Supported byBig technology companies have usually played a defensive game with government prosecutors in their legal fight over customer information, fighting or bowing to requests for information one case at a time.But now, in a move that could broaden the debate over the balance between customer privacy and law enforcement needs, Microsoft is going on the offense.The software giant is suing the Justice Department, challenging its frequent use of secrecy orders that prevent Microsoft from telling people when the government obtains a warrant to read their emails.In its suit, filed Thursday morning in Federal District Court in Seattle, Microsoft\u2019s home turf, the company asserts that the gag order statute in the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 \u2014 as employed today by federal prosecutors and the courts \u2014 is unconstitutional.The statute, according to Microsoft, violates the Fourth Amendment right of its customers to know if the government searches or seizes their property, and it breaches the company\u2019s First Amendment right to speak to its customers.Microsoft\u2019s suit, unlike Apple\u2019s fight with the Federal Bureau of Investigation over access to a locked iPhone, is not attached to a single case. Instead, it is intended to challenge the legal process regarding secrecy orders.The company is also trying to fuel a public debate about the frequent use of secrecy orders in government investigations and, in the process, portray itself as an advocate of its customers\u2019 privacy. The suit itself could plod through the courts, with appeals going on for months or even years.Emily Pierce, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, said officials were \u201creviewing the filing.\u201dMicrosoft is drawing attention to legal issues that have become more acute as tech companies move their customers\u2019 personal and business information into so-called cloud computing systems. The largest such digital storehouses of personal email and documents are operated by big tech companies like Microsoft, Google and Apple.Seizing information from file drawers or personal computers used to require entering a building to examine paper or a hard drive. Typically, the target of an investigation knew about it.Not so in the cloud computing era, when investigators can bypass an individual and go straight to the company that hosts that information. And when courts issue secrecy orders, often with no time limit, a target may never know that information was taken.Microsoft, in its suit, contends that the government has \u201cexploited the transition to cloud computing as a means of expanding its power to conduct secret investigations.\u201dIn an interview, Bradford L. Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president and chief legal officer, said, \u201cPeople should not lose their rights just because they are storing their information in the cloud.\u201dMicrosoft, like Google and Apple, fields thousands of requests a year from federal and state prosecutors for customer information. The companies issue periodic reports with the totals.But, Mr. Smith said, it was the rising portion of gag orders attached to the information warrants that led to the suit. From September 2014 to March 2016, Microsoft received 5,624 federal demands in the United States for customer information or data. Nearly half \u2014 2,576 \u2014 were accompanied by secrecy orders.Mr. Smith called the growing share of secrecy orders \u201cfairly shocking,\u201d suggesting they had become a routine process rather than an exception.The suit positions Microsoft as a champion of its customers\u2019 privacy and draws attention to a legal process many may not be aware of.\u201cMost people do think of their email as their personal property, wherever it happens to reside,\u201d said A. Michael Froomkin, a law professor at the University of Miami. \u201cBut there is a disconnect between behavior and expectations and the statute. And Microsoft is inviting a court to bring the law in line with people\u2019s expectations.\u201dBeyond image-burnishing, the suit is a pragmatic attempt to move away from litigating cases one by one, which is costly and time-consuming.\u201cMicrosoft is going on offense, but they\u2019re kind of forced into it,\u201d Mr. Froomkin said.Judges grant the secrecy orders. Microsoft sees only the warrant for the information demanded and not the argument made by the prosecutors to justify a gag order. But the Microsoft legal team looked at the high percentage of secrecy orders granted in the year and a half through March of this year, and concluded that prosecutors often relied on a vague standard that there was a \u201creason to believe\u201d that disclosure might hinder an investigation.Microsoft, Mr. Smith said, \u201creadily recognizes that nondisclosure orders are appropriate and necessary\u201d when there is a risk of endangering a person\u2019s life or that crucial evidence may be destroyed, for example. \u201cWhat concerns us is the low standard the government has to bear and the absence of a time limit,\u201d Mr. Smith added.About two-thirds of the secrecy orders Microsoft received in the span it audited had no time limits. In the physical world, so-called sneak-and-peek warrants for secret searches are granted to look at documents without notifying a target. But most secrecy orders delay notification for a fixed period of time, typically 30 to 90 days, and detailed evidence is required for any extensions.Microsoft, Mr. Smith said, has talked to other major tech companies, and others may join with briefs in support of Microsoft.In addition to challenging the Justice Department and the courts, Microsoft is trying to prod Congress into looking at the issue. In both the House of Representatives and the Senate, legislation has been proposed to reform the Electronic Communications Privacy Act. But Mr. Smith said he saw little prospect of any substantive action in Congress anytime soon.\u201cWe\u2019ll keep taking these ideas to the Justice Department, Congress and the courts,\u201d Mr. Smith said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Behind Fake Degrees From Pakistan, a Maze of Deceit and a Case in Peril", "Date": "2016-04-10", "News": "Supported byFourteen Axact employees, including the chief executive, await trial on charges of fraud, extortion and money laundering. Bank accounts in Pakistan and the United States have been frozen. Investigators have uncovered a tangled web of corporate entities \u2014 dozens of shell companies and associates, from Caribbean tax havens to others in Delaware, Dubai and Singapore \u2014 used to funnel illicit earnings back to Pakistan.New details suggest that Axact\u2019s fraud empire, already considered one of the biggest Internet scams on record, is bigger than initially imagined. Over the past decade, Axact took money from at least 215,000 people in 197 countries \u2014 one-third of them from the United States. Sales agents wielded threats and false promises and impersonated government officials, earning the company at least $89 million in its final year of operation.The case against Axact, which at first seemed a rare instance in which tycoons with powerful connections were being held to criminal account, has increasingly appeared in recent months to be in jeopardy.The leading prosecutor quit with little explanation, hinting that he had come under political pressure to soft-pedal the case. A trial date for the company\u2019s executives has not been set, and several judges have dropped out of the case. Some media analysts, noting that Axact\u2019s jailed chief executive, Shoaib Ahmed Shaikh, has publicly boasted of his work for the Pakistani military, speculate that his powerful connections may yet work in his favor.\u201cThere\u2019s been a huge amount of speculation and analysis and deep-throated conspiracy theories,\u201d said Hasan Zaidi, a filmmaker and media analyst based in Karachi.\u201cInitially, there was a lot of surprise that Axact\u2019s operations were being tackled so quickly, particularly given the view that it was being backed by the boys,\u201d he added, using a common euphemism for the military\u2019s Inter-Services Intelligence spy agency. \u201cBut now the interest has died down, and I don\u2019t think it will ever be solved \u2014 even through a court case.\u201dAxact had been in business for nearly 10 years at the time of the arrests in May, and the company and its founder appeared ever more eager to step into the public spotlight, seemingly unconcerned about the risk. Most prominently, Axact was preparing to introduce Bol, a television network with 2,200 employees that had started test transmissions in the days before the police raids.Comparing himself to Microsoft\u2019s Bill Gates, Mr. Shaikh had touted Axact as Pakistan\u2019s leading software exporter. He laid out an ambitious plan to provide education for millions of Pakistani children, and he wreathed himself in patriotism: In the corner of his office, near a passage leading to a bedroom and a private swimming pool, the eagle-crested Axact company flag stood alongside a furled Pakistani standard.Once the police investigation began, Mr. Shaikh instructed subordinates to burn company documents at a vacant lot and to destroy computer drives, some of which were later cast into the sea, another executive testified to the police.But Mr. Shaikh could not prevent the seizure of a vast trove of data, some recovered from computer disks as they were being deleted, that led investigators to conclude that Axact\u2019s main business was providing fake degrees.The police found more than one million blank educational certificates and evidence of 300 fictitious educational websites, many with American-sounding names like Columbiana and Brooklyn Park, that sold fake degrees to hundreds of thousands of people around the world. Some knowingly bought effortless degrees to pad r\u00e9sum\u00e9s or to help in immigration, and a handful have been publicly embarrassed.Many other customers, investigators quickly realized, had fallen victim to an elaborate and aggressive fraud, going to Axact-run websites for a legitimate online education only to be intimidated into making ever larger payments.Hundreds of hours of taped phone conversations, extracted from Axact servers and cited by prosecutors, showed sales agents impersonating American lawyers or State Department officials in an effort to collect more money from customers, mostly in the Middle East.In one recording from 2014, Riaz Ahmed Shaikh, a Pakistani living in Abu Dhabi, pleaded for respite from \u201cJacob\u201d \u2014 a man who he believed was calling from the legal office of a university in California but was in fact an Axact sales agent in Karachi, according to police records.\u201cPlease, please, Mr. Jacob,\u201d said Mr. Shaikh, who said he had already paid $150,000 to Axact. \u201cI have sold all of my assets to pay this last amount. I am not eating well. I am not sleeping well.\u201d\u201cLook, you\u2019re not paying that much,\u201d the sales agent cajoled, before holding out a threat of possible police action. \u201cJust another $10,000.\u201dAxact executives took extraordinary measures to disguise their links to fraud. In a lawsuit in the United States, in which former customers of the online Belford High School were seeking damages, Axact officials persuaded an attendant in the company\u2019s cafeteria to pose as the founder of the school, a police report said.The worker, Salem Kureshi, conducted a webcam video deposition in 2011 for the American court. In it, he merely moved his lips while, off camera, an Axact official voiced a set of evasive answers for the American lawyers, Mr. Kureshi told the police.After the police raided Axact last year, Mr. Kureshi added, executives paid him $250 to go into hiding in his hometown, 700 miles from Karachi.In Pakistan, the plight of Axact\u2019s victims has been largely overshadowed by the media furor surrounding the Bol network, which had hired some of the country\u2019s most prominent journalists before it closed. With their salaries suddenly cut off, many employees took to the streets to protest, saying Axact was the victim of a conspiracy by rival news organizations.Shoaib Ahmed Shaikh insists that he earned his wealth through legitimate software exports. He has hired Shaukat Hayat, a lawyer whose client list includes Pervez Musharraf, the former Pakistan president, to defend him.In a telephone interview, Mr. Hayat said the case against Mr. Shaikh and his fellow executives had been cooked up by the news media. \u201cThey have not committed any illegal action,\u201d he said.Mr. Shaikh also faces scrutiny from American investigators. In a letter to the Pakistani authorities in February, United States officials said the F.B.I. had identified Axact as a \u201cdiploma mill\u201d that operated a \u201cworldwide web of shell companies and associates.\u201d Three of the main shell companies, registered in Delaware, were found to have been owned by Mr. Shaikh or his associates, the letter said.Other company documents point to shell holdings in the British Virgin Islands, Cyprus, Dubai and Panama. In several instances, Mr. Shaikh appears to have used a pseudonym, Ryan Jones, to sign company documents. He became a citizen of St. Kitts and Nevis, a small Caribbean island that sells passports to rich investors.In the Belford case, lawyers have obtained a court order freezing three American bank accounts containing $675,000. In a sworn statement, Mr. Shaikh admitted ownership of some of those accounts.His sister, Uzma Shaheen, who lives in Chicago, has been called to testify. Documents filed in court show that Ms. Shaheen transferred more than $37 million from American bank accounts to Axact in Pakistan in recent years.Still, much of Axact\u2019s global network remains undisrupted. It controls 32 other bank accounts \u2014 in the United States, Ireland, Dubai, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Belize, and Singapore \u2014 that are thought to contain millions of dollars, according to prosecution documents.And in Pakistan, the case has run into quicksand. Two judges have recused themselves without explanation; so has Zahid Jamil, an ambitious prosecutor who built much of the case against Axact but quit abruptly in February, citing unspecified circumstances \u201cthat make it impossible for me to proceed further.\u201dContacted by phone, Mr. Jamil declined to comment.Nighat Dad of the Digital Rights Foundation, an Internet advocacy group in Pakistan, said the Axact case showed that good laws also needed political will if they were to succeed.\u201cIf the evidence is so clear, and there is so much of it, then why is the case against Axact taking so long?\u201d she asked. \u201cSomething must be happening behind closed doors.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The reason is her r\u00e9sum\u00e9: Nearly 30 years before she worked for foreign companies in China, Ms. Chen served a stint in the Chinese military. After that, she was involved in a joint venture that was partly owned by the country\u2019s powerful domestic security ministry.Like many foreign-owned Internet services, Twitter has long been blocked in China. But Ms. Chen\u2019s appointment \u2014 and the stir it has caused \u2014 shows the complicated relationship between Twitter, the technology industry and China. The country has some of the world\u2019s strictest limits on online expression, and it requires Internet companies to place servers in the mainland. It has shown little compunction about blocking or banning companies that will not play along.Twitter has become an online home to a number of Chinese political activists abroad, who use it to communicate with one another and to share their views of current events in China with the world. Some of them reacted with condemnation over the weekend to Ms. Chen\u2019s appointment.In a statement, Dickson Seow, a Twitter spokesman, said that after college in the late 1980s, Ms. Chen was assigned by the Chinese government to become a junior engineer in the People\u2019s Liberation Army. She left in 1994, when the opening of the Chinese economy provided a chance, the statement said.She then was hired by Computer Associates, an American company, to lead its joint venture in China. The Chinese Ministry of Public Security owned a 20 percent stake in that venture through a local company, the statement said, and Ms. Chen focused on selling antivirus products and never worked for the ministry itself. According to her LinkedIn biography, she worked for Microsoft from 2005 to 2009 and for Cisco from 2009 to 2013, before returning to Microsoft.Advertisement"}

Their causes, such as clean water, sanitation and health, are spawning a new ecosystem of global health care companies, research institutes and academic expertise at places like the University of Washington.\u201cThe fact that we are physically located in Seattle has had an effect on us, and on the local community,\u201d said David Bley, the director of the Gates Foundation\u2019s Pacific Northwest Initiative, which works on issues of poverty, homelessness and education. \u201cA lot of both nonprofits or university-based efforts have grown with great momentum since our inception.\u201dIn addition, there are growing networks of second-generation, nonprofit leaders who were schooled at the Gates Foundation or Allen Institute, and have now filtered out to form a kind of self-reinforcing army. Seattle is first in the nation in private foundation revenue per capita, according to the Urban Institute, with two and a half times the amount of the No. 2 city, San Francisco, where philanthropic technology wealth has also soared.This is just a small part of the wave of money that is washing through Seattle and other tech cities these days, as companies like Amazon, the online retail giant, expand with new facilities and armies of engineers, software composers and deal makers.\u201cIt\u2019s in large part due to these partnerships,\u201d said Greg Allgood, the group\u2019s vice president for water.Another group called PATH, started in Seattle in the mid-1970s to work on family planning, has become \u2014 with the Gates Foundation providing half its budget \u2014 one of the world\u2019s biggest nonprofit developers of vaccines, medical devices and treatments. The company has 450 employees in Seattle, including 100 hired in the last year.And the reach of these post-Microsoft ambitions is still growing. Mr. Allen has charged his Allen Institute for Cell Science with creating an animated virtual model of human cells which would then be donated to the scientific community. Last month, Mr. Allen announced a global initiative called Frontiers Group to search for breakthrough ideas in bioscience \u2013 and then committed $100 million to support the best ideas.An important part of how nonprofit science works here, Mr. Allen said, is its concentration in the South Lake Union area, where The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, the Center for Infectious Disease Research and the neighboring University of Washington have provided a foundation in health science expertise that Mr. Gates and Mr. Allen later built on.\u201cThe neighborhood already had a long history of innovation,\u201d Mr. Allen said in an email. \u201cIn the early 20th century, Bill Boeing tested seaplanes off the lake, and Henry Ford built a Model T assembly line there. Today what we\u2019re doing in South Lake Union is taking on some of the challenges of the 21st century,\u201d he added. \u201cI believe this proximity breeds serendipity, and expect that great ideas will continue to emerge from South Lake Union.\u201dTime has also multiplied those effects, through a second generation of nonprofit workers who were trained at places like the Gates Foundation, which has more than 1,100 employees in Seattle.\u201cThese big philanthropies are changing the city and the region by bringing people in, and so being another magnet for talent,\u201d said Margaret O\u2019Mara, an associate professor of history at the University of Washington who studies modern capitalism and urban affairs.Philanthropies of Seattle\u2019s stripe also need different skills, Ms. O\u2019Mara said, in science, medicine and international affairs \u2014 not just tech workers and engineers. The third factor, she added, is that people move here and stay, further pushing out the wave of ripples. \u201cWhen Seattle gets people, it tends to keep them,\u201d she said.Still, there has at times been a steep learning curve for players in this new philanthropic arena.When a prototype for Cascade Designs\u2019s water purifier was sent to Kenya a few years ago for testing, for example, designers built the units in black. For the U.S. military and outdoor community the company served, black was \u201csexy and sleek,\u201d said Martin Maisonpierre, Cascade\u2019s communication director. The Kenyans, however, from a different cultural perspective, reacted badly.\u201c\u2018Why is it the color of death?\u2019\u201d Mr. Maisonpierre said, quoting the testers.So after a gasp at the misunderstanding and trip back to the drawing board, the next generation of water purifiers became cool and culturally neutral blue.Advertisement"}

Says It Needs Hackers to Keep Up With Tech Companies", "Date": "2016-04-19", "News": "Supported byAmy Hess, the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s executive assistant director for science and technology, made the comments at a hearing by members of Congress who are debating potential legislation on encryption. The lawmakers gathered law enforcement authorities and Silicon Valley company executives to discuss the issue, which has divided technology companies and officials in recent months and spurred a debate over privacy and security.Yet that has done little to quell the controversy. The encryption debate has continued with new hearings, proposed legislation and other cases that involve locked iPhones and law enforcement demands that the devices be opened to aid investigations.In Tuesday\u2019s hearing, Ms. Hess did not provide details on how the F.B.I. ultimately gained access to the San Bernardino iPhone but said the agency had come to rely on private sector partners to keep up with changes in technology. She said that there was no one-stop solution and that the agency generally should not use third parties to hack into systems but lacks the expertise to break past encryption.\u201cThese types of solutions that we may employ require a lot of highly skilled, specialized resources that we may not have immediately available to us,\u201d Ms. Hess said.The focus on third parties at the hearing illustrates a growing discomfort by some in Congress and in the tech industry with the use of \u201cgray hat\u201d hackers, who are hackers who may push the boundaries of the law and anger companies but whose intentions are not malicious.\u201cI don\u2019t think relying on a third party is a good model,\u201d said Representative Diana DeGette, a Democrat from Colorado. She questioned if the use of third-party hackers was ethical and whether it could open up greater security risks because sensitive and valuable data could be accessible to outside groups.Ms. Hess did not answer directly when asked about whether there were ethical issues in using third-party hackers but said the bureau needed to review its operation \u201cto make sure that we identify the risks and benefits.\u201d The F.B.I. has been unwilling to say whom it paid to demonstrate a way around the iPhone\u2019s internal defenses, or how much, and it has not shown Apple the technique.Apple\u2019s general counsel, Bruce Sewell, said at the hearing that encryption did not prevent the authorities from solving crimes.\u201cAs you heard from our colleagues in law enforcement, they have the perception that encryption walls off information to them,\u201d Mr. Sewell said. \u201cBut technologists and national security experts don\u2019t see the world that way. We see a data-rich world that seems to be full of information. Information that law enforcement can use to solve \u2014 and prevent \u2014 crimes.\u201dLaw enforcement officials testifying before the committee on Tuesday expressed frustration over their inability to run a number of cases to ground \u2014 particularly sex abuse and child pornography cases \u2014 because of encrypted phones. They said the recent publicity over the issue could end up helping criminals.\u201cMake no mistake \u2014 criminals are listening to this testimony and learning from it,\u201d said Charles Cohen, commander of the Indiana Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force.The F.B.I. said there has been an increase in the number of devices it has acquired through investigations but was unable to gain access to because of encryption. Ms. Hess said that since October, 13 percent of the devices obtained by the F.B.I. were impenetrable by the agency. When asked at Tuesday\u2019s hearing if the relationship between the tech industry and law enforcement had become adversarial, Ms. Hess responded, \u201cI hope not.\u201dTech companies, which have largely banded together in support of Apple\u2019s pro-encryption position, are lobbying against the draft bill.Timed to the Tuesday hearing, trade groups representing top technology companies including Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft sent a letter to Senators Burr and Feinstein, opposing their bill.\u201cWe believe it is critical to the safety of the nation\u2019s, and the world\u2019s, information technology infrastructure for us all to avoid actions that will create government-mandated security vulnerabilities in our encryption systems,\u201d the groups, which include the Reform Government Surveillance and Computer and Communications Industry Association, said. \u201cAny mandatory decryption requirement, such as that included in the discussion draft of the bill that you authored, will to lead to unintended consequences.\u201dMichael Petricone, senior vice president for government affairs at the Consumer Technology Association, added, \u201cThis is urgent because the one thing you don\u2019t want is Congress coming in a knee-jerk fashion and doing something with all sorts of negative consequences, which is what we may be seeing happen now.\u201dPresident Obama has done little to assuage concerns by the tech industry. In a speech in March, the president warned against \u201cfetishizing\u201d encryption and urged more compromise between tech companies and the F.B.I.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google\u2019s Antitrust Woes in Europe Are Likely to Grow", "Date": "2016-04-19", "News": "Supported byGoogle\u2019s antitrust problems in Europe are about to get a whole lot bigger.The company is expected to be charged with breaking the European Union\u2019s competition rules by unfairly favoring Google services, like its search engine and Google Maps, on its Android smartphone operating system over those of rivals, according to three people. The three, who work in either government or the private sector, spoke on the condition of anonymity.The charges, known formally as a statement of objections, may be announced in Brussels as soon as Wednesday, though the announcement could still be postponed until later this month, according to one of the people.The expected charges against Google are the latest in a raft of regulatory problems that American tech giants have faced as the European Union has cracked down on these companies\u2019 perceived dominance over how people in the 28-member bloc get access to digital services.Google denies that it has breached the region\u2019s tough competition laws, and it will have several months to respond to the charges from the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union.\u201cAnyone can use Android with or without Google applications,\u201d Mark Jansen, a Google spokesman, said in a statement when asked about the company\u2019s mobile software. \u201cHardware manufacturers and carriers can decide how to use Android, and consumers have the last word about which apps they want to use on their devices.\u201dA spokesman for the European Commission declined to comment.Despite the company\u2019s denials, the expected charges linked to Android, which powers 77 percent of European smartphones, would represent a major setback for the Silicon Valley company as it grapples with a growing number of global competition investigations into Google\u2019s vast operations.Canadian authorities, though, said on Tuesday that they had closed their investigation into claims that Google had misused its dominant position in online search. They added they would continue monitoring the company\u2019s activities.Apple continues to generate the largest share of revenue from global smartphone sales. The company also bundles its own services, including digital maps, into its mobile software, but has yet to face similar questions over whether it has broken Europe\u2019s antitrust rules.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.If European officials demand that the company provide rivals greater access to the Android universe \u2014 a possibility if Google is found to have broken the region\u2019s laws \u2014 the search giant may find it more difficult to promote its own mobile services to users worldwide as well as to smartphone makers.As part of the charges to be announced as soon as Wednesday, Margrethe Vestager, Europe\u2019s antitrust chief, is expected to focus on Google\u2019s deals with cellphone manufacturers that include bundles of Google services included in Android.Speaking in Amsterdam on Monday, Ms. Vestager said that these deals may have hindered competition by forcing cellphone manufacturers to rely on Google\u2019s mobile services that come preinstalled on certain versions of the Android software.\u201cOur concern is that, by requiring phone makers and operators to preload a set of Google apps, rather than letting them decide for themselves which apps to load, Google might have cut off one of the main ways that new apps can reach customers,\u201d Ms. Vestager said ahead of the charges being announced.The case related to Google\u2019s Android operating system has been long expected.These companies say that they have been financially hurt by Google practices that they call unfair, an accusation the company rejects.\u201cConsumers deserve more choice and innovation in mobile devices and applications,\u201d said Thomas Vinje, a lawyer for FairSearch. \u201cA statement of objections in the Android case would be an important step forward for competition and consumers.\u201dGoogle says that its partnerships with cellphone makers that rely on its operating system are voluntary, and that these relationships offer benefits to consumers as well as manufacturers.In February, Mr. Pichai traveled to Brussels to meet with Ms. Vestager and other European politicians, including G\u00fcnther Oettinger, a German politician in charge of the digital economy in the bloc. Eric E. Schmidt, Alphabet\u2019s executive chairman, has also been a regular visitor to Europe, meeting often with regional officials, in part to discuss the company\u2019s continuing antitrust problems.Now, Google faces mounting pressure over accusations it abused its position in everything from online search to its Android operating system. And it is the turn of Mr. Pichai, along with other Google executives, to respond.An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of Europe\u2019s antitrust chief.

{"Headline": "Farhad and Mike\u2019s Week in Tech: To Be or Not To Be an Uber Employee", "Date": "2016-04-23", "News": "Supported byHas anyone spent so much for so little before? I mean, other than what our bosses pay you?Oh also, I started watching back episodes of \u201cHalt and Catch Fire\u201d on Netflix and man, that show rules. It deals with the rise of the PC and the era when IBM, or Big Blue, reigned supreme. A different era entirely.Here\u2019s what matters: Aside from the $100 million Uber said it would pay drivers involved in the suit, the company conceded to a bunch of new rules and policies that make things at least slightly better for drivers.For one, drivers can ask for tips now, something they weren\u2019t able to do before (unlike Lyft, where they can get tips inside the app). Uber will also create a union-style \u201cdrivers association\u201d in California and Massachusetts \u2014 just don\u2019t call them unions! \u2014 so that drivers can air their grievances. And drivers won\u2019t automatically be deactivated for canceling too many trips over time.That seems like a list of ways Uber can defend itself in other states in which it faces lawsuits. Essentially, the further away Uber gets from acting like actual employers with drivers \u2014 that is, the less control it exerts over the work force \u2014 the more room it has to call its drivers \u201cpartners\u201d and not employees.This settlement sounds a bit like that situation: Uber drivers get some perks of employment, including people to complain to, and some measure of job security (even if it\u2019s probably pretty weak). But they don\u2019t get to be full employees \u2014 meaning the company does not have to pay them benefits, and the drivers are free to work as much or as little as they\u2019d like.Am I wrong to see this as a pretty good middle-of-the-road fix to a thorny problem that had been vexing lots of on-demand companies?The counterargument for some of this is that Uber can still shut drivers out of the app for short periods of time if they make too many trip cancellations. That\u2019s a level of control that one could argue should be reserved for an employer-employee relationship.Anyway, the moral of the story is this seems to have been largely defused, though not entirely over and done with. Watch other states and the subsequent litigation closely.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Shuts Out Competitors on Android? Hardly", "Date": "2016-04-27", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtOne of the persistent tragedies of Android, Google\u2019s globe-conquering mobile operating system, is that it continues to be better in theory than in reality.The charges make sense in the abstract. Google makes the world\u2019s most popular mobile operating system, and some of its licenses do compel phone makers to include several Google apps, even if they just want to include the Google Play app store. On paper, that may constitute unfair \u201cbundling,\u201d one of the sins that did in Microsoft at its apex in the late 1990s.Yet the European charges miss the messy reality of life on Android, which is clear to anyone who studies the mobile software business: Android phones come teeming with non-Google apps, often to the point of frustration for users. The search company appears powerless to keep many of them off people\u2019s devices, even when doing so might help its business.Harry First, a law professor at New York University who studies antitrust issues, says the key difficulty for regulators in this case is that the tech world has changed radically since the Microsoft antitrust case. Back then, Microsoft managed to outflank rivals like Netscape by bundling its Internet Explorer browser with its Windows operating system, and by using licenses and payments to prevent computer makers from installing competing browsers.\u201cIn the Microsoft era people were unfamiliar with downloading, and nothing was as effective as getting the browser installed by the O.E.M.s,\u201d he said, using the abbreviation for original equipment makers, or computer manufacturers.\u201cBut now, I\u2019d be surprised if people aren\u2019t fully at ease with downloading things from app stores, and people are familiar with having more than one app on their phone that does the same thing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe E.U. has to tell an exclusion story, but it\u2019s hard for me to see the exclusion story here.\u201dBut Hangouts is clearly no messaging juggernaut. In much of the world, that title belongs to two apps owned by Facebook \u2014 Messenger, which has 800 million active users a month, and WhatsApp, which has more than a billion. (Google has never disclosed the Hangouts user base; analysts I spoke to estimated that its share of the messaging market was in the single digits.)Then there\u2019s the popularity of the main Facebook app. As its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has acknowledged, the company was late to realize the importance of mobile phones; for years, its smartphone app was a slow, kludgy mess, and until just a few years ago it had no mobile revenue to speak of. Google, meanwhile, bundled its own social network, Google Plus, with Android phones.So if you were looking at the market a few years ago through the eyes of an E.U. antitrust regulator, you might have anticipated some trouble for Facebook on Android phones, and you might even have ventured that Google Plus would become a hit. After all, here was a small, late-moving upstart pitted against a bundle-friendly giant that owned the operating system.Of course, that\u2019s not how things turned out. Google Plus is now all but dead. And Facebook did not just survive the shift to mobile phones, it became the unstoppable force in the industry.How did Facebook get so popular on phones? On the whole, it happened the old-fashioned way: People loved Facebook, they had no trouble finding it in mobile app stores, and they began to download and use it. In other words, unlike in the desktop era ruled by Microsoft, Google\u2019s platform dominance on mobile phones does not appear to have posed any hindrance to a competitor\u2019s rise.The E.U.\u2019s objections go beyond the supposed restrictions that Google places on Android\u2019s app ecosystem. Another key charge involves Google\u2019s dominance in web search. Regulators say Google ensures that it remains Android\u2019s dominant search engine both by requiring phone makers to install the Chrome browser on their phones and, in some instances, by paying manufacturers to position the Google Search app on the phone\u2019s home screen.Mr. First, the law professor, said the search issue isn\u2019t as clear-cut as the question of whether Google has restricted rival apps. But he noted that the general flexibility of Android \u2014 the fact that, in general, Google makes it pretty easy for device makers and users to tinker with the software \u2014 cuts in Google\u2019s favor.Mr. First said the interaction was noteworthy: Android easily let him download a rival to Google\u2019s offering, and it even asked him if he wanted to set the rival as a default.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see how the commission could do better than that,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Case Against Google Might Help Rivals More Than Consumers", "Date": "2016-04-28", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseIn a persistent (and thus far fruitless) effort to hobble giant American technology companies, the European Union has again taken aim at Alphabet\u2019s Google search engine.At first blush, it might seem the Europeans are onto something. If device manufacturers want to preinstall the Google Play app, they must agree to install Google search and its Chrome browser as well \u2014 and make Google the default search engine.With some manufacturers, Google pays to have its search function preinstalled as the default option \u2014 an estimated $1 billion a year to Apple, according to a court filing last year.If these claims seem a little like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, that\u2019s because anyone over the age of 20 has seen this before: Microsoft embedded its Internet Explorer browser in its Windows desktop operating system, a so-called tying arrangement. In the late 1990s, the Justice Department and European Union regulators accused Microsoft of illegally trying to extend its dominant position in operating systems to Internet browsers and search. (Microsoft ultimately settled the cases.)But the rapid rise of mobile and tablet devices has pretty much rendered all that irrelevant. The latest version of Internet Explorer still has the largest market share for desktop Internet browsers, but it has only a negligible share for fast-growing mobile and tablet devices, where Google Chrome is far ahead.Technological change has also undermined the superficial similarities between the old Microsoft case and the new Android one. Back then, consumers who wanted a rival browser like Netscape to run on their Windows operating system rather than the (free) Explorer had to go to a store, pay for a disk with a rival program and then install it.Today, a free rival browser is a tap away. When I checked into Google Play this week, there were more browser choices than I knew what to do with, including some I\u2019d never heard of (Maxthon?). But I\u2019m satisfied with Google\u2019s offering and have no interest in further cluttering my phone\u2019s display screen.It\u2019s so easy to substitute or add apps that it\u2019s not even clear Google\u2019s agreements with manufacturers would be deemed tying arrangements. \u201cI don\u2019t think they meet the requirement,\u201d said Herbert Hovenkamp, an antitrust expert at the University of Iowa College of Law. \u201cThere\u2019s almost no limit to your ability to add additional apps or to delete the Google app and substitute a different one.\u201dOf course, there\u2019s obviously an advantage to being the default app, or else Google wouldn\u2019t be paying Apple such a large sum. \u201cOn the other hand, anyone can change if they\u2019re unhappy,\u201d Professor Hovenkamp said.Nor do manufacturers have to preinstall any Google apps on devices using Android, which is an open source system, available free. Amazon\u2019s Fire was an Android mobile device with a built-in Amazon shopping app, but it didn\u2019t come with Google Play or Search preinstalled. Fire was deemed a flop, in part because it lacked popular Google apps like Gmail and Maps.Even if Google is found to be using a tying arrangement, that\u2019s not necessarily illegal or bad for consumers. Scott Hemphill, an antitrust professor at New York University School of Law, said tying arrangements are common across a wide array of products and industries. \u201cNo one complains because they don\u2019t have a choice of transmission manufacturers in their cars,\u201d Professor Hemphill said.These same issues were raised last year in a class-action suit in a Federal District Court in California.The two named plaintiffs both bought Android phones, one in Louisville, Ky., the other in Des Moines, Iowa, and complained that they hadn\u2019t realized they came with Google search already installed. Judge Beth Labson Freeman of Federal District Court struggled to find any evidence that either had suffered any harm.So who exactly is being hurt by Google\u2019s behavior? It\u2019s not, apparently, consumers, in whose name this battle is being fought. Google\u2019s search engine is even more popular in Europe, where it has a more than 90 percent market share, according to the European Union, than it is in the United States.The driving force pushing the European action was a consortium of Google\u2019s corporate rivals \u2014 foremost among them, ironically, Microsoft, which once complained loudly about European overreaching. It has backed a lobbying group called FairSearch, which hailed the European action against Google as \u201ca crucial step to end abusive business practices.\u201d(Microsoft and Google said this week that they were burying the hatchet and would withdraw regulatory complaints about each other around the globe. Microsoft has said it will no longer back FairSearch.)If Microsoft really wants to compete with Google\u2019s search engine in Europe, it has the wherewithal to outbid Google and pay manufacturers to make Bing their default search engine.The Russian Internet company Yandex has been the most vocal in urging European action against Apple, which is even more ironic considering that Russia is not a member of the European Union and has been sanctioned over its annexation of Crimea. Yandex has dominated Internet search in Russia but has recently been losing ground there to Google. It filed \u2014 and, no surprise, won \u2014 similar claims in Russia. (Google is appealing that outcome.)Even if competitors like Yandex would stand to benefit, \u201cthe purpose of antitrust law, at least in the U.S., is to protect consumers, not competitors,\u201d Professor Hemphill said.Professor Hovenkamp echoed that thought. \u201cEurope is moving pretty far into left field with this case,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems like over-regulation for the benefit of competitors that won\u2019t end up doing consumers any good.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Minecraft Generation", "Date": "2016-04-14", "News": "FeatureHow a clunky Swedish computer game is teaching millions of children to master the digital world.Supported byAn 11-year-old in dark horn-\u00adrimmed glasses, Jordan is a devotee of Minecraft, the computer game in which you make things out of virtual blocks, from dizzying towers to entire cities. He recently read \u201cThe Maze Runner,\u201d a sci-fi thriller in which teenagers live inside a booby-\u00adtrapped labyrinth, and was inspired to concoct his own version \u2014 something he then would challenge his friends to navigate.Jordan built a variety of obstacles, including a deluge of water and walls that collapsed inward, Indiana Jones-style. But what he really wanted was a trap that behaved unpredictably. That would really throw his friends off guard. How to do it, though? He obsessed over the problem.Then it hit him: the animals! Minecraft contains a menagerie of virtual creatures, some of which players can kill and eat (or tame, if they want pets). One, a red-and-white cowlike critter called a mooshroom, is known for moseying about aimlessly. Jordan realized he could harness the animal\u2019s movement to produce randomness. He built a pen out of gray stones and installed \u201cpressure plates\u201d on the floor that triggered a trap inside the maze. He stuck the mooshroom inside, where it would totter on and off the plates in an irregular pattern.Presto: Jordan had used the cow\u2019s weird behavior to create, in effect, a random-\u00adnumber generator inside Minecraft. It was an ingenious bit of problem-\u00adsolving, something most computer engineers I know would regard as a great hack \u2014 a way of coaxing a computer system to do something new and clever.Since its release seven years ago, Minecraft has become a global sensation, captivating a generation of children. There are over 100 million registered players, and it\u2019s now the third-best-\u00adselling video game in history, after Tetris and Wii Sports. In 2014, Microsoft bought Minecraft \u2014 and Mojang, the Swedish game studio behind it \u2014 for $2.5 billion.There have been blockbuster games before, of course. But as Jordan\u2019s experience suggests \u2014 and as parents peering over their children\u2019s shoulders sense \u2014 Minecraft is a different sort of phenomenon.In this way, Minecraft culture is a throwback to the heady early days of the digital age. In the late \u201970s and \u201980s, the arrival of personal computers like the Commodore 64 gave rise to the first generation of kids fluent in computation. They learned to program in Basic, to write software that they swapped excitedly with their peers. It was a playful renaissance that eerily parallels the embrace of Minecraft by today\u2019s youth. As Ian Bogost, a game designer and professor of media studies at Georgia Tech, puts it, Minecraft may well be this generation\u2019s personal computer.At a time when even the president is urging kids to learn to code, Minecraft has become a stealth gateway to the fundamentals, and the pleasures, of computer science. Those kids of the \u201970s and \u201980s grew up to become the architects of our modern digital world, with all its allures and perils. What will the Minecraft generation become?Playing with blocks, it turns out, has deep cultural roots in Europe. Colin Fanning, a curatorial fellow at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, points out that European philosophers have long promoted block-\u00adbased games as a form of \u201cgood\u201d play that cultivates abstract thought. A recent paper Fanning wrote with Rebecca Mir traces the tradition to the English political philosopher John Locke, who was an early advocate of alphabet blocks. A century later, Friedrich Froebel \u2014 often called the inventor of kindergarten \u2014 developed block-\u00adbased toys that he claimed would illustrate the spiritual connectedness of all things. Children would start with simple blocks, build up to more complex patterns, then begin to see these patterns in the world around them. Educators like Maria Montessori picked up on this concept and pioneered the teaching of math through wooden devices.When Fanning first saw Minecraft, he felt a jolt of recognition. Nearly all these historical \u00adimpulses were evident in the game. \u201cIt\u2019s striking to me how much this mirrors the appeal and the critical reception of Minecraft,\u201d he says. \u201cIn Scandinavian toys, the material of wood has had a really long association with notions of timelessness and quality and craftsmanship.\u201d In Minecraft, as he notes, wood is one of the first resources new players gather upon entering the game: chopping trees with their avatar\u2019s hand produces blocks of wood, and from those they begin to build a civilization. Children are turned loose with tools to transform a hostile environment into something they can live in.\u201cIt\u2019s \u2018Buy the box, open the box, turn to the instruction sheet, make the model, stick it on the shelf, buy the next box,\u2019\u2009\u201d the veteran \u00adgame designer Peter Molyneux says in a 2012 documentary about Minecraft. \u201cLego used to be just a big box of bricks, and you used to take the bricks, pour them on the carpet and then make stuff. And that\u2019s exactly what Minecraft is.\u201dPersson, now 36, was a child of the \u201980s computer scene who learned to program when he was 7 on his father\u2019s Commodore 128. By the time he was in his 20s, he was working for an online photo-\u00adalbum site and programming games in his spare time at home, an apartment littered with game CDs and soda bottles. He released the first version of Minecraft in 2009. The basic play is fairly simple: Each time you start a new game, Minecraft generates a unique world filled with hills, forests and lakes. Whatever the player chops at or digs into yields building blocks \u2014 trees provide wood, the earth dirt and stone. Blocks can be attached to one another to quickly produce structures. Players can also combine blocks to \u201ccraft\u201d new items. Take some stone blocks, add a few pieces of wood, and you make a pickax, which then helps you dig more quickly and deeper, till you reach precious materials like gold, silver and diamond. \u201cMobs,\u201d the game\u2019s creatures (\u201cmob\u201d is short for \u201cmobile\u201d), can be used for crafting, too. Kill a spider, and you get spider silk, handy for making bows and arrows.In its first year, Minecraft found popularity mostly among adult nerds. But sometime in late 2011, according to Alex Leavitt, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Southern California, children discovered it, and sales of the game exploded. Today it costs $27 and sells 10,000 copies a day. (It\u2019s still popular across all age groups; according to Microsoft, the average player is between 28 and 29, and women make up nearly 40 percent of all players.) Persson frequently added new features to the game, like a \u201csurvival mode,\u201d in which every 20 minutes evening falls and monsters attack \u2014 skeletons shooting arrows, \u201ccreepers\u201d blowing themselves up when they get close to you \u2014 forcing players to build protective shelters. (\u201cCreative mode\u201d is just about making things.)Persson also made it possible for players to share their works. You could package your world as a \u201cmap\u201d and post it online for others to download and move around in. Even more sophisticated players could modify Minecraft\u2019s code, creating new types of blocks and creatures, and then put these \u201cmods\u201d online for others to use. Further developments included a server version of Minecraft that lets people play together on the Internet inside the same world. These days, kids can pay as little as $5 a month to rent such a server. They can also visit much larger commercial servers capable of hosting hundreds or thousands of players simultaneously. There is no single, central server: Thousands exist worldwide.The game was a hit. But Persson became unsettled by his fame, as well as the incessant demands of his increasingly impassioned fans \u2014 who barraged him with emails, tweets and forum posts, imploring him to add new elements to Minecraft, or complaining when he updated the game and changed something. By 2014, he\u2019d had enough. After selling Minecraft to Microsoft, he hunkered down in a $70 million mansion in Beverly Hills and now refuses to talk about Minecraft any more.I wanted to know whether the European tradition of block-play had influenced him, but Persson politely declined to be interviewed. Via a public reply to me on Twitter, he explained that he \u201csold Minecraft to get away from it.\u201dThese AND and OR gates are, in virtual form, the same as the circuitry you\u2019d find inside a computer chip. They\u2019re also like the Boolean logic that programmers employ every day in their code. Together, these simple gates let Minecraft players construct machines of astonishing complexity.One day this winter, I met Sebastian, a 14-year-old, at his home in New Jersey, where he showed off his redstone devices. One was a huge \u201ctrading post,\u201d a contraption that allows players on either side of a large wall to trade items through an automated chute. It required a large cluster of AND gates, he said, and took him several days to figure out.\u201cHop down here,\u201d he said, moving down into a subterranean pit beneath the apparatus and looking around. (In Minecraft, you see the world from the viewpoint of your in-game avatar.) It was like being in the bowels of a factory: the redstone sprawled in all directions. He pointed out different parts of the wiring, rattling off components like an architect at a construction site. \u201cComing in from these two wires are the lever inputs from the side \u2014 and from over here, the other side. And what these do is, when they\u2019re both on, they power a piston, which pairs redstone to this block up into this tower dispenser.\u201dMastering redstone requires rigorously logical thinking, as well as a great deal of debugging: When your device isn\u2019t working, you have to carefully go over its circuitry to figure out what\u2019s wrong. One fifth \u00adgrader I visited, Natalie, was assembling a redstone door on her iPad while I watched. But nothing happened when she flicked the \u201con\u201d lever. \u201cI did that wrong,\u201d she said with a frown, and began tracing her way through the circuit. Eventually the problem emerged: A piece of redstone was angled incorrectly, sending the current in the wrong direction.This is what computer scientists call computational thinking, and it turns out to be one of Minecraft\u2019s powerful, if subtle, effects. The game encourages kids to regard logic and if-then statements as fun things to mess around with. It teaches them what computer coders know and wrestle with every day, which is that programs rarely function at first: The work isn\u2019t so much in writing a piece of software but in debugging it, figuring out what you did wrong and coming up with a fix.Minecraft is thus an almost perfect game for our current educational moment, in which policy makers are eager to increase kids\u2019 interest in the \u201cSTEM\u201d disciplines \u2014 science, technology, engineering and math. Schools and governments have spent millions on \u201clet\u2019s get kids coding\u201d initiatives, yet it may well be that Minecraft\u2019s impact will be greater. This is particularly striking given that the game was not designed with any educational purpose in mind. \u201cWe have never done things with that sort of intent,\u201d says Jens Bergensten, the lead Minecraft developer at Mojang and Persson\u2019s first hire. \u201cWe always made the game for ourselves.\u201dOther Minecraft features resemble the work of software engineers even more closely. For example, programmers frequently write code and control their computers through a bare-bones interface known as the \u201ccommand line,\u201d typing abstruse, text-\u00adbased commands rather than pointing and clicking. Many programmers I know complain that while the point-and-click world has made computers easier to use for everyday people, it has also dumbed us down; kids don\u2019t learn the command line the way they would have back when personal-\u00adcomputer use emerged in the \u201970s and \u201980s. This is partly why newcomers can find programming alienating: They\u2019re not accustomed to controlling a computer using only text.But Minecraft, rather audaciously, includes a command line and requires players to figure it out. Type \u201ct\u201d or \u201c/\u201d while playing the game, and a space appears where you can chat with other players or issue commands that alter the environment. For example, typing \u201c/time set 0\u201d instantly changes the time of day inside the game to daybreak; the sun suddenly appears on the horizon. Complex commands require a player to master chains of sophisticated command-\u00adline syntax.One day last fall, I visited Gus, a seventh \u00adgrader in Brooklyn. He was online with friends on a server they share together, engaging in boisterous gladiatorial combat. I watched as he typed a command to endow himself with a better weapon: \u201c/give AdventureNerd bow 1 0 {Unbreakable:1,ench:[{id:51,lvl:1}],display:{Name:\u201cDestiny\u201d}}.\u201d What the command did was give a bow-\u00adand-\u00adarrow weapon to AdventureNerd, Gus\u2019s avatar; make the bow unbreakable; endow it with magic; and name the weapon Destiny, displayed in a tag floating over the weapon. Gus had plastered virtual sticky-\u00adnotes all over his Mac\u2019s desktop listing the text commands he uses most often. Several commands can be packed into a \u201ccommand block,\u201d so that clicking on the block activates them, much as clicking on a piece of software launches it.Mimi Ito, a cultural anthropologist at the University of California, Irvine, and a \u00adfounder of Connected Camps, an online program where kids play Minecraft together, has closely studied gamers and learning. Ito points out that when kids delve into this hackerlike side of the game \u2014 concocting redstone devices or creating command blocks \u2014 they often wind up consulting discussion forums online, where they get advice from adult Minecraft players. These folks are often full-time programmers who love the game, and so younger kids and teenagers wind up in conversation with professionals.\u201cIt\u2019s one of the places where young people are engaging with more expert people who are much older than them,\u201d Ito says. These connections are transformative: Kids get a glimpse of a professional path that their schoolwork never illuminates. \u201cAn adult mentor opens up these new worlds that wouldn\u2019t be open to them,\u201d she adds. Of course, critics might worry about kids interacting with adults online in this way, but as Ito notes, when there\u2019s a productive task at hand, it\u2019s similar to how guilds have passed on knowledge for ages: knowledgeable adults mentoring young people.Ito has also found that kids\u2019 impulse to tinker with Minecraft pushes them to master real-world technical skills. One 15-year-old boy I interviewed, Eli, became interested in making \u201ctexture packs.\u201d These are the external shells that wrap around 3-D objects in the game, like a drape thrown over a table: Change the pattern on the drape, and you can change what the object looks like. Designing texture packs prompted Eli to develop sophisticated Photoshop skills. He would talk to other texture-\u00adpack designers on Minecraft forums and get them to send him their Photoshop files so he could see how they did things. He also began teaching himself to draw. \u201cI\u2019d be downloading the mod,\u201d he says, \u201clooking at the original texture and saying, \u2018O.K., how can I make this a little more cartoony?\u2019\u2009\u201d Then he would put his own designs up on the forums to get feedback, which, he discovered, was usually very polite and constructive. \u201cThe community,\u201d he says, \u201cis very helpful.\u201dWhile Minecraft rewards this sort of involvement, it can also be frustrating: Mojang updates Minecraft weekly, and sometimes new updates aren\u2019t compatible with an older version. Players complained to me about waking up to discover that their complex contraptions no longer worked. One player spent weeks assembling a giant roller coaster whose carts were powered by redstone tracks only to have an update change the way rails functioned, and the entire roller-\u00adcoaster mechanism never worked again. Others ruefully described spending months crafting cities on their own multiplayer servers, only to have a server crash and destroy everything.For Ito, this is all a culturally useful part of the experience: Kids become more resilient, both practically and philosophically. \u201cMinecraft is busted, and you\u2019re constantly fixing it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s that home-brew aesthetic. It\u2019s kind of broken all the time. It\u2019s laggy. The kids get used to the idea that it\u2019s broken and you have to mess with it. You\u2019re not complaining to get the corporate overlord to fix it \u2014 you just have to fix it yourself.\u201d This is a useful corrective to other software. \u201cIPhone apps are kind of at the opposite end,\u201d Ito says. \u201cAnd the way that kids react when things are broken in the Apple ecosystem versus the Minecraft ecosystem is totally different. With [Apple] it\u2019s, \u2018Why are they broken?\u2019 Whereas with Minecraft it\u2019s like \u2014 \u2018Oh, they messed with something again, it\u2019s broken, we have to go figure out what they changed.\u2019 There\u2019s a sort of resignation to that the fact that you\u2019re tinkering all the time.\u201dBecause Minecraft is now seven years old, Ian Bogost will soon have students at Georgia Tech who grew up playing the game. The prospect intrigues him. \u201cI\u2019m very curious to see what their attitude to technology is,\u201d he says.Minecraft is an incredibly complex game, but it\u2019s also \u2014 at first \u2014 inscrutable. When you begin, no pop-ups explain what to do; there isn\u2019t even a \u201chelp\u201d section. You just have to figure things out yourself. (The exceptions are the Xbox and Play\u00adStation versions, which in December added tutorials.) This unwelcoming air contrasts with most large games these days, which tend to come with elaborate training sessions on how to move, how to aim, how to shoot. In Minecraft, nothing explains that skeletons will kill you, or that if you dig deep enough you might hit lava (which will also kill you), or even that you can craft a pickax.\u201cIn Minecraft, knowledge becomes social currency,\u201d says Michael Dezuanni, an associate professor of digital media at Queensland University of Technology in Australia. Dezuanni has studied how middle-\u00adschool girls play the game, watching as they engaged in nuanced, Talmudic breakdowns of a particular creation. This is, he realized, a significant part of the game\u2019s draw: It offers many opportunities to display expertise, when you uncover a new technique or strategy and share it with peers.The single biggest tool for learning Minecraft lore is YouTube. The site now has more than 70 million Minecraft videos, many of which are explicitly tutorial. To make a video, players use \u201cscreencasting\u201d software (some of which is free, some not) that records what\u2019s happening on-screen while they play; they usually narrate their activity in voice-\u00adover. The problems and challenges you face in Minecraft are, as they tend to be in construction or architecture, visual and three-\u00addimensional. This means, as many players told me, that video demonstrations have a particularly powerful explanatory force: It\u2019s easiest to learn something by seeing someone else do it. In this sense, the game points to the increasing role of video as a rhetorical tool. (\u201cMinecraft\u201d is the second-\u00admost-\u00adsearched-\u00adfor term on YouTube, after \u201cmusic.\u201d)That includes Ava on Long Island \u2014 who, after being killed by skeletons, began watching \u201csurvival mode\u201d videos to learn how to stay alive. Soon she had mastered that, and also discovered the huge number of YouTube videos in which players review \u201cminigames,\u201d little challenges that some Minecraft devotees design and load onto servers for others to play. (In one popular minigame, for example, players are shown a sculpture made of blocks and then try to copy it exactly in 30 seconds.) For young Minecraft fans, these videos are a staple of their media diet, crowding out TV. Ava\u2019s mother is genially baffled by this. \u201cI don\u2019t understand it,\u201d she told her daughter when I visited them last fall. \u201cWhy are you watching other people play the game? Why don\u2019t you just play?\u201dAva had recently started her own YouTube channel with her friends Aaron and Patrick, where they play and review minigames. Her father set up a high-\u00adquality microphone on a telescoping arm bolted to the computer desk; her sister drew Ava a white sign that says: \u201cRECORDING.\u201d (Its back says: \u201cNOT RECORDING JUST WANT YOU TO BE QUIET.\u201d) As the family\u2019s gray cat wandered around Ava\u2019s keyboard, she dialed up Patrick on a Skype video call.When they record a video, they improvise freestyle banter while playing, and simply start all over again if something goes awry. (Which, Patrick said dryly, \u201chappens often.\u201d) So far they have 19 subscribers and have posted 21 videos.She played a recent video for me, in which they tried to navigate a difficult map filled with lethal, flowing lava. Their conversation is loose and funny; it\u2019s like listening to two talk-\u00adradio hosts, or perhaps the commentary over a game of basketball \u2014 if the commentary were delivered by the athletes themselves, while they play.Considered as a genre, YouTube Minecraft videos are quite strange. They take elements of \u201chow to\u201d TV \u2014 a cooking show, a home-\u00adrenovation show \u2014 and blend them with the vocal style of podcasting, while mixing in a dash of TV shows like \u201cOrange County Choppers,\u201d where ingenious mechanics parade their creations.\u201cI don\u2019t even know that I know how to properly classify them,\u201d says Ryan Wyatt, the head of gaming content for YouTube. Minecraft videos offer a glimpse of the blurring of the line between consumers and creators. Probably two-thirds of the kids I interviewed had started their own Minecraft channels on YouTube. Most of them were happy when even a handful of friends and family watched their videos.\u201cI told my mom, \u2018I\u2019m quitting my paper round,\u2019 and she said, \u2018Why?\u2019 And I said, \u2018I do a YouTube channel, and it\u2019s earning me more.\u2019\u2009\u201d When his mother looked at his channel, she saw it had more than 40,000 subscribers and more monthly traffic than the corporate newspaper sites she consults for.Next year he plans to study computer science in college. \u201cIn the redstone community,\u201d he says, \u201ca lot of people around me are programmers.\u201d Teaching himself coding is much like learning Minecraft, he found; you experiment, ask questions on Internet forums. He described his YouTube channel on his college application, and that, too, \u201cseems to have helped,\u201d he says. The university accepted him without even seeing his final school grades.Most online games don\u2019t require kids to manage the technical aspects of how gamers interact. A hugely popular commercial game like World of Warcraft, for example, is played on a server run by its owner, Blizzard Entertainment. Game companies usually set the rules of what is and isn\u2019t allowed in their games; if you grief others, you might be banned by a corporate overlord. Or the opposite might happen: Abuse might be ignored or policed erratically.But Minecraft is unusual because Microsoft doesn\u2019t control all the servers where players gather online. There is no single Minecraft server that everyone around the world logs onto. Sometimes kids log onto a for-\u00adprofit server to play mini\u00adgames; sometimes they rent a server for themselves and their friends. (Microsoft and Mojang run one such rental service.) Or sometimes they do it free at home: If you and I are in the same room and we both have tablets running Minecraft, I can invite you into my Minecraft world through Wi-Fi.What this means is that kids are constantly negotiating what are, at heart, questions of governance. Will their world be a free-for-all, in which everyone can create and destroy everything? What happens if someone breaks the rules? Should they, like London, employ plug-ins to prevent damage, in effect using software to enforce property rights? There are now hundreds of such governance plug-ins.Seth Frey, a postdoctoral fellow in computational social science at Dartmouth College, has studied the behavior of thousands of youths on Minecraft servers, and he argues that their interactions are, essentially, teaching civic literacy. \u201cYou\u2019ve got these kids, and they\u2019re creating these worlds, and they think they\u2019re just playing a game, but they have to solve some of the hardest problems facing humanity,\u201d Frey says. \u201cThey have to solve the tragedy of the commons.\u201d What\u2019s more, they\u2019re often anonymous teenagers who, studies suggest, are almost 90 percent male (online play attracts far fewer girls and women than single-\u00adplayer mode). That makes them \u201cwhat I like to think of as possibly the worst human beings around,\u201d Frey adds, only half-\u00adjokingly. \u201cSo this shouldn\u2019t work. And the fact that this works is astonishing.\u201dFrey is an admirer of Elinor Ostrom, the Nobel Prize-\u00adwinning political economist who analyzed the often-\u00adunexpected ways that everyday people govern themselves and manage resources. He sees a reflection of her work in Minecraft: Running a server becomes a crash course in how to compromise, balance one another\u2019s demands and resolve conflict.Three years ago, the public library in Darien, Conn., decided to host its own Minecraft server. To play, kids must acquire a library card. More than 900 kids have signed up, according to John Blyberg, the library\u2019s assistant director for innovation and user experience. \u201cThe kids are really a community,\u201d he told me. To prevent conflict, the library installed plug-ins that give players a chunk of land in the game that only they can access, unless they explicitly allow someone else to do so. Even so, conflict arises. \u201cI\u2019ll get a call saying, \u2018This is Dasher80, and someone has come in and destroyed my house,\u2019\u2009\u201d Blyberg says. Sometimes library administrators will step in to adjudicate the dispute. But this is increasingly rare, Blyberg says. \u201cGenerally, the self-\u00adgoverning takes over. I\u2019ll log in, and there\u2019ll be 10 or 15 messages, and it\u2019ll start with, \u2018So-and-so stole this,\u2019 and each message is more of this,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd at the end, it\u2019ll be: \u2018It\u2019s O.K., we worked it out! Disregard this message!\u2019\u2009\u201dSeveral parents and academics I interviewed think Minecraft servers offer children a crucial \u201cthird place\u201d to mature, where they can gather together outside the scrutiny and authority at home and school. Kids have been using social networks like Instagram or Snapchat as a digital third place for some time, but Minecraft imposes different social demands, because kids have to figure out how to respect one another\u2019s virtual space and how to collaborate on real projects.\u201cWe\u2019re increasingly constraining youth\u2019s ability to move through the world around them,\u201d says Barry Joseph, the associate director for digital learning at the American Museum of Natural History. Joseph is in his 40s. When he was young, he and his friends roamed the neighborhood unattended, where they learned to manage themselves socially. Today\u2019s fearful parents often restrict their children\u2019s wanderings, Joseph notes (himself included, he adds). Minecraft serves as a new free-\u00adranging realm.Joseph\u2019s son, Akiva, is 9, and before and after school he and his school friend Eliana will meet on a Minecraft server to talk and play. His son, Joseph says, is \u201cat home but still getting to be with a friend using technology, going to a place where they get to use pickaxes and they get to use shovels and they get to do that kind of building. I wonder how much Minecraft is meeting that need \u2014 that need that all children have.\u201d In some respects, Minecraft can be as much social network as game.Just as Minecraft propels kids to master Photoshop or video-\u00adediting, server life often requires kids to acquire complex technical skills. One 13-year-old girl I interviewed, Lea, was a regular on a server called Total Freedom but became annoyed that its administrators weren\u2019t clamping down on griefing. So she asked if she could become an administrator, and the owners said yes.For a few months, Lea worked as a kind of cop on that beat. A software tool called \u201ccommand spy\u201d let her observe records of what players had done in the game; she teleported miscreants to a sort of virtual \u201ctime out\u201d zone. She was eventually promoted to the next rank \u2014 \u201ctelnet admin,\u201d which allowed her to log directly into the server via telnet, a command-\u00adline tool often used by professionals to manage servers. Being deeply involved in the social world of Minecraft turned Lea into something rather like a professional systems administrator. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to take charge of anybody who\u2019s breaking the rules,\u201d she told me at the time.Not everyone has found the online world of Minecraft so hospitable. One afternoon while visiting the offices of Mouse, a nonprofit organization in Manhattan that runs high-tech programs for kids, I spoke with Tori. She\u2019s a quiet, dry-\u00adwitted 17-year-old who has been playing Minecraft for two years, mostly in single-\u00adplayer mode; a recent castle-\u00adbuilding competition with her younger sister prompted some bickering after Tori won. But when she decided to try an online server one day, other players \u2014 after discovering she was a girl \u2014 spelled out \u201cBITCH\u201d in blocks.She hasn\u2019t gone back. A group of friends sitting with her in the Mouse offices, all boys, shook their heads in sympathy; they\u2019ve seen this behavior \u201ceverywhere,\u201d one said. I have been unable to find solid statistics on how frequently harassment happens in Minecraft. In the broader world of online games, though, there is more evidence: An academic study of online players of Halo, a shoot-\u2019em-up game, found that women were harassed twice as often as men, and in an unscientific poll of 874 self-\u00addescribed online gamers, 63 percent of women reported \u201csex-\u00adbased taunting, harassment or threats.\u201d Parents are sometimes more fretful than the players; a few told me they didn\u2019t let their daughters play online. Not all girls experience harassment in Minecraft, of course \u2014 Lea, for one, told me it has never happened to her \u2014 and it is easy to play online without disclosing your gender, age or name. In-game avatars can even be animals.But for now, its grip is strong. And some are trying to strengthen it further by making it more accessible to lower-\u00adincome children. Mimi Ito has found that the kids who acquire real-world skills from the game \u2014 learning logic, administering servers, making YouTube channels \u2014 tend to be upper middle class. Their parents and after-\u00adschool programs help them shift from playing with virtual blocks to, say, writing code. So educators have begun trying to do something similar, bringing Minecraft into the classroom to create lessons on everything from math to history. Many libraries are installing Minecraft on their computers.One recent afternoon, I visited the Bronx Library Center, a sleek, recently renovated building in a low-\u00adincome part of the borough. A librarian named Katie Fernandez had set up regular Minecraft days for youths, and I watched four boys play together on the library\u2019s server. Fernandez had given them a challenge: Erect a copy of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris in 45 minutes. Three of them began collaborating on one version; a younger boy worked on his own design. The three gently teased one another about their skills. \u201cNo, no, stop!\u201d shouted one, when he noticed another building a foot of the Arc too wide. \u201cRyan, this \u2014 like this!\u201d They debated whether command blocks would speed things up. As the 45th minute approached, they hadn\u2019t quite finished their Arc, so they gleefully stuffed the interior with TNT, detonated it and hopped onto different games.Over in the corner, the fourth boy continued to labor away at his Arc.

{"Headline": "Alphabet Earnings Disappoint as Google Ad Clicks Cost Less", "Date": "2016-04-21", "News": "Supported byBoth revenue and profit rose sharply from 2015 but missed analysts\u2019 forecasts. Revenue, at $20.26 billion, was about $120 million less than expected. Earnings per share, excluding certain items, were $7.50 when the consensus estimate was $7.96.The result: The stock fell about $46, or about 6 percent, in after-hours trading.Shares of Google were priced for perfection, and the first quarter was a little less than perfect. Whether that means anything substantive is more doubtful.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with this company,\u201d said Colin Gillis of BGC Partners. \u201cThey spent a bit more and took in a bit less than we thought, so Mr. Market is having a mood swing. But it was a fine quarter.\u201dThe Silicon Valley company, which reorganized itself into a holding company called Alphabet last year, gets nearly all of its revenue and all its profits from the core Google search and advertising business.Google is in the middle of a multiyear transition from desktop ads to the harder game of mobile ads. In the latest quarter, aggregate cost per click fell 9 percent from a year ago.Revenue from what the company calls \u201cOther Bets\u201d \u2014 including its fiber business and the Nest thermostat \u2014 was $166 million, more than double what it was in the first quarter of 2015. Losses for Other Bets rose to $802 million from $633 million.The number of employees jumped to 64,000 from 55,000 last year. \u201cThe vast majority\u201d of them, the company stressed, were engineers and product managers.In a conference call with analysts on Thursday, Ms. Porat seemed to indicate that, if there ever was an Anything Goes era at Google, it is now over.In some areas, she said, investments will be increasing only \u201cif teams meet milestones we set as part of our 2016 budgeting process.\u201d In other areas, where Google has had multiple teams developing different approaches to a similar technology, she said, \u201cwe have been evaluating how to rationalize these approaches.\u201dBut Google will still invest in unlikely things. For one thing, it can afford to. Its cash on hand is now $75 billion, up $10 billion in a year.\u201cWhat seemed like a moonshot a decade ago has grown into a booming community of engaged users, creators and brands, unlike any other video platform,\u201d said Sundar Pichai, the chief executive. He was referring to YouTube, of course. He noted that on mobile alone, YouTube now reaches more 18- to 34-year-olds in the United States than any broadcast or cable network.A question hanging over Google is its ventures in cloud computing. This is the growth market where Amazon is far ahead of everyone. Amazon Web Services is more exciting to investors than the retailer\u2019s core business. Microsoft, meanwhile, is mounting an aggressive challenge.\u201cThis is their third try to really become a cloud powerhouse,\u201d Mr. Rymer said. \u201cThey certainly seem more serious this time, but we\u2019ll have to see if they move beyond digital natives to airlines, utilities, trucking companies, governments \u2014 the enterprises where the real money is.\u201dAs for Europe, no mention was made of it by either Ms. Porat or Mr. Pichai, and not a single analyst asked about it.An earlier version of this article misstated the amount by which Alphabet missed analysts\u2019 forecasts for revenue. It was $120 million, not $150 million.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bill Campbell, Coach of Silicon Valley Stars, Dies at 75", "Date": "2016-04-18", "News": "Supported byBill Campbell, one of the most influential background players in Silicon Valley, who was known as \u201ccoach\u201d there for his work advising technology industry stars like Steve Jobs at Apple and Larry Page at Google, died on Monday at his home in Palo Alto, Calif. He was 75.His family said the cause was cancer.Mr. Campbell had exerted a strong influence on Apple and Google, two of the world\u2019s most valuable companies, since the 1980s. Operating in a network of billionaire technology innovators, he was known for making informal but lasting personal connections that helped shape the industry.The term \u201ccoach\u201d was a reference to his days coaching the Columbia University football team from 1974 to 1979 \u2014 he had also played for Columbia \u2014 but it applied as well to his business career.As recently as the end of March, John Doerr, one of the valley\u2019s leading venture capitalists, publicly cited \u201cCoach Bill Campbell\u2019s\u201d advice when Mr. Doerr announced that he would give up his executive role at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and become its first chairman.Mr. Campbell was an Eastman Kodak executive in Europe when he was recruited to Silicon Valley in 1983 by Apple\u2019s chief executive at the time, John Sculley. Mr. Sculley named him vice president of marketing. Mr. Campbell later played a significant role in Apple\u2019s spectacular turnaround when Steve Jobs, who had been fired by Mr. Sculley, returned to the company in 1997. Apple went on to revamp its Mac computer line and introduce the iPod, iPhone and iPad.Mr. Campbell was an Apple director from 1997 until 2014.It was Mr. Doerr who brought Mr. Campbell to Google to serve as an informal adviser to the two founders, Mr. Page and Sergey Brin. Mr. Campbell was instrumental in the hiring of Eric Schmidt to be Google\u2019s chief executive in August 2001.Strikingly, Mr. Campbell\u2019s advisory role was often unpaid, at his insistence; he said he wanted to pay back what he felt was a debt to the nation\u2019s technology region.At Google, for example, he helped shape its leadership for a generation or more but, except for a single stock grant, never had a formal financial relationship with the company, according to Mr. Schmidt, who is now Google\u2019s chairman.\u201cGoogle would not be the company it is today without the influence of Bill Campbell,\u201d Mr. Schmidt said, \u201cand my guess is Apple wouldn\u2019t be, either.\u201dMr. Campbell also worked early on with Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, as well as Ben Horowitz and Marc Andreessen before they founded one of the country\u2019s top venture capital firms, Andreessen Horowitz.Mr. Campbell was deeply involved in Silicon Valley\u2019s start-up culture as well. In 1987 he led a group of Apple executives in setting up a software subsidiary, Claris, with the ultimate goal of spinning the company off as a start-up. When Apple decided not to let Claris become a separate public company, many of the executives, including Mr. Campbell, left.He later became chief executive of Go Corporation, a pioneering tablet computer company that fought a long and ultimately unsuccessful battle with Microsoft. From 1994 until 1998 he was chief executive of Intuit, a personal finance software company.William Vincent Campbell Jr. was born on Aug. 31, 1940, and grew up in Homestead, Pa., near Pittsburgh. He excelled in football in high school.Mr. Campbell ended his coaching career in 1979 with an overall record of 12-41-1. He then went to work for J. Walter Thompson, the advertising agency, before joining Kodak.In 2009, the National Football Foundation and College Hall of Fame announced that its annual award given to the top scholar-athlete would be renamed for Mr. Campbell.He was chairman of Columbia University\u2019s board of trustees from 2005 to 2014 and donated $10 million to help fund the Campbell Sports Center on the university\u2019s campus. As a philanthropist he also donated millions in support of education in the Pennsylvania steel country where he grew up.His survivors include his wife, Eileen Bocci Campbell; a daughter, Margaret; a son, Jim; and his stepchildren, Kevin, Matthew and Kate Bocci.Mr. Campbell was known for his informality. Randy Komisar, a partner at Kleiner Perkins who had been a young lawyer at Apple, recalled Mr. Campbell running down a hall one day and dragging him into a dark conference room to tell him he was starting the software company that would become Claris. Without saying anything about title or compensation, Mr. Campbell looked at him across the table and simply asked, \u201cAre you in, or are you out?\u201dAn obituary last Tuesday about Bill Campbell, an adviser to executives in the technology industry, misstated his history with the tablet computer company Go Corporation. While he was a former chief executive of the company, he did not help found it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook Bets on Bots for Its Messenger App", "Date": "2016-04-12", "News": "Supported byThe experience is akin to chatting with a friend, \u201cthe one whose taste you always trust while you\u2019re shopping,\u201d said Alan Tisch, chief executive of Spring.There\u2019s just one thing: The entity on the other end talking to you and helping you choose the shoes is not human. It is a chatbot, a relatively simple piece of software that uses artificial intelligence to carry on a conversation.On Tuesday, Facebook underlined the rise of bots at its annual F8 developer conference in San Francisco. Facebook said it was opening up Messenger, its own messaging app, so that any outside company \u2014 from Applebee\u2019s to Zara \u2014 could create a bot capable of interacting with people through the chat program.With the move, Facebook is aiming to usher in a new era of customer service by bringing together the 900 million regular monthly users of Messenger with the more than 15 million businesses that have an official brand page on Facebook. Facebook is kicking off the project with partners like Spring, 1-800-Flowers, a weather and travel app called Poncho and news partners like CNN. Facebook is also testing advertising on chatbots as a potential source of revenue.\u201cWe\u2019re conversational creatures,\u201d David A. Marcus, vice president of messaging at Facebook, said of chat. \u201cThat\u2019s the way our brain functions. That\u2019s the way we\u2019re wired. As a result, it\u2019s probably the most natural interface there is.\u201dMark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, also sketched out his grand vision at the conference for the company\u2019s future over the next five, 10 and 15 years. Under his plan, people would accompany Facebook as it builds out a comprehensive global system of communications, virtual reality and shopping.\u201cWe all have a desire to be understood and relate to each other,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u201cWe\u2019re always trying to get closer to capturing the purest form.\u201dUnderlying many of these bot efforts is their presence primarily on messaging services, which are increasingly becoming a primary form of communication and computing. More than 1.6 billion people are projected to become regular users of mobile messaging apps by the end of this year, equivalent to 22 percent of the global population, according to eMarketer, an industry research firm. That figure is expected to reach two billion people by 2018.The bot revival is also taking place at a time when people are growing tired of individual apps. While big brands have long promoted easier access to shopping and customer service through their own proprietary smartphone apps, some consumers are fatigued by having to download a different app for each company. More than a quarter of the time spent on mobile apps by Americans is now focused on just a handful of social networking and communication apps, according to Forrester, an industry research firm.As a result, brands in search of the best way to talk to consumers are now pairing off with some the world\u2019s dominant messaging platforms \u2014 and their chatbots.\u201cImagine if you had, say, 10 bot interactions a day, and if your entire daily commercial life was powered by a chat platform,\u201d said Ted Livingston, chief executive of Kik. \u201cHow that platform works \u2014 and who controls it \u2014 is going to be very important.\u201d Kik is heavily promoting its \u201cbot store\u201d to lure businesses to its platform.There are no guarantees the bot medium will take off. Facebook, Kik and Microsoft are up against other artificially intelligent assistants like Apple\u2019s Siri and Amazon\u2019s Echo, the hardware devices that are voice-controlled \u2014 no typing required. And making each transaction into a personal conversation may not be what people need when they just want to book a flight or order food.\u201cA lot of apps are already incredibly functional,\u201d said Robin Chan, chief executive of Operator. \u201cTake Uber, for example: You just push a button and it works. You don\u2019t need a drawn-out conversation for every single app.\u201dRegardless, the bot wave is coming, said John Lilly, a venture capitalist at Greylock Partners who has long been interested in bots and artificial intelligence. It may not come right now, with consumers needing to type in \u201ccommand line\u201d-style text to the chatbots, but he said the trend may gather momentum as bots increasingly blend technology and \u201chuman product design,\u201d whatever form that may take.Mr. Tisch of Spring, the mobile shopping start-up that just started offering a bot on Facebook Messenger, said working with the social media company to unveil the chatbot was a no-brainer. Facebook\u2019s huge scale, at more than 1.6 billion global users, makes it a good candidate for kickstarting a new form of commerce online, he said.And chatbots themselves are simply an extension of the kind of personal conversations that are already happening in retail, he said. Many high-end retailers offer personal shopping services, often through text messaging.Conversing with a chatbot to shop feels \u201cmagical,\u201d Mr. Tisch said, though \u201cin reality, much of commerce is happening through the conversations we\u2019re already having all the time.\u201dQuentin Hardy contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Want to Be Forgotten Online Without Google? Forget It.", "Date": "2016-04-19", "News": "Supported byBitsWhile we were worrying about banks that are \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d lest they endanger the rest of the financial system, something similar may have happened with Google.Mark\u2019s story is about how the European Union\u2019s so-called right to be forgotten law has worked out in practice. For almost two years, European Union citizens have been able to apply to have links to certain web search results taken down. As over 90 percent of Europe\u2019s search market belongs to Google, this is primarily a law about what Google can track and link the public to.So who is deciding the merits of applications to be \u201cforgotten\u201d? More than anyone else, Google. How do they decide whether the application is warranted? Google won\u2019t say.European Union officials appear to think Google is acting fairly, but that doesn\u2019t answer the question of why Google should be policing itself. The answer to that appears to be that no one else has the money and know-how to effectively do the job.As the Internet gets to be a bigger part of everyone\u2019s lives, it may increasingly be that only the biggest Internet companies can do Internet-scale tasks. Google already appears to have the world\u2019s largest commercial network of computers.To some extent, it\u2019s the same for Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook. It would be interesting to see whether Alibaba and Baidu have more computational and data power than the Chinese government.Much the way it curates much of what happens on the Internet, Google has spent years scanning books to create its searchable corpus. For better or worse, few people would want those things destroyed, or made inaccessible. The price we are paying, however, is a near-essential private entity that has done things no government seems able to do.Advertisement"}
